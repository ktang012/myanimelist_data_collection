            "content": "Inspired by old familiar mecha, Darling in the FranXX tries to incorporate over-the-top elements of Gurren Laggan and symbolic yet dramatic elements of Evangelion. \r\nWhere it doesn't fail to deliver in generic combat, it not only fails to deliver in consistent plot, which it tries to build upon, but adds unnecessary elements of melodrama from characters, which just makes them look unrealistic and unlikable, it adds on extra awkward elements that makes sympathizing with the cast a pain and following the plot a chore.\r\nPerhaps the cartoony mecha style emphasizes on that, but in the end it's a shallow show that foreshadows heavily on plot twists,but doesn't follow through to them in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy \"nu\"-mecha anime with unnecessary fanservice, no respect to its own world building and plot, and no respect to the viewer - go ahead and give this a go. What might seem to be a popcorn flick at first, simply something fun to watch, ends up being something that simply spits on the viewer in multiple ways and calls it a day.",

            "content": "***Caution:*** This review contains spoilers for this predictable show. I have specifically and very clearly marked the spoiler sections (there aren't as many as you think, only 3 paragraphs\u2019 worth) so you can still easily read my review and do not need to worry. As for the fans of the show, enter at your own volition since you will not find this review to exalt it in any manner, so to those who consider FranXX a 10/10, keep your temper in and let's begin. If you're a regular reader, please carry on :)\r\nFranXX was hyped a lot. And that's just the short of it, ithad a huge marketing campaign and had a huge amount of anticipation with people calling it the \u201cNext Evangelion\u201d or a \u201cSpiritual successor to Eva\u201d and so on and so forth. The legendary Yabuki Kentarou was signed on doing the art for the manga adaptation for this unoriginal original and as a matter of fact, that's how I found out about the show in the first place and went in expecting the amazing show the marketing had me believe. Result? Well I can't surprise you since you might have seen the score I gave it. Yes. A mess. A terrible mess.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the main part that is the reason fans gloss over this show, the characters. They are given little to no backstories and their roles to play are very less. Squad 13 mainly served as a bumbling group of teenagers (hmm\u2026 why teenagers in particular?) who don't know jackshit except for the so called \u201cfact\u201d that they must pilot the mechs known as FranXX and defeat these blue magma lover monsters called Klaxosaurs. Let that seep in. Why children? Most likely because they wanna appeal to the target audience of the show, teenagers. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be as fruitful as A-1 and Trigger thought it would because when you've got an idiotic group of teenagers who contribute nothing to character development, I don't think you end up with teenage viewers going crazy over a show. I mean, yes, teens in real life aren't always smart, but if given the chance, I'm sure they'd do something sensible when they need to, but we don't see such a thing at all. Why? All we see is random blushes and such stuff. I mean, these teens are acting like everyday teens, yes, that's fine but is this the premise to do so? A place where people are bombarded by the constant threat of Klaxosaurs? Kids are supposed to have fun yes, but not when you're literally guarding human lives from danger. \\n\\n\r\nTo move away from the characters for a moment, we move to another problem with the show, its connection. And don't you dare justify it by telling me it's an episodic anime, because it sure as hell is not. In reality, it's just mixed up completely and had too many ideas to implement together and instead of choosing one idea to go with, they probably chose all and excellently failed at all of them. Why? Poor connection. To hold up a plot you need connection, FranXX didn't offer any of that at all. It just dragged on and didn't leave any mention of what happened before and most importantly WHY the situation happened before. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Simple. Bad direction. All it takes to destroy the whole hard work of a show is bad direction. In fact, about 90% of the issues with the anime can be traced back to bad direction. If the show had a good director I suppose the show would have a direction to follow, but this being FranXX, it had to follow all the directions it could and then ended up nowhere. In the first episode I had the show at a shocking 9 and if you look at it now it's fallen pretty spectacularly. This is because of the show's bad direction; events were unconnected and an irritated yours truly almost smashed his screen onto the floor . Random stuff happening here with no explanation, and then random stuff happening there without explanation, was this anime devoid of sense or something? Because I did not find any of it anywhere. And then we've got the problem that follows that the story was unexplained. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? How did this occur? Where did this issue first occur? There were many questions asked by fans, and the answer is that it was clear both studios didn't want quality, they wanted the $$$ And that's me trying to be positive, we got zilch as in reality but eh, gotta act positive. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, apart from a cliched mess of a story, it's disappointing in almost every other regard (read on for further explanation), serving as a reminder that it only takes one big mistake to spoil the whole effort put into an anime, or anything for that matter. Speaking of mistakes, we come to another part that had the cosplayers, fan artists and others crazy, the romance\u2014 particularly the romance between Zero Two and Hiro. First off, our two MCs. Zero Two was introduced as a waifu like character which immediately took the undeserving \u201cdeconstruction\u201d tag which was ripped off from Eva (surprise surprise, FranXX ripped off a show) while giving us another useless MC who went by the self appointed name Hiro. Their romance was unexplained until way later into the series, an episode which even I liked, episode 13. They were largely unexplained for most of the anime\u2019s run and it was only in the first episode of the second cour (episode 13) that tried to remedy this. Result? Thankfully good. Episode 13 was regarded as an excellent episode by even the harshest of critics since it explained a lot of the stuff between Hiro and Zero Two and obviously it was a flashback episode, yet despite being a flashback episode it was done well\u2014 surprising since this is FranXX. But the problem came afterwards; after that episode was done, we saw a lot of crap follow it in the form of the team getting \u201cmad\u201d at Zero Two for \u201churting\u201d Hiro for over dramatic effect and to make me sympathise with the characters. Why would you drag through 12 episodes just to see the one episode that seemed half decent and it goes back to its shitty formula? I loathed it even more.The episodes were cliched, unconnected messes with absolutely no relevance to the plot, just serving to pass time either to focus on Hiro or to make the fanboys go crazy over the fight scenes, which were nothing more than one hit kills and random dashes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from there all we got were cheesy half hearted lines like \u201cI wanna be with you forever\u201d and all that teenage fantasy (severely paraphrased for ease of comprehensive analysis) and pointless romantic moments that don't have much to do with the plot. Why am I crushing the romance here even though I'm a romance fan? It's because FranXX deployed this romance at the wrong times, I can't even say I'm surprised anymore at this kind of problem. Then we go to the other cast, Ichigo is a character that served as a reminder about the stupidity of fanboys since her voice actor Kana Ichinose received death threats just because of her work as Ichigo. Anno would be proud. Ichigo\u2019s character though wasn't fleshed out (to say nothing of the rest of the cast, especially Ikuno, Zorome and Miku) and her actions were basically \u201cI'm jealous because I love him but can't reveal it to him because I'm shy\u201d and that time when she DID do it, it was enough to even send non romance fans into a fit because it was done in a (dare I say it?) slutty way cause teenagers? I do not know. Then we come to the signature part which had many people divided as well, Kokoro. To delve into this horrible character we must enter minor spoiler territory so if you can't handle looking at a good character being turned into a whore please skip the marked spoiler section. \\n\\n\r\n***Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers about this side character and want the relationship as a surprise. Spoilers begin: Kokoro was paired up with Futoshi who liked Kokoro a lot but suffered from the same problem as Ichigo. However, since he's male the fanboys didn't take or notice much issue, perhaps also because Futoshi wasn't made as a cockblocker character and instead was of the \u201cI'll protect her\u201d than a \u201cI want him to love me instead\u201d, only thing is that Kokoro turned out to \u201cbetray\u201d Futoshi and instead go for an unlikely character who was largely ignored throughout the show, Mitsuru. She suddenly developed feelings for him and even kissed him for no concrete reason apart from taking the show into an extremely shitty direction because guess what? She wanted a baby. Why? Freakin\u2019 teenagers\u2026 this is the worst way to relate to them. Then Kokoro went from a \u201cI am not in love with Futoshi but he's a kind person\u201d to an \u201cI want Mitsuru\u2019s @#$_ inside me\". I'm not even joking. This LITERALLY happened. Why am I rambling on about this? Because that's definitely not how you make a show about teenagers because that's not at all representative of the majority. Anyway, then they suddenly want to get married (!?) and we see other crap follow as well without explanation or reason, they just wanna fill time at this rate. With what? Throwing in the notion that Kokoro is pregnant later on. Teenage pregnancy, a very common thing in teens nowadays amiright? Wrong. And you know what worse? The fact that the folks at FranXX.inc pulled the WORST cliche to go with this. Both of them are caught and are \u201cbrainwashed\u201d and their memories are \u201cstored\u201d somewhere. If VIRM didn't want to let them regain their memories then why store them in the first place? Why not \u201cdelete\u201d them into oblivion? Plot armour I say. Convenience too\u2026 this makes many viewers realise that the episode was just existing to pass time and fool the viewers into thinking their time into the episode was worth it?  Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us on to the next point, underused characters. Namely Miku, Zorome and Ikuno. Not to mention Goro but he got a little bit of a focus so I'll give him a brief look later. Miku and Zorome were shown as characters who had a rivalry-love which seemed fresh and interesting but that was pulled down along with the anime because they didn't focus on these two at all. What made them attracted to each other? Why are they paired up together? These questions were never answered and I was left hanging, which was disappointing since Miku apart from sharing the same hairstyle as the superstar with the same name (my profile picture character to those of you non-Vocaloid fans) she was one of the few characters who was believable as a teenager. Many people wouldn't notice that these two weren't given enough focus and that was sad because this fresh idea could be explored a lot more and I wouldn't be surprised if I found their rivalry-love better than the two main characters, and don't forget, I liked Miku as a character as well. \\n\\n\r\nLeaving us with the last two, Ikuno and Goro. Ikuno was mainly used as fodder for Mitsuru to frown upon so that he could get hooked to the resident slut Kokoro (I don't think I should call her that because she didn't like Futoshi but considered him kind but then I'm disappointed because like Miku, I liked Kokoro, only that love turned to hate since FranXX ruined her) and Ikuno was ignored for the rest of the anime, she wasn't given lines and that one \u201cI want a baby\u201d episode scene where she DID say something, it wasn't explained WHY she stepped forward and did her act. My guess is because since she didn't have any lines, the show didn't want to make her look like a dumbass so they forcefully gave her lines and that was all. Then we enter spoiler territory yet again because Ikuno was given that small 5 minute focus in a later episode. \\n\\n\r\n***Minor Spoiler Begin: Since Ikuno wasn't given a love interest the folks at FranXX.inc thought it's a good idea to introduce some Yuri at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way, as such, the result was never spoken of again, which pretty much explains how the \u201caffair\u201d went. Needless to say, this was a last ditch effort to save her character and it served as the final nail in the coffin for Ikuno. Minor Spoiler End*** \\n\\n\r\nWe then come to the last character, Goro. Apart from being mildly explored, he served as the third wheel-ish character who was later shown as being in love with Ichigo unsurprisingly, unfortunately he as mentioned wasn't explored much and so was thrown into the sidelines to focus on our main characters, yet another character thrown aside who had a lot of potential to do great things in this mess of an anime. I haven't spoken of any \u201cvillains\u201d yet, as this important role was destroyed by the Iotas, who were, like every other thing in the anime, unexplained, unwanted and irrelevant. They served as somewhat of a \u201cbackstory\u201d to Zero Two despite not going into detail at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above there was no proper backstory to Squad 13. Some people said it's because sci-fi shows \u201cdon't need backstories\u201d. This is plain wrong because if you don't have backstories of your character, there won't be any depth to them (see the word depth again and imagine, if there's no backstory, there's no depth, which means the characters are shallow) and when the characters simply don't develop at all during the course of the anime, you end up with flat characters who fall on their face to the plot. Why am I saying this? Hiro and the others didn't change at all mentally from the first episode to the last. Some might say Hiro\u2019s infatuation with 02 makes him a \u201cdeveloped character\u201d but his rejection of his other members in Squad 13 proves that wrong. Others say that \u201ccharacterisation is excused in a sci-fi anime\u201d. At first it seemed as a joke to me but when people seriously started talking about this as a defense I got concerned and felt I needed to clarify this. Take arguably the best sci-fi show as an example to that statement: Steins;Gate. It definitely has development throughout the series. How? Okabe starts to realise he can't do anything, and tries even harder, Makise realises she can't do things alone, Mayuri does more tuturus because people around her are sad, or to move from the joke, Mayuri realises that she needs Okabe and he needs her, this is what development in a sci-fi is. FranXX, on the other hand, didn't have any development to the show, its characters, or anything. It felt more like characters felt less real each time they appeared, and I'm not talking about them being realistic and human-like since that's not what an anime\u2019s main target is everytime, I'm talking about them being acceptable as a character which wasn't at all seen. No characterisation is only excused in slice of life anime since we're understandably looking at the lives of the characters and so there's no plot and therefore no development. FranXX isn't a slice of life, it's (terribly weak) progression proved that.\\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the MC of our wonderful series, Hiro. I hadn't given him enough attention and will do so now. From the start he was unexplained. Why was he a prodigy? What was he doing before meeting Zero Two? What made him so special? To stand out from the rest of the cast, you need distinctive qualities that set you apart from other characters, Hiro had none of that. He was plain and boring. Many may point out that him being in love with 02 would mean that it makes him different from other MCs but that's wrong because apart from his \u201clove\u201d for 02, nothing else was brought into his character. Although towards the end it was shown that he had become selfish and cared about 02 more than his squad who cared about him, it still isn't the kind of development that makes you go \u201cOh, that changed my view of him positively\u201d and if you read that line again you'll probably understand why too. Then we come to the point that he named everyone else, which was revealed early on. This surprisingly is a good thing I saw. He named Ichigo and named other parasites as well which gave it a child-like feeling (perhaps the only successful child-like/teenage feeling that was executed properly throughout the anime, bear in mind this flashback was 2 minutes long) although it wasn't explained at all I still felt an iota of warmth. And nothing else I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the other \u201cvillains\u201d, the Iotas. Since they came in at random times and with random half baked reasons, unsurprisingly they served as yet another thing that was meant to be loathed in the anime. Another irritating thing is how they suddenly became buddy-buddy with Hiro and team in the final arc. I suppose now that FranXX has exhausted whatever little \u201ccreativity\u201d they had, they wanted to end with a shounen-esque \u201ceveryone bands together to fight the enemy\u201d? I mean, not complaining about the trope but was there any sensible stuff going on beforehand? Speaking of insane stuff going on beforehand, FranXX was said to have been in a post apocalyptic world all of a sudden which we were given hints of in the beach episode for about 20 seconds and then later shown in \u201cdetail\u201d (I don't even know why I'm so generously awarding that word when it's meaning wasn't followed at all) in episode 19, which to FranXX\u2019s favour, was a decent episode. But until then for the first 18 episodes, it remained largely unexplained and I don't think I can award a show a point for revealing something so important when it's finished about 80% of it's run. Not a good practice and it returns more harm than good which by now is definitely not what I need to calm myself down. Oh youth. But then wait! Youth reminds me that I should yet again cover another important part about the \u201cjuvenile\u201d aspect of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) for the final arc below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers for the final arc. If you're okay with them, then please continue :)\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler for last arc begin: The most frustrating part of FranXX is by far the last arc. After pointless teenage melodrama, the FranXX team thought of what \u201cideas\u201d can be added to \u201csave\u201d the anime and they did what every laughable show tries to do as a last ditch effort. To take the battle into (wait for it) SPAAAAAACEEEEEE. Yes. FranXX pulled THAT trope. What an insult to Star Wars and Star Trek. Anyway back to this show, the sudden shift in tones (first a teenage melodrama, then a clone war, then a space war? Is this a tutorial on how NOT to make Star Wars ripoffs?) and extremely convenient and unexplained reveals (more on that in a bit) coming out of nowhere? I don't think that makes for a coherent plot at all. Add to that another desperate added shounen trope where the enemy suddenly becomes your friend??? And he sacrifices his life for you just a while after you rescue him??? The Klaxosaur Princess was set as the antagonist at around the third quarter of the show and she suddenly joined Hiro\u2019s side and sacrificed her life for him? What happened to her people, the Klaxosaurs? What happened to saving the world? And then suddenly VIRM puts themselves as the villains despite the show trying to establish the Klaxosaurs as the villains and then the aforementioned Klaxosaur Princess as an antagonist? And then their boss is a Power Rangers ripoff??? What even was that last arc?! The industry can do without more Dadolf Scmitlers you know! We've seen enough of this trope! Like when they're losing Papa and the others suddenly give the order to destroy Earth? Nanja sorya??? And then if you thought all this stupidity wasn't enough, we suddenly see YET ANOTHER problem with the show surface, Plot armour. If I hadn't explained this before, FranXX suffered from yet another plot hole in the form of plot armour. The Iotas lost a few of their members but Hiro and team were left unscathed, the only \u201cinjury\u201d being Ikuno\u2019s hair being turned white\u2026 Throughout the course of the show Squad 13 was met with life or death situations but I was confused since no one died. It can't be a life or death situation if everyone survives, or at least when you have so many life or death situations and no one dies even once I think that's authentically bullshit. Why fill it to the brim with Deus Ex Machina crap then? In the last 3 episodes we saw Hiro and team suddenly band together and go to space, but then the pathetic dialogue in the previous episodes of the anime became even worse, when they're in space they're going \u201cWe're really in space huh?\u201d And Mitsuru\u2019s reason for staying being \u201cI wanna stay because I want to\u201d? Even the dialogues took a huge hit and fell even further\u2026 Add to that the pointless Mobile Suit Gundam I ripoff battle except FranXX\u2019s was much worse because everyone survived??? Not to mention Zero Two eating Hiro through her teleport to Hiro fro Earth directly in front of Hiro and she eats him and takes him to the dream world only to play hard to get? If you're not understanding at all then you have common sense, because no sensible person could understand WHAT happened and WHY. Let's not add to that horrible reasons to horrible dialogues such as bringing up love when your Squadmate is suffering? And then Hiro and Zero Two immediately go leave the Solar System and the others can't tag along because \u201cit's not possible\u201d? This is the limit of cliches but the studios broke it long long ago. And I want to skip over that last episode since that was the only (remotely) decent (?) part of this arc, but the means done to achieve it wasn't and I spoke enough on that... Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nFranXX tries to show us that adults are somewhat tyrants and displays the children\u2019s \u201cstruggle\u201d to gaining \u201cindependence\u201d even though they're perfectly fine with their lives with no issues. But you know what they say, if you've got no issues, you make them, and that's EXACTLY what FranXX stayed true to. Trying to show us that our teenage cast is \u201cgrowing\u201d by acting \u201cmature\u201d with examples as \u201c wanting to have babies\u201d and \u201cdoing the kitty\u201d (don't search up on that last one) both of which are related and were attempted by Kokoro and Mitsuru. Yet again you ask. Why? I do not know why the show did it. You can't even tell anymore who they're trying to make the show relatable for. Then we have to look at the teenage drama as well that follows (that I covered above). \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) about a range of questions on things that were unanswered throughout the course of the anime below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers on these questions. If you're okay with them, then as expected, read on.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler questions begin: FranXX as mentioned tried very very hard to be edgy by leaving out some so-called \u201cmystery\u201d feel by not answering the most crucial questions many had throughout the course of the anime. Although episode 13 answered the questions many people had in the first half, there was no such plausible explanation for the second half\u2019s stupidity. What makes me say that? We got weak explanations or no explanations. For example why was the enemy VIRM all along? What was their purpose? Why does Hiro not care about the rest of Squad 13 who he's lived with all his life and why is he so attached to Zero Two despite the above problem? Why are the problems for the characters happening? Who is to blame and why? Despite this being answered (VIRM) there was no proper explanation as to WHY the villains did it? What was their purpose? Why is Ichigo the leader of the group? Why is 02 not explained properly? How does she looks human and how did it happen (also why does she have pink hair when she was a clone of one with white or blue hair)? How are the rejected people treated? What happens to them? What about their memories? Although their memories as mentioned were stored in some place there's no explanation as to why they're stored. Why am I asking that question? When VIRM doesn't want their puppets to regain their memory, why store their memory? And how is the memory stored anyway? Why are teens chosen to pilot the FranXX? Don't tell me it's because their sex organs are most prominent because the teenage years is not the age when this is so. Why are pregnant girls not able to pilot the FranXX? How did the Iotas suddenly be able to join Hiro in the last arc? Weren't they broken or something? Why do Hiro\u2019s group care and still chase Hiro despite him having rejected them for his \u201cone true love\u201d Zero Two? What was the bullcrap about them going to space and space being the important stuff? Like, what was that cop out explanation about VIRM and the enemies being the aliens? Who and what was the Klaxosaur Princess? Who were the Klaxosaurs? No detailed explanations were given. To cover the villains one last time, VIRM. We look again at the Dadolf Scmitler trope that FranXX.inc deployed. To viewers of Grancrest Senki who aren't familiar with the Dadolf Scmitler trope, VIRM is basically the Mage Academy, for the first 20 Episodes we were focused on only one villain but suddenly that villain changes in around the 20th episode and they tell us the real villains were someone else all along? (Surprising how both shows deploy the same cliche in the same episode number. Coincidence? I think not), Why is this bad? This is bad because it makes the viewer question if the time they spent on the first 20 episodes even worth it. I mean, if you really HAD to do this, why do it so late? And instead, why not just make an OVA of the last 6-8 episodes and treat it as the same thing? I'm sure it would get a higher score from me and other disgruntled people if they did this instead because our time was wasted\u2026 Spoiler questions end***\\n\\n\r\nWith all that's said, eagle eyed readers might have noticed that I haven't trashed the art or the music. That's because it isn't shit. And continue to find out. Since it was a collaboration project with A-1 and Trigger (and later Cloverworks because budget issues?) many expected the art to look amazing and it did actually. They tried to make a world that looked beautiful and mostly succeeded in doing that but you can't award points to a show for \u201clooking good\u201d as with what the \u201cmainstream\u201d gaming critics like IGN often do (\u201cCoD a 9/10 because it looks good?\u201d Have you even seen what they're doing now ripping off Fortnite?) so though the art looked good thanks to the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery from time to time, it was in vain as the show couldn't manage to utilise it well into its plot. Another thing that the show did good was the sound. Even though I've been (rightfully) trashing the show left and right, I have to give credit where it's due, FranXX\u2019s usage of synth tracks are rarely seen in anime and obviously serve for something really good in terms of listening especially when you're using headphones (and not streaming the show). Then we move onto the OP/EDs selection, I felt that the show went lazy and just changed the OP a bit and passed it off as an OP 2, but the EDs were great. If only FranXX used those EDs more in the second half and don't abruptly end the episode I'd have a positive opinion of the show. But I'm guilty of singing \u201cTorikago\u201d from the show so gotta give a point to that I guess? But oh wait, they underused all the EDs anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, FranXX is a mess which was over hyped and tried it's best to stay relevant by throwing in useless storylines all of which were riddled by plot holes and Deus ex machinas which were unconnected and not to mention completely unrelated events and random crap here and there (from teenage drama to Star Wars to Power Rangers? MASAKA???), to remain positive, towards the end, I only ever found the two caretakers Hachi and Nana (especially Nana) interesting and likeable since they had an aura of mystery and the 30 seconds they appeared in their few episodes were all great. Miku and Goro too were characters I pretty much liked but weren't explored well since they were thrown aside for Hiro and Zero Two unfortunately. If the show had good direction, I'm sure it would have turned out to be one of my favourite anime of all time and for many other disillusioned fans-turned-critics as well. FranXX sadly will always serve as a reminder to how one big mistake in the form of bad directing can jeopardize the whole premise of a show.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to TheCobraSlayer for proof-reading the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 0.5\\n\r\nAnimation: 5\\n\r\nSound: 5.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1.5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.7",

            "content": "For decades, glorious Nippon has been growing closer to extinction. To cure Nippon through the limitless power of anime, our lord and savior Trigger has blessed us with Darling in the FranXX! But to our surprise, this anime was touched by Satan himself, A-1 Pictures, and its true purpose was to accelerate the extinction!!\r\n(Long spoiler filled review ahead. Spoiler-free TL;DR at the end.)\r\nWith the declining birthrate in Japan, people are living longer, but fewer babies are being born; there aren\u2019t enough young people to take care of the elderly. The Japanese government is spending more money on health care, the workforce is shrinking with lessyoung people to fill jobs, people are often being overworked due to a lack of employees, the economy isn\u2019t flowing properly. The country\u2019s issues become abundantly clear when looking at how pharmacies stock their shelves with more diapers for adults than for kids.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Darling in the Franxx, a shoddily written clusterfuck of a mecha series that attempts to inform it's audience about Japan\u2019s declining birthrate. Yet when it does address the issue of birthrate, it only manages to conjure the most asinine, idiotic, and offensive answers possible. While it\u2019s animation, storyboarding, and fight choreography are exceptional for at least half of the show, it\u2019s writing fails on every conceivable level. Beginning as a subpar and predictable character-driven drama with a vague sci-fi setting, it gradually fell into incoherence and the lack of information was a trick used to mask the nonsensical lore.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: [Hiro & Zero Two]\\n\r\nThe first indication that something horribly wrong with A-1 Pictures/Trigger\u2019s dystopian mecha series Darling in the Franxx appears in the first scene of episode one; a monologue by the monotonous protagonist Hiro and his soon to be wild waifu Zero Two.  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe Jian, also known as the bird that shares wings, only possesses one wing. Unless a male and female pair lean on each other and act as one, they\u2019re incapable of flight.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis metaphor is symbolized throughout the series, it can be found on the characters\u2019 uniforms and on the futuristic infrastructure, yet there is no such thing as a \u2018Jian\u2019 bird in real nature. There is no species of bird that only has one wing, even implying a bird like that wouldn\u2019t die out through natural selection is ridiculous. This metaphor has two meanings; the literal: the mechas the kids pilot known as Franxx cannot fly without a male-female pair, as the series demonstrated in Partner Shuffle when two girls were explicitly unable to pilot together (ep. 11). The theme applicable to the audience: that every human has a physical for need another person of the opposite sex, throughout the show we see the characters experience this. Franxx mistakes relying on another human for survival as love, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s just codependency. \\n\\n\r\nNever does the show attempt to refute the message that codependency is necessary for survival, it only romanticizes toxicity by building Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s relationship on nothing but things they need from each other, never actual love. He needs her because he has no one else he can pilot with, she needs him because he\u2019s the first partner she hasn\u2019t killed. Any struggles they face are caused by plot contrivances pulling them apart then putting them back together with fanfare to trick you into thinking they actually overcame something. Yet, they\u2019re framed as the happiest and most exemplary couple in the series. This isn\u2019t love, it\u2019s codependency! They both NEED something from one another and that\u2019s what is tying them together, not a bond! They\u2019re like two snakes wrapping around each other until one of them suffocates first. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Hiro is wallowing in self-pity because he was just too good for his last piloting partner, she was a lame normal girl and the show decides he needs a wilder girl. He\u2019s just a potato self-insert protagonist, everyone loves him for reasons that aren\u2019t nearly compelling enough to the viewer. Seeing all of the characters in love with or admire Hiro feels so unnatural, it\u2019s so obvious that they\u2019re deliberately written to like him regardless of how little charisma he has. All of Hiro\u2019s struggles are rooted in him being better than everyone else. He just perceives himself as being worse because of his frustratingly low self-confidence. The show reminds us of this at every chance it gets with self-pitying inner monologues, but no matter how much he annoys us he never gets anywhere near believability.\\n\\n\r\nOnce his wild waifu Zero Two shows up and they start piloting with one another, he finally feels fulfilled. She\u2019s a half monster half human hybrid and she has horns. That's the single flimsy explanation we get for her craziness, not nearly enough to find her personality believable, but at least she didn't have the same generic design as all of the other characters. She\u2019s known as the \u2018partner killer\u2019 because anyone who pilots with her dies after three times, keep in mind this was back when she was allowed to have interesting character traits. This conflict gave the show chance to discuss how Hiro felt physical pain when he piloted with her, but as we would come to see, the show had no interest in delving into its characters in any meaningful way. Zero Two spends the first half of the show wallowing in angst because she\u2019s not a human or whatever, which is moderately intriguing because she develops PTSD and in hallucinations sees the past partners she killed. It gave the show a chance to actually develop her in a meaningful way, but this was dropped entirely for the sake of making her relationship with Hiro seem as saccharine as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe Beast and the Prince (ep.13), their backstory episode more or less existed solely to contribute to the cloying tone. Zero Two began as a test subject for the creator of the partner piloting system Dr. Franxx himself, and he\u2019s a really evil guy so the episode spends a fair bit of time on her being tortured. Genericness and predictability aside, the episode itself is decent enough upon first inspection; Hiro became friends with Zero two as a kid while in training, he taught her what it\u2019s like to be a normal kid, they tried to escape Dr. Franxx together but were eventually caught, and then their memories of each other were erased. I personally didn\u2019t care for the episode considering it was more or less a copy of a climactic scene from Yuri Kuma Arashi; it directly ripped storyboards, narrative beats, but it had none of the thematic implications. Franxx copies so many great anime like this to craft a hackneyed story that\u2019s less interesting than even one of its parts. The only reason anyone will have to remember this anime is for the climactic moments, and I can\u2019t give it any credit for those knowing how much worse it is than the material it plagiarized. \\n\\n\r\nThe travesty that was Punishment and Confessions (ep.14) was the turning point in the series when it lost any chance to develop the two leads beyond their one-dimensional starting point. In this episode, Hiro\u2019s squad separate him and Zero Two because their last time piloting together left him in critical condition with her simply remarking something like \u2018if he can\u2019t handle it then he\u2019s not worth it.\u2019 Hiro\u2019s squad, in spite of being mostly cardboard-cutout non-characters, are always in the right when they call out Hiro for his bullshit. The major cause of conflict between them is when Zero Two goes to visit Hiro but when she arrives at the infirmary, by some coincidence Hiro happened to have snuck out of the room and went looking for her. When she noticed he was missing, she went into psycho girlfriend mode and tried to murder his friends to find him. Then through another coincidence Hiro returned and see this brawl, convincing him to break off their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a conflict that arises due to their difference in personalities, it\u2019s a lazy ass plot contrivance. It only existed for them to be able to have a reunion a single episode later and act like they actually overcame something, they did not learn ANYTHING from this. Hiro and his friends all forgive Zero Two with no discussion whatsoever in the next goddamn episode, no apologies for her beating the crap out of all of them. The show treats this like the grandest climax so far; for the last time in Trigger's fantastic sakuga is on display, then it\u2019s pure mediocrity for the following nine episodes. Their reunion had virtually no impact narratively because it contradicted what we just saw in the previous episode and it nullified all of Zero Two\u2019s emotional baggage. After episode 15 the whole partner killer thing is forgotten, her PTSD is not discussed again, her being half monster is barely an afterthought, all because somehow being in a codependent relationship helped her. After episode 15 they were still very much relying on one another to survive, they didn\u2019t develop in an organic way. Eventually, their parasitic relationship led to Zero Two sacrificing herself, becoming a rock and also turning into a giant space robot lady.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Zero Two was the most interesting character in the series; she was defined by her unpredictability, she had intriguing emotional hang-ups, she had potential to be a good character. Then by the end, she became a rock, both in physically and metaphorically. She lost any edge she had because her wildness was tamed by Hiro. As we see throughout the series this is the case with all of the pairings, their relationships stunt character growth. For the rest of the show, Zero Two had no agency over the story other than sacrificing herself for her darling's sake. \\n\\n\r\nPart 2: [Story & Setting]\\n\r\nIn the early episodes of Franxx, little emphasis is put on the setting, it\u2019s purposefully left vague for the majority of the show. Post-apocalyptic Earth is mostly deserts, a council of powerful adults issue orders to the various squads of kids to protect the plantations containing adults unfit for battle. Kids pilot mechas to destroy oncoming attacks from giant alien creatures known as Klaxosaurs. \\n\\n\r\nWhat began as a standard, but functional premise, rapidly descended into nonsense. With each big reveal and twist the show gradually lost what the main story was even about. At the start of the series the creatures the kids fight are aliens, then it\u2019s revealed to be an older form of humans, then it\u2019s revealed the council of adults were the real aliens all along, because why the hell not. Then it\u2019s revealed that all of the adults are immortal because they injected molten lava into themselves. There are so many conflicting pieces in the lore of Franxx, it's total illogical nonsense. The best way to look at the writing in Franxx is from a thematic perspective because that\u2019s all the show seems to care about.\\n\\n\r\nRather than competently crafting a story Franxx puts more emphasis on is its characters, themes, emotions. Similar to the mecha classics that it copies incessantly, like Evangelion and Gunbuster, this is an emotional narrative. Except, they don\u2019t know how to make characters feel like believable humans and the themes attempt social commentary without actually commenting on person/group of people that exist in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses in a semi-episodic structure similar to Evangelion, episodes typically do not pick up right where the previous ones leave off plot-wise. Instead, they follow the squad of the ten main characters as they experience becoming pilots and overcoming drama amongst one another, all while delivering small details on the setting to keep you intrigued to where it may go. If Franxx were actually good, this plot structure could work just as well as the shows it\u2019s imitating, but it\u2019s so much worse. Despite being relatively well animated, its story beats are mind-numbingly generic and it almost never surprises. It feels like the script was generated by a soulless corporation, ticking off a checklist with each generic story beat, cliched character archetype, and seemingly important themes used cheaply as window dressing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Franxx, you are always ten steps ahead of the characters. They\u2019re shocked by the most mundane tropes found in any sci-fi dystopian stories. Like when the main cast discovers they aren\u2019t the first squad of kids who lived in their dormitory, it was information hinted at us many times over with the kids constantly saying \u201coh I can\u2019t wait to be an adult someday\u2026\u201d Wow, what a shocker, the menacing council of enigmatic hooded figures leading an army of child soldiers are actually evil. Who could have guessed?? Apparently none of the characters. This is an issue all throughout the series, the story beats are so standard yet the show feels the need to present it with arbitrary foreshadowing as if it\u2019s not obvious enough already. Franxx is the kind of series that doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s audience is capable of thinking beyond the level of a toddler, so at every chance it gets it spoon-feeds us information, making it even more unbearable to watch. Expecting us to be brain dead idiots or very young children is also what lead Franxx to create some of the most hilariously stupid metaphors in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe mechas and how the kids pilot them are very obnoxiously a metaphor for sex; the boy mounting the girl in a doggy style position, complete with sex terminology to describe the mechas and seating positions. As if it the sex analogy wasn\u2019t clear enough, the characters\u2019 piloting banter always sounds like they\u2019re talking about sex rather than I don\u2019t know, fighting aliens. The mechas themselves are for some unexplained reason female, with over-sexualized features so there is always fanservice right in the middle of fight scenes to distract you from the action. They're a mishmash of ugly colors and random accessories that make no sense, the designs are hideous desperately trying to look attractive. And the thing is, the kids have been raised in a sterile environment devoid of any information about sexuality, so they don\u2019t even know how perverted the act of piloting is. First of all, that\u2019s kind of creepy and only adds to the layer of sleazy fanservice covering this whole mess, secondly, it presents the themes of procreation in such a painstakingly literal way that there is no room for analysis. If Franxx had even a little self-awareness, this tonal whiplash could have been at least partially avoided if it were framed as humorous, instead, it\u2019s unknowingly parodying itself by being as stupid as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads us to the fact that the world of Darling in the Franxx makes no goddamn sense. It\u2019s full of contradictions. We\u2019re constantly told that the kids don\u2019t know anything about sexuality, they don\u2019t even know what a kiss is, yet they for some reason they view nudity as inherently sexual. Clearly, the writers did not consider what a culture would look like if boys and girls are raised alongside each other without any real contact with adults or exposure to sex. The boys \u2018ogle\u2019 the girls pervertedly which makes no sense whatsoever because they should not know to view them as sexual, and the fact that the girls feel shame, in turn, makes no sense either. If the show hadn\u2019t forced that pointless beach episode in, these issues wouldn\u2019t have been as noticeable. In a better written dystopian story, the characters' puberty would be free of expectations that would typically be passed onto them by society. However rather than carefully considering the dynamics of the sci-fi setting they were attempting to create, the writers simply gave us cliched romantic comedy hijinks seen in any generic anime.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3 [WHAT THE FUCK IS FRANXX EVEN ABOUT?]\\n\r\nThe world building in Darling in the Franxx is flat out awful, which is what makes the vast majority of the story feel incredibly shapeless. It takes seventeen episodes for Franxx to actually clarify what the hell it is actually commenting on in the real world. If Franxx wanted to be a good reflection the birthrate decline in Japan it would have had to actually make use of its sci-fi setting beyond just stupid sex-powered mechas. For starters, a lack of kids being born would be an explicit conflict in the story to reflect the birth rate decline in modern day Japan. However, there are a TON of children in Franxx! So many that they are able to throw them into cryosleep as we see in episode 22. There is a surplus of kids in Franxx if discussing birth-rate was the real goal of the show then they failed from the start. The issues the heroes in Darling in the Franxx face is not that there aren\u2019t enough children. They want to have children the normal way with the boy-girl pairs they were assigned to, but the aliens in control of their system do not allow that. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 17 is the moment that the series lays down its themes clearer than it ever had before. Kokoro voices that she wants to have a baby in order to feel fulfilled, then the evil Squad Nine comes and takes her book on pregnancy and they tell her humans have cast away their reproductive organs because they cause too much unnecessary drama. He further clarifies by stating the firm belief of APE, the council of aliens leading the anti-reproduction regime. \\n\\n\r\nThis is simply connecting a person's fertility directly to their emotional depth. The world of Franxx says you don\u2019t need to reproduce OR have emotion, and that\u2019s what the main characters are trying to break away from. Of course, why wouldn\u2019t they want to break out of a system like that? But why? What does it represent? What person or group in the real world is preventing people from having kids because they want to be shallow, genderless, and without children? No one! It's social commentary written by someone who is out of touch with reality. \\n\\n\r\nIn the awful backstory of \u201cInhumanity\u201d (ep.19), Dr. Franxx voices that he believes humans are only truly beautiful if they can procreate, which is why he puts faith in Hiro\u2019s squad to become \u201creal humans\u201d and create children in his designated forced piloting system. The piloting is just pseudo-science that very obviously has no reason for existing outside of serving the show\u2019s message and trashy fan service. The show takes this message even further by portraying any person or group who doesn\u2019t procreate the Franxx way as a threat to humanity. \\n\\n\r\nFranxx is very much able to say a traditional family is good; mother, father, procreating, that is a good message for tackling birthrate. But for some reason, it chooses to frame anyone who chooses not to adhere to the traditionalist family setup as a threat to mankind. Franxx just ignores the fact that there are many other ways people can have a family, and still live fulfilled lives. There can be same-sex relationships, people can adopt kids, or even to not have children at all, but Franxx says these are all signs of inhumanity. That hilariously stupid wedding episode served only to convey this message but in the most hamfisted way possible. In episode 18, the alien SWAT team led by APE literally raids the makeshift wedding between Kokoro and Mitsuru. They tear the bride and groom apart, then erasing their memories of one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire wedding arc was unnecessary to the story and boring as hell, it was just crammed in there for the sake of pushing these themes even more. APE is just the idea of diversity but overblown to ridiculous proportions. It antagonizes anyone who opposes traditionalism to an absurd degree, but it also portrays traditionalists as insanely hysterical in their beliefs in an offensively stereotypical way. Both sides of the political spectrum are written in a way that is so overblown to an alienating degree that very few people will want to agree with it. When the purpose of a piece of art is to change the audience's political views, it is fitting to label it as propaganda. However, assuming that level of thought and consideration was put into the story would be giving the moron who wrote it way too much credit. Regardless of your stance on the themes in Franxx, this is all it has to offer in terms of in-depth analysis, other than that it's boring teenage drama between underdeveloped characters.\\n\\n\r\nPart 4: [The Squad]\\n\r\nHow could this have happened?! The voice actors were good enough to mask a lack of depth, the animators were talented enough to make them look like lively pieces of cardboard (at least in the first half), but nope instead they are unavoidably awful and no icing will make this pile of shit resemble a cake. At best they\u2019re forgettable, but at worst they\u2019re horribly portrayed archetypes that will make you feel sorry for how badly the show treats them. There was so much potential in most of these characters, but without writers capable of crafting cohesive or satisfying arcs, all of them remain flat cardboard cutouts only existing to support Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s efforts to be the most obnoxious couple in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIchigo:\\n\r\nAll this poor girl did was have a crush on the potato protagonist, and that caused people to send her voice actress death threats. They\u2019re children, who gives a shit about who likes who? Her reason for actually liking him is so vague and petty, they were friends as children. And per Franxx\u2019s idiot logic, your first affectionate interaction with a person will decide who you\u2019re attracted to when you're older. Ichigo had a few interesting moments of standing up to Zero Two for the sake of protecting Hiro, it of course went how you expect, with the two parasites wallowing in codependency and nothing developing. She does very little throughout the show aside from looking pouty whenever she sees the two leads acting lovey-dovey around her. It was impossible for me to sympathize with her because I can\u2019t comprehend why she would feel so strongly towards a potato. Regardless of her love, by the end, she does not change at all despite being the most prominent supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nGoro:\\n\r\nOccasionally Goro calls Hiro out on his bullshit in some of the most satisfying scenes of the series, then in the most disappointing moments of the series, he immediately apologizes and acknowledges Hiro\u2019s superiority. Goro is allowed to be a character for a few seconds once every few episodes, but for the remainder of the show, he has no stakes in the story. \\n\r\nGoro\u2019s main attribute is that he\u2019s a nice guy who feels unrequited love for Ichigo. He respects her and acknowledges that she has feelings for Hiro and doesn\u2019t overstep his boundaries. He\u2019s the most likable member of the whole cast, but sadly there is literally nothing to him than his unrequited love for Ichigo. His whole character arc culminates very early on in \u201cTriangle Bomb\u201d (ep. 9) when he confesses his love to Ichigo in the best way he could, explicitly stating he doesn\u2019t want to pressure her but wanted to clear the tension between them because he is a nice and respectful guy. \\n\r\nThen Ichigo shrugs off his confession with \u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to that,\u201d\\n\r\n... \\n\r\n...and then she literally doesn\u2019t...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nFOR THE ENTIRE SHOW.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro:\\n\r\nOk, I was bracing myself by talking about Goro first because Kokoro is by far the worst member of the squad. Not only is she the source of many plot holes, she is more or less a vehicle for the show\u2019s creator to preach the themes. In the totally 100% necessary beach episode (ep.7), she finds her bible, a book on pregnancy, and for the remainder of the series, she preaches it like scripture. She uses it to learn about sexuality, weddings, and childbirth. In \u201cBoys x Girls\u201d (ep.8) she references the book to explain why the boys were ogling the girls, she says \u2018we have to put up with their perviness in order to pilot together and to eventually have a family with them.\u2019 Kokoro believes that girls are supposed to ignore any problems they have with the boys because they have to make a baby regardless of how they feel. Not only is this a harmful message for viewers, it also causes even more stagnant character writing because the pilot pairings never have discussions about their troubles. Nothing is ever overcome because Kokoro perpetuates this outdated rhetoric. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro does very little throughout the show, mostly sitting passively until she gets the baby craziness and demands to be allowed to have a child. After promising she would stay with her piloting partner Futoshi, she immediately kicks him to the curb for a new guy in episode 11 for no other reason than he\u2019s fat and she doesn\u2019t want her kid to have the fat genes. So needless to say she\u2019s kind of a monster and I felt no sympathy whatsoever. \\n\r\nThat leads us to the makeshift wedding they come up with which was one of the stupidest moments in the show; for some reason, right before she is wed to Mitsuru they\u2019re raided by APE with their SWAT team. It\u2019s totally ridiculous to think that a futuristic advanced society of aliens could kick down the door at any moment, but they chose to wait just as the two are about to kiss. And seeing them waving around guns at a wedding full of kids is so unbelievably over-the-top. That whole marriage episode was a trudge to get through, and I was honestly relieved when the alien SWAT reproduction-abolitionists ended it early. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. APE erases Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s memories one another, but this opens even more plot holes:\\n\r\n1. APE forgot to remove their wedding rings after the memory removal procedure, genius.\\n\r\n2. All of the other kids knew about the memories getting erased so they just told her and that\u2019s how she remembered. \\n\r\n3. She was still pregnant after being captured by the anti-marriage alien SWAT team. They\u2019re pretty bad at being an anti-reproduction regime if they can\u2019t even figure out this basic shit.\\n\r\n4. Kokoro and Mitsuru regain their memories a few episodes later on their own, they overcome literally nothing because they return to how they were just before getting married. \\n\\n\r\nZorome/Miku:\\n\r\nThey\u2019re the most forgettable members of the squad, simple one-note personalities with no impact on the story. They do have a brief bit of \u2018development\u2019 if you can even call it that abhorrent in \u201cBoys x Girls\u201d (ep. 8). They clash briefly when Zorome ogles Miku (we\u2019ve discussed how this doesn\u2019t make sense) and she reacts by dividing the dormitory with tape in the most sitcom-y episode in the show. For a mecha series that tries to take itself seriously, throwing a proverbial wrench in the tone does not make the characters seem more human and relatable, it was such an unnatural tonal shift that it made them feel like aliens. Other than this one fanservice episode, they just hang around the squad and offer a few inconsequential reactions and quips that add absolutely nothing to the show but background noise. \\n\\n\r\nFutoshi: \\n\r\nThis poor chubby kid is just bullied by the show whenever he is onscreen, his whole character arc is one big fat joke. At first, it was just a few offbeat jokes along the lines of \u201cHey, don\u2019t take any of my food while I\u2019m gone.\u201d His humor was just as unnatural and stereotypical as the rest of the cast, but then the show takes it a step further from a poorly written annoyance into offensively awful. His piloting partner Kokoro ditches him during \u201cPartner Shuffle\u201d because he has the fat genes and she wants a good baby to further the species. Understandably, this causes him to become insecure about his weight and form an eating disorder. This is a very sensitive topic with plenty of potential for good discussion, but this is Franxx so they flushed any potential down the toilet. Franxx approaches this real-world issue that affects plenty of people with the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers were too incompetent to deftly handle a serious topic like an eating disorder, so instead they literally just ignore it. Most of episode 16 is dedicated to his struggling with not wanting to eat any food, with Zorome confirming that Futoshi is throwing up his food. Yet even though they confront him about his insecurity, the episode ends with Hiro giving one of his bullshit speeches about friendship with sad piano music playing, cue the whole cast crying. Futoshi\u2019s turmoil was glossed over and never resolved, likely because none of the corporate drones that manufactured this knew how to sensitively handle real-world issues. The director goes out of his way to show us how unhappy he is with himself in minor ways throughout the rest of the show. Whether he be playing with his food or sadly staring down at his full plate, even by the end it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s still struggling with his disorder yet Franxx couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about his turmoil. Rather than addressing his issue, they choose to force him to be the de facto-priest at Kokoro\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s so cruel and horrible that I might actually have felt bad for him if he had actual character traits beyond \u201che\u2019s fat lol.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIkuno:\\n\r\nThroughout the show, she is very blatantly hinted at being in love with Ichigo, which gave the show a huge chance to backtrack on the message that anyone who isn\u2019t in a heterosexual relationship is actively part of the birthrate problem. But because Franxx is the anime of disappointments, her character arc was handled appallingly. One of the most egregious moments in the series was in \"When the Sakura Blooms\" (ep. 18) when Ikuno confesses her love to Ichigo and she wrote it off by saying \u201coh I was the same when I felt unrequited love for Hiro, but now I am doing what's necessary for the greater good and hooking up with someone else.\u201d It\u2019s the passive-aggressive type of homophobia I've seen plenty of in real life from people who are only accepting of gay people as long as they become straight eventually. What Ichigo says to Ikuno sounds more like \u2018oh how sad that you\u2019re defective, someday you\u2019ll grow out of that phase.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there, Ikuno is perpetually shown as the least able member of the squad. Like I mentioned previously, this show dives into some dark dehumanizing themes of eugenics. It is explicitly stated that in the world of Franxx, your life force is directly connected to your fertility, if you\u2019re not having a kid your hair will become gray and you will die faster than those who chose to further the species. Whether or not it was the creator\u2019s intention to dehumanize LGBT people, he threw these pieces on the board and they landed unnervingly close to hate-speech.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuru:\\n\r\nAt the start of the series, Mitsuru is the \u2018rival\u2019 archetype who has an inferiority complex to Hiro, but through subtle coding is indicated to actually be in love with him. Mitsuru received his name from Hiro when he was a child, therefore per Franxx idiot logic, he is gay. With this character, Franxx approaches the topic of homosexuality as a developmental mistake, something you are born with then eventually grow out of. Which is just not true on any level. Sexuality is biodiversity, you\u2019re born that way or you\u2019re not. A person does not need \u2018a reason for being gay,\u2019 they just are. The fact that Franxx framed it as a discrepancy in Mitsuru and Ikuno\u2019s upbringing and that they have to grow out of it regardless of their how they feel is appalling. \\n\\n\r\nHis turmoil over being in love with Hiro is swiftly brought to a close with him being forced into a relationship with Kokoro. She projects her desire to have a kid on him until he tepidly reciprocates because they are both convinced that unless they have a child they won\u2019t be fulfilled in life or ensure the future. Of course with no resolution for his unrequited love. The show goes out of its way to frame his marriage to Kokoro as an obligation rather than a choice. Similar to Futoshi, through subtle character direction you can tell Mitsuru\u2019s still pining for Hiro even in the episode he starts his relationship Kokoro. And there\u2019s never the same coding for Mitsuru being in love with Kokoro. Hiro flat out tells Mitsuru \u201cyou ARE in love with Kokoro\u201d and he accepts that hesitantly. It\u2019s as if the writers were trying to indicate that Mitsuru actually wanted to be with Hiro, but needed to suppress his feeling in order to prevent the metaphorical birth rate from declining. \\n\\n\r\nEven if these messages were unintentional, the creators of Franxx are playing with serious issues just for the sake of window dressing to make the sex-robot alien stuff seem less stupid, which is in my opinion just as offensive.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5: [Dr. Franxx, APE, \u201cInhumanity,\u201d and the scienceless sci-fi]\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an atheist, you see ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\u201d \\n\r\n-Dr. Franxx while licking his lips at the sight of the loli-monster-girl-princess. \\n\\n\r\nOur first introduction to the eponymous Dr. Franxx is him delivering his half-breed experiment kid Zero Two to Hiro\u2019s squad. One of his first lines is literally him sexually assaulting Nana, the squad's parental-type overseer, and telling her to loosen up. The show frames it as a joke because of course Franxx (the show) finds workplace assault to be fluffy humor. That\u2019s how he\u2019s characterized for most of the series, as a guy who does explicitly bad things like torturing Zero Two during \u201cThe Prince and the Beast,\u201d yet the show frames him as sympathetic. They really expected us to think, \u201che\u2019s done bad things, but he really had some good ideas!\u201d He had no value for human life, but somehow designing the awful sex-powered mechas absolves him? It\u2019s like a crazy person trying to defend Hitler. I Don\u2019t Care. He tortured and experimented on a kid, the show expected us to feel bad for him when he \u2018sacrificed himself\u2019 so everyone could survive at the end of episode 21. I literally applauded when a plot contrivance caused him to get violently crushed by rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAPE is just a bunch of aliens that came down to Earth and pretended to be an organization of scientists, they gave the government a new form of energy, magma and took over the world more or less. It\u2019s a very silly twist, but this is Franxx and it\u2019s a stupid show, magma could technically be used as a form of energy and greed could lead the government to trust mysterious scientists. But the magma is somehow also the key to unlocking immortality? How? Magma is molten rock, hot rocks! How the hell do you make the logical leap between a form of energy and DNA mutation? It makes no goddamn sense! APE was just a bunch of random aliens that had so little to do with the main characters, it added nothing to what had been built up in the prior episodes. The magma energy constantly shown in background details supposedly caused the Earth to become deserts? Taking molten lava from the Earth (below the crust) would in no way affect the soil, it might lower the temperature of the surface but that would cause it to become cold, not hot. I'm not sure who thought coming up with scientific-sounding words and a vaguely futuristic aesthetic would make good sci-fi, but it doesn't. Even I, someone who knows very little about science can tell this show is brain dead stupid and no effort went into researching its concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThen after Franxx spends twenty-two episodes building up this illogical science, it throws in a giant twist in episode 20 that nullifies everything that came before it. Oh no! APE was actually aliens and now Zero Two\u2019s brain is trapped in space fighting them!! Who gives a shit? At this far into the series, the themes and pseudo-science were all the show cared about. Regardless of how badly they were written, at least it was something to engage with. All of the petty melodrama the characters face, all of the hackneyed lore, even the art quality goes down the toilet by episode 22. Franxx does these twists so often with its story, whenever it wants to achieve a climactic moment it just skips over the build-up and goes straight to the catharsis. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of Darling in the Franxx, it doubles down on the ridiculous plot twists, desperate to make you take it seriously when you're more likely to laugh at it. In its final attempt to make you cry, it kills off it's two main characters, but even this lends no catharsis. The only catharsis you'll get from the ending of this train wreck is knowing you\u2019ll never have to watch it ever again.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\n[Story: 0/10] Clichefest, contrived filler drama, terrible world building, nonsensical twists that nullify the whole story.\\n\r\n[Character: 0/10] I've seen planks of wood more interesting and relatable than this entire cast.\\n\r\n[Art: 3/10] No visual identity, good battle sakuga in the first half with hideous mecha designs, very rushed towards the end.\\n\r\n[Sound: 3/10] Mediocre soundtrack, a waste of talented voice actors.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 0/10] Both intellectually and personally insulting.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score: 1/10]\\n\r\nThere\u2019s enough potential here to leave you curious as to what the writer/director Atsushi Nishigori might have created if he weren\u2019t so satisfied with repurposing classic anime into a clusterfuck that\u2019s less interesting than even one of its parts. He never understood what made their themes so impactful in the first place, and didn\u2019t bother to create an anime capable of standing on its own merits. Without a coherent story, remotely believable characters, or even themes rooted in reality, this show offers no redeeming value.\\n\\n\r\nThe best praise I can give to Darling in the Franxx is UNWATCHABLE.",

            "content": "Seeing this number of positive reviews on this show made me decide to write an honest review on it. This review is written by a person who was on the Darling in The FranXX hype train before it arrived at the r/anime station, and also by a person who absolutely loves Trigger and their work, from the Gainax beginnings to their \"independency\".\r\nDarling in the FranXX started out pretty solid, if you ask me. It already introduced a very interesting metaphor in the first 2 minutes, and I was very excited at that point. Then came the naked girl cliche. Ignoring it as an \"A1 shenanigan\",I continued the episode and was able to find it a tad bit enjoyable, mostly because of the cool world concept and the interesting-looking characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat didn't last long. In the first 6 episodes, those seemingly interesting characters have either done nothing or have been super annoying. I was not expecting side character development in 6 episodes, but this was just unbearable. 02 also got old real fast, making Hiro the only one able to save the show. Turns out Hiro is just budget Kirito therefore shattering all my hopes for the characters part.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! There's more to a show than characters. \"Great Art\" is indeed true, and I won't even deny that the art is consistent and good, but it's normal. It brings nothing to the table, it's just the standard \"good\" animation. The music is also unnoticeable. I was expecting better music from Trigger. Have they even worked on this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say much about the story, since right now many questions remain unanswered, I can say that it doesn't seem to be going anywhere in these 6 episodes. It seems more like they're experimenting with the mechs and the \"kyoryuu\" battles right now, and sometimes adding a little bit of info. \\n\\n\r\nI am not enjoying this show. I'm having trouble finishing these last episodes and that's a no-no for me.",

            "content": "4 Cups of Evangelion\r\n2 tablespoons of granulated Gurren Lagann\r\n1/4 teaspoon of Star Driver\r\n1 dash of Beauty and the Beast\r\nAnd last, but not least.\r\n69 metric tons of CRAP! (freshly steamed)\r\nIn case it wasn\u2019t obvious, these are the instructions for one serving of Darling in the FranXX.\r\nThere is a tacit understanding in the anime industry, as well as the filming industry, that you are allowed to draw inspiration from other works, but not plagiarize said works.  There are, of course, exceptions to this rule \u2014 particularly, in regards to satirical natured shows (Gintama and Inferno Cop, being the perfect examples) \u2014 however, solemn show\u2019s dance ona very thin line, and must introduce innovative ideas to alter the perception on existing paradigms; otherwise, they come off as being cliched, and redundant.  From a monetary perspective, it makes sense to draw influence from other works, for example: Disney\u2019s Lion King took inspiration from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet and Kimba, the White Lion (an anime from Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy).  Yet it doesn\u2019t absolve those involved from imbuing their own ideas and nuances to create something worthwhile.  Darling in the FranXX doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend this point, as it overtly uses critical elements from several other anime as a faux attempt of appearing sophisticated.\\n\\n\r\nFor ease of reading, I have created a short list of instances that were copied, slightly altered, or outright stolen from other anime (this is not all-inclusive, as there are countless examples):\\n\\n\\n\r\n-The underground city bears resemblance to Tokyo-3 and the Geofront from Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-The mysterious men/women in the white uniforms that have significant influence are rip-offs of SEELE from Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-The launch sequences are essentially mirror images of Evangelion\u2019s launch sequences (see a theme here).\\n\\n\r\n-There was some kind of testing that was being performed in the early episodes that paralleled the synchronization tests in Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX has been compared to episode 8 of Gurren Lagann.  Which makes perfect sense, since Atsushi Nishigori (the director of Darling in the FranXX) was the director for episode 8 of Gurren Lagann, but this brings up a more serious issue: why is Nishigori reusing old ideas from over ten years ago?  Not only that, but why is episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX a worse rendition of his earlier work (he couldn\u2019t come up with improvements in all these years)?\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 13 is a reverse retelling of Beauty and the Beast \u2014 in fact, the title of the episode is The Beast and the Prince (they\u2019re not even attempting to disguise their intentions at this point).\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 20 we find out that VIRM wants to annihilate the klaxosaurs who retreated underground, similar to the spirals (who lived underground) fighting the anti-spirals in Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n-Mecha\u2019s transforming to absurd levels of scale and power like Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n-Instrumentality, much?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the real \u201cbutt\u201d of my issue with this series, and this concerns the \u201cdoggy-styled\u201d positions the girls must assume to pilot their Evangelions \u2014 I mean, their FranXX\u2019s.  It\u2019s one thing to engage the viewer through needless fan-service, but there are limits one can go before coming off as ridiculous.  Kill la Kill, another studio Trigger production, already ingratiated the anime community to the concept of excessive lasciviousness, the difference being: they did so with a self-deprecating tone.  This show, on the other hand, is treating the matter with solemnity; and sure, they attempt to shoehorn in a half-assed explanation, but the whole immortality subtlety doesn\u2019t fit well with the predetermined conclusion.  Immortality, as a concept, lends itself to numerous paths of intrigue about the overall worth of life, the monotony of existence, and the deterioration of cognitive faculties.  Alas, Darling in the FranXX (i.e. Studio Trigger) does not choose to expand on any of these philosophical conundrums, and instead, elects to go for sex and procreation \u2014 no surprise.\\n\\n\r\nHold your frustration back, because it gets worse.  In episode 8, when the girl\u2019s clothing gets disintegrated by the Klaxosaur \u201cgoo,\u201d revealing portions of their bodies to the boys, they decide to pull-out (Mitsuru should have done the same thing, hehe) the ultimate TV trope: dividing the house in half, with tape.  They straight up took this out of the I Love Lucy playbook.  Considering that sitcom television is the lowest form of televised entertainment known to man, it speaks volumes about an anime that takes inspiration from said \u201cart form.\u201d  It\u2019s like the anime staff couldn\u2019t be bothered to think of one original concept, so they just mashed a conglomerate of  ideas into a CGI mess of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe suggestive positioning of the girls, along with the incognizant sexual innuendo\u2019s surpasses the realm of idiocy, resembling the writing complexity of a soft-core porno.  We get it, the stamen (the boys) and the pistil (the girls) are references to the sexual organs of a flower; and the lack of trust (i.e. love) leads to incompatibility and a flaccid conclusion.  In other words: sex is not as meaningful without the love; especially when partners are switched amongst each other, implying unsympathetic cucking.  Then, in the final episodes, Nine Alpha rides with Hiro (bisexuality?), harkening back to Gurren Lagann when Simon put aside his differences with Viral in their final battle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the first episode when Zero Two is catching fish with her mouth, in the nude.  It was a senseless scene that provided nothing more than reference material for future waxing sessions (you know what I\u2019m talking about).  Seriously, though.  Why must Studio Trigger continue their quest of inducing the most boners in the anime community?  It use to be an art to inject promiscuousness into anime, now its so ubiquitous that if feels burdensome to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you thought this review was scathing up until this point, then you would be correct. Nevertheless, stay tuned, because I\u2019m about to discuss the worst aspect of the show: the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\u2026They all suck!\\n\\n\r\nOkay.  That\u2019s not much of an analysis, but what can we really say about these characters?  Zero Two acts like a temperamental five year-old, who condescends to her superiors and comrades because that\u2019s what passes for cool nowadays.  She also likes to slather her food in honey and shove it down her \u201cdarling\u2019s\u201d mouth.  Speaking of which, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse: Yuno, from Mirai Nikki, saying \u201cYuki\u201d, or Zero Two saying \u201cdarling.\u201d  They are both excruciating to the eardrums.  Her \u201cdarling,\u201d Hiro, is your typical mundane protagonist, lacking identifying characteristics that would engage the viewer and become interested in his plight towards becoming a FranXX pilot.  He is, however, infatuated with Zero Two to the point of feeling dead inside without her presence (get over it dude, your like, 14?)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, unfortunately, is a compilation of tired tropes that have been utilized time and time again.  In fact, I can\u2019t remember any of their names, so I won\u2019t waste your time, and mine, looking them up just to explain how trivial their roles really are.  Suffice it to say, the cast is a representation of the anime staff\u2019s laziness, but considering this show has a higher rating than the reboot of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (which has an excellent cast of characters), it should come as no surprise why anime writers continue to shove monotonous characters down our throats ad infinitum.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to sound too presumptuous, but this may be the worst anime I have ever seen in my life \u2014 or, at the very least, it\u2019s in the running.  As it stands, the current list of the worst anime goes as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n\r\n1)  Mirai Nikki\\n\r\n2)  Sword Art Online\\n\r\n3)  Bio Broly\\n\r\n4)  Boku no Pico\\n\r\n5)  Darling in the FranXX\\n\\n\r\nConsidering they copied everything else from Evangelion, it is only fitting to compliment Darling in the FranXX for their crappy achievement.\\n\\n\r\nCongratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 0/10\\n\r\nPlot: 0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10 (by default)\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhat kind of fuckery is this?\u201d Amy Winehouse.\r\nWell, folks, it\u2019s finally time to talk about the most notorious anime of 2018. Darling in the Franxx. \r\nAfter the success of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill, as well as the unfortunate failure of Kiznaver Studio Trigger, decided to make Darling In The Franxx but with the help of A1 Pictures/Cloverworks. Like many others on the internet, I was really excited for Darling in the Franxx. Maybe that was my biggest mistake and like with Beatless, Black Clover and Re:Zero I was expecting too much. However, even if the anime had failed to live up toexpectations the anime would be still be entertaining so bad it\u2019s good to watch. Unfortunately Darling in the Franxx is not so bad it\u2019s a good type of shows. In fact, Darling in the Franxx is by far one of the worst written and directed anime I have ever seen from this medium. Say what you want about Black Clover, The Asterisk Wars, Big Order and Eromanga Sensei for being for worst shows than this but least those shows had the so bad its good effect where despite these shows being horrendous least they were actually funny. This show from start to finish was not funny at all as it only got more insulting and stupid as it progressed and because of that am going to end my intro here because since this show doesn't give a damn about its viewer so why should I?\\n\\n\r\nGod help me.\\n\\n\r\nAct I: The broken written and directed mess of a story that has no idea of it it's doing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the distant future. The world is ruined, and humanity establishes mobile fort cities called \u201cplantations\u201d. Pilots produced inside Plantation live in Mistilteinn, also known as the \u201cbirdcage.\u201d Children living there know nothing of the outside world or the freedom of the sky. Their lives consist of battling to carry out missions. Their enemies are mysterious giant life forms known as Klaxosaur, and the children pilot machines called Franxx to face off against them. For the children, riding the Franxx proves their existence. The story follows a boy named Hiro who goes by the code 016 has lost motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out class graduation\u00a0Hiro goes to the lack where he encounters a girl with two horns and she quickly introduces by her code name Zero Two. She has been infamously known as a partner killer where none of her partners survive after the third ride. Before they properly interact they the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. After Zero Two failed attempt to engage the Klaxosaur\u00a0as well her partner dying Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her and from there Zero Two, Hiro, and the crew must fight against the Klaxosaur\u2019s in order to save humanity.\\n\r\nThere are so many problems with this show I seriously don\u2019t know where to begin.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story is very dull and boring as hell. I didn\u2019t care about many events in the story because I was bored by them and I thought they were poorly executed. It\u2019s also rips off a lot of better mecha anime without understanding of what made them good for example Hiro and Zero are just poor-mans versions of Demonic and Anemone where they relationships are similar but it was done better in Eureka Seven as there was a lot of build up for Demonic and Anemone to grow as characters before they formed a relationship with each other. Also, did I forget that Demonic and Anemone are far better-written characters than Zero Two and Hiro will ever be.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx also has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in any anime as the show consistently waste its time on pointless bullshit instead of focusing on relevant things that are important to the overall narrative.\\n\r\nThe world-building for Darling in the Franxx is god awful. Besides from the episodes 7, 10 and 19 where the show\u00a0briefly did world-building in a bad way the show never even bothers at establishing its own setting and because of this, the world in Darling in the Franxx is incredibly empty. Where do the Klaxosaurs come from? What\u00b4s this organization that's fighting against them? In which time is this series set? What kind of government there is there this world?\u00a0How old are each parasite in the series are? This show never explains any of these things because screw worldbuilding lets just have characters go out with the pathetic and cringe-worthy character drama that is contrived as hell. These issues along with the pacing would eventually bite the show in the ass later on which I will talk about in a bit.\\n\r\nDarling In The Franxx is also the dumbest show ever to take itself too seriously where the show tries to be all serious, smart and edgy with its monologues, symbolism, and themes but because of the horrendous tone shifts and flashy fan-service it completely makes the show very pretentious as a result of its themes and speaking of themes.\\n\r\nThis show also does a horrendous job at presenting its themes and topics to a point certain characters in the show just preach about sex, love, and family all over the fucking place without any context and real reasoning. It doesn't the fact this show has the maturity level of a horney 12-year-old.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue of Darling in the Franxx is how it really doesn\u2019t know what show it wants to be as it keeps changing its damm genre in almost every freaking episode?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be balls off the wall dumb mecha show?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a sitcom?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a mystery anime?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a slice of life show?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a coming of age story?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a serious mecha show that deals with a lot of sensitive topics and themes?\\n\r\nWho the hell knows because this anime clearly doesn\u2019t and top it all out because this show tries to squeeze in many genres as possible the pacing and the tone of the series becomes screwed.\\n\\n\r\nAct II: The boring and\u00a0infuriating cliched empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation and character development in Darling in the Franxx are practically non-existent thanks to the show having a nasty habit of using certain elements that completely prevent any form of character growth and because of that am currently struggling to find a series with more empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur male protagonist Hiro is a boring empty husk who barely even capable of producing the energy required being a mecha protagonist. He has no personality on his own and there\u2019s nothing that stands about him as the way his written and designs is awful. Plus all the character development that he gets feels forced and unnatural. Not to mention he becomes a much worser character as the series goes on but we will get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two is an awfully written waifu pandering character with no substance.\\n\r\nDespite being the character that has the most personality from this bland cast she is still a pathetic written character that has no substance that doesn\u2019t develop for shit. She also has a stupid and annoying sexy horney personality where she constantly preaches about being with Hiro.\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for this piece of shit character is that she is just a god damm wish fulfillment/waifu pandering character where outside of the awfully predictable romance with Hiro she just there to pander to the lowest common denominator. Screw this character and her wish-fulfillment bullcrap\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters from the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation are absolutely awful.\\n\r\nZorome and Miku are both loud mouthed tsundere\u2019s who like to yell a lot. They don't have a purpose to the narrative at all other to be background noise.\\n\r\nGoro is a boring bro type character that we all have seen before who is very friendly and protective to people.\\n\r\nFutoshi is your typical fat friendly guy who likes to stuff his mouth with food all the time.\\n\r\nKokoro is a shy girl who has a good heart.\\n\r\nIkuno is a very calm and collected girl who loves to read books.\\n\r\nMitsuru is the prideful guy who has a superiority complex.\\n\r\nIchigo or as I like to call her Bitchigo for being an insufferable contrived bitch is your cookie cutter childhood character that we all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nDo you guys see a problem here? Not only the characters in Darling in the Franxx are tropey as fuck but they can't even stand up on they own as characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all equally awful and not even worth mentioning at all as they all feel like Gurren Lagann and Evangelion character rejects.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this worse is how this show plays with its audience with its half fast character development that didn\u2019t matter thanks to character resets.\\n\r\nOne of the examples of this was in episode 10 where the show tried to develop Zorome as a character you know that brat who behaves like Boruto. He got great character development in that episode and by the end of the episode they decided to kill off all the characters development that he had and went back to the same loudmouth tsundere character from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t me started with Episode 14 with the whole Ichigo bullshit. Okay while she didn\u2019t lose her memory or anything she devolved to a whiny and unsympathetic bitch of a captain who constantly gets too emotional about Hiro and that completely who against all of her previous character development in episode 9 with Goro. The final coffin for Bitchigo is that as soon as Zero Two leaves she literally takes advantage of Hiro by kissing him.\\n\r\nBitch, we get it you don\u2019t like Zero Two but did you really have go out of your fucking way to tell everyone in the room that members from the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation won\u2019t take apart in the battle unless they tell kick Zero Two off and on top of that you go confess to him even though you got Goro as a love interest. I understand you want to project your childhood friend from danger but this was the dumbest way to do it and because of that you just became one of the dumbest characters to ever exist in an anime\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also that stupid love subplot with Kokoro and Mitsuru but I will get to that in a bit because that subplot alone killed the show it an idiotic fashion.\\n\r\nHonestly, what is a point of being a coming of age story if you only to going to reset character development and motivations? I swear the staff was god damm clueless knowing the basic elements of a coming of age story.\\n\\n\r\nAct III: The cringe homage festival aka episodes 20-24\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the first 19 episodes were awful you ain't seen nothing yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe final 5 episodes of Darling in the Franxx are some of the worst final episodes I have ever seen in any anime.\\n\r\nNot only it was horrendously build up but the way that the show that disgustingly changed its tone was infuriating because it took one of the shows biggest problems and took it to a next level where the show tries to squeeze all the story elements from NGE, Kill la Kill, Gunbuster and Gurren Lagann without understanding of what made those\u00a0story elements great and because of those reasons the pacing, narrative, direction, production values and especially worldbuilding becomes broken.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like the creators in the show had no freaking idea of what the hell they were doing plus you could clearly tell they were on a tight deadline.\\n\r\nI can even predict how the staff of the show was handing the final 5 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: Hey what episode are we on now?\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Ummmm episode 20 I think\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: OH SHIT\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: What the hell. We need to get going as we only have 4 episodes left now. How do we fix this?\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: (Looks for Gundam 00 Movie and Chicken Little Blu Rays and shows them to Creator 1) Have you tried aliens that usually end things.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: But isn\u2019t that cheap.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Do you have a better idea.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: I told you we shouldn\u2019t have spent so much time on individual characters only for them to not develop at all,\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Too late now.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: Screw it. Just add aliens in the series and call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this worst is that if your someone like me who likes goes back to watch earlier episodes of the show to catch certain story/character elements that you missed the first time around. However, in the process of revisiting certain episodes in Darling in the Franxx you will start to see poorly made and directed this show is and it got to a point where you could have removed or shortened certain episodes like for example episode 8 Boy x Girls.\\n\r\nThat episode alone was the beginning of the shows horrible writing and direction because only they did a horrendous job at exploring the theme of puberty but the reasoning for the girls to set the line for the dorms was horrendous and contrived.\\n\r\nThis conflict alone would have been solved in 5 minutes but thanks to this show stupidity it decided to drag it out to point where it becomes contrived with its stupid character drama that had no reason to exist other to preach the theme of puberty to the audience.\\n\r\nGirls in this show I understand you want to protect your bodies but in a war-zone, especially on a scale battle, no one will give a shit about your sex life because in a battle you either kill or be killed.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the whole romance subplot between Kokoro and\u00a0Mitsuru where instead of the show foreshadowing and building up story events. The show decides wastes its time on two episodes on a  terribly contrived romance subplot that characters who have no character chemistry with each other whatsoever. Plus that subplot didn\u2019t even matter because as Hiro decided to pull off a wedding for these two the show decided to take that subplot and flushes it down the toilet by having these characters lose they memories after being captured by the Nines. What made this subplot even worse thanks to a dialogue asspull by Mitsuru in episode 23 where he states that ''even without our memories we can start all over again'' even though the show had made it clear at the end of episode 18 that Kokoro and Mitsuru cannot regain or make new memories with each other whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWords cannot describe of how contrived and poorly executed this subplot was because the only reason why this subplot even exist at all is to showcased the shows fanfic writing. The show already had a lot of fanatic writing, to begin with, but this one takes the cake for being the most insufferable subplot I have ever seen in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't just end there Episode 19 is a complete waste of time. While the show for the last time tried to do its world-building it failed miserably becauae everything else on that episode ended up being pointless. Not to mention that episode quickly devolved to a typical sob backstory for Dr Franxx of how he became the person that he is today thanks to his motivations in the past. However two episodes later he get's killed off Akame Ga Kill style where chararters get they backstories or sob stories before they are killed off one to two episodes later. What's a point of having a backstory of a chararter if your only going to kill them off one to two episodes later? This is atrocious writing and direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is Hiro as a character. Do you remember when where I previously called Hiro an empty husk? Well after episode 15 this sack of shit literally devolved into a freaking Gary Sue who preaches about Hiro. I don\u2019t know about you guys but I have never seen a protagonist in a fictional work that literally started off being horrible empty husk to being an insufferable preachy Gary Sue where every single piece of dialogue is about Zero Two and nothing else. It also gotten to a point where in episode 22 where Hiro would rather choose to save his sex object aka Zero Two in space instead of helping his friends and follow parasyte survive. Some say that his change of personality from being an empty shell is a good thing but for actually writing it's not because at the of the day he went from an empty husk to a preachy Gary Sue who only cares about Zero Two.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on talking about the shows plotholes such as Hiro being able to ride with 9\u03b1 who is also a male character as well not a nine's member, characters not reconsidering that Ikuno hair colour has changed to white, Ichigo being able to plot her mecha even though there is no male pilot, members of APE only wiping out only Kokoro and Misturu memories instead of all the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation members to Zero Two being able to transform into a mecha at the end of episode 23 but since this show doesn't give a damm about writing and directing why I should I even bother.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nAm finally done talking about the show's plot and chararters.\\n\r\nOverall the story was hot garbage, really hot garbage. This felt like an awful Gainax fanfic that was done by a horney 12 year old on fanfic.net. The pacing was awful the character drama was insufferable. I didn\u2019t give a shit about any of the characters and writing/directing especially in the final 5 episodes were god awful. This is one of the worst told stories I had ever had the displeasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nAct IV: The almighty cheap and uninspired production values that have no soul and charm.\\n\r\nSaying that Darling in the Franxx look like shit is a fast understatement because this is by far one of the worst looking and animated shows I have ever seen from this decade.\\n\r\nIt may look decent at first but the more of watch this show you will start to see how lazy animated the show is as it starts to use animation shortcuts to cover up the show ugliness and lazy directing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all horrendously bad and uninspired.\\n\r\nHiro is basically Dominic from Eureka Seven but downgraded.\\n\r\nZero Two who despite being the best-looking character in the show is a downgraded\u00a0Anemone from Eureka Seven with added horns on her face and a bit of makeup.\\n\r\nIchigo looks like a more deformed version of Rem from Re:Zero.\\n\r\nZorome looks like a blander Boruto with that brown hair.\\n\r\nMiku looks more like an Asuka reject that Hideaki Anno decided to throw in the bin. decided to and the rest of the ranged from being uninspired knockoff to being downright awful especially Futoshi who is by far one of the worst characters designs I have ever seen any anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha designs are even worse as they all look like they were done by a horney 12-year-old. Am sure that the same horney 12-year-old designed all the\u00a0Klaxosaur's in this show\u00a0because they all look terrible.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I didn\u2019t like the art is how cheap it looks in terms of color. It\u2019s like someone from secondary school in art class who is not good at art decided to paint over the background, character to even mecha designs forgetting to add detail in the progress. It just makes the anime look cheap and lazy.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started how inconstant the art was as at various times character to even the mechas go off model to a point where the show can look incredibly ugly.\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is just flat out horrendous. Still frames up the ass, characters constantly going off-model, horrible fight choreography, stiff and awkward movement, to even the frame rate at one moment of episode 23 where the show had the frame-rate of 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall visuals were just awful is uninspired and have no charm and soul.\\n\\n\r\nACT V: The somewhat enjoyable soundtrack and great opening and ending themes.\\n\r\nThe music is the best thing about this show. The soundtrack is pretty alright what it was as it does a good job at presenting its setting and tone of the series then again having a good soundtrack doesn't automatically make an anime any good.\\n\r\nThe opening Kiss to Death is a great opening theme that is very catchy that I really enjoyed especially the version 2 of the same opening from episode 16 onwards with the different lyrics.\\n\r\nAll the ending themes are pretty good and catchy in they own ways.\\n\r\nIn short, both the opening and ending themes are good and it\u2019s easily the best thing to ever come out from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nACT VI Finale: The borderline hentai dub acting and audio quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good overall that is filled with talented Seiyuus that did a good job with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is absolutely horrendous. There was not a single good performance in the dub as all the voice actors sound like they were doing a hentai production. Not only that but it makes an already horrendous series almost unwatchable thanks to its shitty audio quality.\\n\r\nAs a person who loves English Dub as a whole watching this show dubbed episode 1-20 was pure misery. One of the worst dubs I have ever heard.\\n\r\nIf you had to pick a choice stick with the sub for this one than again why would you even watch this broken mess of a show, to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nEpilogue.\\n\\n\r\n\u201c\u266b\u266b\u266b\u266b It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down...\u266b\u266b\u266b\u266b\"\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s was Darling in the Franxx.\\n\r\nA broken, pathetically written and directed train-wreck mess of a show that disgustingly plays with it's audience emotions. It has pathetic characters, horrendously written character drama, contrived subplots that have no reason to exists other to pad out time, laughable production values, pathetic world-building, horrendous pacing, poorly executed themes and most importantly this show has no respect of what it trying to homage/rip-off as it keeps on poorly homaging a lot of Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster and Eureka 7 elements without having any understanding of what made those shows great in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the music there is nothing and I mean NOTHING redeemable or good about this series whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst animes I ever had the displeasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to say this. When even the worst mecha shows like Gundam Seed Destiny, Brain Powered and Aldnoah Zero where despite them being more flawed they have more things going for them and manages to outclass you in certain aspects you know you have screwed up on a scale that is immeasurable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to a good mecha show that features great character drama and great story elements go watch Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann or Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from Studio Trigger? Watch Little Witch Academia Space Patrol Luluco and Kill la Kill.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from A1 Pictures? Watch Shinsekai Yori, Space Brothers, and Magi.\\n\r\nAvoid this show like the plague.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 0.5/10",

            "content": "For the better half of my life, I have been looking for an anime series where bunch of kids --who don't know what sexual intercourse is-- fight against tensai super robot power rangers inside settings which has plot for 6 episodes, but still lasts for 24: Filling the remaining air time with b-grade melodramatic past stories, and current time with slice of life soap opera which looks like the anime version of Jersey Shore. For such a specific request to be filled, I had almost lost all hope. Then my boy Trigger arrived to town and not only did this exact thing, but filled theseries with epic symbolism. Basically, whenever anything happens, it is a sexual innuendo about relationships, hugging, kissing and dicks. Really, thanks. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual story centers around our ten kids who are trying to find their soulmate/significant other/person with whom they share the best body compatibility with. They do this by piloting mecha in the pairs of two and fighting against these things called Klaxowhatever. Klaxosaur, just like everything and anything else, is a reference. If you remove xo from the name, you get the combination of klasa and ur, klasa standing for \"class\" in polish - and xo obviously meaning hugs and kisses - giving us klaxosaur as: \"U R hugs and kisses class.\" Same thing can be said about the actual title of this series. Darling in the FranXX basically standing for Darling in the Fran hugs hugs. The whole \"two parties fight against each others until one collapses\" is initially just a debate over should you remain loyal to your significant other and are hugs truly enough. The robots think it is not enough, and the whole series is basically our characters realizing the same little by little. This is, indeed, the plot of this series. Pretty cool, huh. \\n\\n\r\nThere are in total of ten main characters here (in case you forgot what you read 17 seconds ago). By 10 main characters, I mean we have 3 actual characters and the remaining 7 are filler people. The characters are just great. Oni girl is basically a whore who is looking for her prince charming. I musn't runway guy does the opposite his name suggests. And the third wheel dude and the most potential prince charming... exists. I call this trio The Cuck Squad, by the way. Rest of the \"characters\" are so much filler I believe the thought process behind creating them was something like: \"Hmmm. we need more people here. Let's see........ One fat guy? Yes, one fat guy coming in.......... girl who wears glasses? ...... Oh yes, f**k yes.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe production is based Trigger. Not exactly as ADHD as Kill la Kill nor a masterpiece from every aspect like Inferno Cop, but at least doesn't ruin the series like they did with Uchuu Patrol Luluko and Ninja Slayer. The OST could use some Tomatodermewhatever they called the band in KlK, and some tedious German language vocals would be great addition to put in the mix, but otherwise I was pleased to get a confirmation that every Trigger anime from now on will be the exact same thing production wise as all the rest have been. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, my expectations were very mixed. I heard so much praise and flaming, and after watching it, I have to conclude that this series can be liked and disliked for infinite different reasons. In one way, the series is a clusterfuck, the seasonal shitstorm, the trainwreck and sum of all wagons. This obviously makes it an obligatory watch for every critic so they can hit it with 1/10 and call the worst thing ever because once again you can criticize FranXX for thousand and one things. On the other hand, Darling is often so ridiculous that it can offer enormous entertainment value with ironic viewing. All you need is a sense of humor and some chill. The drama, the cute and comfy stuff and the happy moments will serve those are ready to take them for what they are. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final verdict: Critics and the likes can write thousand pages long analysis of all the things that are wrong in this one, people with sense of humor laugh their asses off, and people who approach it with more \"casual\" and open mindset will enjoy this show for what it is. This series has something for each and everyone. If a series like that is not a masterpiece, then I do not know what is. 10/10. \\n",

            "content": "It's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. It has a lot of things acting against. Yeah, butt-piloted mechs are silly. Yeah, the mech designs themselves are like Voltron had a bad hair day. Yes, much of the plot is composed of teen melodrama. And yes, the show clearly wears its heart on its sleeves, drawing inspiration from the last two decades of mecha anime. \r\nIt's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. Why do I think it's worth the time? \r\nWhere Darling shines is in how all of the best parts of its disparate inspirations and intrigues blend together. Clearly drawing fromthe names most anime fans are familiar with - Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagan, Evangelion, and the like - Darling draws on a dramatic flair while slowly drip-feeding the viewer with a slow-burn bit of world-building. What are Klaxosaurs exactly? Why do they want Plantation? Why are there rarely adults around? Why does the youth have to fight for the Plantation, and why do they have to be in pairs? Each episode explores each of these topics, little by little, further paving the world with information, both for the characters and the viewers themselves. What will this result in? That depends on the direction of the series. But very similar to Evangelion itself - with it's seemingly random, monster-of-the-week styled Angel battles - less is more, and the intrigue behind why things are happening leaves the viewer eager to learn more about the odd, dystopic world around the characters, so that the dots can slowly be connected over the larger arc of the series. \\n\\n\r\nBy deliberately obfuscating the reasons behind the larger plot at play, this allows the show to play out as a character drama. It is explained quite explicitly that the main cast is \"different\" from other mech pilots in this world. Thus, in a Breakfast Club mishmash of characters concepts thrown together, the show gleefully begins to layer out each individual's backstory. \\n\\n\r\nMain characters like Hiro are probably the least interesting, acting as a surrogate for the viewer to this world. But even then, his leadership and charisma to the rest of the crew bonds them all together. He's not just some faceless Kirito, and also certainly doesn't have the depth of someone like Shinji; but he proves that he is a unique soul of his own, with goals and ambitions (even if they mostly are obsessively regarding one character). 02 is clearly an anti-hero, someone the viewer is meant to hate, and the caring attitude of Hiro is the only thing that binds her abrasive personality down. While I don't particularly like their relationship - 02 is quite toxic/abusive and definitely ain't best girl - having Hiro act as a foil to her combat abilities and personality which lacks control allows the two to operate in junction with each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters come into play with their own interrelationships. If you haven't seen the octahedron memes, those constant inter-dependencies between characters come into play in various ways to further develop both the characters themselves as well as for climactic moments of trial during the plot. Two people aren't getting along because of teen melodrama? Mech stops working, everyone might die. Two characters get into a petty argument? They can't pilot anymore, and it ripples through the morale of the rest of the group. Certain characters are infatuated with others rather than their own partner? The team dynamics suddenly switch, both affecting the combat portions, the relationships between characters, and heightening the drama itself. Darling is very good at showing how seemingly petty melodrama can resonate through a large cast of varied characters, who have shared goals, but different investments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, and sound barely need to be discussed. All are stellar, and nothing less than should be expected from a TRIGGER production. Having the talents of A-1 pictures to help boost the fluid action while also enhancing the quieter and more emotional scenes, which ring ever more gorgeous as time goes on. An epic fight with a giant monster has all the bombast you expect from a high-octane mecha anime, while a character trailing their crush's footsteps in the sand is able to draw out both happiness as well as a painful twang of melancholy. The music has a particular orchestral style that, although similar to many other series, has a certain pomp reminiscent of Kill La Kill, giving each scene their appropriate emotional flair. The first ED, \"Torikago,\" is especially good, ending the early episodes with a strong refrain to deep you intrigued in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe slowest episodes in the first half of the series begin to drag down the show, as it slogs through run-of-the-mill beach and bathhouse episodes. And although there are no compliments that can be given to these inductions into the series, it is nice that the show at least stays true to the characters still being developed over time. Even in these slight moments that can seem irrelevant and purposeless in the larger scheme, the deeper commitment to drip-feeding the audience with ever-expanding social connections and worldbuilding pay off as the series begins to shift gears into the end of the first cour. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. But pushing beyond some of the trappings of its genre, and letting the world and character development continue to expand, it is quick to see why this show is so rewarding not for its EPIC HYPE, but for its dense character evolution over time. This is a show mired in feelings and emotion, and the scenes within it are best appreciated through the lens of an emotional viewer: someone who tries to feel out a scene rather than logically analyzing it, and understanding that you aren't meant to know the details, but are instead asked to let the world around you shift your feelings, just like the shifting loyalties and persuasions of the characters within.",

            "content": "I decided to write a review after episode 6 as this series keep getting better and better after each episode for me. If they keep this up until the very last episode I will definitely make this anime as one of my recommendation to people who want to watch some quality mechs anime.\r\nStory (9):\r\nThe story itself about the pilots of the mech, their relationship with other pilot and I think about finding their purpose in life other than fighting with their mechs. The beginning of the story itself is quite typical. The usual boy meet mysterious girl (Eureka 7 did this, Evangelion did this, CometLucifer did this, Code Geass did this, etc). However it is by no mean bad, I love Eureka 7 and if this executed well I might love this one too. A the series progress I think the story improve and keep getting better. It has enough mysteries to keep me wanting more and looked forward to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10):\\n\r\nOne of the best part of this series is its actions scene, episode 6's fighting scene is so awesome. The duo animation studios work really well in here. There is no inconsistency in the animation. The animation is fluid, the character, the mech as expected of A1 Picture and Trigger working together.\\n\r\nThe action simply the BEST in this season for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9):\\n\r\nThere is one OST that play in every epic moment (The climax in episode 6 for example) which I really love. Torikago and Kiss of Death is one of my favourite ED and OP song this season aside of Sora Yori Mo Tooi Basho's and Yuru Camp's. I am waiting for the second cour ED and OP song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\r\nAt first I hate how Hiro's act, but as the series progress up until episode 6, He developed and He begin to grow on me. On other hand I really like Zero Two since the beginning of the series. Zerome and Miku is also a pair  that really memorable to me especially Zerome because of his arrogance. Some memorable character for me are enough for me to give this part a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nAs a mechs fans mysel, I watched a lot of mechs series, some which I enjoy some other not so. This one is one of the mechs series I really enjoy.The battle scene, the character, the story.\\n\r\nI am looking forward for new episode every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 10 =  9.2):\\n\r\nThis anime keep getting better and better and I hope It will always be. Give this series a chance especially if you like mechs. Don't let the excessive amount of fans service put you off, this anime has a lot more to offer. For me, as of now this is on my top 3 for this season. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never watch an anime with mechs on them though I heard them and see some but never actually watch it. This will be the first one, and as I can say, its the best one. Though it might change as episodes progress but I hope not.\r\nSo for the story, well, its great though the way they control the mechs will be much better if they just rely on batteries xD. The story focus on their so called Parasites which are pilots of the mechs. They think that their whole life was depend on piloting a mech even though theres alot of things worth yourlife, well thats what the anime tells me, it differ to person to person.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, its actually good. The quality really suit the modern age. Even they still using  keypads on their phones. The animation is smooth, the animation is great as the art style it self.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, well I can say its plain but its still good for my ears. There wasn't that much battle scene yet in the anime so I can't really say if it needs to change its music when action scene took place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime was relatable. And the MC is the one I can relate to. Other characters are also memorable, as I meet different person with the same characteristic as this supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, well, its really fun to watch. Most of the scene I watch are very fun mostly because on how they control their mechs and how they talk about on riding them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime score an all out of 10. It also has potential. I recommend watching it. I just don't get it why they don't put Romance aswell Action on the genre\\n\\n\r\nAdditional!\\n\r\n- So After I watch Ep.7, I wasn't expecting anything like that but even though its a beach episode it turns out to be improtant (For my prespecrive) as character development for Ichigo somehow started here aswell a story on why Humanity become something like this.",

            "content": "I'll be as fair and objective as possible here, additionally, this review will be practically completely spoiler-free! \r\nStory: 3 (Poor)\r\nArt: 8 (Very Good)\r\nSound: 6 (Fair)\r\nCharacter: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nEnjoyment: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nOverall: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nSome can be accredited to its massive hype up until its release, but also to the objective analysis of the different parts that make up this anime. I will be delving into the different parts that I rated it on, and explaining why I chose that number. Hopefully you can come to your own conclusion about whether you'd want to watch this or not, or whether you agree with me or not, but regardless;\r\nLet's getright into the parts:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nThere is simply no other way of putting it. The story follows utterly generic story cliches that have been done many times before. Whilst I understand this solely doesn't invalidate the anime, the sheer amount of plot holes and evidences of terrible writing does. You don't get fed a lot of information about the world, and not even in a purposeful way; whilst mystery is nice, it requires a balance of given information to keep you interested in the mysteriousness. Darling in the FranXX, however, lacks any mysteriousness as it also lacks information to begin with. You, the viewer, feel very lost watching it, as you try and piece together the characters to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a beach episode, which logically doesn't make much sense in the story and was extremely shoehorned into it even though prior statements showed that a \"beach episode\" is highly unlikely to be able to occur. These changes in the story (ie. inputting a sole fanservice episode, even when the story would dictate otherwise) show that the writer's intentions were not even towards forwarding or developing the story. Perhaps money, or a sickening desire to make fanservice, were the real reasons behind the completely-lacking-plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe world does look interesting, however, but this is more accredited to the art, since the world isn't explained at all, which is a shame to put such art to waste. It's like seeing something amazing that really sticks out in a painting, but never being able to find the true reason why that object was placed there, or what it is - this is the only kind of intrigue you get about the story; an annoying kind. In the first few episodes, the story progresses alarmingly quickly. This is given to the fact that the story skips over things that might seem important simply to move to the next big plot twist, however, the plot twists are extremely predictable. The next few episodes actually completely copy each other, with the exact same kinds of things happening in the story, repeated 3 episodes in a row. For example, A happens, then B happens by surprise, and C has to fix it. It became extraordinarily apparent that the next episode would follow suit, and I physically predicted the episode before it happened. Again, it copied the same template, which was so painfully obvious I had no enjoyment watching the episode (as with all of the episodes).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, there are definitely animes with worse stories. There are plotholes in many major publications, but regardless is still worth mentioning due to their glaring obviousness in Darling in the FranXX. If you don't think about the story, and just watched the fight scenes, I would admit that it would be an enjoyable watch. However, this does show the precedent example of how the context of the story actually somehow makes the intermittent (and rare) fight scenes worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is a weak point. In some later episodes, plot holes and problems become severely apparent. \"The plot\" is used to do practically impossible things, with little expectation. You actually feel quite dumb, as the anime is practically assuming you wouldn't notice the plot holes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe distinct 'Trigger style' is what initially drew a lot of people to this anime, as the name carries good connotations for most. Kill la Kill, Kiznaiver and Little Witch Academia all carried the Trigger name, and were massively successful, so it's without a doubt that there were already high expectations. Unfortunately, this is where its let down. Sometimes the Trigger style art is obviously 'switched out' or at least touched by A1 Pictures in some way, most notably on a lot of the fanservice moments. Really makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of that, the artwork is nice. The colours go well together, for example, Zero Two's mecha Strelezia, has a great contrasting colour scheme. The world vibrantly comes to life, especially during large-scale scenes. Unfortunately, the action scenes are a let down, a tiny bit, but still illustrate the battles quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, made apparent by the beach episode, the characters are oddly disproportional. Younger, smaller characters have massive breasts which are completely impossible for their stature, yet are shoehorned into the episodes, whilst the \"flat-chested\" characters (basically anyone without C+ chests) feel bad about it. With no place in this anime, it becomes amazingly jarring when you see those parts of the character designs, and completely understand the artist's intentions behind the character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there isn't much else to say for the art. The colours and art style are pleasant to look at, but are let down by the blatant use of disproportionate characters for more sex appeal, and some fight scenes not being as fluid as they could be. I also have to deduct a point for pointless cinematic black bars appearing randomly. I thought they helped make the fights more cinematic, for some reason, but I saw them appear even during random conversations. It confused me and detracted my attention away from the content itself. Still, a solid piece to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThis one was harder to rate. At not one point did I consider the sound to feel 'off' except for, more often than not, the music. Sounds for everything else is practically pristine - its powerful, pristine, and matches whatever is going on, and at whatever scale, too (some objects in the world are large, for example, and sounds given off match that well). However, I noticed several times where the music used did not fit the situation or feel of the scene at all. Usually it was with the music during, and around, fight scenes. Some times it would play utterly unfitting music that actually distracted you from the scene itself, which is something that shouldn't happen in any anime, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nSince it doesn't stick out, and is let down several times by unfitting music, it isn't amazing, but nothing to complain horribly about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nWell, in addition to the parts of the review that talked about the story, the characters fit in next. They are bland, to say the least. The most relatable character for most viewers is probably Goro - he's down-to-earth and overall a nice guy. Unfortunately, he is not the protagonist. The protagonist, Hiro, is a carbon-copy of Kirito (from SAO), but objectively worse and actually lacking any form of personality. He makes dumb decisions, not even for the sake of 'its a mistake', but completely illogical. For example, there are multiple times where the conversation is turning towards a point where we might actually learn something about a character's viewpoint/feelings, but in both situations, Hiro, gets distracted by 'something' (aka an event that was shoehorned into the plot, completely coincidental, and would never happen between people talking, ever), and you completely lose the buildup. I would suppose, however, that I do like the side characters, as a positive. They are very relatable, and actually react to conversation in a much more realistic sense, unlike the protagonist. If you are okay and can deal with a complete self-insert basic protagonist, and can see past him to see the more interesting characters, it would be bearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the weakest point of the anime. It's such a shame for characters with strong visual representation to be so poorly-written. They fulfill tropes to a disgusting degree, although that can be argued to help the story by letting the reader's instinct about particular tropes (eg. the fat guy eats a lot) to extrapolate information to help construct a context. Apart from this, it's difficult to get any more information about the characters other than what's scarcely fed to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are weak; some are strongly relatable, but you easily begin to realise that their small screen-time is jarring and disturbing. One character introduced in Episode 5 for about 5 seconds is seen again in 6, for about the best of 30 seconds. Even in this short space of time, they already give off an amazing air and vibe of mystery, with me desiring to want more. Why couldn't I feel this for all the other protagonists and side characters? It really shows the shortcomings in the character development, compared to other animes by the same studios, for example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's hard to be objective about this part, so it will be subjective. Darling in the FranXX is mediocre at best, but terrible at worst. Its most marketable character, the pink-haired 002, is arguably the most well-known character due to her distinct look compared to the other main characters, but she is wound up in this odd plot. There is no point that you want more answers about her and her lore simply due to an air of mystery, you are fed information intermittently, and you piece together bits, but never get any real answers for her, or the other characters for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basic at best. It's a generic \"us vs. them\" story for starters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but is orchestrated in such a horrific manner that it becomes a letdown. Things make no sense, plotholes become obvious, the plot itself makes drastic changes that are absurdly unrealistic, and ultimately results in a disturbed experience as you wonder 'Why? How?' to almost everything.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the sex appeal appalling fanservice. Random scenes of close-up bodily parts, obvious insecurity from 'flat-chested' (as I mentioned before, who are practically not even flat-chested) characters to the rest, disproportionate body types, and such really detract from the rest of the art. Whilst the enemies, allies, and world itself look beautiful at times, seeing a character with massive breasts that are too big for her body swinging them about (which I may add, is whilst wearing a skintight suit, therefore them 'bouncing' is impossible) for no reason really shows the creator's intentions. It genuinely seems like, most of the time, the creator is gearing for the next posterior camera angle rather than the next reveal in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nTo which I will go on to say that each 'reveal' that you're geared up to be somewhat excited for is a massive letdown. Either it follows the same archetype of there being some sort of 'unseen problem' which is ultimately fixed by the power of ____ (insert feeling here). One part I remember, is where another team of characters we've never seen before had to fight some enemies, and I actually connected to them more than I had any other of the main characters. Their situation was realistic. They acted realistically. At no point were they saying cringey lines.\\n\\n\r\nTo mention 'cringey lines' is funny too, as a lot of the words are unnecessarily replaced with innuendo-esque words. \"Kissing\" is used a lot to refer to a certain event in the anime, as well as \"Docking\" etc. Again, it seems too intentional to really take the anime seriously at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a shame. The anime looked good from the trailers and screenshots, reveals and character designs. Hearing 'Trigger' really set people into expecting a lot, but the end result is a massive letdown. You may wish to watch this if you can see past the problems above, but I doubt there are a lot of people who can actually be honest to themselves and actually admit that it is genuinely a mediocre-to-bad anime at most. Similar anime that do their job properly would be Evangelion, Aldnoah.Zero, and Sidonia no Kishi.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review.",

            "content": "!! POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING !!\r\nNOTICE: These reviews will each be episode by episode (updated on Mondays), but at the end of this shows airing, I will finally type up a full cumulative review on the show.\r\nNow let's get into Episode 18's review.\r\nStory: 7 (last week: 7)\r\nThus far we have had many ups and downs in the lives of these Parasite pilots. This past week we had what seemed to be an up but it came with the inevitable down we all knew would have to happen. We are slowly learning that everyone is just the APE's pets besides Squad 13 who start to have theirown ideas. These ideas are quickly shut down. We also know they can somehow destroy a large quantity of life from space and to be honest, it's probably some sort of laser (just because that is what it always is). We also learn of a goal of the APE's and higher up humans, to rid themselves of their bodies like some sort of god. This will be interesting from here on out and the squad probably won't be allowed to tell Kokoro or Mitsuru about each other and what really happened. I wonder if Hachi will ever get his emotions back. We see the struggle of him wanting to help the kids but he can't and the same with Nana. I don't see Ikuno's lesbianism affecting the story much if we are being honest.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9 (last week: 9)\\n\r\nI love the art in this show. This is done by A-1 and Trigger. What more could you ask for art wise? I love this style although they do nothing special. If you look at the FranXX, they each are done very well and with a solid color palettes that show their personalities. But also, if you look at this environments and background arts, no space is wasted. The fact that the FranXX's resemble the female pilots is also a pretty cool concept, while it may just be so the audience knows which is which without needing to memorize each pair and their FranXX. The OP's and ED's are very well done and I actually really like both.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9 (last week: 9)\\n\r\nThe sound in this show is nothing special by any means but it isn't bad. They are careful to not use the same sound twice for different types of characters, which is often done in A-1 productions. The sounds of ambience and chaos are balanced fairly well but can be a bit abrupt at times. I think the sound is the same but the sounds of fighting and dialogue are balanced well. The fighting noises aren't way down, and the dialogue isn't extremely loud during fight scenes and the same goes for it vice versa. Plus, the voice actors are paired with characters very skillfully. I prefer the sub VA\u2019s and just based on how well they fit each role. I raised my score in this category by one because I really do love each VA and their roles. They each are paired incredibly well. The new OP and ED are freaking amazing and I love them both so much more then the first, hence the bumping up by 1 point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (last week: 7)\\n\r\nWe see our Parasite's relationships go further than desired by the APE's and thus they had to be reindoctrinated (Kokoro and Mitsuru). They don't remember each other so I wonder what will happen between them from here on out. Also, how will the rest of the squad go on? Every one of them, knows what happened but most likely won't tell Kokoro or Mitsuru what happened for one reason or another. These characters struggle with individual thought because the consequences for independence are so great. I wonder if this will have an effect on partner pairings and if they will just go back to their original ones since they have no recollection of each other. Also, Ikuno is a lesbian so that'll be interesting although I just think that it got thrown into there (although who didn't see it coming) because each episode focuses on two or three characters and their problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (last week: 10)\\n\r\nI really freaking enjoy this show. I love everything about it. Over the course of these 7 weeks, the show has just gotten better and better. I just love watching it every single week which can be hard to do for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (last week: 8)\\n\r\nI recommend this show because of the fun characters, interesting story, and especially Zero Two. You won't regret your decision unless you have a very specific taste and hate these types of shows in general.",

            "content": "First of all, all the negative reviews here have been done when only the 6th episode has released, so they are suffering from a SEVERE lack of information to even properly judge this anime. \r\nIf you consider up to the current episode, ep 15 right now, this anime is a MASTERPIECE. There simply is no other way to put it. It mixes elements of romance, action, suspense, and mystery perfectly to create the ultimate plot. The character development is INSANELY strong, and we get to know the preferences and backgrounds of almost all the main characters. This leads to a plot that makes sense andis enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter dynamics are amazing, the plot is terrific, the foreshadowed symbols and recurring themes are all top-notch. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a must watch and will probably be remembered as a classic.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First off, i have no clue how to write review, but here's what i think about this anime. I don't usually share my thoughts like this, but i've changed lately\r\nIn my opinion the anime definitelly deserves more than #500 ranking. To be honest, i'm giving it 10/10 overall just so it gets more ranking.\r\nI love anime like this, when i started watching anime for first time, i wanted to see a anime like this, where couples fight. A true anime couple. When i first started watching anime, i watched the boo hoo bad anime SAO and in fact, i liked SAO's first few episodes, Justbecause of Kirito and Asuna teamworking, to take down the first SAO boss. But then they split up and stuff, and SAO became bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 There's still more to learn, but for sixth episode it's good enough. I like how the anime explained why Hiro's squad is the only ones who have colorful mechas and nicknames.\\n\\n\r\nI was always picky about what anime to like, because i used to talk to a friend, that liked literally every bad anime, no matter what ranking MAL gave it, so i always just skipped through low ranked anime, thinking that they're bad, but i changed lately. I'm giving now 10/10 even to a show that's got #500 ranking at this moment. I think it deserves more than #500.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 Well it's not some super art masterpiece like Violet evergarden, but again it's good enough. The animation's not that bad, i think we should leave 10/10 for anime like Violet evergarden. \\n\\n\r\nIt's propably hard not to see me as one of these triggered fanboys, after putting in 10/10 overall just like that. I'm self aware of that. I knew that's how i'd look like, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 I like both ED and OP, there's sometimes violin playing in background too, that's nice. Violin's nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 I love how Zero Two is so close to Hiro right from the beginning, it's kind of charming. I don't mind Hiro being unconfident, there's space for him earning the confidence, as anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThis couple kinda reminds me of Horo and Lawrence! Horo and Zero Two are so alike. Why haven't i seen someone mention this before.\\n\r\nHoro and Lawrence are propably best couple out there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Don't see why not put 10/10, there were some cringy moments, and cringe is always not enjoyable, but whatever i enjoyed it.\\n\r\nI love how the monsters/enemies are all in difference shapes, always have different abilities, you never know what to expect of them. That's fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 I don't think it's masterpiece, we should leave 10/10 for the true masterpieces, but i think it deserves more than just #500. So i'm gonna give it 10/10. Hope it gets better rank.\\n\\n\r\nI should've though propably waited a while longer before posting this, because of two reasons: I finished watching episode 6 just 30 minutes ago, so my review is easily affected by emotions, and second reason is because the anime is still not finished. \\n\r\nWow, episode 7 sucked. Literally nothing happened. am i watching One Piece, or a Naruto filler, or what. \\n\r\nDamn, episode 8 sucked too, i dislike these \"relaxation\" episodes so far, i'd rather prefer if they kept advancing the story asap. If it continues like this, i'm gonna regret making this review tbh,\\n\r\nKinda funny, people will propably hate this review, if i didn't change lately, i would've hated it too.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that the purporse of me giving it 10/10 overall is literally just to increase it's rating. Don't know if this is legal or not.\\n\\n\r\nReviewing a unfinished anime is propably easier than reviewing a finished one, it has IMO potential to become either one of the bad anime, or a above average 8.30 anime, at this point it's propably just average one that i taken liking to. I have no clue what \"hype train\" is everyone talking about, i found this anime randomly just a day ago.\\n\r\nAnyway, i've written what i wanted to write.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cHow can I become popular?\u201d\r\nDarling in the FranXX is a sad attempt at creating or rather, replicating a legacy act. It took inspiration from what popular shows like Evangelion and Gurren Lagann did, without understanding a thing about what made them work. It tries to expand on ideas without understanding how to sell them, let alone incorporate them meaningfully. It wants to craft a setting to draw us in and make us remember it but instead, FranXX falls flat on its hormone-driven face. It\u2019s a brilliant showcase on why the insular nature of anime writers & directors is detrimental. It is the definition of ananime that tries to pander to the entire anime community, and as a result, FranXX lost the chance to craft a work of art worthy of being remembered. What we have now is a vulgar yet ambitious mess whose only remarkable features are its volume of ineptitude and its interesting but horrendously executed aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, what does FranXX\u2019s sex aesthetic contribute to the narrative? Nothing good. Sure, every conflict deals with the idea of sex, gender, and couples in some way, but the visuals don't remotely contribute to this. Additionally, the world-building that stemmed from this is as questionably handled as it is derivative. Yes, Neon Genesis Evangelion did similar things, from the concept and world to having its mechs be drenched in symbolism. However, we get to what separates the two: humanity and focus.\\n\\n\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most human anime ever made. It constantly delves into the psyches of each character in a way that feels both relatable and real, while exploring their hobbies and how these people bounce off each other and affect each other personally. They were in the face of a war against deadly creatures, and the focus was placed on how this, their upbringing, and their conflicts stemming from this affect each other. This happened because Eva was written and directed by a legendary man and nerd who went outside, talked with people a lot and had a social life with them, and suffered through personal, relatable problems. The director and writer also had a sense of focus, making sure each world-building element made sense and retained consistency in the logic of the show, and that each character was consistent, with gradual mental declines that felt natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow, look at this show, made by someone who no doubt worked to get here but is as much an unknown figure as most other directors in this insular, borderline unsustainable industry. While he's capable of delving into his characters' upbringings, no one is written well enough for us to care. Part of why is because instead of relying on substantial interactions and meaningful introspections, FranXX takes the Re:Zero route of letting these autists shout their pathetically written and constructed feelings to each other Light Novel monologue style while letting flashy directing choices do the rest, often during contrived scenarios meant to incite drama with the most hideous of dialogue. To put this into perspective, episode 1 does this 5 or 6 times with its main character. Unlike say: Fate/Extra: Last Encore, this show isn't oozing with the kind of style to make it feel natural, instead only busting out the interesting presentation as a borderline disingenuous attempt at enhancing or explaining emotions. LE also delves into the introspection aspect far better and shows a superior portrayal of broken people raised by a horrible, controlling system that sends its inhabitants to fight for their lives. Additionally, it better demonstrates how that affects several of them once they\u2019re out fighting and when they\u2019re part of the system. FranXX can't even make a compelling character to save its life, let alone a character that truly feels real. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with awful post-Eva works such as Brain Powerd or De;Vadasy, you may have found these problems all too familiar. Another common post-Eva trait is the ability to have a general idea of what to explore without any idea on how to make it work. Brain Powerd focused on trying to do the concepts and relationships of Eva backward and did so incoherently with a script to reflect that as they had to make up new terms and ideas out of nowhere that don't fit or make any sense. It decides to copy the actions of Evangelion and the narrative structure of Gurren Lagann while failing to create a coherent world with believable characters to care about. The disastrous second half more than cements this fact in several ways. \\n\\n\r\nI won't cover everything, but let's start at the top. The world-building in FranXX is among the worst I have ever seen, delving into its symbolism with little regard as to how it can make sense beyond vague setup, much like with the direction of the narrative as a whole. So much about the setting and lore counters itself, even outside of the parts that already make no sense. This anime\u2019s inability to show us the necessary information for certain events to have possibly taken place have resulted in monumental plot holes to make matters even worse. The FranXX mechs make no sense in literally any aspect, and the implications in them manage to assassinate the already badly executed relationship between Hiro and Zero Two. Let\u2019s not even mention how hideous the final 11 episodes were, especially in regards to FranXX's lore. Even then, the beginning was atrocious too, what with the awful love triangle, episodes 6 and 8, the aforementioned world-building, and the fact that most of the characters are obnoxious, worthless, needlessly hateful, and surprisingly inconsistent caricatures at best. The show has such little respect for them that its primary mascot character Zero Two, constantly switches on a dime simply for the sake of creating drama and steering the show in a planned direction.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we wrap up, we best look at the audiovisual side of things, as this show still manages to trip over itself in this regard, though it doesn\u2019t do so as hard as it does with the writing. The fembot designs are all around the passable range with nothing being truly awesome or toy-worthy. The creatures and settings have nice colors but nothing is particularly well designed, from creature to character -with the possible exception of Zero Two-. Hiro\u2019s design is especially awful for obvious reasons, and several of the supporting cast designs are eerily similar to certain Eva characters. The outfits are also mediocre to bad, often with awkward \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d logos for no good reason, and whenever the show tries to do something with dynamic cameras -sometimes even when they don\u2019t- the frames get cut in half, from a normal amount to what feels like half, if not less. The premiere episode alone is the perfect indicator. It thankfully doesn\u2019t happen too often when it does, the viewing experience becomes a rough one. As mentioned, the directorial idea of messing with the aspect ratios haphazardly or for the sake of emotion and whatnot is borderline laughable as well. Additionally, there are several scenes where no one has any facial features, and the luckily infrequent CGI here is subpar at best. This collaboration between A-1 Pictures, Studio \u201csaving anime\u201d Trigger, and eventually, A-1\u2019s new subsidiary, Cloverworks, was definitely shaky, even from a visual standpoint. It\u2019s not like the show was badly animated or anything, and the environments were done rather nicely. There were just several variables that kept this work from functioning greatly on a visual level. One last one to mention is how the fight scenes manage to be completely unexciting, with little real flow or impact to anything, or many truly good bits of animation or spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the music, none of the background tracks stick out, even if none are necessarily bad or ill-fitting -outside of one rap song at the start of episode 8-. There are some triumphant tracks in the first quarter that are good, but that\u2019s as far as that goes. The opening theme \"KISS OF DEATH\" by Mika Nakashima x Hyde, is certainly unique, even if not to my taste. The ending themes are all numerous, and none of them are particularly good or memorable. Sure, some are better songs than others, but none of them are really going to stick with you in the same vein that Gurren Lagann ED 2 or Neon Genesis Evangelion\u2019s ending themes did. Somehow, all of this makes the music the most competent part of the entire show, which is mortifying.\\n\\n\r\nThe most embarrassing thing is that the show not only tried its best to become popular, but it did so whilst having its staff being treated like shit by its \u201cloyal fans\u201d like it was the second coming of Re:Zero. There was ambition here but little thought beyond popularity and mimicry with a spin. One could argue this is propaganda for the Japanese to have kids and fix their under-population problem, but that doesn\u2019t exactly fix anything, or even help give the show any real identity. Such a shame since, again, the ideas present here, if given more thought, could have turned into a fun dystopian action show that explored its characters in interesting ways while being a meaningful allegory for sex and puberty. It isn\u2019t like the show doesn\u2019t have its moments of sincerity or even a visible narrative through-line either, so the potential was obviously there. It's just that so much of what it did would require a complete and utter reworking in order to even become salvageable. Alas, we get this broken, tiresome replica to forget about once the memes are over.",

            "content": "It was the 14th episode. I was wracking my brain trying to figure out what exactly was causing the fans to go livid. Given what happened in the last few episodes the actions of a certain character who is taking all the hate seem justified to me, albeit selfish. I tried reading the rants people wrote online and ended up not connecting with them, to the point where I decided to re-watch all 14 episodes fearing I\u2019ve lost my sensibilities. Then it hit me - I was looking at this series all wrong. It was never about mecha, or relationship drama, nor was it aboutchildren vs adults. No, the actual theme is more sophisticated, and way more profound, and that is Darling in the FranXX is first and foremost about waifuwars. Only when you make this realization will you be able to put things into perspective, and understand why the fan base react the way they do towards any episode.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get down to brass tacks. If you\u2019re watching this for the mecha, you\u2019ll be disappointed. While the struggle between human and Klaxosaur is the pivotal aspect of the setting, it falls apart too easily on scrutiny. The show is unbearably stingy on details to the point that it\u2019s fair to doubt if the Klaxosaurs are even a threat to humanity, in contrast to Eva or TTGL, shows that DitF clearly take inspirations from.  Everything about the fights is underwhelming. The effort put in mecha designs alone makes it clear who they have their spotlights on. The choreography is terrible and fights are agonizingly bland. Rather than a highlight, they feel like a chore to watch, it feels like I\u2019m being forced to read a light novel because it contains a vital piece of information to understand something else I\u2019m actually intrigued about. The music that accompanies them lacks punch, feels awkward and is sometimes mistimed. The monster designs on the whole are uninspired garbage; quite a few of them are honestly copypasted from Gunbuster. I want to be more verbose here but really, it\u2019s not worth the effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe character drama aspect is the main draw from the creator standpoint. It\u2019s also bad, but this deserves more explanation because unlike the mecha aspect, the issue is not low effort. In its attempt to copy Eva it they\u2019ve misjudged what they needed to do. Despite having a way larger cast, they saw it fit to waste so much time in the second half of the first cour on episodes that can be arguable described as filler. Ep 7-8 are damn near needless and can be condensed into 5 minutes with the remaining time put to better use in fleshing out the world or characters more satisfyingly. The character-focused episodes were piled continuously one after another without proper, chronological justification, before jumping back into the main story, which makes it hard to appreciate the character development following these episodes. Because these lasted a total of 5 episodes, it\u2019s impossible to ignore how badly they screw up the pacing. It feels like an afterthought, which is a shame because I really liked one of the episodes. What\u2019s odder is perhaps the character they\u2019ve decided not to focus on; 14 episodes in and Ichigo, the team leader and main rival for the glorious Nippon dangler have yet to receive any proper characterization from her POV beyond some snippets here and there, which is odd given her background as the childhood friend love interest (something that usually makes fans instantly hard). There\u2019s this vagueness as to why she is attached to Hiro, and throughout the series so far (especially in context with episode 9) the creators are thoroughly unsympathetic, providing minimal reason to persuade us that she has a fighting chance. She\u2019s created solely to lose and make 02 look good in the process (they might pull a Nia here, but that\u2019s still a win by definition). It\u2019s a crying shame because Ichigo\u2019s the closest thing to a rational but still human character the show has. In the notorious episode 14, she attempted a Hail Mary pass to win her lover (reminds me somewhat of Setsuna from White Album 2); her action was selfish, bold and completely unexpected, yet it feels like a proper progression of her character. I applauded it, even if it wasn\u2019t reciprocated, but apparently to most viewers she became \u201cThe Worst Anime Character Ever Created\u201d, a rapist, and a manipulative bitch all at the same time while 02 gets all the sobby eyes despite her comparatively similar actions, thanks to her tragic past.\\n\\n\r\nThe third major offender is how the show treats plot points. Foreshadowing is particularly weak aspect to the point of disbelief. The one which I take the greatest issue with, the one that jumped the shark is how for almost the entire first cour we were framed with the understanding that Hiro\u2019s compatibility with 02 is almost completely unanticipated, only for a whole new story to emerge later. Vignette of 02\u2019s backstory were given way early in episode 1 but there was no adequate indication that Hiro was ever a part of it. This is made harder to swallow given how the first arc concluded in episode 6, and the crutch they\u2019ve chosen to rationalize this is memory loss; the oldest excuse in the book. The remaining 12 episode could be treated almost as a different story. There are other legitimate complaints I could leverage against this series with regards to its treatment of plot points, such as how important details are inserted only to be left unexplored until it was necessary to do so, sometimes for multiple episodes on end. In episode 1 Dr. Franxx, the creator of the robots and by definition the best person that can take us on tour of the world appears, but was never seen again until episode 7. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t do anything worthy of screen time for 12 episodes, and that\u2019s something I take issue with. Multiple other examples of this kind of writing can be given, but most of them boil down to 2 things; the characters simply do not ask enough questions, and they do not communicate, and so the plot stagnates. Someone made a clearly ominous remark on our future? Let\u2019s not ask him to clarify! Found a room used by your predecessors with a diary that you could open which may or may not provide you with a deeper understanding of your situation? Let\u2019s just leave it be! I can go on and on.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I\u2019d like to talk about the actual reason you\u2019d be compelled to watch this show, and that is 02. 02 is absolutely waifu. She essentially a monster girl, she has long pink hair, distinct eye cosmetic, horns with a cute connecting hairband, and fangs. Her breast and butt is shapely and supple, her mannerism is enticingly sensual. She dotes only on Hiro and calls him \u201cDaaling\u201d all the time. She gorges on honey almost fetishizingly but never gains weight. Unlike the rest of the team she is knowledgeable about sexuality, handing out a kiss lips to lips with Hiro by the first episode no less and licking various people onwards while still undoubtedly pure in both her body, heart and mind. Any criticism you could possibly subject her to are moot because she\u2019s had a harsh life. Sure she might be uncooperative in team fights which diminish Ichigo\u2019s leadership value, sure she has caused actual bodily harm to her teammates including her own pair, sure she has acted irrationally, sure she\u2019s admitted herself that she too is selfish, sure her initial affection is fake and done just to manipulate the MC, but all of this is quickly forgiven once she says the word \u201cDaaling\u201d. If Sauron had called everyone \u201cDaaling\u201d the inhabitants of Middle-Earth would gladly hold out their neck for slaughter. I mean come on, compare her design to Ichigo\u2019s, there\u2019s just no competition. Even the title clearly establishes how flawless she is, 02 simply can do no wrong and by extension Hiro too since he\u2019s her object of affection. Anyone who dares argue otherwise should be spammed with hate messages.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom-line is this; DitF is an ambitious attempt even if derivative, but the writing as well as choreography leave a lot to be desired. The key to enjoyment is approaching it with the right mindset, and that is watching it for the sole purpose to ship characters. If this is sounding too much like tumblr don\u2019t worry, we are above that, we are in fact, inexplicably the exception to it, I swear. More importantly, no matter how bad the rest of the show may be, no matter how much you take issue with it, the moment 02 comes on screen you will forgive everything, she is simply perfect. Thank you A-1 and Trigger for saving anime.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t mind my score; a bug is preventing me from rating any higher, the fact is this deserves a 10. For some reason this does not happen with other series, must be Ichigo hacking the code, that bitch.",

            "content": "So what if Evangelion had more robots, more characters, more ecchi, more romance, a little less overwhelming dread and christian imagery, and a whole lot more colour?\r\nYou'd get Darling in the Franxx. Is it a romance anime with a mecha aesthetic? Is is a mystery anime with mecha and romance mixed in? Or is it proper mecha, with some mystery and romance thrown in to build character? Or is it all three. Time will tell. And that's what makes Darling in the Franxx unique and extremely interesting, as far a I'm concerned. \r\nCurrently Darling is a joyous, fun, wacky ride with great potential for story,romance, and could go very very dark and become one of the best series in recent years. Time will tell, but as it stands, it's oozing evangelion vibes... and that's only a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it will go downhill, but as it stands, I would personally rate the first nine episodes very highly. They're not perfect, there's cliches left and right, but the execution is very well done, the ships are sailing strong, and it's candy to the eyes. Oh, and ZeroTsu is best girl for sure.\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward to see is it lives up to its potential!",

            "content": "Before Darling in the Frankxx actually aired, I asked myself if Trigger could ever replicate the success of Kill la Kill. Remember that series back in 2013? Their debut show made a significant impact for anime fans all over the world. From then on, Trigger produced some questionable series like Kiznaiver but also reminded us that there are still golden eggs such as Little Witch Academia. Sometimes I still have to ask myself, what the hell is Darling in the Frankxx?\r\nTo be fair, Darling in the Frankxx is actually a co-production between Trigger and A-1 Pictures. It\u2019s an original TV anime that adheres to moreof a humongous mecha show while mixing elements of drama, comedy, sci-fi, and absurdity. Oh wait, that\u2019s not a genre, isn\u2019t it? Well, you will probably understand the meaning of that later on. But first things to remember is that Darling in the Frankxx takes place in a distant future. There are imminent sci-fi themes that deals with pilots and Frankxx, giant robots that are capable of fighting the mysterious klaxosaur. Here, we meet the children that lives in mobile fort cities known as the Plantations. Out of these children, a young boy named Hiro (Code 016) meets a strange girl with horns on her head. So begins this journey\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nOn my first viewing, it felt like Trigger really wanted to play a bit with the viewers\u2019 emotions while attempting the tricky feat of combining many different genres. I\u2019m not going to lie, the first few episodes made me feel like the anime wanted to experiment with sex. Even the first moment when Hiro encounters Zero Two showed implies there may be an immense amount of fan service in the show. However, I wouldn\u2019t say this anime thrives on sex as it\u2019s mostly played out like a metaphor. In other words, this anime isn\u2019t a trick pony but does rely on the emphasis of fan service to some extent. The gimmicks of the anime relies more on the characters\u2019 actions to do the talking. Remember, the main cast is composed of young characters who hasn\u2019t fully grown up yet. In fact, they rely on the Frankxx in order to exist in their world and doesn\u2019t really know their true purpose. A driving factor of the show chronicles the lives of these children. They begin to learn more about their world, themselves, and what their true purpose really is. That is to say, the plot is suspenseful from the start as more and more storytelling is unraveled.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series is mixes in a variety of themes, exposition is necessary and we get a lot of info dumping. It shouldn\u2019t take long to learn the show\u2019s terms as every episode made is easily understandable. However, it\u2019s the characters that are deceptively complex as we learn more about them. At the heart of the show is the horned girl named Zero Two. There\u2019s not much we know about her in the beginning but it\u2019s discreetly shown that she has a connection with the klaxosaurs. From a viewer\u2019s perspective, Zero Two draws the line between human and inhuman. A good portion of the characterization focuses on whether Zero Two accepts on being who she is. She seeks her own identity and place in the world. Thanks to Hiro and his friends, Zero Two does manage to realize who she is and makes her own choices like seeking freedom. And to be quite honest, freedom is a pretty important word considering that these children are trapped like birds in a cage. The animal motif is evident as the children from Squad 13 are called \u201cparasites\u201d by the adults. The mysterious Papa gives out orders to them and they obey them without question. Later on, Squad 13 begins to wonder their real purpose and seek to create freedom themselves. \\n\\n\r\nZero Two is a controversial character who seemingly caused the deaths of pilots who formerly were partnered with her. In a sense, she can be labeled as \u201cblack widow\u201d. It is only when she took Hiro as her \u201cdarling\u201d that reveals a more sensible side of her. Usually, Zero Two is playful despite being serious about her duties. It\u2019s easy to see how childish she can be even on the battlefield like a cat playing with her food. (she actually does this in early episodes) The show also takes a deep dive into her past as we learn how the adults experimented on her and connection with Hiro. Speaking of which, Hiro is like a light in a dark tunnel for not just Zero Two but all his teammates. He is hopeful and is often a voice of reason. As a pilot, he isn\u2019t afraid to take risks despite knowing potential consequences. This inevitably leads him to fall in love with Zero Two. At the apex of the story, he is able to express his feelings in honesty to her. From that point on, they are pretty much inseparable. However, this show\u2019s relationship dynamics isn\u2019t exactly well written if you read between the lines. From the two main leads, it\u2019s very obvious that the anime wants to keep them as true loves. It\u2019s a pretty generic way of storytelling that sends the message of \u201clove will conquer all\u201d. It's something you can find in almost any sci-fi flicks these days. From puppy love to an actual romantic relationship, it\u2019s something any show could have done easily. It\u2019s a shame since I wanted to see this anime think a bit outside of the box.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, that\u2019s not all. The biggest turn off of the relationship dynamics involves the other characters of Squad 13. Let\u2019s face some facts here, the children in the show are very clueless about the concepts of love. Yes, love itself is a very complicated subject for discussion but the anime makes it clear that they have zero knowledge about it. There are multiple character love angles going on by the time you reach 1/3 of the show. For a short list, it involves the love triangle between Goro, Ikuno, and Ichigo. Then, there\u2019s Ichigo, Zero Two, and Hiro. Outside of this circle, there\u2019s also a love triangle between Mitsuru, Kokoro, and Futoshi. Zorome and Miku also seems to have some special feelings towards each other. At one point in the series, Ichigo became an Internet meme for the drama she bought in between herself, Hiro, and Zero Two. I also felt bad for Futoshi as well since the show made it clear that he didn\u2019t stand a chance. Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s relationship is perhaps one of the more tragic ones in the series. And Ikuno\u2026, it almost feels like the show put the character in a love triangle with Goro and Ichigo to make her more relevant. That being said, you may get a headache or two after realizing how clueless these kids are about love. The show even has multiple episodes where they question the meaningful of a \u201ckiss\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Darling in the Frankxx actually started off pretty strong with a lot of potential for developing some of the main characters. Indeed, there are definitely moments that are worth talking about considering how far the series takes care of them. Outside of Squad 13, we also take a deep dive into Dr. Franxx (the creator of the Frankx) and his past. There\u2019s even exclusive storytelling on what motivated him to create these giant mechs in the first place. Unfortunately, that\u2019s pretty much how far the characterization ends up for individuals who are not part of the main cast. An example is Nines, a special defense force who were once part of Zero Two\u2019s former unit. The number 1 of the Nines is an antithesis of Hiro as he is intensely loyal to Papa while mocking Zero Two of becoming \u201chuman\u201d.  The series hardly explores him beyond his personality and even though he changes, it felt like a script of a play that anyone can predict would happen. I was more interested in seeing how the show would handle the roles of the adults. There\u2019s no doubt that Papa plays the role of a distant surrogate figure to Squad 13. In early episodes, they all try to impress him that characters such as Zorome goes to absurd lengths to prove himself. Later on in the show, we find out their real motivations and almost feels like a slap to the face when you realize reality. \\n\\n\r\nActually, now that I think about it, this series can actually be a bit dark. Trigger\u2019s anime projects consists of a diverse variety but Darling in the Frankxx took a lot of risks. I do commend them a bit for doing that. It\u2019s what makes Trigger the studio they are known for nowadays. Did the risks pay off in the end? I\u2019d say hardly because the final few episodes in the show really made me scratch my head wondering if the creators planned this out in the beginning. The incredibly rushed plot is stuffed with cheesy dialogues and subplots that felt irrelevant. The power of love trope is so overused in this show that the final arc felt mindless and it took me awhile to get it over with. There\u2019s a feeling of the anime of cooking up drama for the sake of drama. The worst part ends up being whether we should care about all this or not. Because honestly, I think this show went way over itself in trying to be something special. Instead, it became a hollow shell of itself and degenerated its own legacy.\\n\\n\r\nBy animation quality standards, Darling in the Frankxx maintains a consistent flow throughout the show. The first few episodes made it clear that there would be over the top action and it didn\u2019t betray expectations. The producers were able to capture the highlights of battle scenes, emotional segments, and comedic moments flawlessly. Actual fighting scenes in the show is fast paced that makes an emotional impact. This is accomplished through the character expressions as it made many scenes feel larger than life. The mecha designed by Shigeto Koyama (Captain Earth, Eureka Seven) looks well-polished with the biotech features. Character designs shows the children well-dressed despite being isolated from society. On the other hand, the adults in the series looks ambiguously alien-alike. In addition, the klaxosaurs looks like they were inspired by kaiju movies. And of course, there\u2019s fan service. It\u2019s one of the main selling factors of the show to attract an audience. The metaphoric suggestive positions of the pilots are like a visual innuendo. Zero Two also spends some episodes in full nude while being shameless of her appearance. You want fan service? You got it, you horny viewers.\\n\\n\r\nKnown for taking a lot of risks, the show does also jump into the music department with a mission. That mission is to bring out a sci-fi show to its most iconic form. Admitingly, the theme songs are moderate at best in terms of appeal but contains a lot of creativity. The amount of foreshadowing and references are evident in many scenes. However, the theme songs adheres to a more emotional side of the show once you get into it. Battle OST also works its magic during many important scenes. The character voice mannerism of the show also makes an interesting impression in the case of Zero Two. She does indeed draw a line between a human and inhuman by the tone of her voice. In some episodes, she behaves like a playful child while other times, she acts like an emotional doll. Unfortunately, the other main cast falls short. I mean, who wants to listen to Hiro talking all day or Ichigo complaining like a brat?\\n\\n\r\nWith a total of 24 episodes, Darling in the Franxx ended up being a show that made a big impact but couldn\u2019t fully capitalize on its ideas. It has a creative world and an intriguing group of characters. But when it comes to the actual storytelling, that turned into a chunk of mess. In fact, it made me wonder if the creators had a clear plan in the first place or if they procrastinated it like a final school project. To me, it\u2019s a show that hit the right spots in the beginning but doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. It sure got people talking about it if that was one of its missions. However, it\u2019s ultimately a series that talk the talk, but couldn\u2019t walk the walk.",

            "content": "Im terrible at writing reviews.\r\nSo far:\r\nThis is Fantastic. It feels like a combination or Neon Genesis, Guren Lagann and Kill la Kill. That is, beautifully playful and colorful animation and characters, mixed in with dark undertone and a slightly eerie post apocalyptic setting. \r\nStory:9\r\nThe story presents itself as a story of Giant robots fighting powerful monsters but it's really a story about a bunch of orphaned and disturbingly manipulated yet innocent and animated children discovering what love is (with a crazy and sporadic zero two teasing the MC), while at the same time discovering the world. It's also rather intelligently told, as there are quitea bit of visual metaphors. but while being deep it keeps up its playful and innocent demeanor throughout, even throwing in rather blatant and unapologetic fan service.  (guess that's why they call it the cockpit *wink wink*).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nI really should give 10, but they can be a bit whiney at times. Remarkably diverse characters (diversity of personality, which is ALL that i care about)(and i'm black) though. And deeper than they first appear. All of them of course being pretty transparently innocent, and the character development seems to be aiming towards destroying said innocence (multiple connotations for innocence being used here). But it's that innocence that makes this anime wonderful. Because these are kids who have been growing up in a bubble, unaware, though slowly figuring out, that the world is darker place than they might have otherwise conceived. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is just the main cast of kids, before going into Zero two. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nKill la Kill X Guren Lagann, with 2018 visual standards. Not exactly original, but still unique and it fits the innocent and childish demeanor of the story. Also the fight scenes are built more around feeling than visual excitement, which is it's strength. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(P.S. I\u2019m probably gonna have this review drowned out by the amount of negative reviews, anyways, but I gotta do what I gotta do, since I don\u2019t try to be an elitist or some picky critic.)\r\nTrigger brought us the likes of Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Kiznaiver\u2026all great shows, imo, and all having been nominated as a bookmark savior of anime (anime never needed saving, though, imo\u2026LOL).\r\nThen, this happens: a three-way project of Trigger, A1, and CloverWorks (A1\u2019s subsidiary) calling Darling in the FranXX. I\u2019m going to make it clear right now: while Trigger did stop being involved in the production of theshow after the first half, the series is STILL essentially a Trigger production, so you\u2019d have to think about the kind of expectations many viewers were having for this series. What\u2019s sad is that while I think this show was amazing, it really knew how to drive anime fanbases / groups apart as well, especially when it involved the likes of \u201cdie-hard\u201d fans of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, both shows produced from Gainax Studios, from where the headmasters of Studio Trigger originated.\\n\\n\r\nWith that bit of stuff off my chest, here\u2019s my review, and be warned, there\u2019s a bit of spoilers up ahead:\\n\r\nSTORY: Before I go on a long elaboration, I\u2019ll be straight up with my grade for the story: 6/10. This show literally pulled an Arc-V (for everyone who\u2019s still a follower of Yugioh) where the story went really smooth and fantastic until around the final arc/episodes, plus the ending on both instances felt very inconclusive or not very fulfilling, but still a solid, decent wrap-up. The sudden plot twist in the final stretch with the revealing of the real enemy is honestly shocking and very offputting, but at least pretty entertaining. That sudden changing of the game didn\u2019t come off very well due to the timing and the lack of enough backstory or history to make the plot twist as compelling as it should\u2019ve been. This is honestly THE big bugaboo of the entire show.\\n\r\nThat\u2019ll end my talk regarding the bad news about the story/plot.\\n\r\nAs for everything else regarding the story, it was very good. It\u2019s set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity struggles to survive and avoid extinction via the interference of giant monsters, and because of this, the formalities and norms of society before the disaster were lost with the passing of time. The hope of humanity is then dropped onto the shoulders of children born and raised simply to fight against the enemy, with the main story centered on a rather tight-knit group of kids, whom, like all the others, know nothing about stuff like romance, family, and independence. They really had to find out the truth for themselves and experience the perks and adversities of puberty\u2026.growing up sure is hard, eh? People have to face reality at some point instead of being left in the dark and dependent on someone else you shouldn\u2019t really trust.\\n\r\nI thought that the surprisingly compelling focus on nearly each and every one of these characters was amazing. It\u2019s funny how many people can complain about specific character focusing and/or arcs, yet also complain about a certain show\u2019s lack of it later on\u2026like seriously, what do y\u2019all really want? Even during the specific character arcs, the show still nods back to important points in the main story whenever needed. It\u2019s also good to know that the two lead main characters don\u2019t hog so much of the spotlight as well.\\n\r\nIs this series a melodramatic romance story disguised as a mecha show? Yea, I guess, but I don\u2019t really think it necessarily means it\u2019s automatically a bad thing. I\u2019d rather have a show explore a sizable group of characters and make their personalities and traits shine with specific episodes or group of episodes while gradually building up the main storyline, as opposed to having nonstop action and fights with barely a sliver of character or plot buildup\u2026which would be honestly be like watching a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut off.\\n\r\nDo I even need to mention how much this show relies on symbolism and lore all the time? It CAN be quite offputting for many people, but for others for me, I found it very cool.\\n\r\n(With all the nasty flaws of the story being said\u2026at the very least, it wasn\u2019t as bad as that of Aldnoah Zero, which fell apart almost right from the get-go and never got back up\u2026.that experience burns a sort of PTSD feeling into me even to this day xD)\\n\\n\r\nART / SOUND: The animation, while not the best thing around, is really good. Unfortunately, due to the animation not really being handled by Trigger, you don\u2019t get to feel that kind of nostalgia from when one watched previous Trigger works and animations, so it\u2019s honestly a big shame. That being said, the animation is good, especially during the action scenes. I also think they handled any CG animation they inputted very well, without making it stick out like a sore thumb like in most other anime shows.\\n\r\nAs for the music, the soundtracks of this show are great as well, and put a lot of emotion into the scenes in which they are being played. Being someone who\u2019s pretty much listened to music for the majority of my life (though I don\u2019t have musical career goals xD), I can be quite picky and selective with the kind of music I like, with no real specific genre as a favorite. I really do like how the voice actors for five heroines in the show came together to form a musical group to sing all the ending themes for this show. One thing, though\u2026as much as I love the music, I really disliked the first version of the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I\u2019ve probably said this before: I usually prioritize characters over everything else, barring a few exceptions, when I\u2019m watching anime. For me, even if the story is the greatest damn thing in the world\u2026if the characters aren\u2019t even likable, relatable, and/or even anywhere compelling, it ruins my impression for that show, and hence my final grade for it. It works more for me if a series can even make me give a shit about not just one or two characters, but an entire gang as well\u2026.not a lot of shows that I watched have done that for me prior to watching Darling in the FranXX.\\n\r\nWhat I found great about the characters is that not only do they have some intriguing and/or colorful personalities and traits, but they\u2019re also very relatable to most of us viewers\u2019 real-life experiences and/or friends\u2026yes, for perhaps even our own characteristics. Each and every one of the characters can remind us of ourselves or the friends (or former friends) we\u2019re associated with. I mean, if a show can make you really LOVE the characters as well as HATE some of them at the same time\u2026.it\u2019s doing something right, imo. And of course, I thought the main cast of characters went through a lot of maturity and development very well...which is funny because the two main characters, the focal point of the show, went through the least amount of that. I DO wish that more of the \u201cothers\u201d got better background stories than what I was presented with, though, especially the likes of Dr. FranXX.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Even with the ridiculousness of social media blasting this show left and right without discretion, I can said without hesitation that I really enjoyed the show, even with the stuff regarding the last stretch of episodes going downhill. Like I mentioned before, this is one of the handful of shows that not only made me REALLY care about the characters, but also care about each and every one of the members of an entire main cast\u2026.VERY few mecha shows even do that for me. It was so fun to watch the social interactions between the characters, as well as feel for the characters\u2019 inner strife and adversities that are initiated by the post-apocalyptic setting they\u2019re in. While I personally do like all of the main cast, I did pick favorites like Goro, Zero Two, and yes\u2026.Ichigo (even with the controversy from ep 14).\\n\r\nThat being said, I really wished this series had a more compelling and bittersweet final stretch and finish. It just felt like all the buildup of characters and story/plot wasn\u2019t completely or properly paid off in the very end, and it just felt like that last arc should\u2019ve been given more time to develop. Yes, I was admittedly one of those that did get offput by the turn of events in the last episodes\u2026initially. For me, personally, though, when I do go back to rewatch those episodes, I found the moments more beautiful and symbolic than offputting. The one regret I do have while watching\u2026is not because I stuck around\u2026it\u2019s because I failed to tune out social media, even though I knew what the show would be subjected to criticism, anyways\u2026needless to say, that itself was what really somewhat ruined my enjoyment level in the end.\\n\r\nThis show by itself gave me hope for mecha series in general, due to my previous pet peeves and disliking about the said genre prior to this. Perhaps from here on out, I\u2019ll try to have more faith in mecha shows in the future, with everything being said and done.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be frank here and say this phrasing: \u201cone man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure\u201d\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ll personally recommend at least giving this show a try, I think it\u2019s better to bingewatch the show at a later date, when the shitstorm from social media (including MAL) dies down (as of from the date of this posted review). If you do not like it at all, then so be it\u2026perhaps this kind of plot structure is not to your liking. If you do really like it, then that\u2019s awesome.\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is one of those shows that really miss the target by a lot, but one I can still find at least high levels of enjoyment watching, even with the ridiculous mess in the final episodes. In the end, it\u2019s up to you whether or not the show turns you on or off.\\n",

            "content": "***Caution:*** This review contains spoilers for this predictable show. I have specifically and very clearly marked the spoiler sections (there aren't as many as you think, only 3 paragraphs\u2019 worth) so you can still easily read my review and do not need to worry. As for the fans of the show, enter at your own volition since you will not find this review to exalt it in any manner, so to those who consider FranXX a 10/10, keep your temper in and let's begin. If you're a regular reader, please carry on :)\r\nFranXX was hyped a lot. And that's just the short of it, ithad a huge marketing campaign and had a huge amount of anticipation with people calling it the \u201cNext Evangelion\u201d or a \u201cSpiritual successor to Eva\u201d and so on and so forth. The legendary Yabuki Kentarou was signed on doing the art for the manga adaptation for this unoriginal original and as a matter of fact, that's how I found out about the show in the first place and went in expecting the amazing show the marketing had me believe. Result? Well I can't surprise you since you might have seen the score I gave it. Yes. A mess. A terrible mess.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the main part that is the reason fans gloss over this show, the characters. They are given little to no backstories and their roles to play are very less. Squad 13 mainly served as a bumbling group of teenagers (hmm\u2026 why teenagers in particular?) who don't know jackshit except for the so called \u201cfact\u201d that they must pilot the mechs known as FranXX and defeat these blue magma lover monsters called Klaxosaurs. Let that seep in. Why children? Most likely because they wanna appeal to the target audience of the show, teenagers. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be as fruitful as A-1 and Trigger thought it would because when you've got an idiotic group of teenagers who contribute nothing to character development, I don't think you end up with teenage viewers going crazy over a show. I mean, yes, teens in real life aren't always smart, but if given the chance, I'm sure they'd do something sensible when they need to, but we don't see such a thing at all. Why? All we see is random blushes and such stuff. I mean, these teens are acting like everyday teens, yes, that's fine but is this the premise to do so? A place where people are bombarded by the constant threat of Klaxosaurs? Kids are supposed to have fun yes, but not when you're literally guarding human lives from danger. \\n\\n\r\nTo move away from the characters for a moment, we move to another problem with the show, its connection. And don't you dare justify it by telling me it's an episodic anime, because it sure as hell is not. In reality, it's just mixed up completely and had too many ideas to implement together and instead of choosing one idea to go with, they probably chose all and excellently failed at all of them. Why? Poor connection. To hold up a plot you need connection, FranXX didn't offer any of that at all. It just dragged on and didn't leave any mention of what happened before and most importantly WHY the situation happened before. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Simple. Bad direction. All it takes to destroy the whole hard work of a show is bad direction. In fact, about 90% of the issues with the anime can be traced back to bad direction. If the show had a good director I suppose the show would have a direction to follow, but this being FranXX, it had to follow all the directions it could and then ended up nowhere. In the first episode I had the show at a shocking 9 and if you look at it now it's fallen pretty spectacularly. This is because of the show's bad direction; events were unconnected and an irritated yours truly almost smashed his screen onto the floor . Random stuff happening here with no explanation, and then random stuff happening there without explanation, was this anime devoid of sense or something? Because I did not find any of it anywhere. And then we've got the problem that follows that the story was unexplained. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? How did this occur? Where did this issue first occur? There were many questions asked by fans, and the answer is that it was clear both studios didn't want quality, they wanted the $$$ And that's me trying to be positive, we got zilch as in reality but eh, gotta act positive. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, apart from a cliched mess of a story, it's disappointing in almost every other regard (read on for further explanation), serving as a reminder that it only takes one big mistake to spoil the whole effort put into an anime, or anything for that matter. Speaking of mistakes, we come to another part that had the cosplayers, fan artists and others crazy, the romance\u2014 particularly the romance between Zero Two and Hiro. First off, our two MCs. Zero Two was introduced as a waifu like character which immediately took the undeserving \u201cdeconstruction\u201d tag which was ripped off from Eva (surprise surprise, FranXX ripped off a show) while giving us another useless MC who went by the self appointed name Hiro. Their romance was unexplained until way later into the series, an episode which even I liked, episode 13. They were largely unexplained for most of the anime\u2019s run and it was only in the first episode of the second cour (episode 13) that tried to remedy this. Result? Thankfully good. Episode 13 was regarded as an excellent episode by even the harshest of critics since it explained a lot of the stuff between Hiro and Zero Two and obviously it was a flashback episode, yet despite being a flashback episode it was done well\u2014 surprising since this is FranXX. But the problem came afterwards; after that episode was done, we saw a lot of crap follow it in the form of the team getting \u201cmad\u201d at Zero Two for \u201churting\u201d Hiro for over dramatic effect and to make me sympathise with the characters. Why would you drag through 12 episodes just to see the one episode that seemed half decent and it goes back to its shitty formula? I loathed it even more.The episodes were cliched, unconnected messes with absolutely no relevance to the plot, just serving to pass time either to focus on Hiro or to make the fanboys go crazy over the fight scenes, which were nothing more than one hit kills and random dashes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from there all we got were cheesy half hearted lines like \u201cI wanna be with you forever\u201d and all that teenage fantasy (severely paraphrased for ease of comprehensive analysis) and pointless romantic moments that don't have much to do with the plot. Why am I crushing the romance here even though I'm a romance fan? It's because FranXX deployed this romance at the wrong times, I can't even say I'm surprised anymore at this kind of problem. Then we go to the other cast, Ichigo is a character that served as a reminder about the stupidity of fanboys since her voice actor Kana Ichinose received death threats just because of her work as Ichigo. Anno would be proud. Ichigo\u2019s character though wasn't fleshed out (to say nothing of the rest of the cast, especially Ikuno, Zorome and Miku) and her actions were basically \u201cI'm jealous because I love him but can't reveal it to him because I'm shy\u201d and that time when she DID do it, it was enough to even send non romance fans into a fit because it was done in a (dare I say it?) slutty way cause teenagers? I do not know. Then we come to the signature part which had many people divided as well, Kokoro. To delve into this horrible character we must enter minor spoiler territory so if you can't handle looking at a good character being turned into a whore please skip the marked spoiler section. \\n\\n\r\n***Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers about this side character and want the relationship as a surprise. Spoilers begin: Kokoro was paired up with Futoshi who liked Kokoro a lot but suffered from the same problem as Ichigo. However, since he's male the fanboys didn't take or notice much issue, perhaps also because Futoshi wasn't made as a cockblocker character and instead was of the \u201cI'll protect her\u201d than a \u201cI want him to love me instead\u201d, only thing is that Kokoro turned out to \u201cbetray\u201d Futoshi and instead go for an unlikely character who was largely ignored throughout the show, Mitsuru. She suddenly developed feelings for him and even kissed him for no concrete reason apart from taking the show into an extremely shitty direction because guess what? She wanted a baby. Why? Freakin\u2019 teenagers\u2026 this is the worst way to relate to them. Then Kokoro went from a \u201cI am not in love with Futoshi but he's a kind person\u201d to an \u201cI want Mitsuru\u2019s @#$_ inside me\". I'm not even joking. This LITERALLY happened. Why am I rambling on about this? Because that's definitely not how you make a show about teenagers because that's not at all representative of the majority. Anyway, then they suddenly want to get married (!?) and we see other crap follow as well without explanation or reason, they just wanna fill time at this rate. With what? Throwing in the notion that Kokoro is pregnant later on. Teenage pregnancy, a very common thing in teens nowadays amiright? Wrong. And you know what worse? The fact that the folks at FranXX.inc pulled the WORST cliche to go with this. Both of them are caught and are \u201cbrainwashed\u201d and their memories are \u201cstored\u201d somewhere. If VIRM didn't want to let them regain their memories then why store them in the first place? Why not \u201cdelete\u201d them into oblivion? Plot armour I say. Convenience too\u2026 this makes many viewers realise that the episode was just existing to pass time and fool the viewers into thinking their time into the episode was worth it?  Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us on to the next point, underused characters. Namely Miku, Zorome and Ikuno. Not to mention Goro but he got a little bit of a focus so I'll give him a brief look later. Miku and Zorome were shown as characters who had a rivalry-love which seemed fresh and interesting but that was pulled down along with the anime because they didn't focus on these two at all. What made them attracted to each other? Why are they paired up together? These questions were never answered and I was left hanging, which was disappointing since Miku apart from sharing the same hairstyle as the superstar with the same name (my profile picture character to those of you non-Vocaloid fans) she was one of the few characters who was believable as a teenager. Many people wouldn't notice that these two weren't given enough focus and that was sad because this fresh idea could be explored a lot more and I wouldn't be surprised if I found their rivalry-love better than the two main characters, and don't forget, I liked Miku as a character as well. \\n\\n\r\nLeaving us with the last two, Ikuno and Goro. Ikuno was mainly used as fodder for Mitsuru to frown upon so that he could get hooked to the resident slut Kokoro (I don't think I should call her that because she didn't like Futoshi but considered him kind but then I'm disappointed because like Miku, I liked Kokoro, only that love turned to hate since FranXX ruined her) and Ikuno was ignored for the rest of the anime, she wasn't given lines and that one \u201cI want a baby\u201d episode scene where she DID say something, it wasn't explained WHY she stepped forward and did her act. My guess is because since she didn't have any lines, the show didn't want to make her look like a dumbass so they forcefully gave her lines and that was all. Then we enter spoiler territory yet again because Ikuno was given that small 5 minute focus in a later episode. \\n\\n\r\n***Minor Spoiler Begin: Since Ikuno wasn't given a love interest the folks at FranXX.inc thought it's a good idea to introduce some Yuri at the worst possible time and in the worst possible way, as such, the result was never spoken of again, which pretty much explains how the \u201caffair\u201d went. Needless to say, this was a last ditch effort to save her character and it served as the final nail in the coffin for Ikuno. Minor Spoiler End*** \\n\\n\r\nWe then come to the last character, Goro. Apart from being mildly explored, he served as the third wheel-ish character who was later shown as being in love with Ichigo unsurprisingly, unfortunately he as mentioned wasn't explored much and so was thrown into the sidelines to focus on our main characters, yet another character thrown aside who had a lot of potential to do great things in this mess of an anime. I haven't spoken of any \u201cvillains\u201d yet, as this important role was destroyed by the Iotas, who were, like every other thing in the anime, unexplained, unwanted and irrelevant. They served as somewhat of a \u201cbackstory\u201d to Zero Two despite not going into detail at all. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above there was no proper backstory to Squad 13. Some people said it's because sci-fi shows \u201cdon't need backstories\u201d. This is plain wrong because if you don't have backstories of your character, there won't be any depth to them (see the word depth again and imagine, if there's no backstory, there's no depth, which means the characters are shallow) and when the characters simply don't develop at all during the course of the anime, you end up with flat characters who fall on their face to the plot. Why am I saying this? Hiro and the others didn't change at all mentally from the first episode to the last. Some might say Hiro\u2019s infatuation with 02 makes him a \u201cdeveloped character\u201d but his rejection of his other members in Squad 13 proves that wrong. Others say that \u201ccharacterisation is excused in a sci-fi anime\u201d. At first it seemed as a joke to me but when people seriously started talking about this as a defense I got concerned and felt I needed to clarify this. Take arguably the best sci-fi show as an example to that statement: Steins;Gate. It definitely has development throughout the series. How? Okabe starts to realise he can't do anything, and tries even harder, Makise realises she can't do things alone, Mayuri does more tuturus because people around her are sad, or to move from the joke, Mayuri realises that she needs Okabe and he needs her, this is what development in a sci-fi is. FranXX, on the other hand, didn't have any development to the show, its characters, or anything. It felt more like characters felt less real each time they appeared, and I'm not talking about them being realistic and human-like since that's not what an anime\u2019s main target is everytime, I'm talking about them being acceptable as a character which wasn't at all seen. No characterisation is only excused in slice of life anime since we're understandably looking at the lives of the characters and so there's no plot and therefore no development. FranXX isn't a slice of life, it's (terribly weak) progression proved that.\\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the MC of our wonderful series, Hiro. I hadn't given him enough attention and will do so now. From the start he was unexplained. Why was he a prodigy? What was he doing before meeting Zero Two? What made him so special? To stand out from the rest of the cast, you need distinctive qualities that set you apart from other characters, Hiro had none of that. He was plain and boring. Many may point out that him being in love with 02 would mean that it makes him different from other MCs but that's wrong because apart from his \u201clove\u201d for 02, nothing else was brought into his character. Although towards the end it was shown that he had become selfish and cared about 02 more than his squad who cared about him, it still isn't the kind of development that makes you go \u201cOh, that changed my view of him positively\u201d and if you read that line again you'll probably understand why too. Then we come to the point that he named everyone else, which was revealed early on. This surprisingly is a good thing I saw. He named Ichigo and named other parasites as well which gave it a child-like feeling (perhaps the only successful child-like/teenage feeling that was executed properly throughout the anime, bear in mind this flashback was 2 minutes long) although it wasn't explained at all I still felt an iota of warmth. And nothing else I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the other \u201cvillains\u201d, the Iotas. Since they came in at random times and with random half baked reasons, unsurprisingly they served as yet another thing that was meant to be loathed in the anime. Another irritating thing is how they suddenly became buddy-buddy with Hiro and team in the final arc. I suppose now that FranXX has exhausted whatever little \u201ccreativity\u201d they had, they wanted to end with a shounen-esque \u201ceveryone bands together to fight the enemy\u201d? I mean, not complaining about the trope but was there any sensible stuff going on beforehand? Speaking of insane stuff going on beforehand, FranXX was said to have been in a post apocalyptic world all of a sudden which we were given hints of in the beach episode for about 20 seconds and then later shown in \u201cdetail\u201d (I don't even know why I'm so generously awarding that word when it's meaning wasn't followed at all) in episode 19, which to FranXX\u2019s favour, was a decent episode. But until then for the first 18 episodes, it remained largely unexplained and I don't think I can award a show a point for revealing something so important when it's finished about 80% of it's run. Not a good practice and it returns more harm than good which by now is definitely not what I need to calm myself down. Oh youth. But then wait! Youth reminds me that I should yet again cover another important part about the \u201cjuvenile\u201d aspect of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) for the final arc below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers for the final arc. If you're okay with them, then please continue :)\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler for last arc begin: The most frustrating part of FranXX is by far the last arc. After pointless teenage melodrama, the FranXX team thought of what \u201cideas\u201d can be added to \u201csave\u201d the anime and they did what every laughable show tries to do as a last ditch effort. To take the battle into (wait for it) SPAAAAAACEEEEEE. Yes. FranXX pulled THAT trope. What an insult to Star Wars and Star Trek. Anyway back to this show, the sudden shift in tones (first a teenage melodrama, then a clone war, then a space war? Is this a tutorial on how NOT to make Star Wars ripoffs?) and extremely convenient and unexplained reveals (more on that in a bit) coming out of nowhere? I don't think that makes for a coherent plot at all. Add to that another desperate added shounen trope where the enemy suddenly becomes your friend??? And he sacrifices his life for you just a while after you rescue him??? The Klaxosaur Princess was set as the antagonist at around the third quarter of the show and she suddenly joined Hiro\u2019s side and sacrificed her life for him? What happened to her people, the Klaxosaurs? What happened to saving the world? And then suddenly VIRM puts themselves as the villains despite the show trying to establish the Klaxosaurs as the villains and then the aforementioned Klaxosaur Princess as an antagonist? And then their boss is a Power Rangers ripoff??? What even was that last arc?! The industry can do without more Dadolf Scmitlers you know! We've seen enough of this trope! Like when they're losing Papa and the others suddenly give the order to destroy Earth? Nanja sorya??? And then if you thought all this stupidity wasn't enough, we suddenly see YET ANOTHER problem with the show surface, Plot armour. If I hadn't explained this before, FranXX suffered from yet another plot hole in the form of plot armour. The Iotas lost a few of their members but Hiro and team were left unscathed, the only \u201cinjury\u201d being Ikuno\u2019s hair being turned white\u2026 Throughout the course of the show Squad 13 was met with life or death situations but I was confused since no one died. It can't be a life or death situation if everyone survives, or at least when you have so many life or death situations and no one dies even once I think that's authentically bullshit. Why fill it to the brim with Deus Ex Machina crap then? In the last 3 episodes we saw Hiro and team suddenly band together and go to space, but then the pathetic dialogue in the previous episodes of the anime became even worse, when they're in space they're going \u201cWe're really in space huh?\u201d And Mitsuru\u2019s reason for staying being \u201cI wanna stay because I want to\u201d? Even the dialogues took a huge hit and fell even further\u2026 Add to that the pointless Mobile Suit Gundam I ripoff battle except FranXX\u2019s was much worse because everyone survived??? Not to mention Zero Two eating Hiro through her teleport to Hiro fro Earth directly in front of Hiro and she eats him and takes him to the dream world only to play hard to get? If you're not understanding at all then you have common sense, because no sensible person could understand WHAT happened and WHY. Let's not add to that horrible reasons to horrible dialogues such as bringing up love when your Squadmate is suffering? And then Hiro and Zero Two immediately go leave the Solar System and the others can't tag along because \u201cit's not possible\u201d? This is the limit of cliches but the studios broke it long long ago. And I want to skip over that last episode since that was the only (remotely) decent (?) part of this arc, but the means done to achieve it wasn't and I spoke enough on that... Spoiler end***\\n\\n\r\nFranXX tries to show us that adults are somewhat tyrants and displays the children\u2019s \u201cstruggle\u201d to gaining \u201cindependence\u201d even though they're perfectly fine with their lives with no issues. But you know what they say, if you've got no issues, you make them, and that's EXACTLY what FranXX stayed true to. Trying to show us that our teenage cast is \u201cgrowing\u201d by acting \u201cmature\u201d with examples as \u201c wanting to have babies\u201d and \u201cdoing the kitty\u201d (don't search up on that last one) both of which are related and were attempted by Kokoro and Mitsuru. Yet again you ask. Why? I do not know why the show did it. You can't even tell anymore who they're trying to make the show relatable for. Then we have to look at the teenage drama as well that follows (that I covered above). \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Paragraph (or Spoiler-graph) about a range of questions on things that were unanswered throughout the course of the anime below. Skip this paragraph if you don't want spoilers on these questions. If you're okay with them, then as expected, read on.\\n\\n\r\n***Spoiler questions begin: FranXX as mentioned tried very very hard to be edgy by leaving out some so-called \u201cmystery\u201d feel by not answering the most crucial questions many had throughout the course of the anime. Although episode 13 answered the questions many people had in the first half, there was no such plausible explanation for the second half\u2019s stupidity. What makes me say that? We got weak explanations or no explanations. For example why was the enemy VIRM all along? What was their purpose? Why does Hiro not care about the rest of Squad 13 who he's lived with all his life and why is he so attached to Zero Two despite the above problem? Why are the problems for the characters happening? Who is to blame and why? Despite this being answered (VIRM) there was no proper explanation as to WHY the villains did it? What was their purpose? Why is Ichigo the leader of the group? Why is 02 not explained properly? How does she looks human and how did it happen (also why does she have pink hair when she was a clone of one with white or blue hair)? How are the rejected people treated? What happens to them? What about their memories? Although their memories as mentioned were stored in some place there's no explanation as to why they're stored. Why am I asking that question? When VIRM doesn't want their puppets to regain their memory, why store their memory? And how is the memory stored anyway? Why are teens chosen to pilot the FranXX? Don't tell me it's because their sex organs are most prominent because the teenage years is not the age when this is so. Why are pregnant girls not able to pilot the FranXX? How did the Iotas suddenly be able to join Hiro in the last arc? Weren't they broken or something? Why do Hiro\u2019s group care and still chase Hiro despite him having rejected them for his \u201cone true love\u201d Zero Two? What was the bullcrap about them going to space and space being the important stuff? Like, what was that cop out explanation about VIRM and the enemies being the aliens? Who and what was the Klaxosaur Princess? Who were the Klaxosaurs? No detailed explanations were given. To cover the villains one last time, VIRM. We look again at the Dadolf Scmitler trope that FranXX.inc deployed. To viewers of Grancrest Senki who aren't familiar with the Dadolf Scmitler trope, VIRM is basically the Mage Academy, for the first 20 Episodes we were focused on only one villain but suddenly that villain changes in around the 20th episode and they tell us the real villains were someone else all along? (Surprising how both shows deploy the same cliche in the same episode number. Coincidence? I think not), Why is this bad? This is bad because it makes the viewer question if the time they spent on the first 20 episodes even worth it. I mean, if you really HAD to do this, why do it so late? And instead, why not just make an OVA of the last 6-8 episodes and treat it as the same thing? I'm sure it would get a higher score from me and other disgruntled people if they did this instead because our time was wasted\u2026 Spoiler questions end***\\n\\n\r\nWith all that's said, eagle eyed readers might have noticed that I haven't trashed the art or the music. That's because it isn't shit. And continue to find out. Since it was a collaboration project with A-1 and Trigger (and later Cloverworks because budget issues?) many expected the art to look amazing and it did actually. They tried to make a world that looked beautiful and mostly succeeded in doing that but you can't award points to a show for \u201clooking good\u201d as with what the \u201cmainstream\u201d gaming critics like IGN often do (\u201cCoD a 9/10 because it looks good?\u201d Have you even seen what they're doing now ripping off Fortnite?) so though the art looked good thanks to the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery from time to time, it was in vain as the show couldn't manage to utilise it well into its plot. Another thing that the show did good was the sound. Even though I've been (rightfully) trashing the show left and right, I have to give credit where it's due, FranXX\u2019s usage of synth tracks are rarely seen in anime and obviously serve for something really good in terms of listening especially when you're using headphones (and not streaming the show). Then we move onto the OP/EDs selection, I felt that the show went lazy and just changed the OP a bit and passed it off as an OP 2, but the EDs were great. If only FranXX used those EDs more in the second half and don't abruptly end the episode I'd have a positive opinion of the show. But I'm guilty of singing \u201cTorikago\u201d from the show so gotta give a point to that I guess? But oh wait, they underused all the EDs anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, FranXX is a mess which was over hyped and tried it's best to stay relevant by throwing in useless storylines all of which were riddled by plot holes and Deus ex machinas which were unconnected and not to mention completely unrelated events and random crap here and there (from teenage drama to Star Wars to Power Rangers? MASAKA???), to remain positive, towards the end, I only ever found the two caretakers Hachi and Nana (especially Nana) interesting and likeable since they had an aura of mystery and the 30 seconds they appeared in their few episodes were all great. Miku and Goro too were characters I pretty much liked but weren't explored well since they were thrown aside for Hiro and Zero Two unfortunately. If the show had good direction, I'm sure it would have turned out to be one of my favourite anime of all time and for many other disillusioned fans-turned-critics as well. FranXX sadly will always serve as a reminder to how one big mistake in the form of bad directing can jeopardize the whole premise of a show.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to TheCobraSlayer for proof-reading the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 0.5\\n\r\nAnimation: 5\\n\r\nSound: 5.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1.5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.7",

            "content": "For decades, glorious Nippon has been growing closer to extinction. To cure Nippon through the limitless power of anime, our lord and savior Trigger has blessed us with Darling in the FranXX! But to our surprise, this anime was touched by Satan himself, A-1 Pictures, and its true purpose was to accelerate the extinction!!\r\n(Long spoiler filled review ahead. Spoiler-free TL;DR at the end.)\r\nWith the declining birthrate in Japan, people are living longer, but fewer babies are being born; there aren\u2019t enough young people to take care of the elderly. The Japanese government is spending more money on health care, the workforce is shrinking with lessyoung people to fill jobs, people are often being overworked due to a lack of employees, the economy isn\u2019t flowing properly. The country\u2019s issues become abundantly clear when looking at how pharmacies stock their shelves with more diapers for adults than for kids.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Darling in the Franxx, a shoddily written clusterfuck of a mecha series that attempts to inform it's audience about Japan\u2019s declining birthrate. Yet when it does address the issue of birthrate, it only manages to conjure the most asinine, idiotic, and offensive answers possible. While it\u2019s animation, storyboarding, and fight choreography are exceptional for at least half of the show, it\u2019s writing fails on every conceivable level. Beginning as a subpar and predictable character-driven drama with a vague sci-fi setting, it gradually fell into incoherence and the lack of information was a trick used to mask the nonsensical lore.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: [Hiro & Zero Two]\\n\r\nThe first indication that something horribly wrong with A-1 Pictures/Trigger\u2019s dystopian mecha series Darling in the Franxx appears in the first scene of episode one; a monologue by the monotonous protagonist Hiro and his soon to be wild waifu Zero Two.  \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe Jian, also known as the bird that shares wings, only possesses one wing. Unless a male and female pair lean on each other and act as one, they\u2019re incapable of flight.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis metaphor is symbolized throughout the series, it can be found on the characters\u2019 uniforms and on the futuristic infrastructure, yet there is no such thing as a \u2018Jian\u2019 bird in real nature. There is no species of bird that only has one wing, even implying a bird like that wouldn\u2019t die out through natural selection is ridiculous. This metaphor has two meanings; the literal: the mechas the kids pilot known as Franxx cannot fly without a male-female pair, as the series demonstrated in Partner Shuffle when two girls were explicitly unable to pilot together (ep. 11). The theme applicable to the audience: that every human has a physical for need another person of the opposite sex, throughout the show we see the characters experience this. Franxx mistakes relying on another human for survival as love, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s just codependency. \\n\\n\r\nNever does the show attempt to refute the message that codependency is necessary for survival, it only romanticizes toxicity by building Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s relationship on nothing but things they need from each other, never actual love. He needs her because he has no one else he can pilot with, she needs him because he\u2019s the first partner she hasn\u2019t killed. Any struggles they face are caused by plot contrivances pulling them apart then putting them back together with fanfare to trick you into thinking they actually overcame something. Yet, they\u2019re framed as the happiest and most exemplary couple in the series. This isn\u2019t love, it\u2019s codependency! They both NEED something from one another and that\u2019s what is tying them together, not a bond! They\u2019re like two snakes wrapping around each other until one of them suffocates first. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, Hiro is wallowing in self-pity because he was just too good for his last piloting partner, she was a lame normal girl and the show decides he needs a wilder girl. He\u2019s just a potato self-insert protagonist, everyone loves him for reasons that aren\u2019t nearly compelling enough to the viewer. Seeing all of the characters in love with or admire Hiro feels so unnatural, it\u2019s so obvious that they\u2019re deliberately written to like him regardless of how little charisma he has. All of Hiro\u2019s struggles are rooted in him being better than everyone else. He just perceives himself as being worse because of his frustratingly low self-confidence. The show reminds us of this at every chance it gets with self-pitying inner monologues, but no matter how much he annoys us he never gets anywhere near believability.\\n\\n\r\nOnce his wild waifu Zero Two shows up and they start piloting with one another, he finally feels fulfilled. She\u2019s a half monster half human hybrid and she has horns. That's the single flimsy explanation we get for her craziness, not nearly enough to find her personality believable, but at least she didn't have the same generic design as all of the other characters. She\u2019s known as the \u2018partner killer\u2019 because anyone who pilots with her dies after three times, keep in mind this was back when she was allowed to have interesting character traits. This conflict gave the show chance to discuss how Hiro felt physical pain when he piloted with her, but as we would come to see, the show had no interest in delving into its characters in any meaningful way. Zero Two spends the first half of the show wallowing in angst because she\u2019s not a human or whatever, which is moderately intriguing because she develops PTSD and in hallucinations sees the past partners she killed. It gave the show a chance to actually develop her in a meaningful way, but this was dropped entirely for the sake of making her relationship with Hiro seem as saccharine as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe Beast and the Prince (ep.13), their backstory episode more or less existed solely to contribute to the cloying tone. Zero Two began as a test subject for the creator of the partner piloting system Dr. Franxx himself, and he\u2019s a really evil guy so the episode spends a fair bit of time on her being tortured. Genericness and predictability aside, the episode itself is decent enough upon first inspection; Hiro became friends with Zero two as a kid while in training, he taught her what it\u2019s like to be a normal kid, they tried to escape Dr. Franxx together but were eventually caught, and then their memories of each other were erased. I personally didn\u2019t care for the episode considering it was more or less a copy of a climactic scene from Yuri Kuma Arashi; it directly ripped storyboards, narrative beats, but it had none of the thematic implications. Franxx copies so many great anime like this to craft a hackneyed story that\u2019s less interesting than even one of its parts. The only reason anyone will have to remember this anime is for the climactic moments, and I can\u2019t give it any credit for those knowing how much worse it is than the material it plagiarized. \\n\\n\r\nThe travesty that was Punishment and Confessions (ep.14) was the turning point in the series when it lost any chance to develop the two leads beyond their one-dimensional starting point. In this episode, Hiro\u2019s squad separate him and Zero Two because their last time piloting together left him in critical condition with her simply remarking something like \u2018if he can\u2019t handle it then he\u2019s not worth it.\u2019 Hiro\u2019s squad, in spite of being mostly cardboard-cutout non-characters, are always in the right when they call out Hiro for his bullshit. The major cause of conflict between them is when Zero Two goes to visit Hiro but when she arrives at the infirmary, by some coincidence Hiro happened to have snuck out of the room and went looking for her. When she noticed he was missing, she went into psycho girlfriend mode and tried to murder his friends to find him. Then through another coincidence Hiro returned and see this brawl, convincing him to break off their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a conflict that arises due to their difference in personalities, it\u2019s a lazy ass plot contrivance. It only existed for them to be able to have a reunion a single episode later and act like they actually overcame something, they did not learn ANYTHING from this. Hiro and his friends all forgive Zero Two with no discussion whatsoever in the next goddamn episode, no apologies for her beating the crap out of all of them. The show treats this like the grandest climax so far; for the last time in Trigger's fantastic sakuga is on display, then it\u2019s pure mediocrity for the following nine episodes. Their reunion had virtually no impact narratively because it contradicted what we just saw in the previous episode and it nullified all of Zero Two\u2019s emotional baggage. After episode 15 the whole partner killer thing is forgotten, her PTSD is not discussed again, her being half monster is barely an afterthought, all because somehow being in a codependent relationship helped her. After episode 15 they were still very much relying on one another to survive, they didn\u2019t develop in an organic way. Eventually, their parasitic relationship led to Zero Two sacrificing herself, becoming a rock and also turning into a giant space robot lady.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Zero Two was the most interesting character in the series; she was defined by her unpredictability, she had intriguing emotional hang-ups, she had potential to be a good character. Then by the end, she became a rock, both in physically and metaphorically. She lost any edge she had because her wildness was tamed by Hiro. As we see throughout the series this is the case with all of the pairings, their relationships stunt character growth. For the rest of the show, Zero Two had no agency over the story other than sacrificing herself for her darling's sake. \\n\\n\r\nPart 2: [Story & Setting]\\n\r\nIn the early episodes of Franxx, little emphasis is put on the setting, it\u2019s purposefully left vague for the majority of the show. Post-apocalyptic Earth is mostly deserts, a council of powerful adults issue orders to the various squads of kids to protect the plantations containing adults unfit for battle. Kids pilot mechas to destroy oncoming attacks from giant alien creatures known as Klaxosaurs. \\n\\n\r\nWhat began as a standard, but functional premise, rapidly descended into nonsense. With each big reveal and twist the show gradually lost what the main story was even about. At the start of the series the creatures the kids fight are aliens, then it\u2019s revealed to be an older form of humans, then it\u2019s revealed the council of adults were the real aliens all along, because why the hell not. Then it\u2019s revealed that all of the adults are immortal because they injected molten lava into themselves. There are so many conflicting pieces in the lore of Franxx, it's total illogical nonsense. The best way to look at the writing in Franxx is from a thematic perspective because that\u2019s all the show seems to care about.\\n\\n\r\nRather than competently crafting a story Franxx puts more emphasis on is its characters, themes, emotions. Similar to the mecha classics that it copies incessantly, like Evangelion and Gunbuster, this is an emotional narrative. Except, they don\u2019t know how to make characters feel like believable humans and the themes attempt social commentary without actually commenting on person/group of people that exist in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses in a semi-episodic structure similar to Evangelion, episodes typically do not pick up right where the previous ones leave off plot-wise. Instead, they follow the squad of the ten main characters as they experience becoming pilots and overcoming drama amongst one another, all while delivering small details on the setting to keep you intrigued to where it may go. If Franxx were actually good, this plot structure could work just as well as the shows it\u2019s imitating, but it\u2019s so much worse. Despite being relatively well animated, its story beats are mind-numbingly generic and it almost never surprises. It feels like the script was generated by a soulless corporation, ticking off a checklist with each generic story beat, cliched character archetype, and seemingly important themes used cheaply as window dressing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Franxx, you are always ten steps ahead of the characters. They\u2019re shocked by the most mundane tropes found in any sci-fi dystopian stories. Like when the main cast discovers they aren\u2019t the first squad of kids who lived in their dormitory, it was information hinted at us many times over with the kids constantly saying \u201coh I can\u2019t wait to be an adult someday\u2026\u201d Wow, what a shocker, the menacing council of enigmatic hooded figures leading an army of child soldiers are actually evil. Who could have guessed?? Apparently none of the characters. This is an issue all throughout the series, the story beats are so standard yet the show feels the need to present it with arbitrary foreshadowing as if it\u2019s not obvious enough already. Franxx is the kind of series that doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s audience is capable of thinking beyond the level of a toddler, so at every chance it gets it spoon-feeds us information, making it even more unbearable to watch. Expecting us to be brain dead idiots or very young children is also what lead Franxx to create some of the most hilariously stupid metaphors in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe mechas and how the kids pilot them are very obnoxiously a metaphor for sex; the boy mounting the girl in a doggy style position, complete with sex terminology to describe the mechas and seating positions. As if it the sex analogy wasn\u2019t clear enough, the characters\u2019 piloting banter always sounds like they\u2019re talking about sex rather than I don\u2019t know, fighting aliens. The mechas themselves are for some unexplained reason female, with over-sexualized features so there is always fanservice right in the middle of fight scenes to distract you from the action. They're a mishmash of ugly colors and random accessories that make no sense, the designs are hideous desperately trying to look attractive. And the thing is, the kids have been raised in a sterile environment devoid of any information about sexuality, so they don\u2019t even know how perverted the act of piloting is. First of all, that\u2019s kind of creepy and only adds to the layer of sleazy fanservice covering this whole mess, secondly, it presents the themes of procreation in such a painstakingly literal way that there is no room for analysis. If Franxx had even a little self-awareness, this tonal whiplash could have been at least partially avoided if it were framed as humorous, instead, it\u2019s unknowingly parodying itself by being as stupid as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads us to the fact that the world of Darling in the Franxx makes no goddamn sense. It\u2019s full of contradictions. We\u2019re constantly told that the kids don\u2019t know anything about sexuality, they don\u2019t even know what a kiss is, yet they for some reason they view nudity as inherently sexual. Clearly, the writers did not consider what a culture would look like if boys and girls are raised alongside each other without any real contact with adults or exposure to sex. The boys \u2018ogle\u2019 the girls pervertedly which makes no sense whatsoever because they should not know to view them as sexual, and the fact that the girls feel shame, in turn, makes no sense either. If the show hadn\u2019t forced that pointless beach episode in, these issues wouldn\u2019t have been as noticeable. In a better written dystopian story, the characters' puberty would be free of expectations that would typically be passed onto them by society. However rather than carefully considering the dynamics of the sci-fi setting they were attempting to create, the writers simply gave us cliched romantic comedy hijinks seen in any generic anime.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3 [WHAT THE FUCK IS FRANXX EVEN ABOUT?]\\n\r\nThe world building in Darling in the Franxx is flat out awful, which is what makes the vast majority of the story feel incredibly shapeless. It takes seventeen episodes for Franxx to actually clarify what the hell it is actually commenting on in the real world. If Franxx wanted to be a good reflection the birthrate decline in Japan it would have had to actually make use of its sci-fi setting beyond just stupid sex-powered mechas. For starters, a lack of kids being born would be an explicit conflict in the story to reflect the birth rate decline in modern day Japan. However, there are a TON of children in Franxx! So many that they are able to throw them into cryosleep as we see in episode 22. There is a surplus of kids in Franxx if discussing birth-rate was the real goal of the show then they failed from the start. The issues the heroes in Darling in the Franxx face is not that there aren\u2019t enough children. They want to have children the normal way with the boy-girl pairs they were assigned to, but the aliens in control of their system do not allow that. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 17 is the moment that the series lays down its themes clearer than it ever had before. Kokoro voices that she wants to have a baby in order to feel fulfilled, then the evil Squad Nine comes and takes her book on pregnancy and they tell her humans have cast away their reproductive organs because they cause too much unnecessary drama. He further clarifies by stating the firm belief of APE, the council of aliens leading the anti-reproduction regime. \\n\\n\r\nThis is simply connecting a person's fertility directly to their emotional depth. The world of Franxx says you don\u2019t need to reproduce OR have emotion, and that\u2019s what the main characters are trying to break away from. Of course, why wouldn\u2019t they want to break out of a system like that? But why? What does it represent? What person or group in the real world is preventing people from having kids because they want to be shallow, genderless, and without children? No one! It's social commentary written by someone who is out of touch with reality. \\n\\n\r\nIn the awful backstory of \u201cInhumanity\u201d (ep.19), Dr. Franxx voices that he believes humans are only truly beautiful if they can procreate, which is why he puts faith in Hiro\u2019s squad to become \u201creal humans\u201d and create children in his designated forced piloting system. The piloting is just pseudo-science that very obviously has no reason for existing outside of serving the show\u2019s message and trashy fan service. The show takes this message even further by portraying any person or group who doesn\u2019t procreate the Franxx way as a threat to humanity. \\n\\n\r\nFranxx is very much able to say a traditional family is good; mother, father, procreating, that is a good message for tackling birthrate. But for some reason, it chooses to frame anyone who chooses not to adhere to the traditionalist family setup as a threat to mankind. Franxx just ignores the fact that there are many other ways people can have a family, and still live fulfilled lives. There can be same-sex relationships, people can adopt kids, or even to not have children at all, but Franxx says these are all signs of inhumanity. That hilariously stupid wedding episode served only to convey this message but in the most hamfisted way possible. In episode 18, the alien SWAT team led by APE literally raids the makeshift wedding between Kokoro and Mitsuru. They tear the bride and groom apart, then erasing their memories of one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire wedding arc was unnecessary to the story and boring as hell, it was just crammed in there for the sake of pushing these themes even more. APE is just the idea of diversity but overblown to ridiculous proportions. It antagonizes anyone who opposes traditionalism to an absurd degree, but it also portrays traditionalists as insanely hysterical in their beliefs in an offensively stereotypical way. Both sides of the political spectrum are written in a way that is so overblown to an alienating degree that very few people will want to agree with it. When the purpose of a piece of art is to change the audience's political views, it is fitting to label it as propaganda. However, assuming that level of thought and consideration was put into the story would be giving the moron who wrote it way too much credit. Regardless of your stance on the themes in Franxx, this is all it has to offer in terms of in-depth analysis, other than that it's boring teenage drama between underdeveloped characters.\\n\\n\r\nPart 4: [The Squad]\\n\r\nHow could this have happened?! The voice actors were good enough to mask a lack of depth, the animators were talented enough to make them look like lively pieces of cardboard (at least in the first half), but nope instead they are unavoidably awful and no icing will make this pile of shit resemble a cake. At best they\u2019re forgettable, but at worst they\u2019re horribly portrayed archetypes that will make you feel sorry for how badly the show treats them. There was so much potential in most of these characters, but without writers capable of crafting cohesive or satisfying arcs, all of them remain flat cardboard cutouts only existing to support Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s efforts to be the most obnoxious couple in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIchigo:\\n\r\nAll this poor girl did was have a crush on the potato protagonist, and that caused people to send her voice actress death threats. They\u2019re children, who gives a shit about who likes who? Her reason for actually liking him is so vague and petty, they were friends as children. And per Franxx\u2019s idiot logic, your first affectionate interaction with a person will decide who you\u2019re attracted to when you're older. Ichigo had a few interesting moments of standing up to Zero Two for the sake of protecting Hiro, it of course went how you expect, with the two parasites wallowing in codependency and nothing developing. She does very little throughout the show aside from looking pouty whenever she sees the two leads acting lovey-dovey around her. It was impossible for me to sympathize with her because I can\u2019t comprehend why she would feel so strongly towards a potato. Regardless of her love, by the end, she does not change at all despite being the most prominent supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nGoro:\\n\r\nOccasionally Goro calls Hiro out on his bullshit in some of the most satisfying scenes of the series, then in the most disappointing moments of the series, he immediately apologizes and acknowledges Hiro\u2019s superiority. Goro is allowed to be a character for a few seconds once every few episodes, but for the remainder of the show, he has no stakes in the story. \\n\r\nGoro\u2019s main attribute is that he\u2019s a nice guy who feels unrequited love for Ichigo. He respects her and acknowledges that she has feelings for Hiro and doesn\u2019t overstep his boundaries. He\u2019s the most likable member of the whole cast, but sadly there is literally nothing to him than his unrequited love for Ichigo. His whole character arc culminates very early on in \u201cTriangle Bomb\u201d (ep. 9) when he confesses his love to Ichigo in the best way he could, explicitly stating he doesn\u2019t want to pressure her but wanted to clear the tension between them because he is a nice and respectful guy. \\n\r\nThen Ichigo shrugs off his confession with \u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to that,\u201d\\n\r\n... \\n\r\n...and then she literally doesn\u2019t...\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nFOR THE ENTIRE SHOW.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro:\\n\r\nOk, I was bracing myself by talking about Goro first because Kokoro is by far the worst member of the squad. Not only is she the source of many plot holes, she is more or less a vehicle for the show\u2019s creator to preach the themes. In the totally 100% necessary beach episode (ep.7), she finds her bible, a book on pregnancy, and for the remainder of the series, she preaches it like scripture. She uses it to learn about sexuality, weddings, and childbirth. In \u201cBoys x Girls\u201d (ep.8) she references the book to explain why the boys were ogling the girls, she says \u2018we have to put up with their perviness in order to pilot together and to eventually have a family with them.\u2019 Kokoro believes that girls are supposed to ignore any problems they have with the boys because they have to make a baby regardless of how they feel. Not only is this a harmful message for viewers, it also causes even more stagnant character writing because the pilot pairings never have discussions about their troubles. Nothing is ever overcome because Kokoro perpetuates this outdated rhetoric. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro does very little throughout the show, mostly sitting passively until she gets the baby craziness and demands to be allowed to have a child. After promising she would stay with her piloting partner Futoshi, she immediately kicks him to the curb for a new guy in episode 11 for no other reason than he\u2019s fat and she doesn\u2019t want her kid to have the fat genes. So needless to say she\u2019s kind of a monster and I felt no sympathy whatsoever. \\n\r\nThat leads us to the makeshift wedding they come up with which was one of the stupidest moments in the show; for some reason, right before she is wed to Mitsuru they\u2019re raided by APE with their SWAT team. It\u2019s totally ridiculous to think that a futuristic advanced society of aliens could kick down the door at any moment, but they chose to wait just as the two are about to kiss. And seeing them waving around guns at a wedding full of kids is so unbelievably over-the-top. That whole marriage episode was a trudge to get through, and I was honestly relieved when the alien SWAT reproduction-abolitionists ended it early. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. APE erases Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s memories one another, but this opens even more plot holes:\\n\r\n1. APE forgot to remove their wedding rings after the memory removal procedure, genius.\\n\r\n2. All of the other kids knew about the memories getting erased so they just told her and that\u2019s how she remembered. \\n\r\n3. She was still pregnant after being captured by the anti-marriage alien SWAT team. They\u2019re pretty bad at being an anti-reproduction regime if they can\u2019t even figure out this basic shit.\\n\r\n4. Kokoro and Mitsuru regain their memories a few episodes later on their own, they overcome literally nothing because they return to how they were just before getting married. \\n\\n\r\nZorome/Miku:\\n\r\nThey\u2019re the most forgettable members of the squad, simple one-note personalities with no impact on the story. They do have a brief bit of \u2018development\u2019 if you can even call it that abhorrent in \u201cBoys x Girls\u201d (ep. 8). They clash briefly when Zorome ogles Miku (we\u2019ve discussed how this doesn\u2019t make sense) and she reacts by dividing the dormitory with tape in the most sitcom-y episode in the show. For a mecha series that tries to take itself seriously, throwing a proverbial wrench in the tone does not make the characters seem more human and relatable, it was such an unnatural tonal shift that it made them feel like aliens. Other than this one fanservice episode, they just hang around the squad and offer a few inconsequential reactions and quips that add absolutely nothing to the show but background noise. \\n\\n\r\nFutoshi: \\n\r\nThis poor chubby kid is just bullied by the show whenever he is onscreen, his whole character arc is one big fat joke. At first, it was just a few offbeat jokes along the lines of \u201cHey, don\u2019t take any of my food while I\u2019m gone.\u201d His humor was just as unnatural and stereotypical as the rest of the cast, but then the show takes it a step further from a poorly written annoyance into offensively awful. His piloting partner Kokoro ditches him during \u201cPartner Shuffle\u201d because he has the fat genes and she wants a good baby to further the species. Understandably, this causes him to become insecure about his weight and form an eating disorder. This is a very sensitive topic with plenty of potential for good discussion, but this is Franxx so they flushed any potential down the toilet. Franxx approaches this real-world issue that affects plenty of people with the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers were too incompetent to deftly handle a serious topic like an eating disorder, so instead they literally just ignore it. Most of episode 16 is dedicated to his struggling with not wanting to eat any food, with Zorome confirming that Futoshi is throwing up his food. Yet even though they confront him about his insecurity, the episode ends with Hiro giving one of his bullshit speeches about friendship with sad piano music playing, cue the whole cast crying. Futoshi\u2019s turmoil was glossed over and never resolved, likely because none of the corporate drones that manufactured this knew how to sensitively handle real-world issues. The director goes out of his way to show us how unhappy he is with himself in minor ways throughout the rest of the show. Whether he be playing with his food or sadly staring down at his full plate, even by the end it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s still struggling with his disorder yet Franxx couldn\u2019t give less of a shit about his turmoil. Rather than addressing his issue, they choose to force him to be the de facto-priest at Kokoro\u2019s wedding, it\u2019s so cruel and horrible that I might actually have felt bad for him if he had actual character traits beyond \u201che\u2019s fat lol.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIkuno:\\n\r\nThroughout the show, she is very blatantly hinted at being in love with Ichigo, which gave the show a huge chance to backtrack on the message that anyone who isn\u2019t in a heterosexual relationship is actively part of the birthrate problem. But because Franxx is the anime of disappointments, her character arc was handled appallingly. One of the most egregious moments in the series was in \"When the Sakura Blooms\" (ep. 18) when Ikuno confesses her love to Ichigo and she wrote it off by saying \u201coh I was the same when I felt unrequited love for Hiro, but now I am doing what's necessary for the greater good and hooking up with someone else.\u201d It\u2019s the passive-aggressive type of homophobia I've seen plenty of in real life from people who are only accepting of gay people as long as they become straight eventually. What Ichigo says to Ikuno sounds more like \u2018oh how sad that you\u2019re defective, someday you\u2019ll grow out of that phase.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nAnd it doesn\u2019t end there, Ikuno is perpetually shown as the least able member of the squad. Like I mentioned previously, this show dives into some dark dehumanizing themes of eugenics. It is explicitly stated that in the world of Franxx, your life force is directly connected to your fertility, if you\u2019re not having a kid your hair will become gray and you will die faster than those who chose to further the species. Whether or not it was the creator\u2019s intention to dehumanize LGBT people, he threw these pieces on the board and they landed unnervingly close to hate-speech.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuru:\\n\r\nAt the start of the series, Mitsuru is the \u2018rival\u2019 archetype who has an inferiority complex to Hiro, but through subtle coding is indicated to actually be in love with him. Mitsuru received his name from Hiro when he was a child, therefore per Franxx idiot logic, he is gay. With this character, Franxx approaches the topic of homosexuality as a developmental mistake, something you are born with then eventually grow out of. Which is just not true on any level. Sexuality is biodiversity, you\u2019re born that way or you\u2019re not. A person does not need \u2018a reason for being gay,\u2019 they just are. The fact that Franxx framed it as a discrepancy in Mitsuru and Ikuno\u2019s upbringing and that they have to grow out of it regardless of their how they feel is appalling. \\n\\n\r\nHis turmoil over being in love with Hiro is swiftly brought to a close with him being forced into a relationship with Kokoro. She projects her desire to have a kid on him until he tepidly reciprocates because they are both convinced that unless they have a child they won\u2019t be fulfilled in life or ensure the future. Of course with no resolution for his unrequited love. The show goes out of its way to frame his marriage to Kokoro as an obligation rather than a choice. Similar to Futoshi, through subtle character direction you can tell Mitsuru\u2019s still pining for Hiro even in the episode he starts his relationship Kokoro. And there\u2019s never the same coding for Mitsuru being in love with Kokoro. Hiro flat out tells Mitsuru \u201cyou ARE in love with Kokoro\u201d and he accepts that hesitantly. It\u2019s as if the writers were trying to indicate that Mitsuru actually wanted to be with Hiro, but needed to suppress his feeling in order to prevent the metaphorical birth rate from declining. \\n\\n\r\nEven if these messages were unintentional, the creators of Franxx are playing with serious issues just for the sake of window dressing to make the sex-robot alien stuff seem less stupid, which is in my opinion just as offensive.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5: [Dr. Franxx, APE, \u201cInhumanity,\u201d and the scienceless sci-fi]\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an atheist, you see ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\u201d \\n\r\n-Dr. Franxx while licking his lips at the sight of the loli-monster-girl-princess. \\n\\n\r\nOur first introduction to the eponymous Dr. Franxx is him delivering his half-breed experiment kid Zero Two to Hiro\u2019s squad. One of his first lines is literally him sexually assaulting Nana, the squad's parental-type overseer, and telling her to loosen up. The show frames it as a joke because of course Franxx (the show) finds workplace assault to be fluffy humor. That\u2019s how he\u2019s characterized for most of the series, as a guy who does explicitly bad things like torturing Zero Two during \u201cThe Prince and the Beast,\u201d yet the show frames him as sympathetic. They really expected us to think, \u201che\u2019s done bad things, but he really had some good ideas!\u201d He had no value for human life, but somehow designing the awful sex-powered mechas absolves him? It\u2019s like a crazy person trying to defend Hitler. I Don\u2019t Care. He tortured and experimented on a kid, the show expected us to feel bad for him when he \u2018sacrificed himself\u2019 so everyone could survive at the end of episode 21. I literally applauded when a plot contrivance caused him to get violently crushed by rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAPE is just a bunch of aliens that came down to Earth and pretended to be an organization of scientists, they gave the government a new form of energy, magma and took over the world more or less. It\u2019s a very silly twist, but this is Franxx and it\u2019s a stupid show, magma could technically be used as a form of energy and greed could lead the government to trust mysterious scientists. But the magma is somehow also the key to unlocking immortality? How? Magma is molten rock, hot rocks! How the hell do you make the logical leap between a form of energy and DNA mutation? It makes no goddamn sense! APE was just a bunch of random aliens that had so little to do with the main characters, it added nothing to what had been built up in the prior episodes. The magma energy constantly shown in background details supposedly caused the Earth to become deserts? Taking molten lava from the Earth (below the crust) would in no way affect the soil, it might lower the temperature of the surface but that would cause it to become cold, not hot. I'm not sure who thought coming up with scientific-sounding words and a vaguely futuristic aesthetic would make good sci-fi, but it doesn't. Even I, someone who knows very little about science can tell this show is brain dead stupid and no effort went into researching its concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThen after Franxx spends twenty-two episodes building up this illogical science, it throws in a giant twist in episode 20 that nullifies everything that came before it. Oh no! APE was actually aliens and now Zero Two\u2019s brain is trapped in space fighting them!! Who gives a shit? At this far into the series, the themes and pseudo-science were all the show cared about. Regardless of how badly they were written, at least it was something to engage with. All of the petty melodrama the characters face, all of the hackneyed lore, even the art quality goes down the toilet by episode 22. Franxx does these twists so often with its story, whenever it wants to achieve a climactic moment it just skips over the build-up and goes straight to the catharsis. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of Darling in the Franxx, it doubles down on the ridiculous plot twists, desperate to make you take it seriously when you're more likely to laugh at it. In its final attempt to make you cry, it kills off it's two main characters, but even this lends no catharsis. The only catharsis you'll get from the ending of this train wreck is knowing you\u2019ll never have to watch it ever again.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\n[Story: 0/10] Clichefest, contrived filler drama, terrible world building, nonsensical twists that nullify the whole story.\\n\r\n[Character: 0/10] I've seen planks of wood more interesting and relatable than this entire cast.\\n\r\n[Art: 3/10] No visual identity, good battle sakuga in the first half with hideous mecha designs, very rushed towards the end.\\n\r\n[Sound: 3/10] Mediocre soundtrack, a waste of talented voice actors.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 0/10] Both intellectually and personally insulting.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score: 1/10]\\n\r\nThere\u2019s enough potential here to leave you curious as to what the writer/director Atsushi Nishigori might have created if he weren\u2019t so satisfied with repurposing classic anime into a clusterfuck that\u2019s less interesting than even one of its parts. He never understood what made their themes so impactful in the first place, and didn\u2019t bother to create an anime capable of standing on its own merits. Without a coherent story, remotely believable characters, or even themes rooted in reality, this show offers no redeeming value.\\n\\n\r\nThe best praise I can give to Darling in the Franxx is UNWATCHABLE.",

            "content": "Seeing this number of positive reviews on this show made me decide to write an honest review on it. This review is written by a person who was on the Darling in The FranXX hype train before it arrived at the r/anime station, and also by a person who absolutely loves Trigger and their work, from the Gainax beginnings to their \"independency\".\r\nDarling in the FranXX started out pretty solid, if you ask me. It already introduced a very interesting metaphor in the first 2 minutes, and I was very excited at that point. Then came the naked girl cliche. Ignoring it as an \"A1 shenanigan\",I continued the episode and was able to find it a tad bit enjoyable, mostly because of the cool world concept and the interesting-looking characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat didn't last long. In the first 6 episodes, those seemingly interesting characters have either done nothing or have been super annoying. I was not expecting side character development in 6 episodes, but this was just unbearable. 02 also got old real fast, making Hiro the only one able to save the show. Turns out Hiro is just budget Kirito therefore shattering all my hopes for the characters part.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! There's more to a show than characters. \"Great Art\" is indeed true, and I won't even deny that the art is consistent and good, but it's normal. It brings nothing to the table, it's just the standard \"good\" animation. The music is also unnoticeable. I was expecting better music from Trigger. Have they even worked on this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say much about the story, since right now many questions remain unanswered, I can say that it doesn't seem to be going anywhere in these 6 episodes. It seems more like they're experimenting with the mechs and the \"kyoryuu\" battles right now, and sometimes adding a little bit of info. \\n\\n\r\nI am not enjoying this show. I'm having trouble finishing these last episodes and that's a no-no for me.",

            "content": "4 Cups of Evangelion\r\n2 tablespoons of granulated Gurren Lagann\r\n1/4 teaspoon of Star Driver\r\n1 dash of Beauty and the Beast\r\nAnd last, but not least.\r\n69 metric tons of CRAP! (freshly steamed)\r\nIn case it wasn\u2019t obvious, these are the instructions for one serving of Darling in the FranXX.\r\nThere is a tacit understanding in the anime industry, as well as the filming industry, that you are allowed to draw inspiration from other works, but not plagiarize said works.  There are, of course, exceptions to this rule \u2014 particularly, in regards to satirical natured shows (Gintama and Inferno Cop, being the perfect examples) \u2014 however, solemn show\u2019s dance ona very thin line, and must introduce innovative ideas to alter the perception on existing paradigms; otherwise, they come off as being cliched, and redundant.  From a monetary perspective, it makes sense to draw influence from other works, for example: Disney\u2019s Lion King took inspiration from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet and Kimba, the White Lion (an anime from Osamu Tezuka, the creator of Astro Boy).  Yet it doesn\u2019t absolve those involved from imbuing their own ideas and nuances to create something worthwhile.  Darling in the FranXX doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend this point, as it overtly uses critical elements from several other anime as a faux attempt of appearing sophisticated.\\n\\n\r\nFor ease of reading, I have created a short list of instances that were copied, slightly altered, or outright stolen from other anime (this is not all-inclusive, as there are countless examples):\\n\\n\\n\r\n-The underground city bears resemblance to Tokyo-3 and the Geofront from Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-The mysterious men/women in the white uniforms that have significant influence are rip-offs of SEELE from Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-The launch sequences are essentially mirror images of Evangelion\u2019s launch sequences (see a theme here).\\n\\n\r\n-There was some kind of testing that was being performed in the early episodes that paralleled the synchronization tests in Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX has been compared to episode 8 of Gurren Lagann.  Which makes perfect sense, since Atsushi Nishigori (the director of Darling in the FranXX) was the director for episode 8 of Gurren Lagann, but this brings up a more serious issue: why is Nishigori reusing old ideas from over ten years ago?  Not only that, but why is episode 6 of Darling in the FranXX a worse rendition of his earlier work (he couldn\u2019t come up with improvements in all these years)?\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 13 is a reverse retelling of Beauty and the Beast \u2014 in fact, the title of the episode is The Beast and the Prince (they\u2019re not even attempting to disguise their intentions at this point).\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 20 we find out that VIRM wants to annihilate the klaxosaurs who retreated underground, similar to the spirals (who lived underground) fighting the anti-spirals in Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n-Mecha\u2019s transforming to absurd levels of scale and power like Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n-Instrumentality, much?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the real \u201cbutt\u201d of my issue with this series, and this concerns the \u201cdoggy-styled\u201d positions the girls must assume to pilot their Evangelions \u2014 I mean, their FranXX\u2019s.  It\u2019s one thing to engage the viewer through needless fan-service, but there are limits one can go before coming off as ridiculous.  Kill la Kill, another studio Trigger production, already ingratiated the anime community to the concept of excessive lasciviousness, the difference being: they did so with a self-deprecating tone.  This show, on the other hand, is treating the matter with solemnity; and sure, they attempt to shoehorn in a half-assed explanation, but the whole immortality subtlety doesn\u2019t fit well with the predetermined conclusion.  Immortality, as a concept, lends itself to numerous paths of intrigue about the overall worth of life, the monotony of existence, and the deterioration of cognitive faculties.  Alas, Darling in the FranXX (i.e. Studio Trigger) does not choose to expand on any of these philosophical conundrums, and instead, elects to go for sex and procreation \u2014 no surprise.\\n\\n\r\nHold your frustration back, because it gets worse.  In episode 8, when the girl\u2019s clothing gets disintegrated by the Klaxosaur \u201cgoo,\u201d revealing portions of their bodies to the boys, they decide to pull-out (Mitsuru should have done the same thing, hehe) the ultimate TV trope: dividing the house in half, with tape.  They straight up took this out of the I Love Lucy playbook.  Considering that sitcom television is the lowest form of televised entertainment known to man, it speaks volumes about an anime that takes inspiration from said \u201cart form.\u201d  It\u2019s like the anime staff couldn\u2019t be bothered to think of one original concept, so they just mashed a conglomerate of  ideas into a CGI mess of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe suggestive positioning of the girls, along with the incognizant sexual innuendo\u2019s surpasses the realm of idiocy, resembling the writing complexity of a soft-core porno.  We get it, the stamen (the boys) and the pistil (the girls) are references to the sexual organs of a flower; and the lack of trust (i.e. love) leads to incompatibility and a flaccid conclusion.  In other words: sex is not as meaningful without the love; especially when partners are switched amongst each other, implying unsympathetic cucking.  Then, in the final episodes, Nine Alpha rides with Hiro (bisexuality?), harkening back to Gurren Lagann when Simon put aside his differences with Viral in their final battle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the first episode when Zero Two is catching fish with her mouth, in the nude.  It was a senseless scene that provided nothing more than reference material for future waxing sessions (you know what I\u2019m talking about).  Seriously, though.  Why must Studio Trigger continue their quest of inducing the most boners in the anime community?  It use to be an art to inject promiscuousness into anime, now its so ubiquitous that if feels burdensome to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you thought this review was scathing up until this point, then you would be correct. Nevertheless, stay tuned, because I\u2019m about to discuss the worst aspect of the show: the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\u2026They all suck!\\n\\n\r\nOkay.  That\u2019s not much of an analysis, but what can we really say about these characters?  Zero Two acts like a temperamental five year-old, who condescends to her superiors and comrades because that\u2019s what passes for cool nowadays.  She also likes to slather her food in honey and shove it down her \u201cdarling\u2019s\u201d mouth.  Speaking of which, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse: Yuno, from Mirai Nikki, saying \u201cYuki\u201d, or Zero Two saying \u201cdarling.\u201d  They are both excruciating to the eardrums.  Her \u201cdarling,\u201d Hiro, is your typical mundane protagonist, lacking identifying characteristics that would engage the viewer and become interested in his plight towards becoming a FranXX pilot.  He is, however, infatuated with Zero Two to the point of feeling dead inside without her presence (get over it dude, your like, 14?)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, unfortunately, is a compilation of tired tropes that have been utilized time and time again.  In fact, I can\u2019t remember any of their names, so I won\u2019t waste your time, and mine, looking them up just to explain how trivial their roles really are.  Suffice it to say, the cast is a representation of the anime staff\u2019s laziness, but considering this show has a higher rating than the reboot of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (which has an excellent cast of characters), it should come as no surprise why anime writers continue to shove monotonous characters down our throats ad infinitum.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to sound too presumptuous, but this may be the worst anime I have ever seen in my life \u2014 or, at the very least, it\u2019s in the running.  As it stands, the current list of the worst anime goes as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n\r\n1)  Mirai Nikki\\n\r\n2)  Sword Art Online\\n\r\n3)  Bio Broly\\n\r\n4)  Boku no Pico\\n\r\n5)  Darling in the FranXX\\n\\n\r\nConsidering they copied everything else from Evangelion, it is only fitting to compliment Darling in the FranXX for their crappy achievement.\\n\\n\r\nCongratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 0/10\\n\r\nPlot: 0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10 (by default)\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhat kind of fuckery is this?\u201d Amy Winehouse.\r\nWell, folks, it\u2019s finally time to talk about the most notorious anime of 2018. Darling in the Franxx. \r\nAfter the success of Little Witch Academia and Kill la Kill, as well as the unfortunate failure of Kiznaver Studio Trigger, decided to make Darling In The Franxx but with the help of A1 Pictures/Cloverworks. Like many others on the internet, I was really excited for Darling in the Franxx. Maybe that was my biggest mistake and like with Beatless, Black Clover and Re:Zero I was expecting too much. However, even if the anime had failed to live up toexpectations the anime would be still be entertaining so bad it\u2019s good to watch. Unfortunately Darling in the Franxx is not so bad it\u2019s a good type of shows. In fact, Darling in the Franxx is by far one of the worst written and directed anime I have ever seen from this medium. Say what you want about Black Clover, The Asterisk Wars, Big Order and Eromanga Sensei for being for worst shows than this but least those shows had the so bad its good effect where despite these shows being horrendous least they were actually funny. This show from start to finish was not funny at all as it only got more insulting and stupid as it progressed and because of that am going to end my intro here because since this show doesn't give a damn about its viewer so why should I?\\n\\n\r\nGod help me.\\n\\n\r\nAct I: The broken written and directed mess of a story that has no idea of it it's doing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the distant future. The world is ruined, and humanity establishes mobile fort cities called \u201cplantations\u201d. Pilots produced inside Plantation live in Mistilteinn, also known as the \u201cbirdcage.\u201d Children living there know nothing of the outside world or the freedom of the sky. Their lives consist of battling to carry out missions. Their enemies are mysterious giant life forms known as Klaxosaur, and the children pilot machines called Franxx to face off against them. For the children, riding the Franxx proves their existence. The story follows a boy named Hiro who goes by the code 016 has lost motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out class graduation\u00a0Hiro goes to the lack where he encounters a girl with two horns and she quickly introduces by her code name Zero Two. She has been infamously known as a partner killer where none of her partners survive after the third ride. Before they properly interact they the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. After Zero Two failed attempt to engage the Klaxosaur\u00a0as well her partner dying Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her and from there Zero Two, Hiro, and the crew must fight against the Klaxosaur\u2019s in order to save humanity.\\n\r\nThere are so many problems with this show I seriously don\u2019t know where to begin.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story is very dull and boring as hell. I didn\u2019t care about many events in the story because I was bored by them and I thought they were poorly executed. It\u2019s also rips off a lot of better mecha anime without understanding of what made them good for example Hiro and Zero are just poor-mans versions of Demonic and Anemone where they relationships are similar but it was done better in Eureka Seven as there was a lot of build up for Demonic and Anemone to grow as characters before they formed a relationship with each other. Also, did I forget that Demonic and Anemone are far better-written characters than Zero Two and Hiro will ever be.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx also has some of the worst pacing I have ever seen in any anime as the show consistently waste its time on pointless bullshit instead of focusing on relevant things that are important to the overall narrative.\\n\r\nThe world-building for Darling in the Franxx is god awful. Besides from the episodes 7, 10 and 19 where the show\u00a0briefly did world-building in a bad way the show never even bothers at establishing its own setting and because of this, the world in Darling in the Franxx is incredibly empty. Where do the Klaxosaurs come from? What\u00b4s this organization that's fighting against them? In which time is this series set? What kind of government there is there this world?\u00a0How old are each parasite in the series are? This show never explains any of these things because screw worldbuilding lets just have characters go out with the pathetic and cringe-worthy character drama that is contrived as hell. These issues along with the pacing would eventually bite the show in the ass later on which I will talk about in a bit.\\n\r\nDarling In The Franxx is also the dumbest show ever to take itself too seriously where the show tries to be all serious, smart and edgy with its monologues, symbolism, and themes but because of the horrendous tone shifts and flashy fan-service it completely makes the show very pretentious as a result of its themes and speaking of themes.\\n\r\nThis show also does a horrendous job at presenting its themes and topics to a point certain characters in the show just preach about sex, love, and family all over the fucking place without any context and real reasoning. It doesn't the fact this show has the maturity level of a horney 12-year-old.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue of Darling in the Franxx is how it really doesn\u2019t know what show it wants to be as it keeps changing its damm genre in almost every freaking episode?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be balls off the wall dumb mecha show?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a sitcom?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a mystery anime?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a slice of life show?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a coming of age story?\\n\\n\r\nDoes it want to be a serious mecha show that deals with a lot of sensitive topics and themes?\\n\r\nWho the hell knows because this anime clearly doesn\u2019t and top it all out because this show tries to squeeze in many genres as possible the pacing and the tone of the series becomes screwed.\\n\\n\r\nAct II: The boring and\u00a0infuriating cliched empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation and character development in Darling in the Franxx are practically non-existent thanks to the show having a nasty habit of using certain elements that completely prevent any form of character growth and because of that am currently struggling to find a series with more empty characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur male protagonist Hiro is a boring empty husk who barely even capable of producing the energy required being a mecha protagonist. He has no personality on his own and there\u2019s nothing that stands about him as the way his written and designs is awful. Plus all the character development that he gets feels forced and unnatural. Not to mention he becomes a much worser character as the series goes on but we will get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two is an awfully written waifu pandering character with no substance.\\n\r\nDespite being the character that has the most personality from this bland cast she is still a pathetic written character that has no substance that doesn\u2019t develop for shit. She also has a stupid and annoying sexy horney personality where she constantly preaches about being with Hiro.\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for this piece of shit character is that she is just a god damm wish fulfillment/waifu pandering character where outside of the awfully predictable romance with Hiro she just there to pander to the lowest common denominator. Screw this character and her wish-fulfillment bullcrap\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters from the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation are absolutely awful.\\n\r\nZorome and Miku are both loud mouthed tsundere\u2019s who like to yell a lot. They don't have a purpose to the narrative at all other to be background noise.\\n\r\nGoro is a boring bro type character that we all have seen before who is very friendly and protective to people.\\n\r\nFutoshi is your typical fat friendly guy who likes to stuff his mouth with food all the time.\\n\r\nKokoro is a shy girl who has a good heart.\\n\r\nIkuno is a very calm and collected girl who loves to read books.\\n\r\nMitsuru is the prideful guy who has a superiority complex.\\n\r\nIchigo or as I like to call her Bitchigo for being an insufferable contrived bitch is your cookie cutter childhood character that we all seen before.\\n\\n\r\nDo you guys see a problem here? Not only the characters in Darling in the Franxx are tropey as fuck but they can't even stand up on they own as characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are all equally awful and not even worth mentioning at all as they all feel like Gurren Lagann and Evangelion character rejects.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this worse is how this show plays with its audience with its half fast character development that didn\u2019t matter thanks to character resets.\\n\r\nOne of the examples of this was in episode 10 where the show tried to develop Zorome as a character you know that brat who behaves like Boruto. He got great character development in that episode and by the end of the episode they decided to kill off all the characters development that he had and went back to the same loudmouth tsundere character from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t me started with Episode 14 with the whole Ichigo bullshit. Okay while she didn\u2019t lose her memory or anything she devolved to a whiny and unsympathetic bitch of a captain who constantly gets too emotional about Hiro and that completely who against all of her previous character development in episode 9 with Goro. The final coffin for Bitchigo is that as soon as Zero Two leaves she literally takes advantage of Hiro by kissing him.\\n\r\nBitch, we get it you don\u2019t like Zero Two but did you really have go out of your fucking way to tell everyone in the room that members from the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation won\u2019t take apart in the battle unless they tell kick Zero Two off and on top of that you go confess to him even though you got Goro as a love interest. I understand you want to project your childhood friend from danger but this was the dumbest way to do it and because of that you just became one of the dumbest characters to ever exist in an anime\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also that stupid love subplot with Kokoro and Mitsuru but I will get to that in a bit because that subplot alone killed the show it an idiotic fashion.\\n\r\nHonestly, what is a point of being a coming of age story if you only to going to reset character development and motivations? I swear the staff was god damm clueless knowing the basic elements of a coming of age story.\\n\\n\r\nAct III: The cringe homage festival aka episodes 20-24\\n\r\n(Spoilers Ahead)\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the first 19 episodes were awful you ain't seen nothing yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe final 5 episodes of Darling in the Franxx are some of the worst final episodes I have ever seen in any anime.\\n\r\nNot only it was horrendously build up but the way that the show that disgustingly changed its tone was infuriating because it took one of the shows biggest problems and took it to a next level where the show tries to squeeze all the story elements from NGE, Kill la Kill, Gunbuster and Gurren Lagann without understanding of what made those\u00a0story elements great and because of those reasons the pacing, narrative, direction, production values and especially worldbuilding becomes broken.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like the creators in the show had no freaking idea of what the hell they were doing plus you could clearly tell they were on a tight deadline.\\n\r\nI can even predict how the staff of the show was handing the final 5 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: Hey what episode are we on now?\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Ummmm episode 20 I think\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: OH SHIT\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: What the hell. We need to get going as we only have 4 episodes left now. How do we fix this?\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: (Looks for Gundam 00 Movie and Chicken Little Blu Rays and shows them to Creator 1) Have you tried aliens that usually end things.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: But isn\u2019t that cheap.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Do you have a better idea.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: I told you we shouldn\u2019t have spent so much time on individual characters only for them to not develop at all,\\n\\n\r\nCreator 2: Too late now.\\n\\n\r\nCreator 1: Screw it. Just add aliens in the series and call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this worst is that if your someone like me who likes goes back to watch earlier episodes of the show to catch certain story/character elements that you missed the first time around. However, in the process of revisiting certain episodes in Darling in the Franxx you will start to see poorly made and directed this show is and it got to a point where you could have removed or shortened certain episodes like for example episode 8 Boy x Girls.\\n\r\nThat episode alone was the beginning of the shows horrible writing and direction because only they did a horrendous job at exploring the theme of puberty but the reasoning for the girls to set the line for the dorms was horrendous and contrived.\\n\r\nThis conflict alone would have been solved in 5 minutes but thanks to this show stupidity it decided to drag it out to point where it becomes contrived with its stupid character drama that had no reason to exist other to preach the theme of puberty to the audience.\\n\r\nGirls in this show I understand you want to protect your bodies but in a war-zone, especially on a scale battle, no one will give a shit about your sex life because in a battle you either kill or be killed.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started with the whole romance subplot between Kokoro and\u00a0Mitsuru where instead of the show foreshadowing and building up story events. The show decides wastes its time on two episodes on a  terribly contrived romance subplot that characters who have no character chemistry with each other whatsoever. Plus that subplot didn\u2019t even matter because as Hiro decided to pull off a wedding for these two the show decided to take that subplot and flushes it down the toilet by having these characters lose they memories after being captured by the Nines. What made this subplot even worse thanks to a dialogue asspull by Mitsuru in episode 23 where he states that ''even without our memories we can start all over again'' even though the show had made it clear at the end of episode 18 that Kokoro and Mitsuru cannot regain or make new memories with each other whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWords cannot describe of how contrived and poorly executed this subplot was because the only reason why this subplot even exist at all is to showcased the shows fanfic writing. The show already had a lot of fanatic writing, to begin with, but this one takes the cake for being the most insufferable subplot I have ever seen in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't just end there Episode 19 is a complete waste of time. While the show for the last time tried to do its world-building it failed miserably becauae everything else on that episode ended up being pointless. Not to mention that episode quickly devolved to a typical sob backstory for Dr Franxx of how he became the person that he is today thanks to his motivations in the past. However two episodes later he get's killed off Akame Ga Kill style where chararters get they backstories or sob stories before they are killed off one to two episodes later. What's a point of having a backstory of a chararter if your only going to kill them off one to two episodes later? This is atrocious writing and direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is Hiro as a character. Do you remember when where I previously called Hiro an empty husk? Well after episode 15 this sack of shit literally devolved into a freaking Gary Sue who preaches about Hiro. I don\u2019t know about you guys but I have never seen a protagonist in a fictional work that literally started off being horrible empty husk to being an insufferable preachy Gary Sue where every single piece of dialogue is about Zero Two and nothing else. It also gotten to a point where in episode 22 where Hiro would rather choose to save his sex object aka Zero Two in space instead of helping his friends and follow parasyte survive. Some say that his change of personality from being an empty shell is a good thing but for actually writing it's not because at the of the day he went from an empty husk to a preachy Gary Sue who only cares about Zero Two.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on talking about the shows plotholes such as Hiro being able to ride with 9\u03b1 who is also a male character as well not a nine's member, characters not reconsidering that Ikuno hair colour has changed to white, Ichigo being able to plot her mecha even though there is no male pilot, members of APE only wiping out only Kokoro and Misturu memories instead of all the\u00a0Thirteenth Plantation members to Zero Two being able to transform into a mecha at the end of episode 23 but since this show doesn't give a damm about writing and directing why I should I even bother.\\n\r\n(End Of Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nAm finally done talking about the show's plot and chararters.\\n\r\nOverall the story was hot garbage, really hot garbage. This felt like an awful Gainax fanfic that was done by a horney 12 year old on fanfic.net. The pacing was awful the character drama was insufferable. I didn\u2019t give a shit about any of the characters and writing/directing especially in the final 5 episodes were god awful. This is one of the worst told stories I had ever had the displeasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nAct IV: The almighty cheap and uninspired production values that have no soul and charm.\\n\r\nSaying that Darling in the Franxx look like shit is a fast understatement because this is by far one of the worst looking and animated shows I have ever seen from this decade.\\n\r\nIt may look decent at first but the more of watch this show you will start to see how lazy animated the show is as it starts to use animation shortcuts to cover up the show ugliness and lazy directing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all horrendously bad and uninspired.\\n\r\nHiro is basically Dominic from Eureka Seven but downgraded.\\n\r\nZero Two who despite being the best-looking character in the show is a downgraded\u00a0Anemone from Eureka Seven with added horns on her face and a bit of makeup.\\n\r\nIchigo looks like a more deformed version of Rem from Re:Zero.\\n\r\nZorome looks like a blander Boruto with that brown hair.\\n\r\nMiku looks more like an Asuka reject that Hideaki Anno decided to throw in the bin. decided to and the rest of the ranged from being uninspired knockoff to being downright awful especially Futoshi who is by far one of the worst characters designs I have ever seen any anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha designs are even worse as they all look like they were done by a horney 12-year-old. Am sure that the same horney 12-year-old designed all the\u00a0Klaxosaur's in this show\u00a0because they all look terrible.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I didn\u2019t like the art is how cheap it looks in terms of color. It\u2019s like someone from secondary school in art class who is not good at art decided to paint over the background, character to even mecha designs forgetting to add detail in the progress. It just makes the anime look cheap and lazy.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me started how inconstant the art was as at various times character to even the mechas go off model to a point where the show can look incredibly ugly.\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is just flat out horrendous. Still frames up the ass, characters constantly going off-model, horrible fight choreography, stiff and awkward movement, to even the frame rate at one moment of episode 23 where the show had the frame-rate of 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall visuals were just awful is uninspired and have no charm and soul.\\n\\n\r\nACT V: The somewhat enjoyable soundtrack and great opening and ending themes.\\n\r\nThe music is the best thing about this show. The soundtrack is pretty alright what it was as it does a good job at presenting its setting and tone of the series then again having a good soundtrack doesn't automatically make an anime any good.\\n\r\nThe opening Kiss to Death is a great opening theme that is very catchy that I really enjoyed especially the version 2 of the same opening from episode 16 onwards with the different lyrics.\\n\r\nAll the ending themes are pretty good and catchy in they own ways.\\n\r\nIn short, both the opening and ending themes are good and it\u2019s easily the best thing to ever come out from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nACT VI Finale: The borderline hentai dub acting and audio quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good overall that is filled with talented Seiyuus that did a good job with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nThe dub, on the other hand, is absolutely horrendous. There was not a single good performance in the dub as all the voice actors sound like they were doing a hentai production. Not only that but it makes an already horrendous series almost unwatchable thanks to its shitty audio quality.\\n\r\nAs a person who loves English Dub as a whole watching this show dubbed episode 1-20 was pure misery. One of the worst dubs I have ever heard.\\n\r\nIf you had to pick a choice stick with the sub for this one than again why would you even watch this broken mess of a show, to begin with?\\n\\n\r\nEpilogue.\\n\\n\r\n\u201c\u266b\u266b\u266b\u266b It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down...\u266b\u266b\u266b\u266b\"\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s was Darling in the Franxx.\\n\r\nA broken, pathetically written and directed train-wreck mess of a show that disgustingly plays with it's audience emotions. It has pathetic characters, horrendously written character drama, contrived subplots that have no reason to exists other to pad out time, laughable production values, pathetic world-building, horrendous pacing, poorly executed themes and most importantly this show has no respect of what it trying to homage/rip-off as it keeps on poorly homaging a lot of Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, Gunbuster and Eureka 7 elements without having any understanding of what made those shows great in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the music there is nothing and I mean NOTHING redeemable or good about this series whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the worst animes I ever had the displeasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to say this. When even the worst mecha shows like Gundam Seed Destiny, Brain Powered and Aldnoah Zero where despite them being more flawed they have more things going for them and manages to outclass you in certain aspects you know you have screwed up on a scale that is immeasurable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to a good mecha show that features great character drama and great story elements go watch Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann or Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from Studio Trigger? Watch Little Witch Academia Space Patrol Luluco and Kill la Kill.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good anime from A1 Pictures? Watch Shinsekai Yori, Space Brothers, and Magi.\\n\r\nAvoid this show like the plague.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 0.5/10",

            "content": "For the better half of my life, I have been looking for an anime series where bunch of kids --who don't know what sexual intercourse is-- fight against tensai super robot power rangers inside settings which has plot for 6 episodes, but still lasts for 24: Filling the remaining air time with b-grade melodramatic past stories, and current time with slice of life soap opera which looks like the anime version of Jersey Shore. For such a specific request to be filled, I had almost lost all hope. Then my boy Trigger arrived to town and not only did this exact thing, but filled theseries with epic symbolism. Basically, whenever anything happens, it is a sexual innuendo about relationships, hugging, kissing and dicks. Really, thanks. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual story centers around our ten kids who are trying to find their soulmate/significant other/person with whom they share the best body compatibility with. They do this by piloting mecha in the pairs of two and fighting against these things called Klaxowhatever. Klaxosaur, just like everything and anything else, is a reference. If you remove xo from the name, you get the combination of klasa and ur, klasa standing for \"class\" in polish - and xo obviously meaning hugs and kisses - giving us klaxosaur as: \"U R hugs and kisses class.\" Same thing can be said about the actual title of this series. Darling in the FranXX basically standing for Darling in the Fran hugs hugs. The whole \"two parties fight against each others until one collapses\" is initially just a debate over should you remain loyal to your significant other and are hugs truly enough. The robots think it is not enough, and the whole series is basically our characters realizing the same little by little. This is, indeed, the plot of this series. Pretty cool, huh. \\n\\n\r\nThere are in total of ten main characters here (in case you forgot what you read 17 seconds ago). By 10 main characters, I mean we have 3 actual characters and the remaining 7 are filler people. The characters are just great. Oni girl is basically a whore who is looking for her prince charming. I musn't runway guy does the opposite his name suggests. And the third wheel dude and the most potential prince charming... exists. I call this trio The Cuck Squad, by the way. Rest of the \"characters\" are so much filler I believe the thought process behind creating them was something like: \"Hmmm. we need more people here. Let's see........ One fat guy? Yes, one fat guy coming in.......... girl who wears glasses? ...... Oh yes, f**k yes.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe production is based Trigger. Not exactly as ADHD as Kill la Kill nor a masterpiece from every aspect like Inferno Cop, but at least doesn't ruin the series like they did with Uchuu Patrol Luluko and Ninja Slayer. The OST could use some Tomatodermewhatever they called the band in KlK, and some tedious German language vocals would be great addition to put in the mix, but otherwise I was pleased to get a confirmation that every Trigger anime from now on will be the exact same thing production wise as all the rest have been. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, my expectations were very mixed. I heard so much praise and flaming, and after watching it, I have to conclude that this series can be liked and disliked for infinite different reasons. In one way, the series is a clusterfuck, the seasonal shitstorm, the trainwreck and sum of all wagons. This obviously makes it an obligatory watch for every critic so they can hit it with 1/10 and call the worst thing ever because once again you can criticize FranXX for thousand and one things. On the other hand, Darling is often so ridiculous that it can offer enormous entertainment value with ironic viewing. All you need is a sense of humor and some chill. The drama, the cute and comfy stuff and the happy moments will serve those are ready to take them for what they are. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final verdict: Critics and the likes can write thousand pages long analysis of all the things that are wrong in this one, people with sense of humor laugh their asses off, and people who approach it with more \"casual\" and open mindset will enjoy this show for what it is. This series has something for each and everyone. If a series like that is not a masterpiece, then I do not know what is. 10/10. \\n",

            "content": "It's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. It has a lot of things acting against. Yeah, butt-piloted mechs are silly. Yeah, the mech designs themselves are like Voltron had a bad hair day. Yes, much of the plot is composed of teen melodrama. And yes, the show clearly wears its heart on its sleeves, drawing inspiration from the last two decades of mecha anime. \r\nIt's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. Why do I think it's worth the time? \r\nWhere Darling shines is in how all of the best parts of its disparate inspirations and intrigues blend together. Clearly drawing fromthe names most anime fans are familiar with - Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagan, Evangelion, and the like - Darling draws on a dramatic flair while slowly drip-feeding the viewer with a slow-burn bit of world-building. What are Klaxosaurs exactly? Why do they want Plantation? Why are there rarely adults around? Why does the youth have to fight for the Plantation, and why do they have to be in pairs? Each episode explores each of these topics, little by little, further paving the world with information, both for the characters and the viewers themselves. What will this result in? That depends on the direction of the series. But very similar to Evangelion itself - with it's seemingly random, monster-of-the-week styled Angel battles - less is more, and the intrigue behind why things are happening leaves the viewer eager to learn more about the odd, dystopic world around the characters, so that the dots can slowly be connected over the larger arc of the series. \\n\\n\r\nBy deliberately obfuscating the reasons behind the larger plot at play, this allows the show to play out as a character drama. It is explained quite explicitly that the main cast is \"different\" from other mech pilots in this world. Thus, in a Breakfast Club mishmash of characters concepts thrown together, the show gleefully begins to layer out each individual's backstory. \\n\\n\r\nMain characters like Hiro are probably the least interesting, acting as a surrogate for the viewer to this world. But even then, his leadership and charisma to the rest of the crew bonds them all together. He's not just some faceless Kirito, and also certainly doesn't have the depth of someone like Shinji; but he proves that he is a unique soul of his own, with goals and ambitions (even if they mostly are obsessively regarding one character). 02 is clearly an anti-hero, someone the viewer is meant to hate, and the caring attitude of Hiro is the only thing that binds her abrasive personality down. While I don't particularly like their relationship - 02 is quite toxic/abusive and definitely ain't best girl - having Hiro act as a foil to her combat abilities and personality which lacks control allows the two to operate in junction with each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters come into play with their own interrelationships. If you haven't seen the octahedron memes, those constant inter-dependencies between characters come into play in various ways to further develop both the characters themselves as well as for climactic moments of trial during the plot. Two people aren't getting along because of teen melodrama? Mech stops working, everyone might die. Two characters get into a petty argument? They can't pilot anymore, and it ripples through the morale of the rest of the group. Certain characters are infatuated with others rather than their own partner? The team dynamics suddenly switch, both affecting the combat portions, the relationships between characters, and heightening the drama itself. Darling is very good at showing how seemingly petty melodrama can resonate through a large cast of varied characters, who have shared goals, but different investments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, and sound barely need to be discussed. All are stellar, and nothing less than should be expected from a TRIGGER production. Having the talents of A-1 pictures to help boost the fluid action while also enhancing the quieter and more emotional scenes, which ring ever more gorgeous as time goes on. An epic fight with a giant monster has all the bombast you expect from a high-octane mecha anime, while a character trailing their crush's footsteps in the sand is able to draw out both happiness as well as a painful twang of melancholy. The music has a particular orchestral style that, although similar to many other series, has a certain pomp reminiscent of Kill La Kill, giving each scene their appropriate emotional flair. The first ED, \"Torikago,\" is especially good, ending the early episodes with a strong refrain to deep you intrigued in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe slowest episodes in the first half of the series begin to drag down the show, as it slogs through run-of-the-mill beach and bathhouse episodes. And although there are no compliments that can be given to these inductions into the series, it is nice that the show at least stays true to the characters still being developed over time. Even in these slight moments that can seem irrelevant and purposeless in the larger scheme, the deeper commitment to drip-feeding the audience with ever-expanding social connections and worldbuilding pay off as the series begins to shift gears into the end of the first cour. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to not like Darling in the FranXX. But pushing beyond some of the trappings of its genre, and letting the world and character development continue to expand, it is quick to see why this show is so rewarding not for its EPIC HYPE, but for its dense character evolution over time. This is a show mired in feelings and emotion, and the scenes within it are best appreciated through the lens of an emotional viewer: someone who tries to feel out a scene rather than logically analyzing it, and understanding that you aren't meant to know the details, but are instead asked to let the world around you shift your feelings, just like the shifting loyalties and persuasions of the characters within.",

            "content": "I decided to write a review after episode 6 as this series keep getting better and better after each episode for me. If they keep this up until the very last episode I will definitely make this anime as one of my recommendation to people who want to watch some quality mechs anime.\r\nStory (9):\r\nThe story itself about the pilots of the mech, their relationship with other pilot and I think about finding their purpose in life other than fighting with their mechs. The beginning of the story itself is quite typical. The usual boy meet mysterious girl (Eureka 7 did this, Evangelion did this, CometLucifer did this, Code Geass did this, etc). However it is by no mean bad, I love Eureka 7 and if this executed well I might love this one too. A the series progress I think the story improve and keep getting better. It has enough mysteries to keep me wanting more and looked forward to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10):\\n\r\nOne of the best part of this series is its actions scene, episode 6's fighting scene is so awesome. The duo animation studios work really well in here. There is no inconsistency in the animation. The animation is fluid, the character, the mech as expected of A1 Picture and Trigger working together.\\n\r\nThe action simply the BEST in this season for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9):\\n\r\nThere is one OST that play in every epic moment (The climax in episode 6 for example) which I really love. Torikago and Kiss of Death is one of my favourite ED and OP song this season aside of Sora Yori Mo Tooi Basho's and Yuru Camp's. I am waiting for the second cour ED and OP song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\r\nAt first I hate how Hiro's act, but as the series progress up until episode 6, He developed and He begin to grow on me. On other hand I really like Zero Two since the beginning of the series. Zerome and Miku is also a pair  that really memorable to me especially Zerome because of his arrogance. Some memorable character for me are enough for me to give this part a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nAs a mechs fans mysel, I watched a lot of mechs series, some which I enjoy some other not so. This one is one of the mechs series I really enjoy.The battle scene, the character, the story.\\n\r\nI am looking forward for new episode every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 10 =  9.2):\\n\r\nThis anime keep getting better and better and I hope It will always be. Give this series a chance especially if you like mechs. Don't let the excessive amount of fans service put you off, this anime has a lot more to offer. For me, as of now this is on my top 3 for this season. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've never watch an anime with mechs on them though I heard them and see some but never actually watch it. This will be the first one, and as I can say, its the best one. Though it might change as episodes progress but I hope not.\r\nSo for the story, well, its great though the way they control the mechs will be much better if they just rely on batteries xD. The story focus on their so called Parasites which are pilots of the mechs. They think that their whole life was depend on piloting a mech even though theres alot of things worth yourlife, well thats what the anime tells me, it differ to person to person.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, its actually good. The quality really suit the modern age. Even they still using  keypads on their phones. The animation is smooth, the animation is great as the art style it self.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, well I can say its plain but its still good for my ears. There wasn't that much battle scene yet in the anime so I can't really say if it needs to change its music when action scene took place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime was relatable. And the MC is the one I can relate to. Other characters are also memorable, as I meet different person with the same characteristic as this supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment, well, its really fun to watch. Most of the scene I watch are very fun mostly because on how they control their mechs and how they talk about on riding them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime score an all out of 10. It also has potential. I recommend watching it. I just don't get it why they don't put Romance aswell Action on the genre\\n\\n\r\nAdditional!\\n\r\n- So After I watch Ep.7, I wasn't expecting anything like that but even though its a beach episode it turns out to be improtant (For my prespecrive) as character development for Ichigo somehow started here aswell a story on why Humanity become something like this.",

            "content": "I'll be as fair and objective as possible here, additionally, this review will be practically completely spoiler-free! \r\nStory: 3 (Poor)\r\nArt: 8 (Very Good)\r\nSound: 6 (Fair)\r\nCharacter: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nEnjoyment: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nOverall: 1 (Pathetic)\r\nSome can be accredited to its massive hype up until its release, but also to the objective analysis of the different parts that make up this anime. I will be delving into the different parts that I rated it on, and explaining why I chose that number. Hopefully you can come to your own conclusion about whether you'd want to watch this or not, or whether you agree with me or not, but regardless;\r\nLet's getright into the parts:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nThere is simply no other way of putting it. The story follows utterly generic story cliches that have been done many times before. Whilst I understand this solely doesn't invalidate the anime, the sheer amount of plot holes and evidences of terrible writing does. You don't get fed a lot of information about the world, and not even in a purposeful way; whilst mystery is nice, it requires a balance of given information to keep you interested in the mysteriousness. Darling in the FranXX, however, lacks any mysteriousness as it also lacks information to begin with. You, the viewer, feel very lost watching it, as you try and piece together the characters to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a beach episode, which logically doesn't make much sense in the story and was extremely shoehorned into it even though prior statements showed that a \"beach episode\" is highly unlikely to be able to occur. These changes in the story (ie. inputting a sole fanservice episode, even when the story would dictate otherwise) show that the writer's intentions were not even towards forwarding or developing the story. Perhaps money, or a sickening desire to make fanservice, were the real reasons behind the completely-lacking-plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe world does look interesting, however, but this is more accredited to the art, since the world isn't explained at all, which is a shame to put such art to waste. It's like seeing something amazing that really sticks out in a painting, but never being able to find the true reason why that object was placed there, or what it is - this is the only kind of intrigue you get about the story; an annoying kind. In the first few episodes, the story progresses alarmingly quickly. This is given to the fact that the story skips over things that might seem important simply to move to the next big plot twist, however, the plot twists are extremely predictable. The next few episodes actually completely copy each other, with the exact same kinds of things happening in the story, repeated 3 episodes in a row. For example, A happens, then B happens by surprise, and C has to fix it. It became extraordinarily apparent that the next episode would follow suit, and I physically predicted the episode before it happened. Again, it copied the same template, which was so painfully obvious I had no enjoyment watching the episode (as with all of the episodes).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, there are definitely animes with worse stories. There are plotholes in many major publications, but regardless is still worth mentioning due to their glaring obviousness in Darling in the FranXX. If you don't think about the story, and just watched the fight scenes, I would admit that it would be an enjoyable watch. However, this does show the precedent example of how the context of the story actually somehow makes the intermittent (and rare) fight scenes worse.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is a weak point. In some later episodes, plot holes and problems become severely apparent. \"The plot\" is used to do practically impossible things, with little expectation. You actually feel quite dumb, as the anime is practically assuming you wouldn't notice the plot holes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe distinct 'Trigger style' is what initially drew a lot of people to this anime, as the name carries good connotations for most. Kill la Kill, Kiznaiver and Little Witch Academia all carried the Trigger name, and were massively successful, so it's without a doubt that there were already high expectations. Unfortunately, this is where its let down. Sometimes the Trigger style art is obviously 'switched out' or at least touched by A1 Pictures in some way, most notably on a lot of the fanservice moments. Really makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of that, the artwork is nice. The colours go well together, for example, Zero Two's mecha Strelezia, has a great contrasting colour scheme. The world vibrantly comes to life, especially during large-scale scenes. Unfortunately, the action scenes are a let down, a tiny bit, but still illustrate the battles quite well.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, made apparent by the beach episode, the characters are oddly disproportional. Younger, smaller characters have massive breasts which are completely impossible for their stature, yet are shoehorned into the episodes, whilst the \"flat-chested\" characters (basically anyone without C+ chests) feel bad about it. With no place in this anime, it becomes amazingly jarring when you see those parts of the character designs, and completely understand the artist's intentions behind the character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there isn't much else to say for the art. The colours and art style are pleasant to look at, but are let down by the blatant use of disproportionate characters for more sex appeal, and some fight scenes not being as fluid as they could be. I also have to deduct a point for pointless cinematic black bars appearing randomly. I thought they helped make the fights more cinematic, for some reason, but I saw them appear even during random conversations. It confused me and detracted my attention away from the content itself. Still, a solid piece to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThis one was harder to rate. At not one point did I consider the sound to feel 'off' except for, more often than not, the music. Sounds for everything else is practically pristine - its powerful, pristine, and matches whatever is going on, and at whatever scale, too (some objects in the world are large, for example, and sounds given off match that well). However, I noticed several times where the music used did not fit the situation or feel of the scene at all. Usually it was with the music during, and around, fight scenes. Some times it would play utterly unfitting music that actually distracted you from the scene itself, which is something that shouldn't happen in any anime, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nSince it doesn't stick out, and is let down several times by unfitting music, it isn't amazing, but nothing to complain horribly about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nWell, in addition to the parts of the review that talked about the story, the characters fit in next. They are bland, to say the least. The most relatable character for most viewers is probably Goro - he's down-to-earth and overall a nice guy. Unfortunately, he is not the protagonist. The protagonist, Hiro, is a carbon-copy of Kirito (from SAO), but objectively worse and actually lacking any form of personality. He makes dumb decisions, not even for the sake of 'its a mistake', but completely illogical. For example, there are multiple times where the conversation is turning towards a point where we might actually learn something about a character's viewpoint/feelings, but in both situations, Hiro, gets distracted by 'something' (aka an event that was shoehorned into the plot, completely coincidental, and would never happen between people talking, ever), and you completely lose the buildup. I would suppose, however, that I do like the side characters, as a positive. They are very relatable, and actually react to conversation in a much more realistic sense, unlike the protagonist. If you are okay and can deal with a complete self-insert basic protagonist, and can see past him to see the more interesting characters, it would be bearable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the weakest point of the anime. It's such a shame for characters with strong visual representation to be so poorly-written. They fulfill tropes to a disgusting degree, although that can be argued to help the story by letting the reader's instinct about particular tropes (eg. the fat guy eats a lot) to extrapolate information to help construct a context. Apart from this, it's difficult to get any more information about the characters other than what's scarcely fed to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are weak; some are strongly relatable, but you easily begin to realise that their small screen-time is jarring and disturbing. One character introduced in Episode 5 for about 5 seconds is seen again in 6, for about the best of 30 seconds. Even in this short space of time, they already give off an amazing air and vibe of mystery, with me desiring to want more. Why couldn't I feel this for all the other protagonists and side characters? It really shows the shortcomings in the character development, compared to other animes by the same studios, for example.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 1 (Pathetic)\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's hard to be objective about this part, so it will be subjective. Darling in the FranXX is mediocre at best, but terrible at worst. Its most marketable character, the pink-haired 002, is arguably the most well-known character due to her distinct look compared to the other main characters, but she is wound up in this odd plot. There is no point that you want more answers about her and her lore simply due to an air of mystery, you are fed information intermittently, and you piece together bits, but never get any real answers for her, or the other characters for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basic at best. It's a generic \"us vs. them\" story for starters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but is orchestrated in such a horrific manner that it becomes a letdown. Things make no sense, plotholes become obvious, the plot itself makes drastic changes that are absurdly unrealistic, and ultimately results in a disturbed experience as you wonder 'Why? How?' to almost everything.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the sex appeal appalling fanservice. Random scenes of close-up bodily parts, obvious insecurity from 'flat-chested' (as I mentioned before, who are practically not even flat-chested) characters to the rest, disproportionate body types, and such really detract from the rest of the art. Whilst the enemies, allies, and world itself look beautiful at times, seeing a character with massive breasts that are too big for her body swinging them about (which I may add, is whilst wearing a skintight suit, therefore them 'bouncing' is impossible) for no reason really shows the creator's intentions. It genuinely seems like, most of the time, the creator is gearing for the next posterior camera angle rather than the next reveal in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nTo which I will go on to say that each 'reveal' that you're geared up to be somewhat excited for is a massive letdown. Either it follows the same archetype of there being some sort of 'unseen problem' which is ultimately fixed by the power of ____ (insert feeling here). One part I remember, is where another team of characters we've never seen before had to fight some enemies, and I actually connected to them more than I had any other of the main characters. Their situation was realistic. They acted realistically. At no point were they saying cringey lines.\\n\\n\r\nTo mention 'cringey lines' is funny too, as a lot of the words are unnecessarily replaced with innuendo-esque words. \"Kissing\" is used a lot to refer to a certain event in the anime, as well as \"Docking\" etc. Again, it seems too intentional to really take the anime seriously at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a shame. The anime looked good from the trailers and screenshots, reveals and character designs. Hearing 'Trigger' really set people into expecting a lot, but the end result is a massive letdown. You may wish to watch this if you can see past the problems above, but I doubt there are a lot of people who can actually be honest to themselves and actually admit that it is genuinely a mediocre-to-bad anime at most. Similar anime that do their job properly would be Evangelion, Aldnoah.Zero, and Sidonia no Kishi.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review.",

            "content": "!! POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING !!\r\nNOTICE: These reviews will each be episode by episode (updated on Mondays), but at the end of this shows airing, I will finally type up a full cumulative review on the show.\r\nNow let's get into Episode 18's review.\r\nStory: 7 (last week: 7)\r\nThus far we have had many ups and downs in the lives of these Parasite pilots. This past week we had what seemed to be an up but it came with the inevitable down we all knew would have to happen. We are slowly learning that everyone is just the APE's pets besides Squad 13 who start to have theirown ideas. These ideas are quickly shut down. We also know they can somehow destroy a large quantity of life from space and to be honest, it's probably some sort of laser (just because that is what it always is). We also learn of a goal of the APE's and higher up humans, to rid themselves of their bodies like some sort of god. This will be interesting from here on out and the squad probably won't be allowed to tell Kokoro or Mitsuru about each other and what really happened. I wonder if Hachi will ever get his emotions back. We see the struggle of him wanting to help the kids but he can't and the same with Nana. I don't see Ikuno's lesbianism affecting the story much if we are being honest.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9 (last week: 9)\\n\r\nI love the art in this show. This is done by A-1 and Trigger. What more could you ask for art wise? I love this style although they do nothing special. If you look at the FranXX, they each are done very well and with a solid color palettes that show their personalities. But also, if you look at this environments and background arts, no space is wasted. The fact that the FranXX's resemble the female pilots is also a pretty cool concept, while it may just be so the audience knows which is which without needing to memorize each pair and their FranXX. The OP's and ED's are very well done and I actually really like both.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9 (last week: 9)\\n\r\nThe sound in this show is nothing special by any means but it isn't bad. They are careful to not use the same sound twice for different types of characters, which is often done in A-1 productions. The sounds of ambience and chaos are balanced fairly well but can be a bit abrupt at times. I think the sound is the same but the sounds of fighting and dialogue are balanced well. The fighting noises aren't way down, and the dialogue isn't extremely loud during fight scenes and the same goes for it vice versa. Plus, the voice actors are paired with characters very skillfully. I prefer the sub VA\u2019s and just based on how well they fit each role. I raised my score in this category by one because I really do love each VA and their roles. They each are paired incredibly well. The new OP and ED are freaking amazing and I love them both so much more then the first, hence the bumping up by 1 point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 (last week: 7)\\n\r\nWe see our Parasite's relationships go further than desired by the APE's and thus they had to be reindoctrinated (Kokoro and Mitsuru). They don't remember each other so I wonder what will happen between them from here on out. Also, how will the rest of the squad go on? Every one of them, knows what happened but most likely won't tell Kokoro or Mitsuru what happened for one reason or another. These characters struggle with individual thought because the consequences for independence are so great. I wonder if this will have an effect on partner pairings and if they will just go back to their original ones since they have no recollection of each other. Also, Ikuno is a lesbian so that'll be interesting although I just think that it got thrown into there (although who didn't see it coming) because each episode focuses on two or three characters and their problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (last week: 10)\\n\r\nI really freaking enjoy this show. I love everything about it. Over the course of these 7 weeks, the show has just gotten better and better. I just love watching it every single week which can be hard to do for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (last week: 8)\\n\r\nI recommend this show because of the fun characters, interesting story, and especially Zero Two. You won't regret your decision unless you have a very specific taste and hate these types of shows in general.",

There simply is no other way to put it. It mixes elements of romance, action, suspense, and mystery perfectly to create the ultimate plot. The character development is INSANELY strong, and we get to know the preferences and backgrounds of almost all the main characters. This leads to a plot that makes sense andis enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter dynamics are amazing, the plot is terrific, the foreshadowed symbols and recurring themes are all top-notch. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a must watch and will probably be remembered as a classic.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First off, i have no clue how to write review, but here's what i think about this anime. I don't usually share my thoughts like this, but i've changed lately\r\nIn my opinion the anime definitelly deserves more than #500 ranking. To be honest, i'm giving it 10/10 overall just so it gets more ranking.\r\nI love anime like this, when i started watching anime for first time, i wanted to see a anime like this, where couples fight. A true anime couple. When i first started watching anime, i watched the boo hoo bad anime SAO and in fact, i liked SAO's first few episodes, Justbecause of Kirito and Asuna teamworking, to take down the first SAO boss. But then they split up and stuff, and SAO became bad.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 There's still more to learn, but for sixth episode it's good enough. I like how the anime explained why Hiro's squad is the only ones who have colorful mechas and nicknames.\\n\\n\r\nI was always picky about what anime to like, because i used to talk to a friend, that liked literally every bad anime, no matter what ranking MAL gave it, so i always just skipped through low ranked anime, thinking that they're bad, but i changed lately. I'm giving now 10/10 even to a show that's got #500 ranking at this moment. I think it deserves more than #500.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 Well it's not some super art masterpiece like Violet evergarden, but again it's good enough. The animation's not that bad, i think we should leave 10/10 for anime like Violet evergarden. \\n\\n\r\nIt's propably hard not to see me as one of these triggered fanboys, after putting in 10/10 overall just like that. I'm self aware of that. I knew that's how i'd look like, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 I like both ED and OP, there's sometimes violin playing in background too, that's nice. Violin's nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 I love how Zero Two is so close to Hiro right from the beginning, it's kind of charming. I don't mind Hiro being unconfident, there's space for him earning the confidence, as anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThis couple kinda reminds me of Horo and Lawrence! Horo and Zero Two are so alike. Why haven't i seen someone mention this before.\\n\r\nHoro and Lawrence are propably best couple out there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Don't see why not put 10/10, there were some cringy moments, and cringe is always not enjoyable, but whatever i enjoyed it.\\n\r\nI love how the monsters/enemies are all in difference shapes, always have different abilities, you never know what to expect of them. That's fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 I don't think it's masterpiece, we should leave 10/10 for the true masterpieces, but i think it deserves more than just #500. So i'm gonna give it 10/10. Hope it gets better rank.\\n\\n\r\nI should've though propably waited a while longer before posting this, because of two reasons: I finished watching episode 6 just 30 minutes ago, so my review is easily affected by emotions, and second reason is because the anime is still not finished. \\n\r\nWow, episode 7 sucked. Literally nothing happened. am i watching One Piece, or a Naruto filler, or what. \\n\r\nDamn, episode 8 sucked too, i dislike these \"relaxation\" episodes so far, i'd rather prefer if they kept advancing the story asap. If it continues like this, i'm gonna regret making this review tbh,\\n\r\nKinda funny, people will propably hate this review, if i didn't change lately, i would've hated it too.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that the purporse of me giving it 10/10 overall is literally just to increase it's rating. Don't know if this is legal or not.\\n\\n\r\nReviewing a unfinished anime is propably easier than reviewing a finished one, it has IMO potential to become either one of the bad anime, or a above average 8.30 anime, at this point it's propably just average one that i taken liking to. I have no clue what \"hype train\" is everyone talking about, i found this anime randomly just a day ago.\\n\r\nAnyway, i've written what i wanted to write.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cHow can I become popular?\u201d\r\nDarling in the FranXX is a sad attempt at creating or rather, replicating a legacy act. It took inspiration from what popular shows like Evangelion and Gurren Lagann did, without understanding a thing about what made them work. It tries to expand on ideas without understanding how to sell them, let alone incorporate them meaningfully. It wants to craft a setting to draw us in and make us remember it but instead, FranXX falls flat on its hormone-driven face. It\u2019s a brilliant showcase on why the insular nature of anime writers & directors is detrimental. It is the definition of ananime that tries to pander to the entire anime community, and as a result, FranXX lost the chance to craft a work of art worthy of being remembered. What we have now is a vulgar yet ambitious mess whose only remarkable features are its volume of ineptitude and its interesting but horrendously executed aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, what does FranXX\u2019s sex aesthetic contribute to the narrative? Nothing good. Sure, every conflict deals with the idea of sex, gender, and couples in some way, but the visuals don't remotely contribute to this. Additionally, the world-building that stemmed from this is as questionably handled as it is derivative. Yes, Neon Genesis Evangelion did similar things, from the concept and world to having its mechs be drenched in symbolism. However, we get to what separates the two: humanity and focus.\\n\\n\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most human anime ever made. It constantly delves into the psyches of each character in a way that feels both relatable and real, while exploring their hobbies and how these people bounce off each other and affect each other personally. They were in the face of a war against deadly creatures, and the focus was placed on how this, their upbringing, and their conflicts stemming from this affect each other. This happened because Eva was written and directed by a legendary man and nerd who went outside, talked with people a lot and had a social life with them, and suffered through personal, relatable problems. The director and writer also had a sense of focus, making sure each world-building element made sense and retained consistency in the logic of the show, and that each character was consistent, with gradual mental declines that felt natural.\\n\\n\r\nNow, look at this show, made by someone who no doubt worked to get here but is as much an unknown figure as most other directors in this insular, borderline unsustainable industry. While he's capable of delving into his characters' upbringings, no one is written well enough for us to care. Part of why is because instead of relying on substantial interactions and meaningful introspections, FranXX takes the Re:Zero route of letting these autists shout their pathetically written and constructed feelings to each other Light Novel monologue style while letting flashy directing choices do the rest, often during contrived scenarios meant to incite drama with the most hideous of dialogue. To put this into perspective, episode 1 does this 5 or 6 times with its main character. Unlike say: Fate/Extra: Last Encore, this show isn't oozing with the kind of style to make it feel natural, instead only busting out the interesting presentation as a borderline disingenuous attempt at enhancing or explaining emotions. LE also delves into the introspection aspect far better and shows a superior portrayal of broken people raised by a horrible, controlling system that sends its inhabitants to fight for their lives. Additionally, it better demonstrates how that affects several of them once they\u2019re out fighting and when they\u2019re part of the system. FranXX can't even make a compelling character to save its life, let alone a character that truly feels real. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with awful post-Eva works such as Brain Powerd or De;Vadasy, you may have found these problems all too familiar. Another common post-Eva trait is the ability to have a general idea of what to explore without any idea on how to make it work. Brain Powerd focused on trying to do the concepts and relationships of Eva backward and did so incoherently with a script to reflect that as they had to make up new terms and ideas out of nowhere that don't fit or make any sense. It decides to copy the actions of Evangelion and the narrative structure of Gurren Lagann while failing to create a coherent world with believable characters to care about. The disastrous second half more than cements this fact in several ways. \\n\\n\r\nI won't cover everything, but let's start at the top. The world-building in FranXX is among the worst I have ever seen, delving into its symbolism with little regard as to how it can make sense beyond vague setup, much like with the direction of the narrative as a whole. So much about the setting and lore counters itself, even outside of the parts that already make no sense. This anime\u2019s inability to show us the necessary information for certain events to have possibly taken place have resulted in monumental plot holes to make matters even worse. The FranXX mechs make no sense in literally any aspect, and the implications in them manage to assassinate the already badly executed relationship between Hiro and Zero Two. Let\u2019s not even mention how hideous the final 11 episodes were, especially in regards to FranXX's lore. Even then, the beginning was atrocious too, what with the awful love triangle, episodes 6 and 8, the aforementioned world-building, and the fact that most of the characters are obnoxious, worthless, needlessly hateful, and surprisingly inconsistent caricatures at best. The show has such little respect for them that its primary mascot character Zero Two, constantly switches on a dime simply for the sake of creating drama and steering the show in a planned direction.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we wrap up, we best look at the audiovisual side of things, as this show still manages to trip over itself in this regard, though it doesn\u2019t do so as hard as it does with the writing. The fembot designs are all around the passable range with nothing being truly awesome or toy-worthy. The creatures and settings have nice colors but nothing is particularly well designed, from creature to character -with the possible exception of Zero Two-. Hiro\u2019s design is especially awful for obvious reasons, and several of the supporting cast designs are eerily similar to certain Eva characters. The outfits are also mediocre to bad, often with awkward \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d logos for no good reason, and whenever the show tries to do something with dynamic cameras -sometimes even when they don\u2019t- the frames get cut in half, from a normal amount to what feels like half, if not less. The premiere episode alone is the perfect indicator. It thankfully doesn\u2019t happen too often when it does, the viewing experience becomes a rough one. As mentioned, the directorial idea of messing with the aspect ratios haphazardly or for the sake of emotion and whatnot is borderline laughable as well. Additionally, there are several scenes where no one has any facial features, and the luckily infrequent CGI here is subpar at best. This collaboration between A-1 Pictures, Studio \u201csaving anime\u201d Trigger, and eventually, A-1\u2019s new subsidiary, Cloverworks, was definitely shaky, even from a visual standpoint. It\u2019s not like the show was badly animated or anything, and the environments were done rather nicely. There were just several variables that kept this work from functioning greatly on a visual level. One last one to mention is how the fight scenes manage to be completely unexciting, with little real flow or impact to anything, or many truly good bits of animation or spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the music, none of the background tracks stick out, even if none are necessarily bad or ill-fitting -outside of one rap song at the start of episode 8-. There are some triumphant tracks in the first quarter that are good, but that\u2019s as far as that goes. The opening theme \"KISS OF DEATH\" by Mika Nakashima x Hyde, is certainly unique, even if not to my taste. The ending themes are all numerous, and none of them are particularly good or memorable. Sure, some are better songs than others, but none of them are really going to stick with you in the same vein that Gurren Lagann ED 2 or Neon Genesis Evangelion\u2019s ending themes did. Somehow, all of this makes the music the most competent part of the entire show, which is mortifying.\\n\\n\r\nThe most embarrassing thing is that the show not only tried its best to become popular, but it did so whilst having its staff being treated like shit by its \u201cloyal fans\u201d like it was the second coming of Re:Zero. There was ambition here but little thought beyond popularity and mimicry with a spin. One could argue this is propaganda for the Japanese to have kids and fix their under-population problem, but that doesn\u2019t exactly fix anything, or even help give the show any real identity. Such a shame since, again, the ideas present here, if given more thought, could have turned into a fun dystopian action show that explored its characters in interesting ways while being a meaningful allegory for sex and puberty. It isn\u2019t like the show doesn\u2019t have its moments of sincerity or even a visible narrative through-line either, so the potential was obviously there. It's just that so much of what it did would require a complete and utter reworking in order to even become salvageable. Alas, we get this broken, tiresome replica to forget about once the memes are over.",

            "content": "It was the 14th episode. I was wracking my brain trying to figure out what exactly was causing the fans to go livid. Given what happened in the last few episodes the actions of a certain character who is taking all the hate seem justified to me, albeit selfish. I tried reading the rants people wrote online and ended up not connecting with them, to the point where I decided to re-watch all 14 episodes fearing I\u2019ve lost my sensibilities. Then it hit me - I was looking at this series all wrong. It was never about mecha, or relationship drama, nor was it aboutchildren vs adults. No, the actual theme is more sophisticated, and way more profound, and that is Darling in the FranXX is first and foremost about waifuwars. Only when you make this realization will you be able to put things into perspective, and understand why the fan base react the way they do towards any episode.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get down to brass tacks. If you\u2019re watching this for the mecha, you\u2019ll be disappointed. While the struggle between human and Klaxosaur is the pivotal aspect of the setting, it falls apart too easily on scrutiny. The show is unbearably stingy on details to the point that it\u2019s fair to doubt if the Klaxosaurs are even a threat to humanity, in contrast to Eva or TTGL, shows that DitF clearly take inspirations from.  Everything about the fights is underwhelming. The effort put in mecha designs alone makes it clear who they have their spotlights on. The choreography is terrible and fights are agonizingly bland. Rather than a highlight, they feel like a chore to watch, it feels like I\u2019m being forced to read a light novel because it contains a vital piece of information to understand something else I\u2019m actually intrigued about. The music that accompanies them lacks punch, feels awkward and is sometimes mistimed. The monster designs on the whole are uninspired garbage; quite a few of them are honestly copypasted from Gunbuster. I want to be more verbose here but really, it\u2019s not worth the effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe character drama aspect is the main draw from the creator standpoint. It\u2019s also bad, but this deserves more explanation because unlike the mecha aspect, the issue is not low effort. In its attempt to copy Eva it they\u2019ve misjudged what they needed to do. Despite having a way larger cast, they saw it fit to waste so much time in the second half of the first cour on episodes that can be arguable described as filler. Ep 7-8 are damn near needless and can be condensed into 5 minutes with the remaining time put to better use in fleshing out the world or characters more satisfyingly. The character-focused episodes were piled continuously one after another without proper, chronological justification, before jumping back into the main story, which makes it hard to appreciate the character development following these episodes. Because these lasted a total of 5 episodes, it\u2019s impossible to ignore how badly they screw up the pacing. It feels like an afterthought, which is a shame because I really liked one of the episodes. What\u2019s odder is perhaps the character they\u2019ve decided not to focus on; 14 episodes in and Ichigo, the team leader and main rival for the glorious Nippon dangler have yet to receive any proper characterization from her POV beyond some snippets here and there, which is odd given her background as the childhood friend love interest (something that usually makes fans instantly hard). There\u2019s this vagueness as to why she is attached to Hiro, and throughout the series so far (especially in context with episode 9) the creators are thoroughly unsympathetic, providing minimal reason to persuade us that she has a fighting chance. She\u2019s created solely to lose and make 02 look good in the process (they might pull a Nia here, but that\u2019s still a win by definition). It\u2019s a crying shame because Ichigo\u2019s the closest thing to a rational but still human character the show has. In the notorious episode 14, she attempted a Hail Mary pass to win her lover (reminds me somewhat of Setsuna from White Album 2); her action was selfish, bold and completely unexpected, yet it feels like a proper progression of her character. I applauded it, even if it wasn\u2019t reciprocated, but apparently to most viewers she became \u201cThe Worst Anime Character Ever Created\u201d, a rapist, and a manipulative bitch all at the same time while 02 gets all the sobby eyes despite her comparatively similar actions, thanks to her tragic past.\\n\\n\r\nThe third major offender is how the show treats plot points. Foreshadowing is particularly weak aspect to the point of disbelief. The one which I take the greatest issue with, the one that jumped the shark is how for almost the entire first cour we were framed with the understanding that Hiro\u2019s compatibility with 02 is almost completely unanticipated, only for a whole new story to emerge later. Vignette of 02\u2019s backstory were given way early in episode 1 but there was no adequate indication that Hiro was ever a part of it. This is made harder to swallow given how the first arc concluded in episode 6, and the crutch they\u2019ve chosen to rationalize this is memory loss; the oldest excuse in the book. The remaining 12 episode could be treated almost as a different story. There are other legitimate complaints I could leverage against this series with regards to its treatment of plot points, such as how important details are inserted only to be left unexplored until it was necessary to do so, sometimes for multiple episodes on end. In episode 1 Dr. Franxx, the creator of the robots and by definition the best person that can take us on tour of the world appears, but was never seen again until episode 7. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t do anything worthy of screen time for 12 episodes, and that\u2019s something I take issue with. Multiple other examples of this kind of writing can be given, but most of them boil down to 2 things; the characters simply do not ask enough questions, and they do not communicate, and so the plot stagnates. Someone made a clearly ominous remark on our future? Let\u2019s not ask him to clarify! Found a room used by your predecessors with a diary that you could open which may or may not provide you with a deeper understanding of your situation? Let\u2019s just leave it be! I can go on and on.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I\u2019d like to talk about the actual reason you\u2019d be compelled to watch this show, and that is 02. 02 is absolutely waifu. She essentially a monster girl, she has long pink hair, distinct eye cosmetic, horns with a cute connecting hairband, and fangs. Her breast and butt is shapely and supple, her mannerism is enticingly sensual. She dotes only on Hiro and calls him \u201cDaaling\u201d all the time. She gorges on honey almost fetishizingly but never gains weight. Unlike the rest of the team she is knowledgeable about sexuality, handing out a kiss lips to lips with Hiro by the first episode no less and licking various people onwards while still undoubtedly pure in both her body, heart and mind. Any criticism you could possibly subject her to are moot because she\u2019s had a harsh life. Sure she might be uncooperative in team fights which diminish Ichigo\u2019s leadership value, sure she has caused actual bodily harm to her teammates including her own pair, sure she has acted irrationally, sure she\u2019s admitted herself that she too is selfish, sure her initial affection is fake and done just to manipulate the MC, but all of this is quickly forgiven once she says the word \u201cDaaling\u201d. If Sauron had called everyone \u201cDaaling\u201d the inhabitants of Middle-Earth would gladly hold out their neck for slaughter. I mean come on, compare her design to Ichigo\u2019s, there\u2019s just no competition. Even the title clearly establishes how flawless she is, 02 simply can do no wrong and by extension Hiro too since he\u2019s her object of affection. Anyone who dares argue otherwise should be spammed with hate messages.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom-line is this; DitF is an ambitious attempt even if derivative, but the writing as well as choreography leave a lot to be desired. The key to enjoyment is approaching it with the right mindset, and that is watching it for the sole purpose to ship characters. If this is sounding too much like tumblr don\u2019t worry, we are above that, we are in fact, inexplicably the exception to it, I swear. More importantly, no matter how bad the rest of the show may be, no matter how much you take issue with it, the moment 02 comes on screen you will forgive everything, she is simply perfect. Thank you A-1 and Trigger for saving anime.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t mind my score; a bug is preventing me from rating any higher, the fact is this deserves a 10. For some reason this does not happen with other series, must be Ichigo hacking the code, that bitch.",

Is it a romance anime with a mecha aesthetic? Is is a mystery anime with mecha and romance mixed in? Or is it proper mecha, with some mystery and romance thrown in to build character? Or is it all three. Time will tell. And that's what makes Darling in the Franxx unique and extremely interesting, as far a I'm concerned. \r\nCurrently Darling is a joyous, fun, wacky ride with great potential for story,romance, and could go very very dark and become one of the best series in recent years. Time will tell, but as it stands, it's oozing evangelion vibes... and that's only a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it will go downhill, but as it stands, I would personally rate the first nine episodes very highly. They're not perfect, there's cliches left and right, but the execution is very well done, the ships are sailing strong, and it's candy to the eyes. Oh, and ZeroTsu is best girl for sure.\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward to see is it lives up to its potential!",

            "content": "Before Darling in the Frankxx actually aired, I asked myself if Trigger could ever replicate the success of Kill la Kill. Remember that series back in 2013? Their debut show made a significant impact for anime fans all over the world. From then on, Trigger produced some questionable series like Kiznaiver but also reminded us that there are still golden eggs such as Little Witch Academia. Sometimes I still have to ask myself, what the hell is Darling in the Frankxx?\r\nTo be fair, Darling in the Frankxx is actually a co-production between Trigger and A-1 Pictures. It\u2019s an original TV anime that adheres to moreof a humongous mecha show while mixing elements of drama, comedy, sci-fi, and absurdity. Oh wait, that\u2019s not a genre, isn\u2019t it? Well, you will probably understand the meaning of that later on. But first things to remember is that Darling in the Frankxx takes place in a distant future. There are imminent sci-fi themes that deals with pilots and Frankxx, giant robots that are capable of fighting the mysterious klaxosaur. Here, we meet the children that lives in mobile fort cities known as the Plantations. Out of these children, a young boy named Hiro (Code 016) meets a strange girl with horns on her head. So begins this journey\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nOn my first viewing, it felt like Trigger really wanted to play a bit with the viewers\u2019 emotions while attempting the tricky feat of combining many different genres. I\u2019m not going to lie, the first few episodes made me feel like the anime wanted to experiment with sex. Even the first moment when Hiro encounters Zero Two showed implies there may be an immense amount of fan service in the show. However, I wouldn\u2019t say this anime thrives on sex as it\u2019s mostly played out like a metaphor. In other words, this anime isn\u2019t a trick pony but does rely on the emphasis of fan service to some extent. The gimmicks of the anime relies more on the characters\u2019 actions to do the talking. Remember, the main cast is composed of young characters who hasn\u2019t fully grown up yet. In fact, they rely on the Frankxx in order to exist in their world and doesn\u2019t really know their true purpose. A driving factor of the show chronicles the lives of these children. They begin to learn more about their world, themselves, and what their true purpose really is. That is to say, the plot is suspenseful from the start as more and more storytelling is unraveled.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the series is mixes in a variety of themes, exposition is necessary and we get a lot of info dumping. It shouldn\u2019t take long to learn the show\u2019s terms as every episode made is easily understandable. However, it\u2019s the characters that are deceptively complex as we learn more about them. At the heart of the show is the horned girl named Zero Two. There\u2019s not much we know about her in the beginning but it\u2019s discreetly shown that she has a connection with the klaxosaurs. From a viewer\u2019s perspective, Zero Two draws the line between human and inhuman. A good portion of the characterization focuses on whether Zero Two accepts on being who she is. She seeks her own identity and place in the world. Thanks to Hiro and his friends, Zero Two does manage to realize who she is and makes her own choices like seeking freedom. And to be quite honest, freedom is a pretty important word considering that these children are trapped like birds in a cage. The animal motif is evident as the children from Squad 13 are called \u201cparasites\u201d by the adults. The mysterious Papa gives out orders to them and they obey them without question. Later on, Squad 13 begins to wonder their real purpose and seek to create freedom themselves. \\n\\n\r\nZero Two is a controversial character who seemingly caused the deaths of pilots who formerly were partnered with her. In a sense, she can be labeled as \u201cblack widow\u201d. It is only when she took Hiro as her \u201cdarling\u201d that reveals a more sensible side of her. Usually, Zero Two is playful despite being serious about her duties. It\u2019s easy to see how childish she can be even on the battlefield like a cat playing with her food. (she actually does this in early episodes) The show also takes a deep dive into her past as we learn how the adults experimented on her and connection with Hiro. Speaking of which, Hiro is like a light in a dark tunnel for not just Zero Two but all his teammates. He is hopeful and is often a voice of reason. As a pilot, he isn\u2019t afraid to take risks despite knowing potential consequences. This inevitably leads him to fall in love with Zero Two. At the apex of the story, he is able to express his feelings in honesty to her. From that point on, they are pretty much inseparable. However, this show\u2019s relationship dynamics isn\u2019t exactly well written if you read between the lines. From the two main leads, it\u2019s very obvious that the anime wants to keep them as true loves. It\u2019s a pretty generic way of storytelling that sends the message of \u201clove will conquer all\u201d. It's something you can find in almost any sci-fi flicks these days. From puppy love to an actual romantic relationship, it\u2019s something any show could have done easily. It\u2019s a shame since I wanted to see this anime think a bit outside of the box.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, that\u2019s not all. The biggest turn off of the relationship dynamics involves the other characters of Squad 13. Let\u2019s face some facts here, the children in the show are very clueless about the concepts of love. Yes, love itself is a very complicated subject for discussion but the anime makes it clear that they have zero knowledge about it. There are multiple character love angles going on by the time you reach 1/3 of the show. For a short list, it involves the love triangle between Goro, Ikuno, and Ichigo. Then, there\u2019s Ichigo, Zero Two, and Hiro. Outside of this circle, there\u2019s also a love triangle between Mitsuru, Kokoro, and Futoshi. Zorome and Miku also seems to have some special feelings towards each other. At one point in the series, Ichigo became an Internet meme for the drama she bought in between herself, Hiro, and Zero Two. I also felt bad for Futoshi as well since the show made it clear that he didn\u2019t stand a chance. Kokoro and Mitsuru\u2019s relationship is perhaps one of the more tragic ones in the series. And Ikuno\u2026, it almost feels like the show put the character in a love triangle with Goro and Ichigo to make her more relevant. That being said, you may get a headache or two after realizing how clueless these kids are about love. The show even has multiple episodes where they question the meaningful of a \u201ckiss\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Darling in the Frankxx actually started off pretty strong with a lot of potential for developing some of the main characters. Indeed, there are definitely moments that are worth talking about considering how far the series takes care of them. Outside of Squad 13, we also take a deep dive into Dr. Franxx (the creator of the Frankx) and his past. There\u2019s even exclusive storytelling on what motivated him to create these giant mechs in the first place. Unfortunately, that\u2019s pretty much how far the characterization ends up for individuals who are not part of the main cast. An example is Nines, a special defense force who were once part of Zero Two\u2019s former unit. The number 1 of the Nines is an antithesis of Hiro as he is intensely loyal to Papa while mocking Zero Two of becoming \u201chuman\u201d.  The series hardly explores him beyond his personality and even though he changes, it felt like a script of a play that anyone can predict would happen. I was more interested in seeing how the show would handle the roles of the adults. There\u2019s no doubt that Papa plays the role of a distant surrogate figure to Squad 13. In early episodes, they all try to impress him that characters such as Zorome goes to absurd lengths to prove himself. Later on in the show, we find out their real motivations and almost feels like a slap to the face when you realize reality. \\n\\n\r\nActually, now that I think about it, this series can actually be a bit dark. Trigger\u2019s anime projects consists of a diverse variety but Darling in the Frankxx took a lot of risks. I do commend them a bit for doing that. It\u2019s what makes Trigger the studio they are known for nowadays. Did the risks pay off in the end? I\u2019d say hardly because the final few episodes in the show really made me scratch my head wondering if the creators planned this out in the beginning. The incredibly rushed plot is stuffed with cheesy dialogues and subplots that felt irrelevant. The power of love trope is so overused in this show that the final arc felt mindless and it took me awhile to get it over with. There\u2019s a feeling of the anime of cooking up drama for the sake of drama. The worst part ends up being whether we should care about all this or not. Because honestly, I think this show went way over itself in trying to be something special. Instead, it became a hollow shell of itself and degenerated its own legacy.\\n\\n\r\nBy animation quality standards, Darling in the Frankxx maintains a consistent flow throughout the show. The first few episodes made it clear that there would be over the top action and it didn\u2019t betray expectations. The producers were able to capture the highlights of battle scenes, emotional segments, and comedic moments flawlessly. Actual fighting scenes in the show is fast paced that makes an emotional impact. This is accomplished through the character expressions as it made many scenes feel larger than life. The mecha designed by Shigeto Koyama (Captain Earth, Eureka Seven) looks well-polished with the biotech features. Character designs shows the children well-dressed despite being isolated from society. On the other hand, the adults in the series looks ambiguously alien-alike. In addition, the klaxosaurs looks like they were inspired by kaiju movies. And of course, there\u2019s fan service. It\u2019s one of the main selling factors of the show to attract an audience. The metaphoric suggestive positions of the pilots are like a visual innuendo. Zero Two also spends some episodes in full nude while being shameless of her appearance. You want fan service? You got it, you horny viewers.\\n\\n\r\nKnown for taking a lot of risks, the show does also jump into the music department with a mission. That mission is to bring out a sci-fi show to its most iconic form. Admitingly, the theme songs are moderate at best in terms of appeal but contains a lot of creativity. The amount of foreshadowing and references are evident in many scenes. However, the theme songs adheres to a more emotional side of the show once you get into it. Battle OST also works its magic during many important scenes. The character voice mannerism of the show also makes an interesting impression in the case of Zero Two. She does indeed draw a line between a human and inhuman by the tone of her voice. In some episodes, she behaves like a playful child while other times, she acts like an emotional doll. Unfortunately, the other main cast falls short. I mean, who wants to listen to Hiro talking all day or Ichigo complaining like a brat?\\n\\n\r\nWith a total of 24 episodes, Darling in the Franxx ended up being a show that made a big impact but couldn\u2019t fully capitalize on its ideas. It has a creative world and an intriguing group of characters. But when it comes to the actual storytelling, that turned into a chunk of mess. In fact, it made me wonder if the creators had a clear plan in the first place or if they procrastinated it like a final school project. To me, it\u2019s a show that hit the right spots in the beginning but doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. It sure got people talking about it if that was one of its missions. However, it\u2019s ultimately a series that talk the talk, but couldn\u2019t walk the walk.",

            "content": "Im terrible at writing reviews.\r\nSo far:\r\nThis is Fantastic. It feels like a combination or Neon Genesis, Guren Lagann and Kill la Kill. That is, beautifully playful and colorful animation and characters, mixed in with dark undertone and a slightly eerie post apocalyptic setting. \r\nStory:9\r\nThe story presents itself as a story of Giant robots fighting powerful monsters but it's really a story about a bunch of orphaned and disturbingly manipulated yet innocent and animated children discovering what love is (with a crazy and sporadic zero two teasing the MC), while at the same time discovering the world. It's also rather intelligently told, as there are quitea bit of visual metaphors. but while being deep it keeps up its playful and innocent demeanor throughout, even throwing in rather blatant and unapologetic fan service.  (guess that's why they call it the cockpit *wink wink*).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nI really should give 10, but they can be a bit whiney at times. Remarkably diverse characters (diversity of personality, which is ALL that i care about)(and i'm black) though. And deeper than they first appear. All of them of course being pretty transparently innocent, and the character development seems to be aiming towards destroying said innocence (multiple connotations for innocence being used here). But it's that innocence that makes this anime wonderful. Because these are kids who have been growing up in a bubble, unaware, though slowly figuring out, that the world is darker place than they might have otherwise conceived. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is just the main cast of kids, before going into Zero two. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nKill la Kill X Guren Lagann, with 2018 visual standards. Not exactly original, but still unique and it fits the innocent and childish demeanor of the story. Also the fight scenes are built more around feeling than visual excitement, which is it's strength. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(P.S. I\u2019m probably gonna have this review drowned out by the amount of negative reviews, anyways, but I gotta do what I gotta do, since I don\u2019t try to be an elitist or some picky critic.)\r\nTrigger brought us the likes of Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and Kiznaiver\u2026all great shows, imo, and all having been nominated as a bookmark savior of anime (anime never needed saving, though, imo\u2026LOL).\r\nThen, this happens: a three-way project of Trigger, A1, and CloverWorks (A1\u2019s subsidiary) calling Darling in the FranXX. I\u2019m going to make it clear right now: while Trigger did stop being involved in the production of theshow after the first half, the series is STILL essentially a Trigger production, so you\u2019d have to think about the kind of expectations many viewers were having for this series. What\u2019s sad is that while I think this show was amazing, it really knew how to drive anime fanbases / groups apart as well, especially when it involved the likes of \u201cdie-hard\u201d fans of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, both shows produced from Gainax Studios, from where the headmasters of Studio Trigger originated.\\n\\n\r\nWith that bit of stuff off my chest, here\u2019s my review, and be warned, there\u2019s a bit of spoilers up ahead:\\n\r\nSTORY: Before I go on a long elaboration, I\u2019ll be straight up with my grade for the story: 6/10. This show literally pulled an Arc-V (for everyone who\u2019s still a follower of Yugioh) where the story went really smooth and fantastic until around the final arc/episodes, plus the ending on both instances felt very inconclusive or not very fulfilling, but still a solid, decent wrap-up. The sudden plot twist in the final stretch with the revealing of the real enemy is honestly shocking and very offputting, but at least pretty entertaining. That sudden changing of the game didn\u2019t come off very well due to the timing and the lack of enough backstory or history to make the plot twist as compelling as it should\u2019ve been. This is honestly THE big bugaboo of the entire show.\\n\r\nThat\u2019ll end my talk regarding the bad news about the story/plot.\\n\r\nAs for everything else regarding the story, it was very good. It\u2019s set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity struggles to survive and avoid extinction via the interference of giant monsters, and because of this, the formalities and norms of society before the disaster were lost with the passing of time. The hope of humanity is then dropped onto the shoulders of children born and raised simply to fight against the enemy, with the main story centered on a rather tight-knit group of kids, whom, like all the others, know nothing about stuff like romance, family, and independence. They really had to find out the truth for themselves and experience the perks and adversities of puberty\u2026.growing up sure is hard, eh? People have to face reality at some point instead of being left in the dark and dependent on someone else you shouldn\u2019t really trust.\\n\r\nI thought that the surprisingly compelling focus on nearly each and every one of these characters was amazing. It\u2019s funny how many people can complain about specific character focusing and/or arcs, yet also complain about a certain show\u2019s lack of it later on\u2026like seriously, what do y\u2019all really want? Even during the specific character arcs, the show still nods back to important points in the main story whenever needed. It\u2019s also good to know that the two lead main characters don\u2019t hog so much of the spotlight as well.\\n\r\nIs this series a melodramatic romance story disguised as a mecha show? Yea, I guess, but I don\u2019t really think it necessarily means it\u2019s automatically a bad thing. I\u2019d rather have a show explore a sizable group of characters and make their personalities and traits shine with specific episodes or group of episodes while gradually building up the main storyline, as opposed to having nonstop action and fights with barely a sliver of character or plot buildup\u2026which would be honestly be like watching a bunch of chickens running around with their heads cut off.\\n\r\nDo I even need to mention how much this show relies on symbolism and lore all the time? It CAN be quite offputting for many people, but for others for me, I found it very cool.\\n\r\n(With all the nasty flaws of the story being said\u2026at the very least, it wasn\u2019t as bad as that of Aldnoah Zero, which fell apart almost right from the get-go and never got back up\u2026.that experience burns a sort of PTSD feeling into me even to this day xD)\\n\\n\r\nART / SOUND: The animation, while not the best thing around, is really good. Unfortunately, due to the animation not really being handled by Trigger, you don\u2019t get to feel that kind of nostalgia from when one watched previous Trigger works and animations, so it\u2019s honestly a big shame. That being said, the animation is good, especially during the action scenes. I also think they handled any CG animation they inputted very well, without making it stick out like a sore thumb like in most other anime shows.\\n\r\nAs for the music, the soundtracks of this show are great as well, and put a lot of emotion into the scenes in which they are being played. Being someone who\u2019s pretty much listened to music for the majority of my life (though I don\u2019t have musical career goals xD), I can be quite picky and selective with the kind of music I like, with no real specific genre as a favorite. I really do like how the voice actors for five heroines in the show came together to form a musical group to sing all the ending themes for this show. One thing, though\u2026as much as I love the music, I really disliked the first version of the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: I\u2019ve probably said this before: I usually prioritize characters over everything else, barring a few exceptions, when I\u2019m watching anime. For me, even if the story is the greatest damn thing in the world\u2026if the characters aren\u2019t even likable, relatable, and/or even anywhere compelling, it ruins my impression for that show, and hence my final grade for it. It works more for me if a series can even make me give a shit about not just one or two characters, but an entire gang as well\u2026.not a lot of shows that I watched have done that for me prior to watching Darling in the FranXX.\\n\r\nWhat I found great about the characters is that not only do they have some intriguing and/or colorful personalities and traits, but they\u2019re also very relatable to most of us viewers\u2019 real-life experiences and/or friends\u2026yes, for perhaps even our own characteristics. Each and every one of the characters can remind us of ourselves or the friends (or former friends) we\u2019re associated with. I mean, if a show can make you really LOVE the characters as well as HATE some of them at the same time\u2026.it\u2019s doing something right, imo. And of course, I thought the main cast of characters went through a lot of maturity and development very well...which is funny because the two main characters, the focal point of the show, went through the least amount of that. I DO wish that more of the \u201cothers\u201d got better background stories than what I was presented with, though, especially the likes of Dr. FranXX.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Even with the ridiculousness of social media blasting this show left and right without discretion, I can said without hesitation that I really enjoyed the show, even with the stuff regarding the last stretch of episodes going downhill. Like I mentioned before, this is one of the handful of shows that not only made me REALLY care about the characters, but also care about each and every one of the members of an entire main cast\u2026.VERY few mecha shows even do that for me. It was so fun to watch the social interactions between the characters, as well as feel for the characters\u2019 inner strife and adversities that are initiated by the post-apocalyptic setting they\u2019re in. While I personally do like all of the main cast, I did pick favorites like Goro, Zero Two, and yes\u2026.Ichigo (even with the controversy from ep 14).\\n\r\nThat being said, I really wished this series had a more compelling and bittersweet final stretch and finish. It just felt like all the buildup of characters and story/plot wasn\u2019t completely or properly paid off in the very end, and it just felt like that last arc should\u2019ve been given more time to develop. Yes, I was admittedly one of those that did get offput by the turn of events in the last episodes\u2026initially. For me, personally, though, when I do go back to rewatch those episodes, I found the moments more beautiful and symbolic than offputting. The one regret I do have while watching\u2026is not because I stuck around\u2026it\u2019s because I failed to tune out social media, even though I knew what the show would be subjected to criticism, anyways\u2026needless to say, that itself was what really somewhat ruined my enjoyment level in the end.\\n\r\nThis show by itself gave me hope for mecha series in general, due to my previous pet peeves and disliking about the said genre prior to this. Perhaps from here on out, I\u2019ll try to have more faith in mecha shows in the future, with everything being said and done.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be frank here and say this phrasing: \u201cone man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure\u201d\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ll personally recommend at least giving this show a try, I think it\u2019s better to bingewatch the show at a later date, when the shitstorm from social media (including MAL) dies down (as of from the date of this posted review). If you do not like it at all, then so be it\u2026perhaps this kind of plot structure is not to your liking. If you do really like it, then that\u2019s awesome.\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is one of those shows that really miss the target by a lot, but one I can still find at least high levels of enjoyment watching, even with the ridiculous mess in the final episodes. In the end, it\u2019s up to you whether or not the show turns you on or off.\\n",

            "content": "Inconsistencies: writers can't decide whether Hiro is new in the team or not. The children pilots are supposed to have no idea about what romance, sex and everything affiliated are, but they are quite self conscious about their bodies and sex.\r\nLow value script. Quite a lot of pointing out the obvious, e.g. in a deserted village \"it's like a small city or something\" followed by more 0 value assertions of a similar fashion that take too long. Too much talk about kissing to prove that they don't get what that is and what romantic relationships are. Of course, actions prove the opposite. A lot ofrepeated discussions, \"I'm gonna do my best\" blah blah kind of stuff, many of which could have been avoided because it is apparent based on the their characters, expressions, actions, simple logic etc.\\n\\n\r\nCringe fest. Male mecha pilots drive female mecha pilots using handles sticking out of the side of their asses. Being \"piloted\" gives the girls reactions as if they were having sex. Pointless sexualization and distasteful fanservice. If there is a point to it, it's still too blatant, in your face, unsubtle and overly repeated for me to appreciate it. Pointless beach episode. It's also filled with clichees whenever it comes to relationships and human interaction. It wouldn't be a problem if these clichees would add something to the story, but they don't. The gist of the over-sexualization is that the girls are put in a weak position, and boys need to start caring about them as people. The extra sexual tension is also meant to be a catalyst for the intrigue. This \"metaphor\" that forcefully facilitates something which would have otherwise come naturally is not a quality, despite the fact that many people get giddy about noticing said \"metaphor\".\\n\\n\r\nMech fights are not visually spectacular, most of the focus is on showing the method in which monsters are being defeated. You get to see how the mechs get in the correct position to fight the enemy after dodging a bit in some low value mech vs projectile scenes and then the main mech pummels through the monster. An actual fight of reaction time, beauty, skill, teamwork with proper choreography would be much more fun but is something we don't get.\\n\\n\r\nMech(Franxx) designs are meant to emulate the personalities/looks of the female characters they represent but are too overly detailed and similar in style with each other. You end up recognizing them based off of color scheme, take that away and it's hard to distinguish them. Of course this is aside from the one that is fat and has a gun, an almost moe-blob mech. Monster designs however are fairly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does it do good after all? The main female character is a complete troll, tease and has no restraints whatsoever, so that's fun. She's also a half-monster with superhuman agility and power and she gets in a lot of really well animated, highly dynamic scenes. Character animations and expressions overall are really good and so are the backgrounds.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching Darling in the Franxx and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. As ever this review is based on my own impressions and thoughts upon the anime.  \r\nA coming of age story where 10 teenagers fight to both protect their homes and their bonds of friendship and comradeship as they fight in a war where the truth may not be what it seems. \r\nBased off an original idea and concept Darling in the Franxx is a science fiction, mechaand romantic genre anime that also features elements of drama within it. Taking place in a futuristic setting that\u2019s rarely seen within animes Darling in the Franxx gives us the opportunity to see the kind of life that the members of squad 13 a squad of teenage pilot\u2019s experience as they become the newest defenders of their plantation and the kind of problems both personal and professional that they encounter as they enter a world that is fraught with danger where the threat to them and to the human race is not always what it seems. The first episode of the series made a pretty good impression on me and did a great job of hooking me as I become curious not just on the setting but also on the relationship that is forged between Zero Two and Hiro as well as how the squad would change as they enter the life that they had been training so hard to prepare for. Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to stick with the series right to the end as it was a series that I really enjoyed watching. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a futuristic setting where the planet Earth has been devastated by humanity\u2019s relentless mining of the planets key resource of magma humanity has now been reduced to a mere handful whose remnants are forced to live in large mobile fortress cities called plantations. Within these plantations while the adults live in the cities within specially trained and created children called parasites are raised and housed together in isolated home areas where they learn to bond and befriend their fellow parasites and learn the finer points of achieving their dream of becoming a part of the plantations defence force as a pilot that pilots one of the plantations valuable mecha the franxx. The bonds and friendships that are forged between the parasites, however, are more than one can expect them to be however as they are something that is vital for the operation of the franxx and to the life that all children within the plantations hope to achieve with their lives. Each franxx is piloted by a paring of parasites that consist of a female parasite a pistil and male parasite a stamen where alongside their mastery of the franxx\u2019s controls they also have one more weapon in their arsenal which is the shared bond with one another that allows the two to synchronise their thoughts and feelings and use this bond as a weapon in the war against the Klaxosaurs a hostile alien race that seems bent on humanity\u2019s destruction. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story follows the character of Hiro also known as code 016 and the members of squad 13 a squad of parasites that had been created and housed in their home of plantation 13 as they train and prepare themselves for their eventual task of taking up the duty of becoming a franxx pilot and a defender of their plantation as they join the war effort against the humanity\u2019s enemy the monstrous and horrifying Klaxosaur species. As the time draws near and the members of squad 13 begin to work even harder to become ready Hiro encounters a slump that causes him to lose hope and strain his relationship with the members of his squad. But in his moment of despair, Hiro encounters Zero Two a half human and half Klax pilot and a member of APE\u2019s elite Nine\u2019s spec ops unit. Though a girl of ill repute and possessing a sinister reputation and nickname of partner killer Hiro and Zero Two soon forged a bond after an attack on the plantation forced them to fight together to repel it. A bond that will be tested as Hiro, Zero and the members of squad 13 after graduation must come to terms with as they witness the brutal nature of fighting against the klax on the frontlines while at the same time reminding them that they need to get stronger and forge stronger bonds and friendships with one other if they want to protect their friends and home. \\n\\n\r\nBut as the war continues and the squad and their allies are confronted with sinister revelations the reasons for the war and the true aims of APE and their leader Papa become more clouded but one things for certain. The bonds of friendship, understanding, and romance that has been forged between Hiro, Zero and the members of squad 13 are not an illusion and even when pressed to the limit they will use these strong bonds to protect each other, their home and their fellow parasites and allies from all dangers whether from within or without. Joining Hiro and Zero Two in this endeavour are a host of allies that include the members of his fellow parasites in squad 13 which includes the Kind and level-headed Ichigo, the loyal and calm Goro, the perceptive and intelligent Kokoro, the proud but surprisingly stubborn Miku, the overconfident but surprisingly understanding Zorome, the calm and logical Ikuno , the arrogant but surprisingly fragile Mitsuru and the squads mentor and guardian the kind and caring Nana who wrestles daily with her duty to her superiors and her duty to the children. Together Hiro and his friends and allies would fight to protect their friends, allies and their home from all enemies and in the process grow not just as franxx pilots but also as human beings as they learn to forge a life for themselves and for the first time in their lives control their own destiny.  \\n\\n\r\nHiro \\n\\n\r\nHiro played by veteran voice actor Yuuto Uemura of Bungou Stray Dogs fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. At the beginning of the series, Hiro is a trainee parasite that along with the members of squad 13 are preparing for their accent to full parasite status. At the beginning of the series, Hiro was a quiet and composed person that seemingly preferred to remain apart from his fellow squad members. He was also noted to be of low self-esteem due to the fact that unlike the rest of his squad his abilities to syn with his assigned partner and thus be able to pilot a franxx had seemingly vanished from his body. This shock of losing his much-prized ability as well as being labelled as the failed prodigy by others caused Hiro to go into a state of depression as too him being to unable to pilot a franxx means that he\u2019s little more than useless baggage to not just the squad but also to the plantation. However, this feeling of depression within Hiro gradually disappears after he encounters a strange human girl that had horns during one of his many walks in the nearby park an encounter that provided the perfect catalyst to awaken Hiro from the doubts and depression that had been making his life difficult. \\n\\n\r\nAfter meeting Zero Two and successfully becoming her partner Hiro\u2019s personality gradually begins to change as a result of not just meeting Zero Two but also fulfilling his own dream of becoming a franxx pilot. While still quiet and composed it can be seen that after his awakening Hiro has become more confident and determined and willing to help his squad mates when needed. While not shown often in his initial self but more so in his awakened self, it can be seen that Hiro is an intelligent, kind and calm person that prefers to be logical and think things through before committing to them. However, despite his composed nature, it can be seen that Hiro can also lose it pretty easily especially when confronted with unexpected situations. As a result of his new-found confidence and his willingness to help his friends Hiro rather than stay apart from his friends instead starts bonding with them and expresses regret that his past actions have worried them greatly. A key aspect of this process was the development within Hiro of a desire to forgive his friends for the many comments and doubts that they had subjected him to an aspect that I felt matched this development nicely. At the beginning of the series, Hiro was noted to be a firm believer in the belief that a parasite that cannot pilot a franxx was nothing more than trash for the plantation which was a key reason for Hiro\u2019s depression at the beginning of the series. However, as the series goes on and Hiro and his squad mates forge stronger bonds of friendship as they fight alongside each other this belief of Hiro gradually changes and is replaced by a desire to value his friends and the bonds that exist between them more. \\n\\n\r\nThis is shown in Hiro\u2019s gradual realisation that there is more to a parasite\u2019s life than piloting a franxx and that having fun with friends, learning about them and spending time with them to overcome problems together is also part of a parasites life as well a development that I felt shows just how much Hiro\u2019s personality has changed since his awakening. As a result of this while still retaining his core desire to protect the plantation as a franxx pilot Hiro also developed a desire to fight to live and have fun with his friends rather than simply fight because he had to as part of his duty as a franxx pilot. While Hiro\u2019s desire to have fun with his friends and enjoy life by being with them were important another change that emerged within Hiro was a desire to find the truth that within the series was paired with the desire to be independent and be able to pursue their own destiny. This change can be said to be a development borne from Hiro\u2019s new-found bonds with his friends and his desire to preserve them in the face of increasingly risky missions that were ordered by his superiors. This development I felt was surprising and was another indication of just how much Hiro has changed as a person and character. The character of Hiro I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. The change from a depressive and quiet person who ignored all of his friends attempts to help him to someone that was both willing to help others solve their problems as well as forgive those that had no faith in him I felt was a great development of his character when combined with his new-found outlook on what a life should be.  I felt that his voice actor Yuuto Uemura did an excellent job of portraying the character of Hiro. \\n\\n\r\nZero Two \\n\\n\r\nZero Two voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Tomatsu of SAO and Anohana fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A klax human hybrid that was specially created by the members of APE Zero Two outwardly had the appearance of a beautiful young girl with long pink hair and a peculiar headband that had horns on it and if one did not look closely most people would believe that she was human. At the beginning of the series, Zero Two was someone that behaved very similarly to a girl of her age being positive, innocent and playful while also possessing a strong sense of confidence and a certain streak of independence that quickly got her labelled as a problem child by her minders. While seemingly someone that preferred to act in the moment it can be seen that Zero Two was also someone that was perceptive and understanding at times which I felt was a nice contrast to her childish and wilful nature. Despite her seemingly stand-off nature Zero Two was someone that can be surprisingly kind to people that she respects and even willing to break the rules to aid them if it means that she can help them. At the beginning of the series largely due to her experiences with her watchers Zero Two had a very poor impression of humans and of life in general and as a result, she had a very low opinion of her fellow franxx pilots as well as that of the civilians that lived within the plantations. Combined with Zero Two\u2019s sensitivity to comments and ill-will being displayed towards her this had the effect of making it very difficult for others to get to know her causing them to distrust or even fear her and thus creating even more distance between Zero Two and her teammates and allies. This relationship with her fellow teammates and allies remained unchanged until Zero encounters a young boy her age that drew her interest in him because he was able to do something that very few Stamen could manage which was to ride with her and survive. \\n\\n\r\nAfter meeting Hiro and forging a bond with him as her new partner Zero Two\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as for the first time in her life she has found someone that treats her with genuine kindness. Though still guarded to a degree it can be seen that after meeting Hiro and forging a deep bond with him that for the first time in Zero Two\u2019s life she is happy as she is able to show her affections for Hiro who she sees as her darling openly without needing to hide it from her watchers. Indeed, it can be said that her affection for Hiro is strong enough that no matter who tries to stand in her way she will still persevere in treating Hiro as such. However, despite the happiness that Zero Two felt at this point as the series goes on it can be seen that beneath the surface Zero Two also struggles with the unique curse that exists within her a curse that has the effect of creating sudden mood swings within her that if left unchecked would cause her to display anger towards not her beloved but also to her allies as well. During this phase of her development as a result of giving in to the anger that she feels towards her creators and the life that they have given her Zero Two suppresses the feelings of love that she feels towards Hiro and replaces it with a desire to get stronger by fighting harder on the field and thus increasing the strain placed on her partner all in a desire to achieve her dream. After being snapped out of this reckless action however and after seeing what this has wrought upon her beloved it can be seen that Zero Two displays immense regret at her actions regrets that later served as the catalyst to forge an even stronger bond with her beloved darling and one that finally gave a sense of security for the worries and fears that Zero Two had within her. \\n\\n\r\nAfter this and as a result of the change that was imparted within Zero Two by the stronger bonds that had been forged between the two Zero Two\u2019s personality changes into her final form. Unlike her past self in which Zero Two showed nothing but disdain towards her fellow squad mates and cared little about friendships and bonds in this form Zero Two can be seen to have finally realised the importance of friendships and bonds and as a result becomes not just friendlier but also more willing to help them solve problems that are bothering them. At the same time Zero Two also becomes somewhat more rule-bound which when compared to how wild and unpredictable her personality was in the past I felt was a great change. Arguably one of the most important developments of this new change was the realization that her constant desire to become more human in the past was misguided and that being a human is not about transforming yourself to match them physically but rather its about living your life like them by forging friendships, finding love and enjoying the time that you spend with your friends as you walk the road that is called life. As a result of this new understanding Zero Two rather than having a bleak outlook of what her life and her future would be like instead see\u2019s both in a new light one that is filled with both hope and wishes. The character of Zero Two I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed. The development of her character from a mysterious, innocent but anti-social girl to one that was both friendly and understanding of others and yet playful and hopeful towards the future as a result of her new-found bonds I felt was really well done. The core concept and main focus for Zero Two which was her determined attempts to become human I felt was one that matched her character and personality perfectly and I felt that her struggles to achieve that goal was shown really well within the series. More than ever I was really glad that Zero Two was able to come to the realization that at the end of the day it\u2019s the bonds with your friends and how you live your life that defines whether you are human or not and not physical appearance. I felt that her seiyuu Haruka Tomatsu really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Zero Two. \\n\\n\r\nIchigo \\n\\n\r\nIchigo voiced by new seiyuu Kana Ichinose in her first main role to date is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of the series main squad s13. A teenage girl that \u2019s the same age as Hiro and the members of her class squad and its commander Ichigo is a kind, caring and cheerful person by nature that approaches each situation with calmness and logic. A perceptive and understanding person by nature Ichigo is someone that can be said to be the very ideal image of a leader as in addition to possessing the after-mentioned personality traits Ichigo is also someone that\u2019s responsible and always working to ensure that her squad mates and friends are fulfilling their duties as parasites to the city and that their actions are not causing trouble for their superiors.  While this sense of responsibility was seen to cause tension between Ichigo and the more independent-minded members of her squad such as Miku and her partner Zorome it can be seen that Ichigo is someone that cares deeply about the unity of the squad and as a result dislikes it when this sense of balance within the squad is disrupted such as when Zero Two was inserted into her squad. While for the most part Ichigo is a serious-minded person that works hard to ensure the squad remains united and functional it can be seen that Ichigo also has a more childish and innocent side to her that is more prevalent when she\u2019s interacting with her fellow squad mate and friend Hiro that was borne out of the happy childhood that both shared when they were children. This contrast with her serious-minded self I thought was pretty cute. From the beginning of the series it can be seen that Ichigo\u2019s job of being the leader of the squad was a hard one and was a constant uphill battle as she had to deal with the many personalities that existed within the squad chiefly the independent personalities that Zorome and Miku had which caused them to dislike her as they saw her as too bossy and controlling. At the same time, Ichigo was also constrained by her own feelings towards Hiro which often clouded her judgement and kept her from seeing the larger picture and goals of a mission. Judgement flaws that led to a precarious situation that almost proved the end for the squad.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes, however, Ichigo\u2019s personality and character begins to change as a result of not just dangerous missions but also of the increasingly brutal nature of the war that she and the squad bore witness to as it progressed. As a result of the guilt that she felt at freezing at a critical moment Ichigo becomes more determined vowing to become stronger so that she can protect her squad mates better and not rely on others to help her in a job that she was supposed to excel at. This strong desire to improve herself and not only to rely on others but also protect them soon bore fruit as the battles within the war turned even more brutal. In the past Ichigo while an efficient battle leader was someone that can be seen to rely too much on instructions from command and often let that dictate her actions on the field. At the same time, her cautious nature and her care for the members of the squad while welcome also hindered her as it made her rather inflexible on the field and not willing to trust her squad members for more serious objectives. As part of the lessons that she learned from the mine mission Ichigo becomes not just braver and more determined in battle but also more flexible with her thinking and developing the ability to make rational decisions in the midst of combat which is shown in the later battles within the series where she\u2019s able to react to new situations and come up with new tactics to deal with new developments on the field without having to consult higher command. At the same time while not completely letting the members of her squad perform their own actions on the field Ichigo also becomes more mindful of her own performance as a franxx pilot and instead of worrying about the antics that the squad gets involved in instead makes the decision to care less about their antics and trusting them to make responsible decisions on their own initiative. This development is a good indication of the lessons that Ichigo has managed to learn as a result of the often-strained relations that she has with her squad mates and also from her interactions with Zero Two. The character of Ichigo I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed as the series went on. The evolution of Ichigo from an overly cautious, inflexible and somewhat controlling person to one that was more open-minded, trusting and more flexible in both her actions on the field as a battle leader and her interactions with her fellow squad mates and fellow parasites I felt was well done and ensured that among the cast Ichigo alongside Zero Two and Hiro remains one of my favourite characters within the series. I felt that her seiyuu Kana Ichinose really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Ichigo and given her performance I feel that her performance has already been noted by many of her seniors within the industry. \\n\\n\r\nGoro\\n\\n\r\nGoro voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara of Amanchu and Juni Taisen fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of the series main squad s13. A teenage male that\u2019s the same age as the other members of the squad Goro on first appearance can be seen to have an attitude and aura of that of an older brother like character itself a rarity within the anime world. A kind, easy-going and caring person by nature Goro is someone that can be said to be the voice of reason within the squad. While not as bossy and as responsible as his partner and commander Ichigo Goro is still someone that cares deeply about the members of his squad and works hard to keep the peace in it taking great care to stop the arguments between Ichigo and Miku and Zorome from getting out of hand. An understanding person by nature Goro can be seen to be someone that\u2019s moderate in temperament and indeed is someone that prefers to listen to all sides of an opinion or argument first before deciding on a course of action. As a result of this side of his personality, Goro handily fulfils the role as a deputy leader in an unofficial capacity within the squad. \\n\\n\r\nLike the other members of the squad, Goro was wary of Zero Two\u2019s appearance and her subsequent insertion into the squad. However, unlike the likes of Ichigo who disliked Zero Two due to personal reasons Goro was wary of her because he wanted to protect the members of the squad from harm and to stop the unity that his partner had worked so hard to create within the squad from breaking. While distrustful of Zero Two in the beginning like the other members of the squad as the series went on Goro like the rest of the squad was able to bear witness to how the actions of Zero Two have affected his childhood and also best friend Hiro and introduced within him a great many changes that enabled Hiro to become a better person and regain the confidence that he had in the past. As a result of this it can be seen that Goro feels that he owes Zero Two a great deal and having seen the interactions between Hiro and Zero Two knows full well that the two are meant to be together despite Ichigo\u2019s fierce denial of it and as a result had no problem with giving the two the opportunity they needed even if such a decision made him oppose Ichigo on a matter that was personal to her. While the members of the squad like all parasites were created and trained at the facility known as the garden it can be said that Goro, Ichigo, and Hiro have deeper bonds with each other than most members of the squad. This is due to the fact that unlike the rest of the squad the three of them knew each other and it can be said that all three are childhood friends. As a result of this strong bond, Goro can with a certain level of success be able to determine whether any of his two friends are hiding something that is bothering them. Arguably Goro\u2019s most prominent trait is his loyalty to not just the mission and to the city but also to his friends as well. Indeed, it can be said that his loyalty to his friends is so strong that he will be willing to put their safety above that of his. This attitude I felt was admirable and matched well with his character. The character of Goro I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with his loyalty and good-natured and easy-going attitude with his friends and comrades being the best aspects of his character. In addition, I felt that the balance that Goro\u2019s personality traits provided to the squad was also something that was welcome as it helped preserve the unity and chemistry dynamics of the squad. I felt that his voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara did a great job at portraying the character of Goro. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro \\n\\n\r\nKokoro voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no Seraph and the Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of squad 13 the series main squad. A teenage girl with a very well-endowed body for her age Kokoro on initial appearances has the aura and the impression of a classic Madonna a character type best described as the ideal girl in the eyes of males. A quiet, kind and caring person by nature Kokoro at the beginning of the series was someone that seemingly preferred to not speak much preferring to instead listen to the concerns and problems that the other members of the squad are facing in their lives. However, while a quiet person by nature Kokoro was not afraid of offering her own opinions to a discussion opinion\u2019s that can be surprisingly observant and rational often considering variables that the others have not thought off showing that beneath her quiet nature Kokoro was also someone that was perceptive and intelligent. Despite her quiet nature, Kokoro is not someone that is unapproachable and indeed is the opposite in that she is someone that most people find easy to approach which allows her to listen to their problems without interrupting them and providing them much needed advice when needed which shows off her understanding nature. At the beginning of the series, Kokoro was noted to be someone that was rather indecisive in her actions and can be seen to lack the courage to fight on the field when compared to the likes of Zorome. This attitude while certainly understandable also made her stand out somewhat when compared to the rest of the squad. While not intentionally avoiding the members of the squad Kokoro is shown to be someone that prefers solitude and in this case,  she took on a skill that I thought matched her temperament perfectly which was that of gardening. When surrounded by the plants that she cares for it can be seen that Kokoro is truly at peace as she is able to express her worries and doubts about events without having to worry about comments from others.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Kokoro and the squad begin to fight in more fiercer battles as the war with the klax progressed Kokoro\u2019s personality gradually gets expanded upon. In the beginning of the series as noted Kokoro was someone that got scared easily and was visibly hesitant in combat but as the series went on and Kokoro began to see and understand the important role that parasites play in the defence of the city this sense of fear and hesitation gradually begins to vanish being replaced by a desire to become braver and more responsible so that she can protect the friends that she so cherishes. In line with this is Kokoro\u2019s gradual overcoming of her quiet and nervous nature which is shown in her willingness to not just express her own opinions on matters face to face but also be assertive with them instead of feeling pressured to change them like she did in the past. As a result of her new-found confidence, Kokoro rather than stay on the sidelines and get the gist of arguments this way instead decides to interact with her friends more and listen to their problems directly where her perception and understanding skills allow her to provide better advice to them than before. From the beginning of the series, Kokoro was noted to be someone that was far from being just a beautiful girl as she possessed both intelligence and an innate sense of curiosity to explore knowledge that they haven\u2019t been taught. As a result of her new-found confidence, this sense of curiosity was only increased and eventually causing her to begin to ask questions about the past human's something that APE specifically forbids and causing Kokoro to be the first member of the squad to change and setting the stage for the rest of the squad to follow suit. A notable result of this change was the development within Kokoro of a desire to live a life that Is not that of a franxx pilot and one where she can freely create a happy life of her own and bring something back into this war-torn world to create a future where she can be happy. The character of Kokoro I felt was an interesting character that was both well designed and developed with her development from a quiet, nervous and easily scared person to one that was both brave enough and determined enough to fight on the frontlines to protect her friends but at the same time brave enough to ask the questions that nobody before had the opportunity to ask papa and for the first time create the break within papa\u2019s wall that would awaken within the squad a desire to be free. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Kokoro. \\n\\n\r\nMitsuru \\n\\n\r\nMitsuru voiced by new voice actor Aoi Ichikawa is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of s13. At the beginning of the series, Mitsuru had the aura and the air of an honor student though, in this case, the arrogant kind that forms grudges easily. A teenage boy that\u2019s around the same age as the rest of the squad Mitsuru at the beginning of the series was a quiet but arrogant and condescending person that seemed to treat the other members of the squad with disdain bordering on being on anti-social. Indeed, it can be said that in the beginning Mitsuru was someone that viewed friendships and bonds with disdain and as a result did not enjoy a good relationship with the rest of the squad. This had the effect of making the squad dislike him and also feel sorry for his partner Ikuno who had to shoulder the burden of cleaning up his messes when he argues with the members of the squad. Apart from being arrogant and borderline anti-social  Mitsuru in the beginning was shown to be someone that preferred to act when under orders from his superiors similar to how Ichigo was before her change and here it can be seen that this is due to the fact that Mitsuru doesn\u2019t want to worry about anything else that might cause his perfect record to slip. During this first phase of his personality, Mitsuru is noted to have a sense of rivalry with the members of the squad and with Hiro in particular and indeed their competition while certainly useful in a certain sense proved to be nothing more than a hindrance to the squad as it affected their sense of unity. This is illustrated in the fact that in the beginning, Mitsuru did not even see himself as wrong even when the facts are shown to him showing not just his arrogance but also of the fact that this nature of his was more than just about pride. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and Mitsuru and the others encounter the ever-changing nature of the war against the klax Mitsuru\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. As a result of a fortunate encounter with his squad mate Kokoro whose unique nature managed to slip through Mitsuru\u2019s guard and get to the core of the person that was Mitsuru, it soon becomes apparent that Mitsuru\u2019s surface personality was actually a safety mechanism that he created to hide his fear. Unlike Mitsuru\u2019s surface nature which is arrogant and overconfident the true personality of Mitsuru is shown to be the opposite as more than ever he fears at being seen as incompetent and useless by others especially his squad mates as unlike them he was not born with innate skills and indeed was judged by APE as being almost worthless back in training. Indeed, the unfriendly nature that he displays towards his squad mates, as well as the rivalry with Hiro, can also be seen to be a by-product of this belief as well as he does not want anyone to see his true face and skills.  But more than anything Mitsuru\u2019s dislike of Hiro stems from a more personal matter and a crucial link to Hiro that he unknowingly broke. As a result of being able to open up to Kokoro Mitsuru\u2019s personality changed substantially as he began to realise that not being able to trust his fellow squad mates was not just hurting them but also him as well and that coming clean and telling them of your problems and struggles would not be embarrassing and shameful but instead be a good thing as it will enable the squad to better understand your capabilities and allow them to better support you on the field. After the revelation it can be seen that Mitsuru has become more caring of others and also more perceptive at being able to determine any problems that his new friends may be experiencing and rather than keeping them at a distance as his old self would have been Mitsuru instead elects to try and solve it with dialogue showing just how much Kokoro has affected him. \\n\\n\r\nMiku \\n\\n\r\nMiku voiced by veteran seiyuu Nanami Yamashita of Trinity Seven and High School Fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of S13. From initial appearances, Miku can be said to be the ideal image of a girly girl the high maintenance type specifically. A teenage girl around the same age as the other members of s13 Miku at the beginning of the series was a confident, haughty and proud person by nature that was also bossy and loved to order people around. At the same time, she was also stubborn and fiercely independent. These qualities when combined together made her a great challenge for Ichigo to handle as the latter tried to get the squad to fight together as a unified unit. Indeed, at the beginning of the series, Miku was someone that viewed Ichigo as sort of a rival to her and did all she can to impede her efforts often dragging along her partner Zorome along as well. Though a haughty person by nature Miku was shown to also have a softer side to her personality that often slips out at times when she feels there\u2019s no need to keep her guard up. Here it can be seen that Miku while haughty is also a positive and playful person that loves to joke around with people that she considers friends. However true to her nature even in this state Miku is always ready for a fight. A prominent trait of Miku that stays constant with both of her personalities is the fact that she has great pride both as a woman and as a fighter and as a result gets annoyed easily at people that offend her too often comical results. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and Miku and her squad mates become involved in the ever-changing war with the klax Miku\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. While still arrogant and haughty to a degree it can be seen that beneath this Miku is someone that\u2019s cautious and not someone that trusts strangers easily which is shown in the fact that among the s13 she was the one that was most suspicious of Zero Two when she joined the squad and was the one that took the longest to trust her. At the same time, however, Miku was also someone that can be seen to be very loyal to her friends and willing to help them with their problems when needed. Despite her attitude, Miku is also very perceptive and understanding of people\u2019s feelings something that becomes much more prevalent as the series goes on. When confronted with situations where the other party is reacting badly she will not be afraid to lecture them on this. This is best seen in her changing attitude to Ichigo a person that while she disliked at first slowly developed a sense of respect for. \\n\\n\r\nZorome \\n\\n\r\nZorome voiced by veteran seiyuu Mutsumi Tamura of Anohana and Digimon Tri fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a member of s13. From initial appearances, Zorome is the classic example of an overachiever and is very similar to Mitsuru in his phase 1 personality state.  A teenage boy Zorome, in the beginning, was a moody, overconfident and prideful person that looked down on the other members of the squad. Indeed, it can be seen that at the beginning of the series Zorome seemed to have a fervent belief that he was the main star within the squad to the amusement of both the squad and of me the viewer. As a result of his personality, it can be seen that Zorome was someone that got annoyed at things rather easily and when he did he took it out on others much to their frustration. At the beginning of the series Zorome like Mitsuru had a sense of rivalry with Hiro as to him Hiro\u2019s status as a prodigy was something that rubbed him the wrong way and as a result, the relationship between the two was anything but friendly. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and Zorome\u2019s personality gets developed and expanded upon it can be seen that beneath Zorome\u2019s arrogant and moody nature Zorome was actually someone that can readily admit his own mistakes and would apologise to the people that his actions have caused harm to something that is shown in his interactions with his friend and partner Miku. While seeing Hiro as his main rival in the beginning of the series as Zorome and the members of the squad bore witness to Hiro\u2019s gradual awakening of his abilities and his performance as a parasite on the field this sense of rivalry gradually disappears and is replaced by a newfound respect for Hiro who he now treats as a comrade. A prominent trait of Zorome that is unique to him is the reason that Zorome fights so hard as a pilot which is due to his desire to enter the plantations city and join the adult world as a full-fledged adult. This I felt was interesting as unlike Zorome the great majority of parasites which includes his fellow s13 squad mates fight because it's their duty and also because they don\u2019t want to be seen as useless by the plantation. Having a personal reason to fight for I felt explained a great deal as to why Zorome is fighting so hard to be the main man within the squad. \\n\\n\r\nNana\\n\\n\r\nNana voiced by veteran seiyuu Marina Inoue of 3 Gatsu No Lion and Infinite Stratos fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is the squad\u2019s minder at the beginning of the series. A member of APE Nana is the combat HQ parasite manager that oversees squad 13 both in their personal lives and when on the battlefield where she acts as a controller. A calm, positive and efficient person by nature Nana is someone that is intimately familiar with the members of squad 13 as before being assigned there they were also under her tutelage when they were being trained at the garden. As a result of this type of personal bond Nana while responsible and steadfast in her duties also cares a great deal about the members of the squad and always tries to look out for them taking care to put them at ease when needed. As a result of this Nana is shown to dislike it when the squad is put in danger and in situations where they are not prepared for. As the series goes on it can be seen that Nana has two distinct personalities that she adapts. When on duty Nana is serious, efficient and cold and dislikes it when troublesome situations happen. However, when she is interacting with her fellow charges in s13 this is replaced by a more emotional and perhaps human side to her character one that is more emotionally invested in the members of the squad. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Nana\u2019s personality and character get\u2019s expanded upon it can be seen that in the past Nana was very similar to the members of s13 which explains the kinship and strong bonds that she has with them as she too has also experienced the darker side of the war against the klax. This latter part proved to be a costly affair when she relapsed and remembered the pain that the war had brought her. However while this pain caused Nana no small amount of pain both physically and mentally this also awakened within her a desire to not just protect the children that she manages but also open her eyes to the realization that warfare is not something that they should be forced to do and that they should be able to forge a path that is based on their own wishes and one that is based on their own free will. The character of Nana while only a support character I felt was an interesting character in her own right that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between the calm, cold and efficient officer mode Nana and the friendly, caring and positive Nana being especially well done. While her emotional side and the fact that she\u2019s too emotionally invested in the squad is seen as illogical by her superiors I felt that it was her greatest strength as she\u2019s ensuring that her charges will not suffer the same fate as her friends a move that brings both her calm and to the squad a sense of security as they know that Nana will not risk their lives. I felt that her seiyuu Marina Inoue really did a great job of portraying the character of Nana. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I felt that the series did a great job of showcasing the various types of locations and settings that existed in the post devastated world of the planet both in terms of the surface locations that existed outside of the plantations as well as locations that existed beneath the surface such as the magma mines. This also extends to the various plantations that within the lore of the series are essentially mobile fortress cities that housed the remains of humanity within them. The plantations, in particular, I felt made use of quite the interesting design as while on the exterior they featured large but bland spaces that gave wide sweeping views of the surrounding terrain beneath it lay countless gun emplacements that could be activated at a moment\u2019s notice to protect the city. This helped give the impression that while the city was also a sanctuary for the people living inside it was also a bastion that will protect them from the enemies that roam this world. Within the plantation, this design continues as rather than house parasites which are the cities specially created and trained defence force with the civilians that they are expected to protect they are instead separated in which the civilians live within the city as adults and the children live in their home area which is called Mistilteinn. This isolation of the children from the adults that they were supposed to be protecting I felt was highly symbolic and represented well of the belief that the children were only seen and used as weapons and tools and nothing more. This is reinforced by the introduction of facilities like the garden and the lab where the children are created and trained as well as in the views of the parasites that the home area in which the parasites live and social at is nothing more than a birdcage which while pretty is also confining. The character designs for the main and support cast I felt was also something that was well done within the series as their uniform appearance while allowing us the viewers to easily distinguish who is who within the series also matches well with the theme that all humans within the series whether its parasites like the members of s13 or controllers like Nana all have a specific role to play in this war. The fact that the uniforms that are worn by the parasites resemble those worn by high school students which when paired with the individual physical appearances and personalities of the cast I felt also symbolised that the parasites by fighting on the frontlines would as they do develop and grow as individuals and eventually graduate from their roles. This analogy to the life of a high school student from the start to the graduation I felt was pretty interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of mecha designs for the series main mecha the franxx\u2019s, I felt that their design was rather unique. While most contemporary mecha anime make use of mechas that are vaguely humanoid in appearance the designs of the Franxx I felt were far more closer to this idea due largely to not just the shape of the franxx but also because of the faces that each franxx makes which within the series represents the female part of the pilot pairs since their faces are linked with their helmets when in combat which makes the mecha\u2019s faces actually theirs. This aspect of the design I felt was an interesting one as it reinforced the pair dynamics within the pairing as while the male handled weapons control and the larger picture the female pair handled piloting and navigation and reinforcing the concept that they must rely upon each of their bonds to be successful on the field. The fact that the franxx look far more human than most other mechas that I have seen however are not the only aspects that I thought made them stand out though as the fact that each franxx were designed for and were equipped with different weapons also contributed to this impression as well. When compared to the other teams that are seen within the series whose mecha are not just more uniform not just in appearance but also in weapons load out I felt that the franxx that were used by s13 were more unique as each made use of a weapons load out that matched the personalities of each pilot pair giving them a unique role on the field that other teams did not have. A good example will be the franxx that Miku and Zorome make use of which is oriented for close combat due to its main weapons of claws. When paired with the unique personalities of their pilot pairs I felt that the franxx\u2019s only served to reinforce the fact that s13 is an existence that\u2019s unique to humanity whether on the field or not. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of combat animation and battles, I felt that the battles and combat scenes that were featured within the series were both well designed and developed that remained consistent throughout the series whether the battles were large-scale ops or small-scale defensive ops. This was helped greatly by not just the varied designs of the enemies that the cast fight within the series but also by the fact that the squad is still learning to fight as a team. Seeing the squad gradually learn to fight as a team while also seeing their contributions to the larger war effort I thought complimented each other perfectly as it helped not just improve the war effort but also their teamwork as well. In terms of music the series made use of one opening theme and six ending themes which was Kiss of Death which was sung by Mika Nakashima and Torikago, Manatsu No Setsuna, Beautiful World, Hitori, Escape and Darling which was sung by XX:me a unit formed around the main female seiyuu\u2019s of s13 which was Haruka Tomatsu, Kana Ichinose, Nanami Yamashita, Saori Hayami and Shizuka Ishigami. I felt that the opening and ending themes were all pretty well done with the opening, in particular, being able to convey a sense of mystique around the nature of just the war but also of Zero Two as well. The series various ending themes I felt were also well done with each conveying, not just a different emotion but also matching with the themes and developments that were started in the episodes in which they were used in. The series OST I felt was pretty well done and helped complement the various emotions and feelings that the members of the squad experience as they encounter the many events that take place within the series as the war with the klax change, not just their lives but also that of their fellow parasites and the planet as well. In terms of voice acting for the series, I felt that each of the main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters within the series. In particular I feel that Haruka Tomatsu, Kana Ichinose, Yuuto Uemura, Yuuichirou Umehara, Saori Hayami, Nanami Yamashita, Aoi Ichikawa, Mutsumi Tamura and Marina Inoue who portrayed the characters of Zero Two, Ichigo, Hiro, Goro, Kokoro, Miku, Mitsuru, Zorome and Nana respectively deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. Additionally, while I didn\u2019t cover their characters within the review I felt that Shizuka Ishigami, Kenyuu Horiuchi, Katsuyuki Konishi and Rie Kugimiya who portrayed the characters of Ikuno, Dr. Franxx, Hachi and Code 001 respectively also did a great job of portraying the supporting cast for the series a role that\u2019s just as important to the series as that of the main cast.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Darling in the Franxx was a strong anime that despite its flaws was alongside Katana Maiden\u2019s one of the heavyweights of the Winter 2018 anime season with its main strong points being its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, well designed battles and combat animation, strong mecha designs and excellent voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the story on the surface may look to be one that highlights the destructive war that is being fought by the remains of humanity and the hostile alien species known as the klax, but this is far from the truth. Rather it can be said to be half the truth for the true premise of the series is what can be said to be a coming of age story for a group of teenagers as they forge friendships and bonds with each other both on and off the battlefield as they enter a hostile world where they must learn not just about each other\u2019s strength\u2019s but also their weaknesses as well and learn to support them when needed as they learn to forge their own destiny. When paired with the series strong story I thought that this idea while ambitious was one that the series managed to adhere to and largely succeed at. The overall story of the series I felt was one of the main strong points of the series and made great use of the core premise of the series. Like most full-season animes of this era Darling in the Franxx makes use of the cour concept and divides the overall story of the series into two distinct parts each with distinct themes and plot developments. The series first cour which ran from episode 1 to 15 was the first part of the series whose main purpose was to introduce the members of s13 as well as Zero Two. The main themes that were introduced and used in this cour were bonding with your friends, forging bonds, overcoming differences and finding one\u2019s place in society and on the team. The first cour I felt managed to handle the main themes that it made use of pretty well and succeeded in creating a strong foundation for the squad thanks to the countless struggles that the squad manages to overcome as they settle their differences and focus their efforts on fighting against the true foe. The second cour of the series which ran from episodes 16 to 24 was the second part of the series that acted as the soft reset to the series as it showed the squad as a unified entity and not a scattering of sand that they were back in the first cour. Unlike the first cour where the squad simply acted under orders from their superiors here in this cour as a result of their development as characters the members of the squad are seen to learn to think for themselves and with this discover new concepts and beliefs that their past selves would never would have dreamed off such as freedom, independence, and destiny. Paired with and taking advantage of the squad\u2019s newfound desire to become more independent is the revelation of this war and the desire by the squad to not just reject the current system that\u2019s mandated by APE but also to fight for the truth of this war. Key to this cour is the belief that everyone whether its parasites or not should be free to pursue their own destiny and live their life the way that they want. The second cour of the series I felt while expanding upon the many changes that the main cast develop as a result of the struggles that they managed to overcome back in the first cour also did a great job of introducing new concepts and ideas that were largely unknown to the main cast such as notions of freedom, destiny and a desire to live a life that is your own that\u2019s not dictated by someone else.  When combined with the plot developments within the second cour these new themes helped greatly in developing the main cast into their final selves. Despite their differing themes I felt that the two cours of the series overall story supported each other pretty well with the development of the main cast being especially impressive as they went from being a mismatched class that had no small number of doubters to one that brought great change to the world by shining the light of truth into the darkness of APE and Papa\u2019s lies. One particular scene that I felt symbolised the growing change within the members of s13 was the wedding scene within the second cour of the series a scene that was both beautiful and powerful but at the same time tragic at how it ended. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series while certainly entertaining also made use of a number of unique concepts that were unique to the series foremost among these is the bond that exists between the male member of the pilot pair the stamen and the female member of the pair the pistil. While bonds of friendship and comradeship are concepts that we often see in other action themed anime I felt that the bond that exists between the pilot pairs within the series are unique because the bond rather than being just a physical one like that of a friendship is one that is both emotional and mental as both pilots of a pair must not only be good friends but also be able to synchronise with each other by merging their minds and fighting as one being. As a result of this specific bond, it can be said that the stronger the friendship and bond that exists between the two the stronger the bond will be and the stronger their franxx will be on the field. This concept of using the feelings that exists between a boy and a girl I thought was an interesting one as it made use of the concept of turning the feelings that you have whether its friendship or romantic ones into a weapon that can be used to protect them when fighting on the field. A concept that was introduced as part of this bond within the series was the existence of the Jian which is a mythical bird that Hiro and Zero witness that must join together with another of its species in order to survive as on its own it cannot. This concept I felt was an apt one as it symbolises the bond that exists between a male and a female as both must rely on each other to survive thus showing the bond between a husband and a wife a meaning that I felt was also apt for the pilot pairs as well. While the story featured a number of interesting revelations that I felt was maybe at times too strong for it I felt that this was handled pretty well within the series by introducing well timed and well-developed explanations for these new faces within the series. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed Darling in the Franxx\u2019s overall story and premise I felt that the series was also let down by a number of flaws that existed within the story. Flaws that I felt kept it from getting a higher score in my book. First in terms of character development while the main cast was developed pretty well as the series went on I felt that this wasn\u2019t applied to everyone within the squad. The characters of Futoshi and Ikuno I felt had the least bit of development for their characters as the series went on and while admittedly both were minor characters when compared to the rest of the squad I felt that they could have at least been given some development to highlight the fact that they too are members of the squad. Secondly, there was the problem with the Nines. Within the series, the Nines is a spec ops unit of parasites that report directly to Papa and the APE\u2019s but apart from acting as the antagonists of the squad, they have almost no character development whatsoever. Indeed, of the Nines their leader appropriately called Nines Alpha is the only one that actually gets some degree of development while the rest have nothing. I felt that the Nines could have been expanded upon so that their members at least have a more meaningful role within the series rather than just act as intimidating watchmen. Near the end of the series, I felt that the main cast lacked any kind of clear role within the series and while it can be said that they are at their final forms of development as a character I felt that they could have been given better roles rather than what they were given. Too me I felt that the main cast there acted more like support characters than main ones. While the story of the series was something that I really enjoyed I felt that some things could have been explained and expanded upon better rather than let the viewer infer from whats happening in the background to determine whats going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Darling in the Franxx was a series that I really enjoyed with its main strong points being its unique premise, story, characters, battle scenes and animation, mecha designs, voice acting and its take on a number of both new and existing themes. While it does have a number of flaws that hinder it and stop it from becoming the masterpiece that a lot of people wished that it was I felt that despite them Darling in the Franxx was a series that I still enjoyed watching as like Nana said within the series I like her have become emotionally invested in the members of s13 and I wanted to see whether they will be able to end this war and live their life independent of the decisions of others and having the freedom to do what they want with their lives in the world that they live in. As a final score, I felt that Darling in the Franxx deserves a final score of 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[2.0/10]\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nArt is born on a bed of nails. It comes from discomfort. A place that is the opposite of complacency. A wide-eyed child that cries in pain. It forms to fit a mold and that mold is then inducted into our society. Accepted for being palatable. Then you can look to a child that isn\u2019t molded perfectly, one that deviates just enough from the norm to be appreciated by both societies\u2019 most stern contributors as well as the rebellious cynics who are sick of the banal grind.\r\nMuch like the television industry, contorting and fitting a mold is necessary to be accepted by the masses. Expressyourself as you may, but at the end of the day if you aren\u2019t employable then you may as well be wasting your time. If a series can\u2019t be marketed and sold then it is doomed to fail, and doomed products rarely get picked up by investors. So\u2019s the perpetually churning gears of the animation industry in Japan, and so\u2019s the small, niche culture that funds it. \\n\\n\r\nA product for such a niche following must stick to the formula. The formula just so happens to be colorful, unrealistic girl archetypes and generic male blobs; grey-masses of easily-insertable conformity. It must be ironic that a series so interested in telling a story of rebellion, anti-conformity, and growth from the norm is yet another series so pathetically unwilling to practice what it attempts to preach.\\n\\n\r\nFollow Hiro, our blank-slate protagonist who has a chance encounter with a colorful anime pixie dream girl that proves to be the sole appeal of this soulless series, Zero Two. They flirt, she exposits her character archetype and we are off to the races. Set in a post-apocalypse where humans reside in gargantuan fortresses due to a seemingly alien presence, the Klaxosaurs. There are mechs, dystopian themes, and sterile environments. Darling in the Franxx desperately wants to develop stakes. As it should. Unfortunately, establishing a non-protagonist to be puppeteered by the true protagonist isn\u2019t a promising start. \\n\\n\r\nSlogging through the first few episodes, episodes which drag on longer than they ought to for such short run-times, you begin to realize that this series has the same intentions as any other series of its ilk. Vaguely remind people that Evangelion exists, harkening back to a superior series, meanwhile shoving as much fanservice and pandering down your throat with the distinct \u201creasoning\u201d to separate it from its more looked down upon brethren. \u201cWe can hide just how phoned in everything is if we explain it with sci-fi terms that are the single most forced metaphors imaginable!\u201d Ahh yes, three episodes in, all helmed by A-1 pictures and I feel as though I have it all figured out. A sporadic cacophony of barely thought out sci-fi concepts perpetuated in male power fantasies and cringe-inducing metaphors.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can say the show gets better. It doesn\u2019t, it simply gets louder, but I could say that. Chances are you\u2019ll hear it from people. Especially after the first core when a titular episode connects everything back to our blank-slate protagonist, Hiro, and the \u201cveil\u201d begins to lift. It lifts half-way and then the turning gears snap and buckle under the weight of farcical storytelling. A resounding, waifu-driven \u201churrah\u201d to every person who fell in love with Zero Two because she\u2019s the only character who had any design effort put into her. \\n\\n\r\nEvery other character is just a static uniform-clad archetype that plays footsy with the soap-opera melodrama that occurs throughout the series. We wouldn\u2019t have an awful show without a forced love triangle that is oriented around fighting poorly designed aliens. How else are we to connect with 02 if not by seeing her as a little, crying kid with an outwardly cute design? Good character writing? Who needs that when you have exploitable animators working for slave wages on a series with the narrative depth of a BB gun wound. Yes, DiTF is not a bad looking show from an animation perspective. The directing is boring, harkening back to Trigger\u2019s most easily parrot-able clich\u00e9s, to the point where I honestly couldn\u2019t even tell which studio was helming episodes. Not because both A-1 and Trigger were working well together, no, but because the entire series boils down to the worst parts of both Trigger and A-1.\\n\\n\r\nTrigger\u2019s incessant need for bombastic recreations of the same shit that got them popular isn\u2019t that interesting when it is coated with A-1\u2019s absurdly boring paint job. If Trigger and Gainax are known for some of anime\u2019s most impressive and lively character designs, leave it to A-1 to cut that off immediately. Everyone wears grey uniforms. Bafflingly, they decided to have the boys wear shorts. Which looks funny but is fucking stupid nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nFrom character arcs left by the wayside in favor of love interests and some of the most tedious action-writing imaginable to hilarious anti-atheist dialogue that almost makes the theories about this series being a fully corporate product ring surprisingly possible. Darling in the Franxx has the proverbial checklist of anime clich\u00e9s and marketing tools in hand at every possible moment. The need to sell 02 to the audience slobbering over her peaks with her character, similar to many \u201cstrong\u201d female characters in anime, becoming nothing but an object of affection. A limp, spunky noodle to save from the big-bad neon-streaked blocks that we are supposed to believe are scary aliens and not some Bionicles offshoots. Every scene with her, post the initial hackneyed love interest, is just a reaffirmation of her undying love for our blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s without mentioning the perverse nature of the series as a whole. What with robots being piloted in doggy-style, with the female taking the submissive position and males taking the dominant one. It is all very \u201canime\u201d, in the sense that anime means \u201cweakly pandering to an outwardly male demographic.\u201d Awkward, cringe-inducing sexism aside, the series attempts to subvert these elements. Kind of. Of course, they are breaking out of these sexualized positions and becoming their own people! Right? Except not at all in any way. The way these moments are framed paints the audience as the villain since we can\u2019t help but look onto these suffering characters as bait. As the showrunner, you can criticize the perverse nature of the world so much until you realize that you are indulging in these perversions more so than just about any other villain in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not trying to take a moralistic standpoint against a series that doesn\u2019t deserve it. DiTF doesn\u2019t deserve to be taken seriously enough to criticize just how abrasive its messaging is. How meaningless its already well-trodden points are. How painstakingly fake the entire product feels. It is both sterile and outwardly sexual in a way that I haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s getting a vasectomy while watching one of the nurses attempt to give you a lap dance.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this series was akin to hate-fucking because I was going to finish whether I like it or not. Especially when every single episode decided to remind me of yet another grossly popular series from just a year or two ago. Re:Zero. Yet another show that tries to be different but struggles to break free from the mold it was born within. A bed of guaranteed success when the girls are cute, and the ideas established enough. Similarly, 02 parallels Rem\u2019s obnoxious trajectory as a character. Unlike Re:Zero, though, which had redeeming qualities in some of its very hard-to-find edges, Darling in the Franxx is fundamentally broken. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I say that I don\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work. What I mean is that it is a poor recreation. A rip-off brand Rolex that cartoonishly erupts with springs and gears after just a few minutes of use. Not of just story archetypes and narratives that have been expounded upon by hundreds of films and series\u2019 before it, but from a marketing perspective as well. Which is as fake as you can get. If Re:Zero could get popular off the heels of pretending to have new ideas and cute girls, maybe Franxx can too. Except the ideas are less original and there is only one character worth marketing. So much so that we had a nude figurine teased before the first core even finished. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have written this diatribe. Maybe it just isn\u2019t worth it. This series is so hollow and hackneyed that I shouldn\u2019t have forced myself to write about it at all. It\u2019s frustrating that people don\u2019t even want to perpetuate mediocrity anymore. I could only wish this series was mediocre. If only it was just the bare minimum of creativity. If only it had an inkling of quality past a semi-finished coat of paint. If art is born on a bed of nails then Darling in the Franxx was born on a chinchilla coat, looked over by a smirking pink-haired protagonist that decides to speak in derivative catchphrases. \\n\\n\r\nDarling, no thanks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The show has about as much Action as Infinite Stratos, the plotline is garbage, and they focus an insane amount on lewd shots and fanservice. In my perspective, the primary genre of this show IS Ecchi.\r\nDespite doing its best trying to be deep and establish meaningful relations, characters are overdramatic, glossed over, and fall into extremely common, predictable tropesand stereotypes. As a result, they just end up with a shallow fanservice show, because let's be honest, the only reason why anyone watches this is for 02 and the show relies on waifubaiting for its content.\\n\\n\r\nVery disappointing release from Trigger which had some of the more unique and charming concepts in recent anime IMO, and Darling in the Franxx is just a generic show that panders to some of the most boring tropes in anime.",

            "content": "Imagine a class of children hard at work. Each of them writing their stories to be seen and judged by their peers. Taking from their own lives, their own experiences while also paying tribute to those who came before them. In that climate there exists a weasel. A shrewd and sneaky brat who steals. Steals from those works of old that they so loved, leaning on them rather than building off them. On the day of presentation, their work is picked apart and scrutinized by those who adore those older works, and mocked for what original ideas they have. Angered, they march off to ayounger crowd who, to their egocentric joy, eat up their work. Those who have never seen those works of old take the ideas here as something new, and think merely touching upon ideas rather than exploring them is praiseworthy. Also praising are those with an unhealthy obsession with the older titles, who smugly pat themselves on the back for catching all the \u201creferences\u201d. Only to one day, upon revisiting, find a work that is shoddy, incoherent, idiotic, pretentious, flaccid, and overall\u2026.just plain awful.\\n\\n\r\nThat, in a rather verbose and far too wordy nutshell, is Darling in the FranXX. A show made nearly two decades after the post Eva boom that pales in comparison to nearly all contemporaries. Yet it is aggressively popular, for it is also the latest incarnation of \u201cthe show\u201d. That mystical title that, every year, captures the attention of everyone in the anime community before collapsing in an incomprehensible mess. Your Guilty Crowns, your Aldnoah.Zero\u2019s, your Akame ga Kill\u2019s; \u201cthe show\u201d has and always will exist. What makes \u201cthe show\u201d is merely the trappings it chooses to wear. Today\u2019s latest pick is the mecha genre, one that has seen a decline in recent years. Of course, those who bemoan such a decline mostly speak of the most popular titles of the genre, Gurren Lagaan and Code Geass. Those were the last two mech titles to truly capture the community, and FranXX seeks to do the same without any originality or charm to its name. It wants desperately to become the next mecha titan, and fails so miserably that it almost becomes laughable when you\u2019re not tearing your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nWho better to present such a work that the anime communities favorite punching bag, A-1 Pictures. AND YES, this is primarily an A-1 Pictures show alongside their new substudio Cloverworks. For those about to enter a seizure of bile screaming about the involvement of Studio Trigger, allow me to say to you: that\u2019s just how they want you to act. That\u2019s the trick, the diabolical scheme A-1 pulled. Perhaps they knew their name was like a cancer to their original shows, that the burns of Aldnoah.Zero still sting to this day. So they, the cunning wolves they are, pulled on the wool of the communities darling Trigger. A studio to whom a bizarre cult-like mentality has begun over. Trigger will \u201csave anime\u201d, and the like. And let me make this clear: I like Trigger and some of their works. I also will defend A-1, as I think they get far too much flack. The blame should lie not at the studio\u2019s feet, but at the staff behind the show. This idea that Trigger is some godlike company who can do no wrong is asinine. And it\u2019s those people who are the most obsessive in defending this show. Worse yet is how FranXX can\u2019t help but embody the worst traits of these two studios: the obnoxiously self-referential nature of later day Gainax & Trigger, and A-1\u2019s devil may care attitude of \u201cif it sells, put it in\u201d. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting as well that this review will contain spoilers, but since everyone in this community has seen FranXX, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. With that said, here we go.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, I\u2019m not going to go too in depth recapping the story since everyone\u2019s seen it. But suffice to say, the Blue Man Groups pet lizards have torn Earth a new asshole, and the only defense are robots piloted doggy style. Our focus is on a group of potato sacks masquerading as humans, in particular the most potato-ey of all and his sex doll girlfriend. Their boring, uninteresting struggles occur in the same house for like 15+ episodes before the writer\u2019s internet crapped out, leaving with no access to Wikipedia to crib plot points from better shows. At which point he threw his hands up and just wrote whatever came to mind, leading to an out of nowhere finale involving Purple People Eaters and a giant Kantai Collection robot. It\u2019s more jumbled than I make it sound, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nFranXX\u2019s dystopian world is nothing short of uninspired. A narrow focus on only one section of the world makes it so that we don\u2019t really know how bad things are. We go from an episode where the world is a blasted out desert to a freakin\u2019 beach episode and the show acts like nothing\u2019s out of the ordinary. Why is only some of the world a hellscape? They never answer and it makes the world feel less organic. Additionally, the characters sometimes jump back and forth in a similar manner. They have no idea what sex and puberty are, and yet boys ogle girls during the previously mentioned beach episode. Consistency to the world be damned in favor of tropes I suppose. The concept of the Plantations is something interesting, but very little is done with it. At times it even feels like a crutch, like the show is spending so much time in Mistleteen so that no new backgrounds have to be drawn. Death flags are also waved around ad nauseum, but none of them are truly raised. Main characters don\u2019t have to die for a show to be interesting, but the way FranXX portrayed it made it seem like the death flags were there only to draw in hype.\\n\\n\r\nMost damning of all in this department is how unnecessary the mechs truly are. A mech anime needs to have its robots woven into the very core of its story. To the point that removing them would damage the show irreversibly. FranXX, almost in defiance, seems to not only have no real reason for the titular mechs to appear, but seems to actively avoid featuring combat at all. Certainly, the show can\u2019t just be mechanical titans smacking blue dinosaurs, but the way it\u2019s all spread out makes the robots kind of pointless. It\u2019s almost like the mechs were only added as an afterthought, a way to get eyes on the show because there hasn\u2019t been a big name robot show in what feels like ages. Which only added onto the obnoxious hype that existed solely because Trigger was attached to the project.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for this show is also all over the damn place, at once too fast for its own good yet also insanely sluggish. We go from one episode of action packed battles to five straight episodes of the kids dicking around. That pacing issue damns the story in many regards, but also screws with the viewer. Lest we forget the major, absolutely insane backlash that episode 14 received only for everything to be resolved immediately next week. It makes the episode feel entirely meaningless. Even the praised episode 15 (spoiler: it wasn\u2019t that great) suffered because it quite honestly came too early. The shows greatest floundering occurs in the immediate aftermath, with three straight episodes of utterly inconsequential nothing. So many episodes are spent trying to develop or expand the world only for it to not matter in the end. That\u2019s another issue FranXX has: making things matter. Everything it tries to do rings hollow because of the lack of care we feel for the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual story, that isn\u2019t much better. As I implied earlier, the majority of the series primarily gets by on ripping off superior titles. Evangelion\u2019s character focused drama, Gurren Lagaan\u2019s high octane, almost absurd plotting, Eureka Seven\u2019s romantic heart. That\u2019s not to say, however, that taking from these sources is a bad thing. Other shows have taken inspiration from these titles too, but the majority of them bring enough new to the table so that you can look past similarities. What new ideas FranXX has are either laughably absurd (doggie piloted robots), or are never touched upon (what\u2019s city life like?). And that\u2019s to say nothing of the last third of the show: everything post episode 15 is a slog before devolving into a bizarre alien invasion twist. Yes, Gurren had an alien attack climax too, but it was better planned and foreshadowed than FranXX. Here it just comes out of nowhere and leaves you mentally dead. It also flatout STEALS the plot of Gunbuster\u2019s last two episodes without any of the heart or passion that wet into it. You\u2019d think that would make things fun in an ironic sense, but instead it\u2019s surprisingly dull. The show takes an idea like \u201cmy girlfriend\u2019s conscious is in a giant robot fighting aliens\u201d and SOMEHOW makes is boring. As absurd and brain exploding the climax is, it almost feels more like an anti-climax than anything else. Maybe that\u2019s because nothing was set up well or maybe it's because of the lack of any tension during it; either way, the story of this show is pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a shame because there is one area where FranXX is kinda alright: its use of foreshadowing. The show goes out of its way to build elements of its world up in the background, and it\u2019s quite effective. It\u2019s subtle and only really works inside the plantations. But at its best, it makes the world feel pretty well thought out. Which is a shame when everything else drags it down. It\u2019s bizarre how the world can feel simultaneously thought out yet smattered with so many baffling issues.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all that foreshadowing detail, FranXX still has random plot holes that never get answered. Or to be more specific, they forgot to answer. They forgot how and why Kokoro\u2019s mech went berserk that one time. They forgot that old lady Zorome met and her weird heart thing. They forgot 02 having PTSD from all the pilots she killed. They forgot to explain why Ikuno\u2019s hair randomly turns white. They forgot the giant Klaxo hand at the end of episode 15. They forgot to explain how Strelizia went Super Saiyan God in episode 15. They forgot to make us care or even remember Hiro\u2019s original partner Naomi. They forgot to introduce the giant super weapon Star Entity before the episode it was used in. They forgot how the alien VIRM basically Third Impacted half the planet. Bottom line, they forgot a LOT, and nearly all of it was probably only added in to appeal to the obnoxious theorycrafting crowd. Does it really matter if Hiro has horns? No, it doesn\u2019t. But to the theorist, the fact it happened means their theory was justified, and they can feel smug for about a week before the next brain imploding stupidity occurs.\\n\\n\r\nBut that may also happen from trying to dissect the themes of this show. And OH BOY, thematically this show is a goddamn hot mess. It starts with an obvious focus on puberty and sexuality; episode 2 in particular is crammed with as many sexual innuendos as possible. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking, as I did, that the whole show would be like that. But instead, FranXX takes a sharp left away from those ideas to basically forgo any thematic depth for, like, ten episodes. Instead focusing on half assed attempts at \u201cdevelopment\u201d. The only recurring symbol is the \u201cJian\u201d, a bird that through some cruel twist of nature has only one wing and needs two partners to survive. Because codependency is something we apparently need to aspire to. The idea that these kids believe their entire purpose is to pilot the robots is something interesting, but like everything else cool in this show it is quickly brushed aside and forgotten about.\\n\\n\r\nWhen thematic elements return, it\u2019s suddenly about the importance of procreation and how the Japanese people need to have babies so Shinzo Abe will be pleased. I kid, but it really seems like FranXX is pushing for Japanese otaku to have babies and as a result, the themes become kind of laughable. Laughable as it may be, the constant focus on that idea of conception starts to give off a slightly...uncomfortable feeling. \\n\\n\r\nYou, the reader, may have seem posts or reviews discussing how FranXX is demonizing those who deviate from the man/woman gender gap. The characters of the 9\u2019s, the elite Franxx pilots for the government, have a scene in which their leader decries gender as something limiting. This character, 9 Alpha, says this in response to another character questioning humanity moving away from procreation. The implication is that by implying that only people who reproduce are truly human, and anyone that doesn\u2019t exist for \u201cleaving a mark for the future\u201d aren\u2019t equal. I, for one, am conflicted on that matter. On the one hand, I simply cannot believe this was all intentional. There\u2019s just no way that such rhetoric was the intended message; it always seemed more likely that this was the result of FranXX playing with themes far above its head. And that is probably the most likely scenario.\\n\\n\r\nYet at the same time, I can\u2019t help but understand where those people are coming from. The fact is that FranXX can be interpreted in that way and compelling arguments about it can rise. Which may make it even more heinous of a show for those who feel strongly on these issues. As for me, I\u2019m not certain I can discuss such ideas well. They\u2019re extremely intricate and tricky subjects to handle. But in my eyes, this is nothing but another sign of how awful the writing in FranXX is. That it didn\u2019t even consider this outcome or tried to not handle ideas outside its depth. Hell, even these ideas are scooted out the window in the finale for some heavy handed wedding symbolism. The entire storyline of Darling in the FranXX is a joke, a jumbled mess of ideas that try soooooo damn hard to get people engaged. Just absurd plotting and tacky thematics all around. I will say though, the finale was literally so idiotic I kind of loved it. Amazingly dumb in all the best ways.\\n\\n\r\nBut none of that is comparable to the most damning element of this show: Darling in the FranXX may possibly have one of, if not THE, worst cast of characters I\u2019ve seen yet in a mecha anime. I say \u201cpossibly\u201d because I\u2019ve seen shows worse than this, but at least those shows don\u2019t have obnoxious fans screaming about how great these wet blankets are. It is a weak defense, yes, but a defense nonetheless. FranXX, at 24 episodes, has no excuse for having a cast as shallow, uninteresting, generic, annoying, self inflated, and just unlikable in nearly every regard.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, FranXX has too many characters to properly develop and falls into that classic anime trap of spending time with the cast, but not truly getting to know them. What I mean by that is that the cast never expands beyond the surface level of their archetypes. Their development, if they even get any, is universally shallow and generic. Yet the show acts like these planks of plaster are really deep, and their development is profound. This speaks to a certain pretentiousness on FranXX\u2019s end It also seems to lean on the worn out trope of \u201cpeople have numbers instead of names\u201d trope to explain why certain people (mostly Ichigo) can be emotionally impacted by so little.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this is more apparent than with our lead character, Hiro. Hiro may be the most uninteresting mech protagonist in the history of mankind. He is, for the majority of the series, a nothing character. He has no traits, what personality he has is practically nonexistent, he lacks agency in nearly every regard, and is just dreadfully dull to watch. Is he supposed to be a self insert character? If so, I\u2019ve never seen one so botched. It\u2019s like the show tries to hide the fact that he\u2019s a self insert, but in doing so makes him ungodly bland. As the series progresses, he remains the same blank faced, unrelatable potato sack since episode 1. That is until 3 episodes near the end where, in one fell swoop, he became one of the most detestable characters I\u2019ve seen in anime. Someone who is willing to abandon everything and everyone who cares for him because of a pretentious sense of love. The one interesting thing he had was that initially he was a reverse Shinji in the sense that he desperately wanted to get in the goddamn robot, but couldn\u2019t. But that\u2019s dropped early on and he remains unbearably uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, when people defend FranXX and claim it has a good lead, they\u2019re not talking about Hiro. No, they\u2019re getting horny on main and praising \u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cBest girl\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d Zero Two. Yes, that pink haired, red horned chick that\u2019s been popping up all over the place, Zero Two is probably the reason most people started watching FranXX to begin with. Because waifu\u2019s or something. And I\u2019m gonna be upfront: I never liked her. I didn\u2019t hate her, but from episode 1, I was at a loss as to why so many were fawning over her. Something about her just felt...manufactured. Like she was a committee designed waifu to appeal to as many people as possible. Nothing about her attracted me to her, and I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s that attractive. Her dominatrix, intense personae also failed to grab me, for it too seemed like fodder for character hype.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the romance between Hiro and Zero Two. The main relationship that\u2019s supposed to be the emotional core of FranXX is honestly the most pathetic attempt at mecha romance to possibly ever exist. For the entire first half, Zero Two basically treats Hiro as disposable. Only relying on him because she can use him to pilot, as does he with her. It gives off a truly toxic feel of codependency, that these two are basically incapable of interacting in society without the other. It got to such a point that I began thinking this was supposed to be subverting the \u201cmagic mecha dream girl\u201d trope that pops up here and there. There\u2019s no way this couldn\u2019t be intentional, I thought at the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut then they get some half assed backstory that supposedly makes them meant to be and they spend the rest of the series head over heels for each other. Everyone is also somehow cool with her, even though she was a giant bitch to everyone other than Hiro. It\u2019s just so sudden of a shift, not helped by the actual backstory which was so predictable and generic I basically predicted it all before the episode even aired. Worst of all is that, after hooking up, Zero Two is basically neutered. Her drive that attracted so many to her vanished, and she became yet another blank slate who\u2019s only trait is \u201cI weally weally wove Hiro\u201d. Or perhaps I should say, \u201cI weally weally wove Darling\u201d, because I don\u2019t think she ever calls Hiro by name. Which is kind of messed up when I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show tries to make this relationship out as something to be celebrated. Everyone else\u2019s character devolves into \u201clet\u2019s talk about how great Hiro & Zero Two are, and why we should aspire to be like them\u201d. It\u2019s gets to the point that in the finale they literally say \u201cZero Two and Hiro were more human than any of us\u201d. Codependency is NOT something to aspire to. It\u2019s that inflated sense of self importance again, as the show tries desperately to make their relationship ring in any way but hollow. Also, it ruined the word \u201cDarling\u201d for me. It gets used so damn much I can\u2019t stand it. And it was such a nice word too...\\n\\n\r\nBut speaking of other characters, the rest of the Plantation kids don\u2019t fail to the same level as our leads, but are still dreadfully uninteresting in their own rights. Ichigo is the standard childhood friend desperately in love with the blank check of a protagonist. The first half gives us no traits outside of that love, even though it tries given that she is the leader of the kids. Attempts to give her drama fall flat because her character for the first half is as one note as it gets. Her crush on Hiro bizarrely leaves after episode 15, leaving her with basically no character other than simply existing and fellating the Hiro x Zero Two ship. Yet another sign that episode 15 came too damn early. \\n\\n\r\nMiku and Zorome are basically the same character. They both serve the overly spunky/obnoxious character role to a T, and have nothing to add beyond that. Zorome has an attempt at development, given that his other character trait is being blindly loyal to the system. But that\u2019s forgotten about pretty quickly and he devolves back into being an obnoxious brat. Miku gets absolutely nothing to do, so why is she even here? She occasionally bickers with Zorome, but that\u2019s about it. A lot of these kids could actually just be dropped from the show. It would probably improve things too.\\n\\n\r\nFutoshi is the prime example of this uselessness. He\u2019s every generic fat character written, never evolving beyond those tired tropes that come from his archetype. What makes me automatically dislike him is that he gets cucked near the halfway point, and is just so goddamn obnoxious about it. I get it, the girl he likes basically stopped piloting with him, but dear GOD SHUT UP!!! He\u2019s like one of those annoying white knight types, the sort who writes an angry blog about how girls never seem to go for \u201cnice guys\u201d like him. The show makes one attempt to give him an eating disorder of some kind for \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but it\u2019s so half assed in execution it comes off as insulting. And is IMMEDIATELY DROPPED IN THE SAME EPISODE IT\u2019S INTRODUCED IN!! Again, this character is entirely pointless to the show and should\u2019ve been cut entirely.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro and Mitsuru are pointless in their own unique way. Kokoro was only \u201cthe nice girl\u201d until she cucks the fat man. After that, her character becomes the focus of the procreation subplot, which does very little to improve her character. The worst is immediately following episode 15, when her whole character devolves into only wanting to have a kid. I swear, how does Tumblr of all places defend this trash heap? Mitsuru begins as the generic \u201crival\u201d character at first, which at least means he gets some development. But once Kokoro locks eyes with him, he too devolves into a potato as she basically forces him to go along in her baby making ways. Their romance too, is completely half assed and completely with an utterly pointless memory erased twist that adds nothing to the plot. There\u2019s also some subtext and debate over whether or not Mitsuru was initially gay for Hiro. Whether he was or not, it wouldn\u2019t change how dreadfully written he and his two(?) love interests are.\\n\\n\r\nIkuno may be the worst of all the kids. For the first half, she basically has no screen time whatsoever. Only existing because Mitsuru needed a partner before he got paired with the cucktress Kokoro. That is until the second half where the show, desperate to make her seem important, pulled the \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d card. I must ask: what does her being gay matter in the grand scheme of things? The answer is nothing, because immediately after this reveal that should be a big deal in a society like this, it\u2019s dropped in a throwaway line and completely forgotten about. It leaves you wondering what the point of that was and pondering some truly heinous subtext. The very definition of useless, she is.\\n\\n\r\nWhat characters I haven\u2019t mentioned yet are entirely worthless. The adults watching over the kids are complete nobodies who we learn nothing significant about. Attempts to give them character are laughably half-assed. Dr. FranXX is an honest to god child abuser and overall terrible person that they try to wring a sympathetic backstory out of. Why should I feel bad for the man who is honestly kind of responsible for the worlds sorry state? There\u2019s some weird talk also about him being a stereotypical \u201cevil atheist\u201d type, but I\u2019m not to confident in trying to explain how that nonsense works. The 9\u2019s are entirely irrelevant, their development out of nowhere and only 9 Alpha getting any prominent screen time. Even then, he\u2019s so forgettable my initial nickname for him, Kaworu-kun, was basically his name for the majority of the series. Because they apparently forgot to give him one for a while. Papa/the leaders of humanity are just really dull. That is, until the last third where your brain explodes trying to comprehend all the dumbassery the plot does with them. As for the Klaxo princess, there isn't enough to her for me to care about. She\u2019s just a plot device character made to push the show forward.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, however, one exception to all these characters. One individual who became unironically the best part of the show who I have saved until now. I speak of course of Goro, the ultimate embodiment of a bro. Unlike the other kids who are written with an air of pretension about their traits, Goro embraces his sheer bro-ness and becomes a truly likeable person. His highlight is no doubt episode 22, where he channels everyone\u2019s frustration at Hiro and his brain dead obsession with Zero Two into a truly powerful rant. Unfortunately, he recants on the rant immediately after. And he gets cucked for a majority of the series by Ichigo. Because why have a caring, is somewhat stale, man when you can make goo-goo eyes at a living potato? Goro in the end is still on the generic side, yes, but a much needed oasis in this desert blaze of a show. He\u2019s the only likeable bunch out of these ungodly abominations and planks of wood that dare to be called characters. That so many people swear by the writing for these things is ungodly.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for something that will REALLY piss people off, here\u2019s another spicy hot take: this show is ugly. The shows visuals are probably not the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, but it\u2019s subpar in nearly every way. To begin, the characters are not appealing to look at. They all have this weird outline at times that makes them look unfinished, and movement is static and unappealing. What attempts at fanservice there are fail to service anyone because the designs are attractive and what sideboob is seen is unappealing. A-1\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d style means that the fanservice just doesn't look good. That\u2019s kind of a problem when your main appeal is the attractiveness of one character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs fair no better. They are only memorable in how they look like other characters. Hiro looks like every A1 protagonist (i.e. Kirito) with slightly longer hair. Ichigo looks like Cocona from Flip Flappers. Goro\u2019s hair is ripped from Kittan Batchika. Mitsuru\u2019s initial hair kind of resembles Andrew Hainbridge from LWA. Even 02, whom people cannot seem to shut up about being attractive, is a failed attempt to combine Urusei Yatsura\u2019s Lum with E7\u2019s Anemone. The worst of it all is Kaworu-kun\u2019s squad, who aside from the main man himself (who sports a Kiznaiver-esque look) look absolutely hideous. Two of them even steal Hiro and Ichigo\u2019s hair, and give them garrish bright colors that is just disgusting. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply uninteresting, generic, and ultimately forgettable. Why Nishigiori himself didn\u2019t do the designs is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely the mechs and action must save the visuals, right? No, they don\u2019t. The mechs themselves, I must admit, are designed quite nicely. And by the mechs, I mean the main ones because all the other ones look like generic crap. Shigeto Koyama is one of the best mech designers around these days, but his designs are wasted here. Strelizia is honestly the only one that stands out, and that\u2019s only because her design is literally ripped from Star Driver. Klaxosaur designs are also on the generic side, lest we forget the one Klaxo that was literally just a box with horns.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, the action just feels soulless. I know it\u2019s Imaishi and his crew, and the actual fight animation is quite nice, but I feel nothing from it. Like with 02, the pieces for something truly skillful is there, but there\u2019s just no reason to care. Investment in what\u2019s going on can make or break a fight scene. There\u2019s also just, no emotion from any of it. FranXX has commercialized creativity, made the action madmen part of the machine. Compared to Gurren Lagaan or even this year's Eureka Seven movie, the mecha action is just weak sauce. Plus, with how little mecha their truly is, there\u2019s just less to attach to. The show also makes one attempt at a human action scene, and it\u2019s probably one of the most poorly framed and just worst fight scenes out there.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the show continues its aping. Sometimes it tries to have the Sawano esque tracks of Aldnoah Zero, other times it tries the heroic uplifing nature of Eureka Seven. Certain tracks are memorable, yes, but none of them are truly great. The opening theme \u201cKiss of Death\u201d is probably the best part about this show. It\u2019s a surprisingly intense song that gives off a truly dark vibe with great electronica use. In other words, it\u2019s the exact opposite of the shows quality and really deserves to be attached to a better show. The ED\u2019s fare not so well; there\u2019s like, 5, and they\u2019re all generic pop songs. Certainly fine, but nothing great. And with so many you\u2019ll be hard pressed to remember them all. Seiyu are alright, about what you\u2019d expect from this type of show. There\u2019s also a dub. I haven\u2019t seen it but heard less than great things about it. Be that a result of poor acting of the script giving the cast nothing to work with, I don\u2019t know.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that anger, and all that terribleness FranXX has going for it, you may be wondering: why is this only a 2? Why did you not grant it the one is more than likely deserves? And the answer is...I don\u2019t know. For a show to be a 1 it has to truly, unashamedly piss me off. I have to feel like my time was utterly wasted, that there was nothing I could take from it. And FranXX, for its part, just didn\u2019t give me that feeling. It angered me, yes. It frustrates me, yes. But it\u2019s more of an apathetic anger than the full blown fury that a 1 entails. With that said, this is so close to a 1 it\u2019s licking the front porch begging to come in. It\u2019s just something I can\u2019t explain, but FranXX is still one of the worst series I\u2019ve completed yet in this medium. Trying so desperately to be celebrated and to celebrate what came before it, only to fall flat due to its own incompetence, arrogance, and just overall worthlessness.\\n\\n\r\nThe most telling sign of FranXX\u2019s quality can be seen in the reaction to episode 15. After the fans stopped praising it for being an emotionally charged masterpiece (their words, not mine), what did they do? They started making memes out of it. They made a mockery of a scene they just earlier claimed to be a masterpiece. And that is what Darling in the FranXX will be remembered as. A joke, a gaff, a brainless clown that dances and tries so, so hard to make us like it. Oh yes, some of us do like it. But the rest of us see it, complain about it, and move on with our lives. And it fades from our memories as time goes on. As it should.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story: go watch Evangelion. Or RahXephon. Or Eureka Seven. Or Gurren Lagaan. Or any mech anime, really. Anything\u2019s better than this.",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nDarling in the FranXX is an original sci-fi anime co-production between studio Trigger and A-1 Pictures directed by Atsushi Nishigori (Tengen Toppa Gurren Langan, FLCL, Evangelion 1.0 Movie, etc..) with the mech designs made by Shigeto Koyama who became famous after his mech designs for Star Driver, with Nishigori and Naotaka Hayashi handling the series composition, Masayoshi Tanaka designing the characters, Hiroyuki Imaishi(one of the co-founders for Studio Trigger)  serving as action animation director and Asami Tachibana composing the music. The series was announced at Trigger\u2019s Anime Expo 2017 in July 2017, with the first episode airing on 13 January 2018 with alength of 24 episode running time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the distant future. The world is ruined, and humanity establishes mobile fort cities called \"plantations\". Pilots produced inside Plantation live in Mistilteinn, also known as the \"birdcage.\" Children living there know nothing of the outside world or the freedom of the sky. Their enemies are mysterious giant life forms known as Klaxosaur, and the children pilot machines called Franxx to face off against them. For the children who pilot those machines that is their sole reason to prove their own existence into that desolating future not knowing if they will see  the day of tomorrow.  The World is one of the strong points in this show and its containing elements are explained at a steady pace in each episode with the purpose of making the viewer to understand how its mechanics, principles and laws work and interact with the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTo get the viewer familiar with the characters in the first couple of episodes the anime displays their ordinary lives and activities  in those \u201cbirdcages\u201d and the specific bonds that are formed between them. If we take each character apart we will notice that Zero Two steals the spotlight each time she appears on screen leaving the other characters in a con of shadow\u2026..To compensate for that huge gap the anime focuses on the bonds between them and how will influence their further development into that world. The anime allocates time in each episode to dive into each character and display their reasons for piloting the Franxx and depending on your own interpretation you may hate them or love them. There are some heartwarming moments that enforce the bond between our  characters that myself I just fell in love with them. Another thing I must mention is how beautiful and smart the visual metaphors are used when each character is telling us  his own experience as a Franxx pilot and what made him the person that he is today. These are the \u201cmarvelous slice of life moments\u201d that made me love and appreciate  Darling in the FranXX.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters as they dive further into the that world filled with destruction where each day is a battle for survival discover and learn different emotions that they aren\u2019t familiar with it such as love, bond, affection, compassion and family. Those emotions  become their new sole reason of existence replacing the old one in which their lives were at stake each day. Their fight is not over yet but this time is not a fight for the selfish adults but for their own future and to create a place filled with smiles and warmth a place called HOME. The bonds that are formed between the characters, their experience principles that they form for themselves during the fights with the Klaxosaurs become the foundation for their development and growth as characters across this show.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals & Audio:\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off with a visual metaphor to captivate the attention of the viewers  which later will become a narrative monologue metaphor  part of the story and main plot of  Darling in the FranXX. The visual vocabulary is rich and attractive having an important role for telling us the long forgotten bond between Zero Two and Hiro which is the main attraction of this anime. The visuals, story and audio together manage to take the viewer through different stages of emotions and connect them to each character\u2019s experience. The op song is damn good especially the one for the second half were the visual metaphors are damn juicy for the audience who enjoys this kind of  stuff.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion & Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs having some experience in many anime communities and hearing a lot of different opinions about this anime, myself  agree or disagree with many of their points about Darling in the FranXX  who borrowed different elements from famous shows like Evangelion , TTGL, Kill la Kill and so on\u2026\u2026 Despite  all  of that, this show manages to maintain its original  concept and despite the lack of appeal for some characters this anime manages to deliver a form of enjoyment accessible to a variety of viewers (beginner or veteran) especially those who don\u2019t enjoy the mecha genre, through its unique mech designs, characters bonds and visual metaphors. Having seen a lot of  shows with different genres and variety of themes I gotta say that I enjoyed Darling in the FranXX  for the story , world and bond created between the characters and hope studio Trigger will keep on the good  quality they deliver in their original concepts  for shows that may come in the  near future.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Money has always been the core of everything, especially in the realm of entertainment mediums. In the case of the anime industry, when a work has a high budget, people behind it can go a little bit wild in forming their ideas and emotions onto the screen. In contrast, when they are short on funds and/or urgently want their product to sell, they use numerous slick marketing techniques and don't put too much effort into crafting the product. Now you may ask: \"But what does it have to do with Darling in the FranXX? It doesn't suffer from a low budget, nor it tries tosell itself with little to no effort.\" While the first part of that sentence may be right, I cannot agree with the second one.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, accurately called by some people, Cucking in the FranXX is a collab between two extremely well-known studios, A-1 Pictures, which over the years has produced quite a number of controversial titles, and Trigger, founded by ex-Gainax employees and recognised for its bizarre and lively art style. Wait, so people who worked at Gainax are here? Yes, Hiroyuki Imaishi is here and so is Atsushi Nishigori, as the director. Just why?! Why would you place a guy who might have a fair understanding when it comes down to animation, haha, his character designs are pretty darn good, but has a directional knowledge that doesn't go beyond \"Yeah, I directed iDOLM@STER\" as the man in charge? I mean, just look at the first episode, 22 minutes of HIS sole work. It was written entirely by him and do you know what? It's terrible. Our main duo and their future relationship are presented in the banalest and one-dimensional way possible. We get the first glimpse of Hiro's personality through some tedious dialogues of other characters and not his character-defining actions and Zero Two's first encounter with him, quite certainly, had to have a sexual background, because why not? Toss in some titties! Oh, don't forget to make them fuck and do some batshit crazy stuff in a mecha, by the end of the episode. Mission accomplished, characters are (not) established! Don't you worry though as this fantastic and slick writing continues till the very end! Imagine a bowl filled with dough, ready to be merged with the ingredients necessary for baking the quality cake, but instead of said elements, what gets thrown inside is, literally, anything that lies nearby. That's how this show, genuinely, progresses. It began as a story concentrated around the sex symbolism, i.e. all of this piloting mechas in doggy style position and camera angles straight on a girl's ass bullshit. I like to call this section in FranXX's construction as \"The horny period\" as it baits potential viewers with its lewd imagery and themes. Then, it developed into a full-on teen drama with a little bit of NTR sprinkled on top since, you know, there are characters besides the main duo in this anime! It pretended to be a coming-of-age tale while treating its characters with remarkably passive writing that they came off as lifeless and rigid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the deal. Every single character in this show is a walking talking archetype, no matter how much time people behind this show put into these teenagers. Futoshi is the obese guy, Ichigo is the childhood female friend that falls in love with the protagonist because... Zero Two needs an empty love adversary, Goro is the nice guy who gets cucked, Zorome is the hyperactive one, Kokoro is the additional sexually frustrated hoe, Ikuno is the hollow anal type of a character, Mitsuru is the cocky lad and Miku is the enthusiastic girl. I just described the entire cast in full detail with the use of a few words. Situations, where these fellow individuals are given some kind of a turn, are not rare, in fact, they are there to remind us that, hey, these characters actually exist, I know, that's shocking, but they are resolved and forgotten in a span of AT MAX 2 episodes. Oh, does Futoshi have bulimia for some stupid reason? Remind him that he has to eat, problem solved. Oh, there's someone called Ikuno and she's the most transparent out of all the cardboard cutouts? SHIT! Better throw in some lesbian action without foreshadowing it! Oh, is Mitsuru over his gay-ish fantasies? SHIT! Better make him the love interest of Kokoro and kill 2 birds with one stone! Do these situations add an extra layer to these characters? No, they do not. Honestly, they exist for the sole purpose of not making these guys so forgettable that even the simplest of the viewer doesn't give a damn about them by the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, we come to the last section in Darling in the FranXX, the okay-ish worldbuilding episode and the big alien invasion. *cough* \"How do we keep our viewers interested in the series till the end? The popularity of the series has gone down drastically with its progression, please think of something! how about we just throw in some alien bullshit? Brilliant!!\" I imagine that was the thinking process behind these few episodes. Out of fricking nowhere, we get an alien invasion? Was it foreshadowed? No. Was it built up in any logical sense? No. Does it make sense? No. And do you know why this whole thing was arranged? Because the space elements worked in Gurren Lagann, so it's assured that they will work here too... right? You see, I didn't mention it before, but... this series takes EVERY SINGLE INTERESTING PLOT ELEMENT from Gurren Lagann and Neon Genesis Evangelion. What's that? A theme of youth and growing up, the main and fantastically executed and humane theme of Gurren Lagann? Let's take it and screw it up here because why not? What's that? Changing from a typical monster of the week type of a narrative into an absolute psychological feast, which was done in Neon Genesis Evangelion flawlessly? Guess what? FranXX borrows that structure but instead of psychological intricacies, it offers a horrific teenager drama with no emotional weight behind it. The list goes on and on! A copycat of SEELE? Check. Tokyo-3/Geofront inspired underground cities? Check. Are klaxosaurs a hybrid of the spirals and angels? Check. HOW BRILLIANT! \\n\\n\r\nBut, do you know what's even better than the broken narrative of FranXX? Its splinter that got stuck underneath my skin so many goddamn months ago - Zero Two. At this point, it should be more than apparent that I absolutely hate her. If you saw me at least once on the MAL forums, you would notice me with a caricature of her disgusting face. All of my seemingly \"unreasonable\" hatred for her person can be summarised in one single sentence: She's an abhorrent character because she's not a character, dang it, she's not even a damn plot device like Biba from Kabaneri or any other 0-dimensional \"villain\" ; she's a tool used to sell this monstrosity of a show. She was created to play the role of the \"best\" character in the entire anime and to exclude others from being important, worth remembering or straight up existing in the eyes of an average Joe watching FranXX. Unmistakably, this anime's appalling writing played an important role in making the supporting characters paper thin, but look at her character design and compare it to that of Squad 13's members. Did you spot it? Every single fellow beside her owns a bland grey uniform, while our dear female wears a distinctive and eye-catching red coat, heck, even her parasite suit bares the same colour with the addition of heels, heck x2, even her face and hair are way more \"defined\", which furtherly distances her from others. Pretty much the same thing applies to her personality. While it's extremely annoying and hyperfocused on the concept of stealing the hearts of cucks without breaking a sweat, stands as the only recognisable one. Not for long though, as she went from the obnoxious horny waifu bait tool to the shallow and unbelievably artificial waifu bait tool due to her consistent character shifts. Here, let me explain how she developed over the course of this series with this: \"Hey, I'm 12-year-olds' wet dream\" > \"im a monster :(\" > \"I'm over it :D darling :3 :D\" > \"b-but im a monster :(\". Ugh, even her relationship with Hiro, which, NEWS FLASH, is the primary focus of the story comes off as toxic and fake. Well, that's what happens when you combine a generic self-insert cuck, who's an empty seashell with gold sprayed on top with the most hurtful, for the viewer that desires high quality, marketing method: a horny and futile waifu bait that will easily sell merchandise.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for something a little bit more positive, let's stray from this road of complete agony and take a look at the production values. Visually, this anime looks good and stable for the majority of the times. I won't gonna lie, as much as I don't like... anything in this show, I have to give FranXX credit for its fighting scenes. It may be devoid of any personality, but damn, the fluidly animated battles (I'm talking about the mech fights, not the god awful space LotGH stylised battles) are darn good. The backgrounds, stills and colours are more or less decent. Aurally, meh, it leaves much to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy Darling in the FranXX? Well, franxxly, HELL NO. This show has been such a frustrating nuance since the very beginning. Dear Lord, merely hearing and seeing Zero Two made me want to gouge my eyes out. Mangling your goddamn story didn't enhance the viewing experience. What a surprise! I would describe this atrocity in 2 words; cringy and pretentious. Adding the flavourless bird symbolism and the poorly executed theme of dualism and colour theory rather than supplementing the plot, made this anime look like its trying to be more profound than it is in reality. Oh, you like when the symbolism and subtle themes are well incorporated into the narrative and aren't \"into your face\"? Guess what? You will want to puke next time you see one of these. B-but the fights look nice! So what? Do they bear any meaning? Hell no. There's no emotional weight behind any of these. Why should I care about characters creators themselves do not care about? But the director said that he wanted the characters to remain human till the very end. Haha, guess what? They weren't humane, to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nUh, let's be FranXX, this show sucks on every single level imaginable. It's as devoid of motion, emotion and heart as humanly possible. If you want to see a good waifu material, stick to shows that truly care about their personality. As for me, I will try to erase my memory of this abomination... by stabbing myself in the temple.

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX, the product of a partnership between the esteemed anime studios Trigger and A-1 Pictures, ended up being like a rollercoaster ride. The anime has many good things going for it, yet for every positive aspect of the show, I found that there seemed to be a negative to correlate with it. I was torn between writing a supportive assessment or a critical dissertation of the anime, so in the end, I thought why not write both? The following review is divided into two segments, one talking about the good characteristics of the anime, and the other discussing the bad.\r\n______________________________\r\nNEGATIVE NOTIONS\r\nWARNING: Containsspoilers and sarcasm\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is an anime about a bunch of teens with problems who ride robots. Wow, how original! Well, at least this anime adds its own unique twists to the mecha genre. Too bad viewers have to sit through several bland episodes before anything actually happens. This is made worse by the fact that during this time, viewers are subjugated to the self-pitying monologues of Hiro, who is the HERO of the anime. Now you might find something familiar about Hiro. Well, that\u2019s because he is strikingly similar to [INSERT_GENERIC_ANIME_PROTAGONIST_HERE]. That\u2019s right, Hiro starts off dull, uninspired, and seems to lack any basic human emotions. His only distinctive quality is that unlike Shinji, this guy actually WANTS to get in the fricking robot. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I thought to be the worst part of the show would be the klaxosaurs. Introduced as humanity\u2019s adversaries, these beasts ended up being more disappointing than Goro\u2019s love life.  First of all, they just look lazily designed. I found the majority of FranXX\u2019s visuals to be generally satisfactory, but the klaxosaurs were poorly animated blobs of black and blue mass. Their mysterious origins were the only thing the klaxosaurs had going for them, but the anime\u2019s explanation of these origins was so underwhelming that it made me dislike the klaxosaurs even more. Thankfully, FranXX is an anime about the psychology of people as opposed to one about monster fights, and the klaxosaurs aren\u2019t even the protagonists\u2019 main adversaries anyway, so their shortcomings really aren\u2019t that deleterious to the show\u2019s success. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s too bad that the true antagonists are just as bad. Seriously though, the big \u201cplot twist\u201d near the end of the anime that revealed Earth\u2019s true enemies was so convoluted that I almost laughed at its absurdity. And the writing of everything that followed was messier than Dr. FranXX\u2019s soiled pants after he laid his perverted eyes on the klaxosaur princess. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned how the anime\u2019s strong points would be character interactions and development. Alas, there are still some issues with this department as well. The primary one would be how the writers apparently thought that the only way they could evolve their characters and get viewers to care about their struggles was through forced romance drama. Now I\u2019ve seen this theme used before, but in FranXX, its overuse is more ridiculous than the concept that magma can somehow grant immortality. It started to get pretty repetitive real fast when every main character would confess their love to another who happened to love someone else, thus creating what the writers would probably call \u201ctension\u201d. The only ones free of this curse were Miku and Zorome, who were probably just too annoying for anyone else to fall in love with. \\n\\n\r\nSo it\u2019s no secret that Zero Two ended being the best part of the anime for a lot of viewers, myself included. But even the greatest pink haired, crazy anime girl- er, I mean second greatest. I think YUNO who\u2019s really the best\u2026has her share of flaws.\\n\\n\r\nSo my main problem with Zero Two ended up being the sudden fluctuation of her personality that would literally just come out of nowhere. The most noticeable instance would be her dramatic character shift during the middle of the anime. She went from \u201cI love you Darling!\u201d to \u201cHa! I was actually just using you as fodder and hate all of your friends!\u201d to \u201cI love you again Darling! Oh, and btw, I completely made up with everyone else offscreen! Now we\u2019re all besties!\u201d In like 2 or 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow I actually think that the WAY she develops is great. However, I wish the creators gave her more TIME to develop instead of having a bunch of episodes where she remained stagnant and then unexpectedly altering her persona for the sake of drama. Then they just resolved all issues immediately after like they meant nothing. But hey, she\u2019s a monster girl waifu, so that completely invalidates all of this, right? Riiiiight\u2026\\n\\n\r\n______________________________\\n\\n\r\nFAVORABLE FACTORS \\n\\n\r\nWARNING: Contains positivity and praise\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to start this off by saying that Zero Two, the kawaii monster girl waifu and best girl 2018 contender, is a pretty entertaining character and a definite highlight of the show. Hiro should be honored that she claimed him as her darling. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s plot admittedly takes awhile to get going, but when it does, you just can\u2019t help but be intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the world of FranXX. And you have to commend the anime for its subtle yet effective world building. Up until the last several episodes, there were never any lengthy exposition dumps, and elements of the story were gradually revealed in pieces that fit together in the grand puzzle. This approach resulted in each episode being fresh and exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, none of this would have mattered if the story didn\u2019t have any decent characters to interact in this world. FranXX has ten \u201cmain\u201d characters, with Hiro and Zero Two being the most significant and fleshed out of the bunch. Now I figured that the majority of these characters would basically just be filler and serve no purpose, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the anime dedicated some time to developing each and every one of them. Aside from the two leads, Goro and Ichigo got the most focus and development, and I ended up really liking their characters. Kokoro and Mitsuru had great synergy, and Miku and Zorome were pretty humorous at times, but could be serious when necessary. I even found myself genuinely caring about the well being of Futoshi and Ikuno and hoping that they would survive through the show.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to dedicate a paragraph to praise the flashback episode. For me, it was the pinnacle of the anime, and it heightened my impressions on the plot, characters, and, well, everything about the anime really. It genuinely made me feel for Zero Two, and I ended up gaining a newfound respect for Hiro, who I had sort of disregarded as a bland character prior to this episode. In fact, I actually ended up liking shota Hiro a lot more than his teenage counterpart. He was simply more interesting and charismatic as a child. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime boasts a fine assortment of music. Each and every one of the ending theme songs is quite catchy. The opening theme song, Kiss of Death, is a really great tune. Voice actors do a fine job, and Japan once again demonstrates their uncanny ability to breed females who voices sound like the most adorable things ever that just make your heart melt from the cuteness. In this anime, it was loli Zero Two who got the super kawaii voice, and it was delightful to listen to. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: Contains my personal opinion\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is ultimately an incredibly flawed anime. Just as it starts to establish itself as good after several great episodes, it falls apart by following them up with a bafflingly bad and confusing episode. But you know what? I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Despite the many issues in the narrative, I still found myself captivated by the story and plot progression and found myself rooting for the characters during their times of struggle. Now maybe you\u2019re different, and maybe you found that the negative aspects of the show outweighed the positive ones. But for me, I know that I\u2019ll look back on Darling in the FranXX with fond memories.",

            "content": "I'll admit it, I give good scores to anime with great character design.  However, I usually don't like mecha, and this anime has really silly looking mecha to boot.  The character interactions are intriguing and the story setting is very adventuresome--it kind of reminds me of Dune actualy.  I have a bit of a weakness for the post-apocalyptic wastelands and this show does a great job of making it look bleak.\r\nAside from presumably appealing to their target audience, I'm not sure why the ones saving the world are always children.  At least the adults assuage whatever guilt they might feel bythrowing the occasional parade for these kids who are not likely to reach adulthood due to constantly risking death to defend everyone.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ecchi content is surprisingly tasteful, I'm surprised the other reviewers haven't mentioned the ridiculously silly \"piloting\" mechanic in the anime: a boy and a girl have to pair up, and their position in the \"cock\"pit is essentially doggy-style.  No, seriously, two handles on the girl's bum flip up and allow the boy to control the mech.  No, no, really, I'm serious.  That's how the show does it--doggy style.  I actually thought the kisses were genuinely moving, the children's unfamiliarity with physical affection charming... but, really, doggy style.  They aren't subtle about it, either.  The girls moan in while piloting (being piloted?) and at one point the MC even literally says that he felt himself, \"driving deeper\" into his partner.  I don't personally mind it but I thought maybe the softcore porn in this show bears mentioning if you plan on tuning in.",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is best described as a failed experiment, although that might not be entirely true in the sense that it certainly achieved widespread appeal and amassed a considerable following of its own. Through my own viewing experience, I can surmise that there was in fact no other goal in mind. Darling in the FranXX feels like little more than a vapid and desperate attempt to harness the influence and legacy of other anime, and does so clumsily with seemingly no intent of creating its own identity. Much of its elements are thoughtlessly replicated from successful shows such as Evangelion and Gurren Lagann,without an understanding of what made these elements work in their own respective titles. It handles these elements so incredibly poorly and with such naivety that it could almost serve as a parody of the material it takes after.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Hiro in particular faces an internal struggle relating to self-esteem and a desire to be needed, not dissimilar to that of Shinji Ikari from Evangelion. But while Shinji was given a thorough introspective on his character to make him feel like a real human being, Darling in the FranXX makes no hesitation to skip over to the drama, expecting viewers to buy into it the moment it\u2019s established. Hiro along with all the other characters doesn\u2019t feel human in the slightest because his conflict is conceptual. Conflicts are not character traits; incessant monologuing on how Hiro wants to be Zero Two\u2019s partner is not substantial enough to take priority over the action or, better yet, actual story and character progression. This is just one example of what Darling in the FranXX does wrong compared to the works it takes after, specifically Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. Both these shows did what was necessary to flesh their characters out before opening the floodgates on the drama. There was drama in those instances of course, but it was in relatively small doses and was mostly a side effect of character interaction and certain other events. It\u2019s as if the writers of Darling in the FranXX wanted to take inspiration from Evangelion and to a lesser extent Gurren Lagann without having watched either of those shows to discern what made them work in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of why Darling in the FranXX fails as a character study or drama amounts to the basic issue that the characters are sorely lacking in depth, and likewise fails to so much as come close to the monumental standard Evangelion had set in stone. Evangelion arguably contains some of the most human characters in all of anime, for reasons that are apparently lost on Darling in the FranXX. Character interactions felt genuine and grounded, effectively fleshing out these characters as well as their relationships with one another. Much focus was put on how they each operated in the grievous environments they were confined in. No such introspective or chemistry is present in Darling in the FranXX despite there being similar conditions. Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s want for each other, Ichigo\u2019s jealousy, and the Parasites\u2019 discovery of love all remain conceptual without any complexity or dynamic whatsoever. In other words, the show\u2019s focus lies squarely on the destination with hardly any focus on the journey, which flies directly in the face of basic story writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions in general are often completely mundane and are taken more seriously than they have any right to be. Most of the time they hardly evoke anything that isn\u2019t already known by the audience and are overblown to a sometimes cringe-inducing level. Once a singular concept is made apparent by a certain dialogue or monologue, subsequent interactions relating to this concept serve no purpose to the narrative apart from artificial drama. Ichigo\u2019s fixation on Hiro in particular has no effect on Hiro\u2019s arc nor his character, and only serves to spur more dramatic tension. Ichigo herself has no depth apart from her love and concern for Hiro, and the drama involving her once again remains conceptually the same with no complexity to warrant its screen time. It\u2019s also funny how quickly her mind changes once things turn out to be fine in the end, as sees Zero Two \u201cfor who she really is\u201d. There\u2019s hardly any dynamic present with any of the characters in Darling in the FranXX. Their traits all boil down to love or concern for one another or a singular goal of their own. There\u2019s no events in between to further characterize them or challenge their beliefs. If you were to assemble a plot chart based on the events in each individual character arc on Darling in the FranXX, it really becomes apparent how barren the story really is, even compared to first-grade-level writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Gurren Lagann were hardly complex themselves, but the show excels in other areas which make moments with its characters so worthwhile compared to FranXX. For one thing, Gurren Lagann doesn\u2019t excessively pile on drama where it doesn\u2019t belong. It recognizes that it isn\u2019t fit for any sort of cerebral commentary or psychological analysis, and instead focuses on making its characters charismatic and endearing, only prioritizing the characters\u2019 internal conflicts when it was deemed necessary. Circumstances were introduced at a steady pace to keep viewers in tune with the adventure and understand the characters\u2019 struggles. And the drama in the second half, although it had mixed reactions from viewers, is still arguably more plausible and impactful than Darling in the FranXX could ever manage. The show effectively set these characters as it let other elements run their course as the simple character arcs were left in the back seat. What results is very likeable characters within a captivating series of events which is all executed tremendously. Darling in the FranXX is too focused on its futile effort on making these characters sympathetic to make them appealing in any other way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Darling in the FranXX holds in place of natural story progression is its world building. Much of the motivation held by the characters is the dark truths they find about their own world. This kind of story isn\u2019t uncommon, and The Matrix is perhaps the most well-known example of this particular setup. This was also the case with other anime like Ergo Proxy and Shinsekai yori which, unlike The Matrix, take the form of a long, continuous narrative. Where both these anime succeeded where Darling in the FranXX fails is how they made these narratives captivating as an actual storyline. Discovering these disturbing secrets had an effect on the individual characters. Their views on the world changed substantially, and sometimes even considered giving up because they didn\u2019t want to have to endure more pain. Nothing of this sort ever happens in Darling in the FranXX. These discoveries don\u2019t add to their character in any interesting or dynamic way. They just pile on more reasons for the characters to act against their society. Their goals remain exactly the same and they seem to persist without hesitation no matter how much of their anguish is displayed. The most it ever manages is short-term shock of the characters only to be brushed off immediately after.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building itself doesn\u2019t fare much better. It\u2019s a mish-mash of cliches and borrowed ideas that fail to surprise anyone with at least a moderate experience with sci-fi. The show also seems to be more focused on whipping up surprises and twists about its world than maintaining any cohesion. Many elements of its world remain underdeveloped as though they were hastily thought of as production deadlines were drawing near, which is honestly my exact impression.\\n\\n\r\nEven as flat as she is, Zero Two is the closest thing to an interesting character that this show has on offer, but fundamentally she doesn\u2019t act the way she should in the first act. All throughout she\u2019s been portrayed to be lonely, distrustful, and longing for someone who will give her comfort. And yet despite all this, she acts like a jolly, flamboyant, promiscuous exemplar who is far more easy going than any of the other Parasites in Squad 13. This was presumably done to make her more likeable, and possibly to juxtapose her descent into anxiety later on. But this comes off as artificial because of how illogical it is, and rendered completely implausible the moment an attempt is made to give her a tragic backstory. Consistent characterization is worth sacrificing a facade of a personality such as this. It's easy to see that if Zero Two wasn't like this at the start she wouldn't have the widespread appeal she does now, which I think ultimately reaffirms how poorly-thought-out her character really is overall.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes to further display how Darling in the FranXX is at odds with itself in regards to its tone as well as plausibility. It\u2019s pretentious take on sexuality is just one example; the show is littered with other things like this. Dr. Franxx is presented as noble, powerful, and ambitious individual with a lot of importance to the storyline. And yet the very first scene he\u2019s in is a comedic moment where he molests a co-worker, and with no repercussions I might add. Additionally, puerile sex innuendos run rampant in a show that clearly wants to be taken seriously in nearly every instance. They have a place in Kill la Kill, where they clearly mesh with the overall tone. And in Evangelion, symbols relating to sex and birth were deliberately nuanced, attributed to the varying conditions of the characters and evoking them indirectly, just as symbolism should. Darling in the FranXX\u2019s approach on this routine is designing the cockpits in such a way that puts both pilots in doggy-style intercourse. It\u2019s a frivolous stylistic choice far more inane than anything in Kill la Kill and adds nothing of worth to the sort of themes it wants to get across. This image is seen frequently throughout the show, and makes it harder to get invested in whatever dire situation is in play. Whether it\u2019s possible to collide the styles of Evangelion and Kill la Kill successfully and seamlessly, I can\u2019t say. I can say however that this is certainly among the worst ways of going about it.\\n\\n\r\nSexuality is supposedly a theme with the story and characters alike, but the way it\u2019s handled feels a lot more like a means of falling back to basic anime tropes than any sort of meaningful take on the matter. Anyone familiar with the medium can understand what I\u2019m getting at here. Flustered male characters, embarrassed female characters, beach episode, you name it. One episode in particular encapsulates a pitifully juvenile boys vs. girls affair, which is handled quite poorly and serves as nothing more than a bare-bones teamwork lesson with fanservice thrown in the mix. What\u2019s also preposterous is the fact that, despite that they don\u2019t know what sex is or what a kiss represents, they\u2019re somehow aware that nudity is inherently sexual. As it stands, Darling in the FranXX\u2019s take on sexuality is about as cerebral and nuanced as your usual harem. The very implication of a theme relating to sexuality has no place here whatsoever, other than to seemingly mask its intentions as something greater than what you\u2019d find in a harem.\\n\\n\r\nMany people seem to think that Darling in the FranXX had lots of potential, and had the ability to easily achieve much more with what it had. Personally, I disagree with that sentiment. While I won\u2019t say there was no hope for it to turn out better, I can\u2019t say that much potential was wasted. Almost every element of Darling in the FranXX feels bought off from other shows. It uses the visual design of Kill la Kill or any Trigger anime for that matter, the concept of fusing mecha pilots taken from Gurren Lagann, and the existential journey from Neon Genesis Evangelion. The only remotely novel concept in the show is how the FranXX\u2019 take on the form of the pilot, which is little more than an aesthetic design and a rather uninspired one at that. Most elements in Darling in the FranXX are already present in many shows before it, and are handled much better. Much of the apparent potential within Darling in the FranXX has already been manifested elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI imagine most of the effort made in the production of Darling in the FranXX was put into the action sequences, which I can say are rather impressive. They\u2019re well-choreographed, fluidly animated, and have lots of energy to accentuate that trademark Trigger aesthetic. This is one of the few departments of the show which doesn\u2019t feel as though it was soullessly bought off, but seems to have some degree of skill and diligence put into it. This quality might have amounted to something if any ounce of value in this department hadn\u2019t already been bested by earlier shows, namely those made by Imaishi himself. In this regard you\u2019re already better off flocking over to those anime instead, and with much better story and characters at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle on the other hand is nothing more than a passing grade, and feels like a spinless compromise between that of Evangelion and Kill la Kill, topped with A-1 Pictures\u2019 own flavor of blandness. The designs of the Franxx\u2019 are quite standard and ordinary, contrary to the enigmatic and daunting look of the Evas. The character designs are reminiscent of Kill la Kill, only trimmed of any unique or endearing quality and reduced to an SAO-level of creativity. The only environments that look even remotely striking are the Plantations and the labs within them, which take an obvious inspiration to that of Evangelion. Their scheme of yellow and red lighting along with how well they\u2019re animated certainly looks appealing, if not a weaker effort compared to Evangelion. Overall, the aesthetic department is a case of hit-or-miss. Whatever styles it takes from other shows, it just drops aimlessly hoping that at least a few pieces will fit well.\\n\\n\r\nThe best word to describe Darling in the FranXX as a whole is \u201csuperficial\u201d, from the very idea of it all the way down to its execution. Its ideas are already outclassed from the start and the end result doesn\u2019t even serve as a lesser alternative. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any thought or consideration towards most of the elements, which presumably goes to show the thought process during the show\u2019s creation. I see little to no signs of this being made as a work of imagination instead of a means of garnering an audience through controversy and artificial drama. It\u2019s pitifully boastful about its tacked-on themes, has fanfiction-level story writing, and completely disregards logic for the sake of viewership, with Zero Two yet again being a perfect example. Regardless of how shamelessly derivative its core ideas are, Darling in the FranXX was not beyond salvaging. It had its material, which could have been utilized to uplift itself from the mangled state it turned out to be in the end. It might not have been the best at any of what it had to offer, but at the very least it could have delivered a serviceable experience with possibly a unique flavor of its own. As it stands now, Darling in the FranXX has exhausted almost any reason to justify its own existence. It\u2019s an effort, or lack thereof, that I feel nothing but contempt for. I don\u2019t exactly bear resentment or malice towards this show like so many others. I see this show as little more than a tragic accident, which I can only hope will fade away in the near future.",

I will start with what I do not like= the dragons are badhere..... srsly DRAGONS? before I started watching this anime I was imagining dragons as an anime called Cross Ange, it seems like it was a mistake, I'd better call these dragons for Acrids something like that (from the game called Lost planet colonies) and in order to be able to fight against them are needed mechs controlled by teens, because it is accepted by law here and these teens need to protect the city and other things and then new intrigues and other things appear later. As far as I see there are two teens groups and both live in each of their homes all living teens live as it is in reality and in generall story I like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10- Since I rate animation and art together then everything is beautifully drawn yes, there are places where there is potboiler, but everything is fine, more attention was paid to me mech drawing I do not know how others, but I see mechs for the first time with eyes and mouths the idea seems rather original at first, they did not like me but after several episodes that I fell in love.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- I appreciate the music here very much, it's a pleasure that music finds a place not in just battle episodes but in a drama this is one of several reasons which makes me watch this art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10- so I will try briefly and specifically, all teens except Zero two by character and behavior are completely the same as anime called Ginga Kikoutai Majestic Prince, but Zero Two is a combination of two characters (that's just how I see it) Lucy+Yuzuriha, Inori (Elfen lied+Guilty Crown)- this is another reason why I keep watchin.... some kind of love arises here :*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10- every day I watch 3-4 episodes, because I wanted to watch and watch becouse Zero Two= mysticism- I think I love her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10- I very much hope that anime will not end like Guilty Crown or Elfen Lied, I do not want to cry I want to see a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nBonus- I hope the anime will continue in a spirit like 15 episodes\\n",

The biggest issue at times is pacing feels off, which is subjective, but off compared to past series by Trigger or A1 it stands out. Then the other major issue is the conclusion felt rushed, as in things didn't finalize until the final 3 episodes. Referencing Kill La Kill, there were clear objectives from the start. That isn't the case here since it seemed like a survival show, but the main enemy changes as the show goes on. That is fine, but the issue is the true enemyand objective was rushed into the picture towards the end. That is my biggest flaw since the ending is good, and the final battle is good, but the final \"villain\" was rushed without much build up unlike past shows. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the strong suit is the characters and animation. Granted, there are a few episodes that will anger some fans on how the characters act, but it comes together later on. That said, it confuses the week by week viewers like myself. The good news is the characters are strong for the most part, and I enjoyed seeing them grow. Finally the animation is solid, and it's beautifully animated. I say give it a watch.",

            "content": "This will be my final review on the anime seeing as the last time I wrote a review for this anime was around Episode 12. The review MAY contain SPOILERS BE WARNED\r\nI'll keep it short, but to be honest Darling In The Franxx had so much potential going for it. It really did set up a good premise, but I felt as if after Episodes 1-16 the Studio had no idea what on earth to do with the anime. It felt as if the show that was slowly becomming one of my favourites slowly was losing its unique feel and special qualities and that sucked.\r\nThestory is a constant battle against Slice of Life Vs Action scenes. I didn't really feel anything in the final battle against the Villian's knwon as (VIRM) because it's literally the same old thing?\\n\\n\r\nEnemy wins > Main character has a realization > All of a sudden works out > Beats enemy> That's honestly throughout the entire story & that's why action scenes didn't really matter to me. They tried to make a hybrid of action and romance and the only thing they did good which I think is why a good portion stayed was because of the romance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDarling In The Franxx is an ambitious anime to begin with but falls flat in the second half of the series on what they were trying to convey. I can only imagine the writers didn't know what to do after the first half of the show and winged it sadly. Would I recommend it? Sure go aheadm, you may enjoy it, but for me sadly it's average at best and it sucks to say that.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

            "content": "Don't go in here expecting the next Kill la Kill or Gurren Lagann as the synopsis and studio may well suggest because you will be sorely disappointed, instead go in here expecting something that is much worse than mediocre in every single department possible and be just as disappointed.\r\nUnderstandably, the OP is not the same kind of genre presented in more action oriented series, but that doesn't excuse Franxx from having poorly designed mechs crammed with symbolism and fanservice its writers seemingly love to hamfist into the audience; while fighting even more shoddily created CGI enemies, the mech's nonsensical mechanics are powered by the emotionstability or angst of two pilots, supposedly setting up the series for some sort of impact twist. Sure, there's a few well placed burst of animation drawn by well known figures in the animation industry, but other than that, combat movements seemingly resemble the frame-skipping style of Kill la Kill, yet lacks all of the energy, innovation, and impact that the previous Trigger show has familiarized us to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest concern here is the pacing... why does it have to take the writers 15 episodes to resolve Hiro and 002's interpersonal problems where they could have just revealed one of the most predictable and straight forwarded \"twist\" ever by the second half of the first cour? It's not so much that there is no need for buildup, but it's rather because of how quick and conclusive it felt despite all 14 episodes leading up to it, naturally, it doesn't help its case either when the story is comprised of one hell of a poorly executed script filled with unnecessary elements that have seemingly been abandoned by the later episodes, as these recent releases have showcased to us.\\n\\n\r\n17 episodes in and none of the world building theories starting from the first episode has been answered, or even touched upon at all. With unanswered questions stacking from every single corner of a new introduction of an element along with the show's incentive for mystery, Franxx seemingly pile itself with questions in the form of every single train wreck imaginable. Even worse is the decision to rather sacrifice world building for a compelling narrative weaved from well choreographed fights meant to catalyze the relationships between the large cast, we are instead treated to episodes of pointless fanservice, constant addition of problems, and secrecy with no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nDespite massive doubts in the music scores due to Franxx's inability to understand the usage of appropriate music to amplify certain scenes, or the hype surrounding the \"new OP\" when it's literally just a remix of the first one, for the most part, Franxx's debut was tolerable, unfortunately of course, this later changed when the realization of how much this incompetent show can possibly lower it self down to hits me all too damn late.\\n\\n\r\nWith pretentiousness oozing from every single line of dialogue starting from the first episode and usage of black cuts, unnecessary melodrama with terrible beginning and endings, non-existent world building despite its mystery, and a pacing slow enough to feel like every episode is an exposition of the last rather than a cohesive and climatic crescendo of events, we, are ultimately presented with one of the hypest show of its season.\\n",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is a great example of what two studios working together can bring, though in the later episodes it struggles with it story, it is still really enjoyable and with some amazing art, sound design and characters\r\nStory: 5/10 The main story is pretty interesting, it has shown us a mysterious world and a lot of things to figure out (that could get explained in the rest of the series), like why are there plantations, what has happened to the world, was the world always like this, what are the klaxosaurus, and most importantly, WHY ON EARTH ARE THE FRANXX PILOTED BY DRYHUMPING?!?!? , I have a small theory that I made myself, and that is one of the great things about this story, because it makes me believe that the intent of trigger is to provide viewers with a sense of pride and accomplishment for finding the hidden reasons to things, the only problem is that in the second and third episode it lost part of its charm, but recovered it in the fourth and fifth episodes. At the second part of the show the story decides to end the world building quite rapidly and has an enormous twist that can be related a lot to some Gainax or other Trigger shows, but the thing is, that while those other shows managed to do it in a perfect way, putting hints, and making you feel like there is more, this shows twist was really unexpected and left me more confused that shocked, it slowly recovers in the final part though, even if it is just a little.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 The art has that really cool Trigger artstyle but more polished with the help of A1 pictures, with some gorgeous moments, and some really good animated fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 I admit it, I\u2019m one of those guys that tend to skip the OP and ED to get straight to the action, but this is one of the exceptions to that, the opening is probably my favorite of the season, and the ending is on my top list of all time, they are that good. And about the OST, it is really good, in the calm moments it is really relaxing, but in the fights, oh man, it makes the action feel 1000 times more epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 The character design is really good, paired with the great animation, it gives us a large cast of characters with really distinct looks and personalities, and none of them feels too clich\u00e9. There gets a point in the show where you actually start feeling more connected to the side characters, and while this in other shows would be a bad thing, in this one it feels like something good because of the quality of those characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 This is a really entertaining show, though in some parts it does feel a little bit annoying in how it starts to and more things without notice and without time to process it, it almost always is a really good watch.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I believe that this is a show that should be watched, it brings a lot to the table, does some things well, and some not as well as they could have made, especially in the story side, but apart from that, if you want a really good mecha drama you should totally watch this, and even If you don\u2019t enjoy it, finish it all.\\n",

            "content": "FANSERVICE GALORE\r\nIs what I'll be reminded of every time I see a tweet of this anime weekly.\r\nAs someone who was hyped for this show to get it's adaptation to trying my hardest to stay loyally in love with it, I can't.\r\nDo not get me wrong, it started off great and the fact people were trying to call it a Evangelion rip-off annoyed me to the max but with the amount of content we have right now and how the \"story\" has progressed, I think you're giving it WAY too much credit to even call it on par with Evangelion. \r\nWe first get to meet 002who someway somehow won over the easy pleasing bottom tier part of the anime community, I mean she's basically a Rem of this season who'll most likely fall off the radar as the year carries on. She has the typical personality of \"my past was horrible so now I'm aiming to create a future better\". Clich\u00e9 much?\\n\\n\r\nWe then have a dull, and boy is ever so dull, MC who doesn't fit in where he belongs EVEN though he basically created that group of bond because of their childhoods. Oh by the way you might as well call all of them orphaned because they were just given up. \\n\\n\r\nI seriously wanted this show to be good but it's so... typical. These past 2 episodes were nothing but fan service and you'll laugh when I say this because my profile is decked in ecchi stuff but damnit, STOP IT. This was supposed to be a great Mecha anime but instead turned itself into a want to be Infinite Stratos. If I want ecchi stuff I'll go watch hentai but not anime, anime is supposed to be all the good shit without the tiddies and nudity mucking up the show. That's when you know a studio isn't shit, when they fork out 2 episodes of fanservice shit. I can bet my life they're making figs right now with the girls in their suits being melted off just like how I can bet they're making the beach ones.\\n\\n\r\nI won't tell you to go watch it, shoot, I won't even bother talking to you about it if you bring it up to me. The anime started off great and is now going downhill and NO I'm not someone who needs to see action all the damn time like some simpleton but damnit give me a story I can happily say I enjoyed!!! 24 episodes and this is what they're bringing. PATHETIC.\\n\\n\r\nYou see my rating and you've read how I feel now you go and see what you think. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to love this anime so badly but as history will teach us: Expectations can lead to disappointments. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!!",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is an anime that disappointed me. In a nutshell, it tries to be bigger than itself by trying a grandiose and deep approach to the story and characters, but in reality it is just a facade for a quite shallow story and characters.\r\nStory (4) : The story so far has been shallow and confusing. They don't seem to really want to explore the nature of the sci-fi universe they live in, which would have been fine by me if it wasn't for the fact they give a lot of importance to this universe. There is also no logical progression, and eventsseem to happen when they are convenient for the story, which again would be fine if it wasn't done in such a clumsy way. They also try to pull a bit of suspense with the nature of some characters and the world, but it doesn't really work that much because you don't have much reason to care. That is probably the biggest weakness of the story, we don't know about the world, the characters don't seem to care that much about the world, we don't care about the story because they don't make us care. Instead, the \"story\" focuses on the characters and drama, which are petty and shallow.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4) : The art is unimpressive. Doesn't look special in any way, and looks like animation from 5 years ago. The only character they put an artistic emphasis in is Zero Two. When it comes to the mechas, I'm not much of the mecha guy but I did like these at first. They are different and seem to fit the personality of their riders. However they haven't explored the mechas at all and the riders' personalities are inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) : I gave this a 6 because I don't really have anything bad to say about it. Nor much good. No amazing music nor shitty sound effects. Just fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3) : This is what makes this anime frustrating to watch. The characters have very superficial traits and problems, they do develop, but they go from token characters to stupid characters. Sometimes, when they want something to happen to a character, but it wouldn't make much sense due to his/her personality, they just kinda change their personality (to be fair not by ridiculous amounts) with no reason to make the event make sense. They are all very petty and their problems are very shallow, although they seem to hint that there might be a \"bigger reason\" for that, as I said in the story part, why should we care? Once they start developing other characters than Hiro and Zero Two, you start to realize that Zero Two is the only interesting character really, and even then they kinda trivialized her and also changed her personality as a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3) : Ugh. Watching stupid kids going through shitty melodrama while the safety of thousands supposedly lie in there selfish childish hands is frustrating. Episode 11 feels like a kick in the nuts. Most characters in the group seem to have a past trauma or hidden desire that drives or inhibits them, but when you actually learn what they are you will regret even wondering due to how petty and stupid they are. A defense I've seen against this is that it is quite realistic, and people are stupid and petty, but that doesn't make it enjoyable, and real people also have a bigger sense of priority than these idiots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4) : Dropped the anime. I'll read reviews once it finished airing to see if it is worth watching until the end, but it is not enjoyable, it is not funny and it does not get you invested.",

            "content": "Darling In The FranXX:\r\nDarling In The FranXX is an anime about people who are trapped in specific places because if they were not there they would be attacked by the Ursosaurus, and that's where the main plot comes in, or at least that's what we think.\r\nThe highest quality of DITFXX, or unique, is its production. It is done by TRIGGER, so there is no way to expect less from the visual part, but I'm sorry to say that we even have problems in this. The character design of our characters are extremely simple, some even generics, so it is, you can expect a good animation,pretty collors, but do not expect ANYTHING too, a Mob Psycho 100 originality, or something very exceptional like Fate or One Punch Man .\\n\r\nNow, departing for your plot, story, world building, everything you find in the script, we begin to catch your faults.\\n\r\nYes, that way of driving robots is a problem. ''But why? That's originality !!! '' Not quite. If you know what '' immersion '' is, you know how much this way of driving the robots breaks it. Errr, you can tell me that this whole thing has to do with genres and that it's not just a form of sex driving robots, but even the lines in this anime make it clear - many of these lines being expository worse than Shingeki no Kyojin in the bow of the female titan - totally shattering the immersion of the scenes.\\n\r\n\"Oras! We're almost dying, Zero Two! But we have to stay together. ''\\n\r\n'Darling !!!!' '(30X)\\n\r\n'' Let me fly with your wings, AMOORRRRR ''\\n\r\nYes, Sir. The roboz\u00e3o of a mound of old, broken, fucked can, returns to normal. And with more power! The power of love! Oops, wait there. When did this anime specify that a high synchronization makes the robot stronger? Or would it make him evolve? When did this anime detail us about the robots? When did this anime focus on showing us a decent world building, explaining how robots work, creating mysteries in how the FRANXX can be altered, discovering in practice? I do not think so, so the name of this is GOD EX MACHINA. All right, it was exciting, there were some exhibits there filling that nonsense thing, it had a cool song, fluid animation, PRETTY COLLORRRRS !! But so what? This is all bad.\\n\r\nAnd as I said, when did the anime show off how your worldbuilding worked? Two or three dialogues that never went forward? They showed the magma, created inquiries, and no, it was never developed.\\n\r\nOras, the anime had more important thing than the fucking plot of the business, right? Yes, we had couples !!!!! In a slice of lifes routine, they created internal conflicts that were developed in episodic ways, many of which did not matter in character relationships. An example of this is the episode dedicated to Zorome. He did not evolve Zorome, he did not deepen Zorome, did not develop anything. By the way, when were they developed? Let's differentiate screen time from development. No one except Hiro and 02 was developed here. And you know how they made the relationships of the characters work out? A team of skip skippers a week or two, so that those characters would look good, instead of showing us all that development, using bullshit and unnecessary episodes in their characters, and this reminds me of Code Geass.\\n\r\nCome on, Ichigo had his conflict with Zero Two and Hiro. An episode to solve all this, being that they did not have to go back in that aspect, everything was ok. More time lost with couples, about three to four episodes in these blunders.\\n\r\nConflicts> Resolution> Slice of life. Rhythm of DITFXX. Huff. Now being honest, there are people who still find this anime of the year ...\\n\r\nBy the end, what the fuck is this? They created a spear with the same function as Evangelion's spear, they have mysterious characters not worked (Daddy), who are even shown in the same mysterious way by the direction that Evangelion used, has the same episodic rate of Evangelion in giving screen time to and it was not enough for me to find this an ill-made copy of Evangelion, NOTHING I TOLD IT HAVE BEEN WORKED NOW. This spear simply had nothing to do with the work, they forgot, bye Lance Longinus, ops, I do not know the name. Daddy was not worked, it's a big random shit, plot device that was there to generate the Zorome conflict that was NOT DEVELOPED OR WORKED !!\\n\r\nNow, to make matters worse, we have become Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Urrosaurs are bugs that fight for the survival of the species, had bigger enemies coming from space claiming human existence, we will have a fight in space!\\n\r\nOops, wait, how did the mind of Zero Two end up in the Strelizia in space? That was at least worked out. Plus, they used the power of friendship in that, yes, the petrified body of Zero Two had her mind down now, like, like, like? I do not even know. Ai, daughter of that damn whore of Kokoro (THAT THERE WAS A COMPLETELY NONSENSE PERSONALITY AGAIN) DARLING !!! I honestly found it VERY beautiful when she spoke, BUT SHIT, IT WAS USED TO DISCOVER THAT THE MIND OF ZERO TWO WAS THERE LOW. THE ANIME SIMPLY EXPLAINS SOMETHING OF NOTHING, DRAWN FROM THE ABSOLUTE CU OF THE VITORVERDE, TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE ANY DRAMA AROUND FRIENDSHIP THAT COULD BE MUCH BETTER WITHOUT A FUCKING TIME SKIP EVIL DONE BY FODENDING ALL THAT SCRIPT SHIT.\\n\r\nThen Strelizia also became a giant robot that has breasts and the face of Zero Two with the power of love, now we have a portal that leads to another dimension, Hiro is a ursosaurus now too, they reincarnate and all this was taken from the ABSOLUTE ASS. The Darling in the FranXX writer smoked a pound of shit mixed with marijuana and salt, drinking two liters of vodka alone and wrote all this crap.\\n\r\nBy the way, do you know all that driving? So it was only the TRIGGER attracting public with ecchi bait, besides the people see: MOESHIT, YURI, A MAN ASKED TO KISS THE OTHER AND EPISODE ON THE BEACH. SEE YOU CAN. TRIGGER, IT WILL TAKE INTO THE EYE OF YOUR CU, IF I WRITE MY WORK I'M SURE THAT IT IS BETTER THAN THAT.\\n\r\nNote: 1/10.",

            "content": "\u201cPerhaps the cartoony mecha style emphasizes on that, but in the end it's a shallow show that foreshadows heavily on plot twists, but doesn't follow through to them in the end.\u201d - -chronos \r\nYou didn\u2019t even seen the whole anime or the plot twist yet, you\u2019ve only seen 6 episodes lol\r\n\u201cInspired by old familiar mecha, Darling in the FranXX tries to incorporate over-the-top elements of Gurren Laggan and symbolic yet dramatic elements of Evangelion. \u201c - -chronos \r\nIf you actually watch Gurren Laggan, and Evangelion, the themes, setting, characters, cinematography, art are so disparate from those 2 anime, I dont see how they are similaraside from the robot thing (even though the way that works is even different, since you need a male and a female parasite to ride it). \\n\r\nIt\u2019s like comparing water and vinegar, its attracts, but it does not technically dissolve; rather, it forms a homogeneous solution with water. In this case, water represents Darling in the FranXX, vinegar represents Gurren Laggan, and some other solution that doesn\u2019t mix with water or vinegar represents Evangelion. It might be similar in the use robots to fight monsters, some imagery, but the theme, setting and other elements of the show, all of the 3 compared, is markedly distinct.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf you enjoy \"nu\"-mecha anime with unnecessary fanservice, no respect to its own world building and plot, and no respect to the viewer - go ahead and give this a go. \u201c - -chronos \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re trying way too hard man. Did you even watch the anime. Fanservice was actually toned down quite alot in the anime, surprisingly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI could already see the pattern with these 1/10 ratings that easily get so many upvote from people. The review is not only radical, narrow minded, and clearly seeking to get their review notice even at the expense of defaming the show. Additionally, the supporting premises that he presented never have anything to back it up with examples, but a bunch of connections with other animes, stating the obvious things from the show then label them as a cons, basically, a bunch of blanket statement indulging in sophistry fallacy. And because the show hold so much of the cons, even though there was no explicit examples to back it up, or any logical connection, many naive people decided to just upvote it for the sake of being on board with a radical opinion, because it makes them feel special or something to be holding a unique perspective from others. \\n\\n\r\nPeople seems to like to think like this huh, in the anime community at the very least. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert btw\\n\\n\r\nIt actually took me like a month or so to get to this anime. The scene that I saw with the robot riding system was a complete turn-off for me, plus im not a fan of robot animes. The only thing that made me reconsider was the mere fact that people actually sent death threats to the creator, and literally track down the artist of Ichigo, somehow, and literally harass the person like it\u2019s their fault that they\u2019ve felt this indignation towards the character, blindly believing that Ichigo as a character is ruining the anime as a whole (even though we got like 10 episode left, from episode 14). That actually made me see a peek of episode 14 and literally binge watch the anime from episode 1 in one go. And like mate, its 2D, calm the fuck down. Its a \u201cdrama series\u201d, shit like that supposed to happen. And why the fuck did you go after the artist for a character you hate? Their job was to design the character that the author decided to make. The existence to her character was due to him, not the illustrators. \\n\\n\r\nAnd plus, let me repeat, its a fucking DRAMA series. Dont expect there to be rainbows and sunshine every single time after you see a dreary storm. I\u2019m glad that rainbow after the storm thing didnt happen in episode 14, or else it would be uninteresting, and almost trite. And literally like from episode 10, leading up to ep 14, the anime actually sets that up for that to happen with the way they foreshadow it with Zero 2\u2019s shift in mood, and even Ichigo learning to fear Zero 2, not only from information alone, but the accidental sight of Zero 2 appearing like an actual monster for the very first time to her. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let me defend Ichigo's action here coz this started this hate train to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nIt does fucking frustrates us and all with Ichigo accidentally making everything worse when shit almost finally going down the path that we\u2019ve been longed for, and that fucking kiss was dumb af, I would agree, but a \u201cdrama series\u201d is a drama series, it\u2019s to be expected to see a character acts as an obstacle within a story in a relationship, in this case, one belonging in the rival of love category. And the anime really did a great job to actually make so many people treated her like some sort of a thot (even though she\u2019s really not if you pay close attention to the anime), mostly the callous and narrow minded people who only cares about one thing: the ship between Hiro and Zero 2; though not the emotions of the characters of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\n In addition to that, after episode 12, Ichigo doesn\u2019t have a third eye where she can actually watch the whole episode 13 somehow lmao. That would be way too inconvenient.  But I guess, after episode 13, it kinda tunnel vision the audiences\u2019 sight of other character\u2019s perspective that the anime presented, so we could easily replace our indignation for Ichigo\u2019s ignorance and put our anger onto her without recognizing the fault in Zero 2'action to not speak to her teammates, which would surely not make everyone to lock her up, her assuming that everyone lied to her and she proceed to beat the shit out of everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the kiss part\u2026 Love is illogical, and Ichigo can\u2019t prevent it from showing when she loves Hiro (although she had not learn of this yet when she was young as love wasn\u2019t taught for the parasites) ever since her childhood with him. And since the very beginning, it was indicated so profusely with the way she acts toward Hiro flirting with Zero 2. The same goes for Goro, she never went out with him to begin with, Ichigo only partnered with him because Hiro couldn\u2019t become a pilot. Both also have a one sided love: Ichigo,for the dude that had been taken away by Zero 2 but was never consciously aware that she was being jealous because she had never been taught what love is; Goro, the girl who he had always love since very young, despite knowing that she likes Hiro from the very first time he had met her. \\n\\n\r\nJust because Ichigo doesn\u2019t want to fall in love with Goro, and acts in a way that may looked seemingly like she betrays him, that\u2019s not what the male to female riding the robot thing called the FranXX supposed to indicate. So she\u2019s not a thot from that POV, and outsider can\u2019t typically force love, since it won't be a genuine one.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Ichigo never acts like some jealousy bitch and forcefully, or illogically breaks them apart lmao, she actually encourages them to be paired up with, aside from that one case where Zero 2 literally gave Hiro a big ass scar in the neck, which pushes her to actually take action for the very first time, despite the numbers of endangerment that Hiro had to go through because of Zero 2, as she was actually using him to earn some freedom to kill more of em monsters and use him. And I mean, I shipped Hiro and Zero 2 and all, but she appeared as a monster before she had the right mentality about Hiro in episode 13. After that, it was kinda too late with the damage that she\u2019d done to Hiro and getting out of control. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the other didn\u2019t behaved the way she does, only because she was the only one knowing the truth about her slowly turning him into a monster, and after being the only one witnessing her monstrous side in her group, ofc anybody in her shoes would divide them as a way to protect Hiro.\\n\\n\r\nSome called Ichigo manipulative, but really, I don't see that at all in the show. She genuinely believes that she is protecting him. She even let Hiro make the decision to pair up with Zero 2, and respects their relationship for the past 13 episode thus far, did you guys forgot? She even called her a \u201cteammate\u201d in episode 12 when confronting against the elite parasite guys with the blonde hair dude. We really can't hate her here.\\n\\n\r\nSelfish? Maybe so, but the desire to protect your teammate that you cherish (like how Kokoro saved Mitsuru, or Ichigo saving Goro), especially if you are in love with them, is typical of a human being. Being overly protective is an act of selfishness after all. It\u2019s also our human nature, and the anime did very well to portray that in Ichigo\u2019s character. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall toxic feedback of this episode from the audiences that sincerely hate her as a character clearly doesn\u2019t know that this is a drama series, and the character actually do have a very realistic, and reasonable judgement for doing the things they did, given the character\u2019s personality, and their current state of beliefs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI kinda rant abit there, but to wrap this up, the pros of this anime would definitely be the cinematography, the very natural-sounding voice acting, the vibes/atmosphere, the animation, the most realistic interaction between characters in an anime (given their character archetypes), great character concepts, and the perfect fit of ost on a given scene.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, all the interesting stuff about what being an adult entails,  the origin of the monsters, what happened to the outside world, who is the papa, and other philosophical questions resided in the anime; and obviously, the key selling point of this show, the drama and the in-depth angle on each of the character\u2019s perspectives (mainly the one close to the MC) which led into a significant character growth later on in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe cons is obviously the lack of core plot in the story other than concentrating on solely the relationship between characters, while using the monsters as a way to cause character growth to happen; the lack of explanations to the setting, even if it was later explained vaguely in later episodes; the unexciting fight scenes (imo). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is pretty good. Definitely a definite watch if you\u2019re into a drama series, although it doesn\u2019t really offer much storyline (from ep 1 to 14), but the anime will probably draws you in if you watch the anime with an open mind.\\n",

            "content": "As a review partway through an unfinished series, you can expect it to follow one of two paths:\r\n1) The show is really good and the reviewer is gushing about it in vague and unhelpful ways\r\n2) The show is actually really bad and something to be wary of picking up only to end up dropping it\r\nGuess which one I am?\r\nThe hype around this show was terrible and what killed it. Devoted fans saw who was involved in making it and created a hype-train that swept up \"less-informed\" behind it, ultimately derailing itself with elevated expectations when it arrived at the station. This isn't the first orlast time this kind of thing has happened in virtually any form of media you look at.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the category reviews:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10 - It's just painful. For lack of my desire to write an overly detailed paragraph, I'll keep it to it's biggest 2 downfalls. The world is just awful, uninspired, extremely vague beyond reason, and actually POINTLESS in the setting because of reasons that will be further explained on. Melodrama... needlessly drawn-out melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nArt NA/10: Judging something by the Art has becoming a very meaningless unless it's just trash. Bad shows and have great art, good shows can have bad art. Against other shows this year... Franxx is a non-entity when compared to Violet Evergarden. It's just \"Generic Modern Anime\" on every single account with little in the way of flare beyond the Mecha, which ironically isn't the most accurate portrayal of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: Music is uninspiring given the people making it and the sound design is... \"Anime\". Not much to talk about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10: I judge by the actual Characters, not the \"Character of the show\" in this category I presume it means. It generally makes much more sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll of them are stereotypical cookie-cutter characters except given lazily masked ulterior motives for their actions. One of them is specifically the \"Waifu\" bait and breaks the tone of the show by being completely different from everyone else in every way imaginable, and as previously hinted at, is one of the main sources of the show's shortcomings. The show tries to be quasi-intellectual and edgy at the same time when it comes to this character, and even forces poorly aging gimmicks in the show at the expense of the rest of the cast and/or setting because of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: It's not enjoyable really. If you enjoy a specific aspect of the show, you could probably find it elsewhere done better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: This \"Chimera\" of an anime tries to appeal to too many genres whether listed or not. Turning it into an inconsistent mess that seems to dive from genre to genre \"in the moment\". It tries too hard to relive a distant memory while also at the same time falling into all the modern shticks that detract creativity, individuality, and enjoyment most modern anime that all seem to blend together. It's just not an appealing show even if you have nothing else to watch. Rewatching something else you enjoyed is a far better idea.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers for Darling in the Francisco, not that I would recommend you to watch it anyway.\r\nOh boy... If there was a show in these last couple of months that people couldn't shut the fuck up about, whether they were bashing or praising, it was definitely Darling in the FranXX, an original \"mecha\" anime made by Trigger, a studio I like, and A-1 Pictures, a studio I'm not a really big fan of. I, for one, was definitely interested in Darling in the FranXX when they announced it, the premise seemed interesting, I liked the character designs that were shown, the mechasaren't CGI for a change and Trigger animating the show showed a lot of promise for exciting battles like the ones from Gurren Lagann, especially since Darling in the FranXX is being directed by Atsushi Nishigori, who was heavily influential back in the Gainax days. So yes, there was a lot to be excited about Darling in the FranXX, it was aiming to be a big project and possibly one of the best anime of this year. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately... As soon as I watched the very first episode of Darling in the FranXX on the day it started airing, my hype for this show was dramatically reduced, by the third episode I actually lost interest in the series altogether, but everywhere I went, I always saw people talking about it, so I decided to give it another shot and the fifth episode was actually pretty good... Then episode 6 happened, I said \"fuck this shit\" and decided to drop it. A few weeks later, I saw people shitting on this show, but some friends of mine said it was improving, and after some time they convinced me to give it another chance, and so I did... It started to get better again, but then episode 14 happened, and the series never recovered from that, only got worse with each new episode and became a complete disaster by the time it was on its final stretch, and I felt I've got too far to drop it again, so I figured I might as well finish the damn thing. But I'm getting ahead of myself here, let's slow down a bit and take a proper look at things.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth where humanity is constantly threatened by creatures known as Klaxosaurs, therefore humans are living inside mobile city-like fortress called Plantations in order to be safe from harm and these Plantations are ruled by a mysterious organization called APE and defended by the Parasites, children who were raised to pilot the FranXX, giant mechas that can be only piloted by a male and a female in a doggystyle pose [?] and are the only weapon known to be effective in fighting against the Klaxosaurs. The main characters of the show are the Squad 13 Parasites, one of them is Code 016... I mean, Hiro, a boy who was a pilot-candidate, but failed at synchronizing with his previous partner and apparently just can't pilot the FranXX at all, that is until he met a mysterious pink-haired girl with horns who goes by the code 002, but ends up being named Zero Two. After Hiro has a ~hilarious~ encounter with Zero Two naked in a lake and accidentally touches her panties, she starts flirting with him and eventually the Plantation they're in gets attacked by a Klaxosaur. Zero Two deploys to her FranXX called Strelizia along with her partner to fight against the monster, but they end up getting their asses handed to them until Zero Two's partner gets mortally injured and Hiro ends up getting in the Strelizia in the guy's place, thus becoming Zero Two' partner, or her \"Darling\" as she likes to call him. Of course, with Hiro's main character powers, the Strelizia defeats the Klaxosaur and later we get the reveal that Zero Two is a human-Klaxosaur hybrid who's known for killing her partners. Uh-oh...\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, Darling in the FranXX's first episode wasn't too bad, I guess I just expected too much from it. Although I liked the setting, I definitely didn't like the characters all that much, they all seemed tropey and even the narrative was kinda predictable, it was another \"regular teenager meets mysterious girl who gives him some kind of special power\" intro episode, and honestly the only thing that made me intrigued was the reveal in the end about Zero Two killing her partners. Episode 2 proceeds to introduce some sweet love triangle drama to the story when Hiro's childhood friend, a girl named Ichigo or Code 015, obviously has a crush on him and tries to get him to pilot the her FranXX, the Delphinium, just to prove that he can pilot a FranXX just fine and doesn't need to risk his life by piloting with Zero Two. Because everything this series was needing was the childhood friend who gets rejected because she's not the main girl, right? I see the writers of Darling in the FranXX did their research on TV Tropes before they decided to work here. Also Hiro has a rival of sorts, and it's no one other than Satan himself! Well, not really, but it's Code 666, also known as Zorome, an arrogant brat who pilots another FranXX with his partner, the token tsundere, Miku, and wants to prove that he's the best FranXX pilot or whatever, so he challenges Hiro to a mock battle. Hiro and Ichigo pilot the Delphinium and fight against Zorome and Miku's FranXX whose name I forgot because these characters are barely relevant to the story, so their FranXX's name is not even worth googling. Predictably, Hiro has metaphorical erectile dysfunction, so it went wrong and he couldn't pilot the Delphinium, which made Ichigo extremely pissed.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 3 and 4 are pretty much the exact same shit: A Klaxosaur attack happens, Hiro's friends deploy to fight them but they job harder than Dragon Ball side-characters, then Strelizia comes in to rescue them and destroy the Klaxosaurs. The only difference is that episode 3 showed that Code 326, also known as Mitsuru, really hates Hiro for some reason and got to pilot Strelizia in his place because APE wouldn't let Hiro pilot until we get the obvious confirmation that Hiro is the only pilot who's compatible with Zero Two. Surprise surprise: Hiro actually is the only compatible pilot, as Mitsuru was shown to be wounded after piloting with Zero Two! Who would have thought that, huh? In episode 4 he ends up piloting with Zero Two after they both disobey APE's stupid orders and run straight for the Strelizia... Which makes me wonder why they didn't do that in the previous episode already, they didn't suffer consequences for disobeying the higher-ups or anything, episode 3 was almost completely pointless in the end. If you feel the plot didn't advance at all in these first four episodes, it's because it didn't, nothing actually happens in Darling in the FranXX for at least half of the series because it's way too busy keeping its vapid teenage drama going while offering some interesting bits of worldbuilding in specific episodes, but it doesn't actually move the plot forwards until much later. I do like the worldbuilding episodes, though, they're some of the better ones in the series and explore the show's world in a fairly interesting way, the beach episode surprisingly isn't just for cheap fanservice, the squad has some fun character interactions and they discover ruins of a civilization that once lived in that beach area near the Plantation, which makes them fascinated because as far as they knew, people only lived inside the Plantations. That one episode where Zorome becomes relevant and ends up getting lost in the Plantation's city is also pretty good, he meets an old lady who seems familiar to him, even though she never met him before, it's revealed that Parasites have a short lifespan because they age faster due to their physiology being different from that of the adults, who are shown to be apathetic as hell, also when he's found by authorities, they avoid direct contact with him as if he was infected.\\n\\n\r\nYou may argue now that Darling in the FranXX is a two cour show, so it's taking its time to build its world and focus on developing its characters before the plot starts to progress. Excuse me, it's developing its characters, you say? Like hell it is! These characters get a lot of screen time, sure, but saying they get developed is a bit of an overstatement, most of them are two-dimensional archetypes and become completely irrelevant after the one episode that focuses on them, only having some kind of focus again when the show requires more teenage drama to happen, that is for the characters who are actually lucky to get at least one episode about them. Goro, Ichigo's partner and the mature level-headed member of the squad, has an interesting episode where he almost Allahu Akbars to destroy a Klaxosaur from the inside, but gets stopped and saved by Ichigo, then Goro confesses his feelings for her and she doesn't answer, but he's not in a hurry to hear an answer anyway. You'd think they would start to slowly build a love relationship between Goro and Ichigo after this episode, finally ridding the show of this retarded love triangle, but they don't! Ichigo was a character who was conflicted because of her feelings for Hiro, the fact that not only he loves Zero Two, but also Zero Two is killing him the more he pilots with her, and she also needs to have responsibility as the leader of Squad 13. All of these are decent concepts for a character, and Ichigo does grow a bit from episode 2 to around episode 11, she slowly accepts Zero Two as part of the squad, she works into becoming a good leader, she gets some good interactions with Goro, all while still fearing for Hiro's life. But in episode 9, which is the Goro episode, I felt she finally grew up properly both as a leader and a character, in past episodes Goro was the one who helped her in the hardest situations, he kept her from letting her feelings get the best of her and doing something stupid and dangerous in a previous mission, and now Ichigo is the one who stops Goro from throwing his life away and you can see how she acts more maturely in the episodes after this one. \\n\\n\r\nA few episodes later, Ichigo discovers that Zero Two is still killing Hiro when they pilot, and then that one infamous episode happened, you know what I'm talking about, episode 14 where Ichigo separates Hiro from Zero Two, I was actually fine with the fact that this happened even after episode 13 showed the admittedly well-done backstory of how Hiro and Zero Two met in the past when they were kids and all. What I wasn't fine with, though, is that Ichigo proceeded to force a kiss on Hiro and say she loves him... And we're back to exactly 12 episodes ago, because fuck developing your character and giving her a new arc or something, right? Better drag the love triangle drama further even though Ichigo hasn't been trying to get Hiro to like her for a while, reverting or ignoring character development for the sake of having more drama is bad writing. And for what? For the following episode to bring in a rushed conclusion to this arc, with Ichigo suddenly being happy that Hiro and Zero Two got together again and now she's totally okay with their relationship, almost as if bringing this plot point back for these two episodes was fucking pointless and only served to undermine Ichigo's development for the sake of making people root for Hiro and Zero Two. Because it was! Is that the reason why the writers denied Goro becoming relevant to the story after that episode and have some kind of romance arc where Ichigo starts to understand her feelings for him? God, what a stupid, emotionally-manipulative pile of garbage episodes 14 and 15 were!\\n\\n\r\nIchigo isn't even the only one who falls into this trap of ignoring character development for the sake of injecting more redundant drama into the story, there's also Futoshi, the fat guy who likes to eat and talk about food. Hah, what a unique and creative concept for a character, guys, truly marvelous! Anyway, Futoshi is the partner of Kokoro, a gentle girl who's been talking with Mitsuru for a while as she tries to understand why he's so distant from the rest of the squad and make him open up, until another infamous episode where Kokoro asks to pilot with Mitsuru while Futoshi ended up being with Mitsuru's former partner, Ikuno. Naturally, and understandably, Futoshi didn't take this too well, he cried a lot in this episode, but when they departed to complete the mission, he had to focus on getting shit done, and by the end of the episode he comes to accept that Mitsuru and Kokoro are partners, making Mitsuru promise that he'll protect Kokoro from now on. That's nice, Futoshi and Kokoro even interact a bit after that episode and he seems alright with that now, good for him! \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, after episode 15 the squad got isolated in the house where the used to stay, they use a convenient time skip to change the cast's personalities because in 15 episodes they failed to develop them in a convincing way, so now that they spent a couple of weeks together offscreen and they're all best buddy-buddies. Mitsuru and Kokoro's bond starts to grow stronger, but also Futoshi now is back to crying over Kokoro and apparently developed an eating disease... Which never becomes a relevant plot point ever again after this one episode where it's introduced. Seriously, the two things Futoshi has in his character are that he likes to eat and he cries over Kokoro, I would say he's the most worthless character in this series, but that honor actually goes to Ikuno. Ikuno doesn't get an episode focused on her, she barely appears or does anything significant, but the show reveals she's a lesbian and she always loved Ichigo from the very beginning... The subject gets resolved after she talks to Ichigo for a few minutes, never to be touched upon again. What was the point of that? Miku is also a character in this show, by the way... Yeah, she's just there, she's Zorome's partner... Also Satan here is never relevant again after his episode and that subplot about the old lady he met in the city goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you think Ichigo and Futoshi had it bad, then you should take a look at Mitsuru and Kokoro. For one thing, they were actually being developed during the course of the series, Mitsuru's reason for hating Hiro at first is explained, he slowly gets over that, comes to terms with Hiro and starts to take a liking to Kokoro, they have some difficulties understanding each other at first, but eventually fall in love, their scenes together are cute and it seemed like the writers wouldn't find a way to ruin this one! Then Kokoro wanted to have babies because of an old book about human reproduction she found in the house... What the fuck, guys? Isn't Kokoro, like, 14 years old? Is this show encouraging female teens to get pregnant? Ah, whatever, she and Mitsuru got to have sex and the squad simulated a marriage for them, which is good and all... But they get caught and taken away because apparently having sex is prohibited or something, then APE mindwipes them. \\n\\n\r\nYes, they arbitrarily lose their memories of being in love just so the show can have another arc where Mitsuru and Kokoro fall in love, and it's just so contrived because there was actually no point or reason for the mindwipe. It's later revealed that FranXX pilots who get pregnant can't pilot a FranXX, which explains why APE prohibited sex, but doesn't explain the fact that they mindwiped Mitsuru and Kokoro, but kept her pregnant instead of just aborting her child. Also, how come Kokoro piloted a FranXX after that happened even though she was pregnant all along? Ah, fuck it, they actually managed to take a fairly decent couple with a nicely developed relationship and reduce that relationship to being founded upon the fact that one of them is pregnant and the other just feels like he should be protecting her because she's his partner and the writers still want to ship them. What a masterfully-written series, man, you WISH your favorite anime was this good!\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the main characters, Hiro and Zero Two, I might as well talk about the two as a couple already since the show doesn't bother to give them much characterization besides the fact that they love each other. They try to give Zero Two some character development, she starts to warm up to the squad for a bit, but after a while she starts acting like she's having her periods or something and lashes out at anyone who would talk to her, because she's half-Klaxosaur and she feels she needs to kill more of those monsters in order to become human, she also keeps draining the life of her partners away because she wants to find her Darling who helped her in the past, being unaware that it was Hiro all along, but he also didn't exactly remember her for reasons that are explained in their background. Right after the episode where this misunderstanding is resolved, Zero Two becomes the squad's buddy in the previously-mentioned convenient timeskip and her personality changes completely, which is jarring because she doesn't resemble her \"normal\" self from the start of the series at all. She kinda had a strong personality, but it just goes away forever and now Zero Two is a token waifu, kinda feels like Asuna from Sword Art Online being a mildly interesting strong female lead at the start of her series and devolving into a useless damsel in distress for Kirito to save. Hell, Zero Two even becomes a bit of a damsel in distress during the final act of the series, Darling in the FranXX is literally the Sword Art Online of mecha!\\n\\n\r\nNow, in all seriousness... I don't mind Hiro and Zero Two as couple, their relationship is handled pretty decently, warts and all. However, I do absolutely hate how every major conflict in this show revolves around Hiro and Zero Two getting separated, reuniting later right when the current battle is on the verge of being lost, then they talk about how much they love each other and Strelizia randomly gets so strong that it one-shoots whatever big enemy was giving the heroes all this trouble. In episode 6 they were emotionally distant and Hiro was being killed by some kind of Dino AIDS, but it's still very much the same shit, the power of love just solves everything, there's no tension, no payoff to what the episodes before the big battles try to build up because after the second time it happens, you already know how this shit will play out. I never felt anything with Darling in the FranXX's most critical moments when some horrible stuff was happening and Hiro and Zero Two got separated, because I knew there was going to be some love ex machina asspull that will make them win the battle in a few minutes as soon as they get together again and talk about how much they love each other and yadda yadda, it's cheesy as hell, and not in a charming way either. It goes exactly like this from the very first major conflict all the way to the last one, the other characters do nothing significant even in the mecha fights, unless it revolves around helping Hiro and Zero Two reunite, they're nothing but glorified background characters. People give battle shounen anime a lot of crap for having power of friendship asspulls, which is true, but I see no reason to give Darling in the FranXX a free pass when it does the same thing, except it's love instead of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX's premise showed a lot of potential for how the show could develop its main characters, being a group of kids who don't have much experience with emotions or feelings, or knowledge of the world surrounding them, because they were raised as soldiers whose only purpose is to fight against monsters and protect humanity, in a world where most people became cold and apathetic towards each other. But this show just refuses to do something with these characters besides dragging love triangle dramas out, it doesn't properly develop them as a group of friends who care for each other, it doesn't make the FranXX pilots grow a stronger bond between each other without having some contrivance cutting it out right afterwards, it doesn't show how they deal with the fact that they have a limited lifespan. They just use this potentially interesting concept as an excuse to do the same type of teenage drama you see in thousands of other teenage drama anime, except it's not even well-written teenage drama, it's just redundant and lazy. It's a shame, because I do find some of these characters likeable in spite of how poorly the show handles them and there's definitely a handful of good moments when they're not crying over something, Goro, Ichigo, Mitsuru and Zorome are characters who deserved a better show with better writers.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, the plot doesn't actually advance much for the first 17 episodes or so, we get some bad teenage drama, the Parasites fight Klaxosaurs, some interesting bits of worldbuilding here and there, alright. Then around episode 18, the show introduces us to Klaxosaur-hime, who is a human-like Klaxosaur who lives underground and apparently commands all the Klaxosaurs we've been seeing all along, APE tries to talk her into surrendering or something, she kills one of the APE guys and she sees there's no body inside his suit, proceeding to call him a \"human wannabe\". We then get introduced to the story of Dr. FranXX's past and how the world ended up being this fucked up. Previously called Dr. Frank, he was a scientist who's only personality trait is that he's an atheist, and he definitely likes to remind us of that, in case we forget it, and his hardcore atheism makes him such a pussy magnet that some girl randomly got attracted to him and they started to date. Then the world gets taken over by APE, who are a bunch of mysterious people who came out of nowhere, and appparently everyone became okay with them taking over the world, no one investigated them, no one showed opposition or anything, because obviously that's how fucking politics work in our world. APE introduces to humanity the concept of extracting magma from the Earth so that it gets used to make humans immortal, which instantly became a hit and Dr. Frank was obviously called to help with this experiment, being a hardcore atheist, he's gonna take humanity's evolution to the next level and prove  that he's an euphoric scientist who's enlightened by his own intelligence and not by some phony God.\\n\\n\r\nThe Klaxosaurs were then introduced as monsters who were living underground and started to attack humanity because of the whole magma extraction thing, which also caused the Earth to start dying... Because the magma was an important resource of the planet and Klaxosaurs feed on it. To counter the Klaxosaurs, Dr. Frank developed the FranXX, mechas who are technically based on Klaxosaurs and require a male and a female to operate, in the first FranXX test his girlfriend dies because we need some tragedy in this story, but he gets sad for, like, 5 seconds and the story moves on. Eventually, Dr. Frank meets Klaxo-hime and he instantly falls in love with her, seeing her as the next step for human evolution or whatever, she bites his arm off and he uses her genetic material to create Zero Two, who was the \"perfect\" Klaxo-hime clone, and some other imperfect clones called the \"Nines\" who aren't even worth talking about in this review, they serve no other purpose in the story besides dying near the end so Hiro can reunite with Zero Two for the thousandth time.\\n\\n\r\nWell, now that this show explained in this huge info dump episode the backstory it could have slowly revealed in the previous 18 episodes, it's time to depart to the last and most \"dangerous\" mission yet where they're going to atack the main base of the Klaxosaurs and take Strelizia to some huge mecha called Star Entity that's being held by the Klaxosaurs. Well, the battle doesn't go well, Hiro gets separated from Zero Two because Klaxo-hime kidnaps him to use as a pilot for the Star Entity... And APE is revealed to be aliens called the VIRM all along... Yes, aliens. No, this was not a good plot twist, it came out of fucking nowhere and it has nothing to do with anything the story was doing prior to that! I know some people say there were \"hints\" to the whole alien thing, but that's bullshit because they could be hinting at anything, having no physical bodies could mean that they're robots, possibly controlled by some secret society or something, hell, it could even be other human-like Klaxosaurs who want to use the humans to overthrow the princess or whatever. Their base being a space station located near the Earth is also not a hint that they're aliens, this series has moving towns, giant mechas who fight monsters, technology that makes people immortal... And you think a base in space is so absurd that they could only be aliens? And even then, what the hell does this twist have to do with anything in the story? Why were there humans in APE who were collaborating with these mysterious figures without even knowing that they're aliens? It's stupid as hell!\\n\\n\r\nSo, VIRM has everyone as confused as people watching the show at that point, we discover that the Klaxosaurs were actually an ancient civilization that populated the Earth prior to humanity and got attacked by VIRM centuries ago, there were lots of human-like Klaxosaurs, now called Klaxosapiens, like the princess, but now they're all dead and the remaining ones became the monsters we see now. The princess knew VIRM would come back eventually, but never bothered to warn humanity about it before it happens, her reasoning is that she thought they could handle VIRM on their own... Which is stupid because VIRM nearly wiped out her species, but whatever. So, this whole conflict between humans and Klaxosaurs has been pointless and now they're joining forces to fight VIRM, Klaxo-hime dies, Zero Two reunites with Hiro, the power of love makes Strelizia and the Star Entity to merge into a new form and they one-shoot VIRM, who goes all Team Rocket on us and says they will come back with a bigger army. But wait, now Zero Two is dead! Or is she?\\n\\n\r\nThe next episode reveals that Zero Two's physical body is on the Earth, but her mind is actually on the Strelizia Apus fighting against VIRM on space and getting her ass handed to her, which is causing harm to her physical body. When Hiro finds that out, he talks to his friends about it and says he's gonna save her, but for some reason they don't want him to go and Goro calls him selfish for only caring about himself and Zero Two. Sorry, what? Why aren't you guys going with him? You DO know that VIRM said they're coming back and you'll have to fight them later anyway, right? Also, I thought you all liked Zero Two, now you suddenly don't care that she's getting murdered by ayy lmaos in space? Don't get me wrong, Hiro has been selfish for most of this series and I wanted someone to call him out for that, but not in this specific situation where he's actually right, this was such a dumb and pointless discussion that a few minutes later they just decide to go with him anyway, along with the Nines who are now \"redeemed\" from being assholes during the whole series and some Klaxosaurs who go together. Mitsuru and Kokoro remain on the Earth because Kokoro, being pregnant, can't pilot a FranXX anymore, and they sorta bond again in these last episodes, predictably, but I still don't see why they got mindwiped to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nEventually they get to Zero Two and fight VIRM, the Nines die in the most anti-climactic way possible and Hiro and Zero Two reunite... The power of love now makes the Star Entity turn into a giant mecha Zero Two with a wedding dress. No, I'm not making this shit up and I couldn't take it seriously for a second, this is the same show that begged me to take it seriously with all that stupid drama and relationship themes, and now it ends with a giant mecha waifu fighting aliens in space. I know this is supposed to be a Gunbuster reference... And I don't care, it's not because it's a reference that it's automatically good, and I don't even think Gunbuster was a good series to begin with. Once again, they one-shoot VIRM with the power of love and now they open a warp gate to VIRM's planet that came out of nowhere and apparently was placed there by the Klaxosaurs... You'd think Klaxo-hime would mention this warp gate since it's so important, but I guess not. Anyway, they use the warp gate ex machina to battle what's left of VIRM while everyone else goes to their homes. In the end: Hiro and Zero Two destroy VIRM's planet but end up dying together, also VIRM are still alive for some reason and they say they will attack again eventually, back in the Earth, our heroes spent years waiting for Hiro and Zero Two to return while focusing on rebuilding the Earth, Kokoro gives birth to her baby, there's a timeskip with them being adults and all and they get a happy ending with Hiro and Zero Two sorta reincarnating into two different kids.\\n\\n\r\n... Wait, the Parasites became adults? I thought they were going to die because they age fast, what the hell? Well, about that... Ikuno, who used up her mech's energy and got granny hair as a result, started to age faster than the others, but she suddenly became Einstein and, even though she was aging fast, still had time to conduct some research and find an unexplained way to revert the whole fast-aging process of the Parasites. Goddamn, what a copout, and that was one of the most interesting parts of the series, it was resolved in such a half-assed way that I refuse to accept this. If they were building up to something that could save the Parasites from aging, then I would be fine, but they weren't, they just casually said Ikuno made some kind of experiment and now they're all cool. This story is a fucking disaster, it has no idea what the hell it wants to be, it introduces a bunch of subplots that ultimately go nowhere, there's a couple of relatively major plot holes regarding VIRM and in the end I don't really feel like much was accomplished anyway, it's just a poorly-written and poorly-paced mess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, even if you're going to watch Darling in the FranXX for the mecha action, I don't think this show provides enough of that to keep your interest either. There's a couple of cool mecha fights here and there in the first half, but the second half feels like the budget was running out and so they made even a bunch of mechas battling aliens in space amount to them flying around as some explosions happen and occasionally there's some actual fighting, I was honestly surprised by how underwhelming the action ended up being, especially with how much they were hyping the space battle up. The animation at least is consistently good for the most part, I don't remember characters looking off-model, some noticeably poor animation happening or anything, it was pretty solid on that regard and some of the scenery actually looks beautiful. I don't have much to say about the soundtrack, as I don't remember anything from it aside from the opening and ending themes, which are all quite good and I really like opening 1's choice of color palettes for the animation going with the theme, it's really a great opening, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's definitely worse anime than Darling in the FranXX out there, but this is just the type of bad anime that frustrates me the most, the one that shows promise, has great concepts and ideas that could amount to a brilliant work, even a few legitimately good episodes, but it executes most of its ideas poorly and ends up being a huge wasted potential. How did things turn out like this? I have no idea, but this was easily the worst anime I was ever convinced to undrop and possibly the worst Trigger anime I've watched, and even my friends who talked me into giving another chance after episode 6 finished it and got disappointed in the end. I don't care if it's Trigger or A-1 Pictures' fault, both were involved with this and it was terrible.",

            "content": "Darling in the Franxx is a Trigger studio anime that everyone seems to love before even watching it. Many will tell you, or perhaps you are one of them, that this show is thematically deep and deliberate with its \"insanity.\" I will personally tell you that I dropped this anime in the second episode, probably would have given it a 5 because it was quite average, but my friend kept saying that it was as good as Fate/Zero so I HAD to watch it. I was thoroughly disappointed. You should avoid this anime, if you are not convinced, read below:\r\nStory: (2/10)\r\nIt's just a mess. Thestory is about these teenagers in a dystopian dead society, a fairly common take, and they need to fight these dinosaur robots. Interesting, kind of. The series, however, does not know subtly- hey why is the authority telling us to pilot with a partner? why do we do shit we don't want to do? Frankly I am insulted. Furthermore, a dystopian series like this really depends on its rich characters to serve as vehicles for its advacement - read the character section to find out ;). Everything seems force and contrived and the dialogue really questions my analysis. The bulk of my critque, I should have you know, for the story is in the characters section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (6/10)\\n\r\nAlone, I would give the art a 7 or 8 because its just pretty. The thing is, IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SYNERGY WITH THE SHOW ITSELF. Let me give you an example: Nagi no Asukara's art style is crystal clean and a clear saturation with a light marine blue. Not only does this saturation synergize well with the ocean theme of the story and setting (its a village by the sea, and another actually in the sea) but the coloring choice is serene and somewhat melancholic, a perfect component for a romance-drama series. The character designs are also quite stale, and seeing them in more animated animation does not make that staleness disappear. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nI don't really hear any spectacular OST that stand out. Fear not this is the usual problem. So I would give it a 6/10. The opening theme and ending theme brought it down for me. Again, read the character section below. The Opening and Ending are so dramatic and low-toned that it sets up the story to be deep and thematic, and Darling in the Franxx is not. Its really a show catering to the lower derivative and evidentally good at faking itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (2/10)\\n\r\nSo, my thoughts for every character is really articulated in this reddit page: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/80ddqp/is_darling_in_the_franxx_actually_good_or_is_it/. Highly recommend to check it out. All of them are just BLAND. Even 02, who is the closest to a personality, is seen way too much in anime. The more you learn about 02, the best character, the less you like her. You should also know that SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER (no one dies). HAHAHA, you gotta be kidding me, so these tropes are significant? The biggest argument I heard against mine is that \"but DUDE, these are teenagers raised in a sterile environment, they are supposed to be bland and generic!\" I say that's fucking retarded. That would not make them generic, it would make them either broken or at least have personality. REAL personality. Look at Gurren Lagann, I don't know a single name of all the Team Gurren group in episodes 5-13, but I remember their personalities and designs. In Darling in the Franxx, I could really care less.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (1/10)\\n\r\nThis show really questions my intelligence. Its melodrama is too overexaggerated and its themes are absent if not simple (well it makes itself seem deep). \\n",

The anime is based, at least the \"romance\", in conflicts between Ichigo lack of design and details, out of laziness to build the characters, made them flawed, and often bugged, mainly in the fights of Mechas, it gets very strange, typical  of Trigger and A-1 Pictures.\r\nCharacters: The most critical and flawed point of the work, containing one-dimensional or two-dimensional characters (at most) that no matter the lesson of life, definitely learn nothing, no matter what conflict they have entered or fought.There's the proof.\\n\\n\r\nMiku and Zorome: Characters lacking characterization and irritating personalities were posed simply because they did.\\n\r\n After all, it's all Trigger's slice of life, or A-1 Pictures, to have that kind of shit and the whole Zorome-focused episode does not deepen the character, he's simply one-dimensional and Miku is not different.\\n\\n\r\nFather - well, this is a huge defect, as it would be an extremely important character for the narrative, but it is nothing more than a garbage that had no construction and was no more than a plot device pro Zorome.\\n\\n\r\n In short, all characters remain one-dimensional, or two and are poorly constructed.\\n\\n\r\nPlot;  After showing the failure progression of it, let's talk about the critical points.\\n\r\nLet's start with Fanservice, and even if any fanboy says he has a meaning, I say, yes, he owns that meaning of puberty, which by the way is so badly done, bro.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the main Ecchi, the way of piloting, that was too much appeal in the eyes of the public, seriously?\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention all those fanservice generated in the tenses and fetishes of 02.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Building: MY GOD, I do not want to talk about it, but come on: The World Building sucks.\\n\\n\r\nIt does not present anything definitively about the Magma energy or its proper explorations, the adults are poorly exploited, and only as barrier of the protagonists, nothing more than a Plot Device.\\n\\n\r\nThe Urossaurs are just giant Robots, which despite having feelings, only support part of the script.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal: This end copied a Gainax genius, but ruined it leaving loose ends, examples of copies?  The fact that the aliens are the real villains, and the human instrumentality as the main objective, only those who saw Evangelion or TTGL know what I'm saying.\\n\\n\r\nBut here are the loose ends:\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy did Strelizia acquire a Zero Two format?  Or rather, How did Zero Two end up in Strelizia in space while your body was on Earth?\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy did the simple speech of a child result in people talking to statues?  And how did Hiro and Zero Two hear their voices?\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy were Hiro and Zero Two reborn as children?  Like the 02 Born as human?  How they were reborn if they had no descendants, no relatives on Earth, and they died in space.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd those various transformations of Strelizia based on the Power of Friendship or Power of Love?  At what point did they say that these Mechas altered their forms based on feelings?  Was not it psychological?  At what point did you explain anything about those Mechas?\\n\\n\r\nWhen did they do something that was not based on God-Ex Machinas?",

Other people said they don't know what's the goal of the show, where the story is going - I don't know either, and I don't want to know at this point. \r\nThe truth is, whoever wrote this mess is capable of really good storytelling. Darling in the FranXX(X) had some great moments, also some great fights. (I got emotional several times, at least at the beginning.) This could have been a masterpiece, but they decided to make it trashy instead. The fanservice is unbearable. I was notbothered by a naked woman in the first episode at all, I was bothered by a strange fluid that makes women's clothes melt, so that the boys could see their private parts. That's too cheap even for a hentai anime. I don't see how anyone in his right mind can give this a good review. It's just ridiculous and really childisch. Maybe this show is made for horny teenagers? I don't know. The way how they potrayed love in general was very questionable and not to my liking. It seems love = sex. Well, romantic love without sex doesn't work, but there should be some room for character development and emotion. How a homosexual character suddenly helped a girl getting pregnant was irritating too. This show is shallow and one of the worst I have ever seen. I don't think you can learn a single thing watching this. Not to mention that the plot is repetitive. Hiro and Zero Two get seperated, they ride together (orgasm), they get seperated, they ride together (stronger then ever with the best orgasm ever). It's that kind of teenage show drama I have a hard time to endure without rolling my eyes. \\n\r\nDon't waste your time with this garbage. And don't get deceived by the first episodes.

            "content": "It's difficult to decide where to begin. Most reviews start by talking about how good the show started and how controversially it ended, but I'm here to offer a counter point: I never found Darling in the Franxx good.\r\nEpisode 1 a fairly cookie cutter first episode of a mecha anime. Boy cannot pilot. Boy meets mysterious girl. Sudden monster attack! All hope is lost, boy pilots as he hoped he could and saves the day using skills no one knew he had.\r\nThe show is focused on the eight main pilots, their progress heavily tied to symbolism regarding the stages of life. They start out pamperedlike infants, slowly grow, go through puberty as they try to understand themselves, are thrown out on their own in the harsh world as adults, get married, have children, the symbolism is there. It's a shame that this was prioritised over coherence.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unbalanced and disorganised. I was bored to tears for the first 11 or so episodes. Then, there's a few legitimately intriguing ones that had me thinking I'd care a lot if the first half invested me! Followed by more boring, then nonsense. The story simply does what it wants with no foreshadowing. There's no logic to anything that happens, with a lot of just plain magic occurring in the second half without any indication that what occurred could be physically possible in this world, there's never precedent. It's meant to surprise us, but I ended up throwing my hands in the air. What's the point in caring if literally anything could happen? There are moments where the show unabashedly takes scenes from other mecha shows and just uses them. 8 minutes of episode 19 are just leading into a big Evangelion reference.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine, no shots outside of the second to last episode feel cheap or ugly, but what's most important to me is the cinematography. Cinematography is the blood of storytelling. Presentation means everything. A show's writing could be simply, but an inspired staging could bring everything back.\\n\\n\r\nIt's bad. Most shots are flatly staged with minimal camera movement in even lighting, resulting in everyday interactions that are just unexciting to look at. Even in action the camera barely moves, quickly cutting about instead. There is no energy to this show, it simply looks by the numbers.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Also fine. Unmemorable but passable OST, nothing to complain about. Voice acting is top notch. In general, the production team who was unrelated to story and direction should be proud of their work. They gave their all, and it really does show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? I could write an essay about how bland, underdeveloped, and dull they are (including everyone's waifu of the year, 02, who caught attention just by having a sultry disposition), but instead I'll cover a topic I have not seen in any other review: the lack of agency. The characters nod and follow orders until one of the final episodes, at which point the stakes are so high that they have literally no choice but to disobey. Even when they know their transparently evil bosses are evil, they still follow orders. Three times the show taunts us with a potential rebellion that never occurs. These characters are unambitious and do nothing without being forced to.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, much of their developments occur offscreen between the many timeskips in the show. Any time there's any kind of revelation, we skip ahead and the characters have already adapted to it. Just like the cinematography, there's no character moment that slams you in the heart, merely the main characters dramatically confessing their love for the 3rd time after the exact same argument so that they can one-shot the villain of the week.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this show, which is unfortunate as I went into the first episode extremely optimistic. There's a lot of talent on board, but it could have been applied so much more effectively. There are better shows out there.",

It has compelling side characters, but it squanders them. \\n\\n\r\nThat lopsidedness reflects almost perfectly in the show\u2019s two halves and their respective quality. The beginning of the show seemed like another Trigger orgasm; excellent animation, compelling characters, loving visual and thematic callbacks to old school anime, a fantastic score, fanservice that\u2019s incorporated into the plot, FranXX had everything going for it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil it didn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nBecause in the second half, not only does the animation quality drop, but, well, the goddamn story drops. \\n\\n\r\nThe momentum loses itself, the compelling characters and drama are thrown to the wayside, the plot completely derails itself, the primary romance stops being a heartwarming solid anchor that holds the show together and instead is shoved into our face over and over until it just completely jumps the shark.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of those issues, all of the glaringly huge holes in this show\u2019s quality and plot, all of them derive from one, singular problem:\\n\\n\r\nThe show cannot reconcile its core romance/drama with the mecha/action framework that houses it. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, the show showed promise because it showed the OPPOSITE. \\n\\n\r\nIt was great to see that these weren\u2019t ordinary mechs; the technology of the FranXX was directly in tune with the emotions/bonds of the users. The world itself was vague, but it didn\u2019t matter, because the primary focus was on the people inhabiting it. The main conflict between the Klaxosaurs and humans was merely a backdrop for the romance and bond between our two main characters. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of this is just fucking thrown out the window when the show decided to shift focus onto the more practical, literal side of things. What once was a show that was swooning about sexuality, adolescence, love, suddenly turned into a generic mecha romp, to the point where there was an entire episode of pure exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not how compelling romance space operas should play out. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama, the love triangle, the bond of our characters should EXTEND into their interaction with the mecha, and the world around them. The mecha, the world building, all of it should just be an extension of our character\u2019s emotions and development. \\n\\n\r\nThese two things should not be mutually exclusive!!\\n\\n\r\nTo better understand this, let\u2019s take a look at a show that does everything FranXX attempts to do, but does it all RIGHT:\\n\\n\r\n1982\u2019s Macross (hell, 2008\u2019s Macross: Frontier too).\\n\\n\r\nIn Macross, there\u2019s an alien threat, mecha, and a love triangle. How does that show reconcile all of these elements together, putting all of them on the forefront at the same time? It does so by tying them all together with one, singular theme: \\n\\n\r\nLOVE.\\n\\n\r\nThe very same theme FranXX tries to shove into our faces, only to shy away from it!\\n\\n\r\nIn Macross, the alien threat is vanquished by the power and love of culture, the love triangle is interwoven into every major battle, the mecha are merely tools and an extension of said love and celebration of love, never the focus. \\n\\n\r\nIt left more time to flesh out the characters as actual people instead of talkboxes that harped on and on and on and on about why love is important; it SHOWED us why love is important, SHOWED us how love can save the universe.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s pretty much the opposite of how FranXX wrapped up, and that\u2019s why, even with all of the sappy orations and passion in the show\u2019s subtext, the show failed to deliver. Failed to really mesh together as a cohesive whole. \\n\\n\r\nBut for all its faults, at least FranXX tried. \\n\\n\r\nAt least it wasn\u2019t a generic mecha showdown throughout, actively subverting tropes we would expect, setting up character beats that, at times, were absolutely magical. \\n\\n\r\nI bought the romance between the two main characters. I FELT for the side characters whose hearts were broken. I cried and I cheered whenever hardships were overcome by that power of love, no matter how sappy or corny that sentiment may be. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not be a great show, but there\u2019s still a heart beating inside of it. Despite all of its missteps, Darling in the FranXX still dares to ask that timeless and ever-relevant question:\\n\\n\r\nDo you remember love?",

            "content": "So Darling in the Franxx is the first anime I've watched and is what made me love anime all together.  No other anime I've watched so far can compare to Darling in the Franxx personally.  The excitement I would get working on Saturdays to know that when i get home there would be a new episode was unforgettable.  So without further ado, here is my review of the show.\r\nStory. The story for the show was very unique and i never heard anything like it but then again I'm still an anime noob.  It has good progression and a pretty big twisthere and there.  Overall it was a thrilling story that will leave you on the edge of your seat on what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nArt.  The art for Darling in the Franxx is what caught my attention and made me start watching it.  The characters, the places and the fight scenes are so visibly appealing. \\n\\n\r\nSound.  The sound for this anime is awesome.  The opening song, the ending song, the music for the fight scenes, the sad scenes, they all are awesome.  I was able to experience some real feeling  during a scene with the music that was played during it.  The voice actors and actresses were also excellent.  They had real emotion in their voices and all did a great job.  I was especially impressed with the voice actor of Hiro and voice actress of Zero Two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.  Ahh the characters. All the characters were such fun to watch.  Especially with best girl Zero Two and Hiro.  The chemistry and interactions with these two and everyone felt real.  Each character has their moment in the series and grows throughout which was very enjoyable to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.  Out of all the anime I've seen so far, I haven't enjoyed a series as much as I did this one.  With what I said earlier, the excitement I would get working on Saturday to know that I can watch a new episode was unforgettable.  During the first few weeks of this anime I had trouble thinking on actual real life matters cause I was so obsessed with this show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime really was something special.  What with its story, its art, its sound, and its characters, it really was perfect for me as a viewer in every way.  Im sad that its over, but thankful.  Without it, I don't think I ever would have gotten into the world of anime!",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is a show that has very clear influences from a variety of other shows, both mecha shows like the ever-present Neon Genesis Evangelion, as well as more recent shows like Kiznaiver with its focus on interaction between a group of teens. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does make viewing this series less enjoyable if you've seen plenty of other anime. It doesn't really try to do anything new. The post-apocalyptic setting is fairly undeveloped and the mecha aspect feels tacked on. This could just as well have been set in a very different setting with the samecharacters without really losing any substance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem the show has is that it doesn't really develop this setting much at all. Since the post-apocalyptic mecha setting is merely fodder for the main aspect of the show which is the youngsters and their troubles with adults, love, and finding a place where they belong. Furthermore it is often quite silly things which draw my attention, like the fact that no one seems to know what a kiss is but they all have very clear ideas of what constitutes ogling and being a pervert. This would not have been that problematic if the character interactions in and of themselves had been more interesting, but sadly they are not.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a wistful kid that doesn't really belong with the group, due to some flaw of his in piloting a mecha which is a symbiosis between a male and female pilot. He is indecisive and entirely driven by circumstances beyond his control. His character seems like one stereotyped after who the studio believes is watching the show. The female lead, Zero-Two, is more interesting and manages to remain somewhat alien and aloof in her actions which gives her some credibility. The other main love interest, Ichigo, is also somewhat interesting but ultimately cannot be anything but a wet blanket to the main character, a love interest which will never pan out. The rest of the supporting cast follows typical stereotypes and aside from Goro they are not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe sexism in the show runs quite rampant, with the boys taking control of the mechas by using the girls bodies (to which they seem to have an orgasmic reaction as the male \"connects\" to the female). This wouldn't be that big of an issue if it wasn't for the tacky messages that the show also tries to convey with a moralism that would have offended me if it wasn't so obvious and comical in its effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is somewhat well done without anything that really stands out, action scenes are decently portrayed but has no real \"wow\" moments nor does the character design, apart from Zero-Two, evoke any kind of feeling. It is all rather drab and boring, which is also damaging to the series because it tries to portray the teenagers as a test-team with a focus on individuality. But just because you make everyone else immensely drab doesn't mean that the main characters will suddenly become more interesting or colourful. The mechas all look the same apart from colours and some minor differences, they wear the same uniforms, character designs don't stand out at all.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, it is a decently enjoyable series, it doesn't do anything really badly and if you have nothing better to do by all means take it out for a watch, but go in with your expectations set low. 5/10",

            "content": "Studio Trigger & A1-Pictures, what can possibly go wrong?\r\nWell if there was one anime for the first half of 2018 that was controversial on many fronts, some legitimate, some just crazy outrage, then it's none other than Darling in the FranXX.\r\nDarling in the FranXX was by in all cases a very good character study with great character developments.....mainly on the supporting cast. But Darling in the FranXX also had many sexual innuendoes even to the point of the FranXX's mecha cockpit mechanics to the characters' intentionally unknown knowledge of sex to even some of the naming themes in Darling in the FranXX but even howblatant it is, LA will say that this has more of a theming to both the world building and to the characters' development to their relationship with one another. So going back to the supporting cast development being somewhat better than the main duo, well it's because we get some good development from the colorful cast of personalities, some clashing some having alot of great interactions with one another, like Kokoro voiced by Saori Hayami and Mitsuru voiced by Aoi Ichikawa, the more hot-blooded Zorome voiced by Mutsumi Tamura opening up to both his partner Miku voiced by Nanami Yamashita and Miku mingling with many of her peers, we find some plot twists that involve Ikuno voiced by Shizuka Ishigami and Ichigo along with Goro's \"bro\" status to the main character Hiro voiced by Yuuto Uemura and finally Futoshi voiced by Hiroki Gotou, the gentle giant of the group who stops being so clingy to Kokoro and tries to find his own identity in some sense. With all this in mind, LA's favourite supporting cast member would have been.....a tie between Ikuno and Goro and LA wanted the both of them to get more development than before. Now onto our main duo and LA KNOWS the main duo, Zero Two voiced by Haruka Tomatsu and Hiro have develops just like the supporting cast but as much as the supporting cast or Hiro & Zero Two have a stake in the plot, the supporting cast themselves are just a bit more memorable and likable even if the entire cast by all means gets their own lionshare of screentime in the process. Nonetheless continuing on from that well...Zero Two had gotten a notoriety in the Winter of 2018 of being the best girl and LA won't lie as much as all the things LA said above but Zero Two was LA's favourite character especially with her character development of being discriminated of being dangerous and \"not human\", now this goes to Ichigo and what she did to Zero Two and Hiro and LA found the entire controversy against Ichigo and what she did completely overblown, like LA understood Ichigo's feelings and her actions that caused the entire melodrama to Zero Two & Hiro in the process was Ichigo's chaotic feelings and wanting to protect Hiro but the entire outrage against Ichigo was uncalled for especially with the death threats to the creators (yes, this happened). With all that said, Darling in the FranXX major strengths is with it's characters and how they develop them...however\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX' world building both helps and works against this anime as a whole. The thing is Darling the FranXX has a rich lore concerning the entire premise of the anime, of alien-like beings called Klaxosaurs that have driven humanity to the brink of extinction however humanity created the FranXX, robots with humanoid properties in order to fight these Klaxosaurs. So it's like Trigger's Attack on Titan...in a ways and LA loves world building but the thing is both the world building along with trying to develop it's characters at the same time, can cause some inconsistent pacing, though this kind of pacing is necessary (as such from fighting to a breather episode works fine). Where the problem lies in trying to cram world building and character developments at the same time is that Darling in the FranXX has the tendency to bring up world building out of nowhere while wholely focusing on it's characters. Darling in the FranXX mostly keeps both it's world building and character development balanced but this goes out the window by the latter last quarter of the anime and it's especially prevalent in one certain episode (However LA will say it was hinted at but only vaguely at worst, connect the dots please~ at best). Darling in the FranXX' world building is interesting and it's character development only gives layers to the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, done by Trigger, CloverWorks and A1-Pictures, this trifecta of animation studios did great overall in almost evey element, from character designs, mech designs, backgrounding and action scenes were amazing to see for the most part, the Darling the FranXX world is a baron wasteland filled with killer Klaxosaurs while the fortress humanity has put themselves in are schizotech cybertech and even that shows. The character designs are all exotic and colorful and easily memorable with many of the characters instantly recognizable (heck even their FranXX!). It is VERY obvious that the mark of both A1-Pictures and Trigger are ALL over Darling in the FranXX, from Trigger's batshit crazy action to A1-Pictures' slicker character designs to smooth out Trigger and with all this the one other animation studio that didn't really got recognized that being CloverWorks (who worked on Persona 5: The Animation and Slow Start) was still decent as they along with A1-Pictures worked on the backgrounding. Ohh and by the way A1-Pictures and Khara handled the 3D Graphics while Trigger worked on the animation production. The animation like LA said was top notch with A1-Pictures helming the production across the board with Trigger and CloverWorks helping as well. This was still a decent effort in the animation department and has both consistency and looks great at the same time. Darling in the FranXX's animation is worthy of praise to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, well with a huge cast, LA will go by what LA wants to really talk about, LA felt sorry for Ichigo's voice actor Kana Ichinose with the fallout of the entire Ichigo controversy but nonetheless Kana Ichinose was great as Ichigo and LA thought it was Kana Hanazawa when LA first heard her. Haruka Tomatsu utterly dominated this anime as Zero Two, for all the crazy wide range of emotions Zero Two went through and Haruka Tomatsu blew it out of the park...and that's another Haruka Tomatsu role where she is best girl and HIGHLY POPULAR *cough* Asuna *cough*. Saori Hayami was another contender for this anime but seriously Saori Hayami did her ALL in this anime and Kokoro goes through some shit in this anime!. If you liked the characters in Darling in the FranXX then quite easily the entire cast did their all in this anime, LA was massively impressed with this voice cast all round that if LA went voice actor by voice actor, LA could be here all day.\\n\\n\r\nWith how gripping the anime is at times, the plot twists and what the characters goes through some shit, well many of the plot twists are by all means great and changes the entire plot directions for the better or worse and LA will say that the plot twists are warranted of saying the anime DOES give subtle hints, yes even the plot twist LA said above has this as unprecedented it seemed. The plot twists are great for the most part, from it's characters to it's plot itself even if the plot twists were covered by controversy. LA will say the plot twists are done...but with some shaky execution here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSo the finale...aside from it's unprecedented exposition to it's world building and newly added abrupt villains to the roster was shaky at best, the finale as a whole was satisfying if a bit cliche it's execution of the final result of this finale. The ending was satisfying at the most as the story DID end with all all the loose plot points concluding as well as an entire \"what are they doing now\" scenario with all the supporting cast members. The clicheness comes in the entire part of \"regaining and rebuilding humanity\" scthick but nonetheless Darling in the FranXX IS a \"completed\" story with an ending that gave us and for LA was satisfying as much of a rough it's build up and shaky plot twists it took to get to it's inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX was largely followed by it's controversy and swerving of plot directions here and there in the latter half of the anime, but all things considered, Darling in the FranXX was........a \"decent anime\", as much of a hyped anime this was from Winter 2018 and with all it's strengths of great characters and making them highly memorable and interesting, great animation and voice cast to it's weakness of it's shaky world building that both hurts it's own world building and sometimes it's own characters in the process of it along with it's many outrageous & sometimes stupid controversies, Darling in the FranXX by the end of it all for LA...was just decent all round, not great but just decent. LA was hyped about Darling in the FranXX and LA didn't even care that A1-Pictures had a hand in it, but Darling in the FranXX for LA kept LA's hype in some cases but didn't FULLY deliver thus dropped LA's opinions on Darling in the FranXX to just the \"decent\" anime pile and this isn't a hit at Darling in the FranXX, LA liked and enjoyed Darling in the FranXX especially with it's characters and world building as well as the great battles and shocking plot twists that largely impacted the plot and characters when it did and finally it's satisfying finale, but how it was executed as a whole, LA just found it as \"decent\" at best, good at worst and this is a COMPLIMENT to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX shook up the anime community for the first half of 2018 and might have been LA's most controversial anime of Winter 2018, but Darling in the FranXX was just one hell of a crazy ride that just left LA saying that it's \"decent\" but slightly overhyped but still has creditability to itself especially when Darling in the FranXX's strengths still overwhelmed it's weakness in aspects as shaky it did become at the end of it...",

            "content": "Ah, yes. The controversial anime of the season. I had to check this out strictly based on the fact that it was banned in China and had so many \u201creaction\u201d videos on YouTube. (I\u2019m not really a mech anime fan.) Having seen it, I don\u2019t get the hubbub. \r\nSTORY: I\u2019m not sure why there\u2019s such an ordeal over the sexual nature of this show. Yes, the positions of the characters in the mech are very suggestive. From time to time, the girls make comments and sounds that are definitely sexual. And there\u2019s absolutely a very vaguely tongue in cheek meaning behind Hiro\u2019s lack of abilityto perform with anyone but Zero Two. So what?? It\u2019s not the focal point. There are so many anime that are much, much more ecchi. Specifically, I\u2019m thinking of shows like Valkyrie Mermaid whatever (where the girls need to turn their weapon on in order to turn it on... I mean activate it). Or Simoun, in which the girls must kiss and be in tune (just like the Franxx kids) in order to pilot their machines. \\n\r\nRegardless of the controversy, I enjoy this show. It\u2019s about kids learning what it means to be an adult in a dystopian future where children are disposable. It\u2019s fast paced and enjoyable, if not predictable. As the kids learn about \u201cbecoming an adult\u201d (literally they don\u2019t understand how one day they are children and the next they magically transform into an adult), you grow attached to them and see their views as sweet and innocent (even Zero Two). This is more a story about life span development in a world that rejects children as anything other than parasites (literally what they are called), than ecchi. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Cute when it needs to be, sexy when it wants to be. Reminded me of Gurren Lagan or FLCL. Zero Two certainly has a unique character design. The \u201cbig bad\u201d monsters of the show are well animated as well, a blend of tech and dinosaur. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Nothing special. The characters are pretty emotive, but otherwise nothing over the top. I did notice a couple scenes that definitely could have used different mood music, but otherwise nothing extraordinarily good or bad.",

This anime became from the state of being 9+ worthy even on mal to a straight 7. \r\nHere is the morale of this anime, if you want to watch it: you will enjoy every single episode until episode 15/16. Don't wanna get into detail but the anime from this point starts being progressively trash. It is worth the watch until this point, I did never regret doing this, I do regret however watching this anime PAST this point to see how quickly it felt down. It was depressing. If you however manage to get to the sweet spot of this animeyou would still want to finish the anime, that is fine, but don't expect shit.",

            "content": "This is not a review per se, rather a conservative essay masked as a review about the series. There are spoilers ahead.\r\nWhat is conservatism? Is it the worship of the ashes or the preservation of the fire?\r\nWhat is Darling in the FRANXX? Is it a glorified mecha or a cheap romance anime?\t\r\nAnd now, what does conservatism have to do with Darling in the FRANXX? It\u2019s exactly the dystopian future where the fire has not been preserved and there are barely ashes to even be worshipped. A world ruled by an elite whose actual faces are not even seen at all, pulling the strings from apodium ordering what should be done and what should not.\\n\\n\r\nSo it\u2019s no coincidence that in 2018, conservatism is having its finest year since a few decades, and also one of the finest anime of the season, both have absolutely awed the world with their simple, but blunt and clear way to show their worlds and why it\u2019s more needed than ever.\\n\\n\r\n-Story (10/10):\\n\r\nChildren are made to fight mechas called Franxxs to protect the plantations from klaxosaurs, which are a species of reptiles who live under the Earth, one of those children is called Hiro, a once promising parasite waiting his turn to finally pilot a Franxx, can\u2019t connect at all with a female in order to pilot it. His fate changes when he meets a controversial pilot by the name of Zero Two, who is believed to killing her partners after a few rides in her favorite Franxx, the Strelizia. Somehow, Hiro knows Zero Two from earlier times, and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Hiro gets tired of waiting, goes to pilot with this controversial pilot Zero Two, and surprisingly, he makes connection with her, but starts to have the same problems and conditions that former Zero Two partners endured before dying. Not to be deterred, he keeps insisting it is fake and just by pure willpower, manages to break that curse from him, accepting unconditionally Zero Two and vowing to never let her alone and \u201cbe one with her\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two is invited to live with Hiro in an old house reminiscent of the old 19th century mansions in the place referred as the Garden, here she is met with skepticism by the other parasites, namely Ichigo, the leader of the squad, who herself has something with Hiro. The first episodes consist on mostly fights with the mechas against the klaxosaurs, and of course the mandatory beach episode. And it\u2019s ironically that in the fan-service-ish episode where one the most important, yet secondary arcs of the anime is started.\\n\\n\r\nCheap romance drama happens all the time, crushes are widespread between all the cast, some broken hearts and some not, typical for people in their puberty/adolescence, volatile mood swings, so very typical, but in this dystopian world, it\u2019s forbidden to have emotions! The parasites are treated as numbers (Ichigo: 015, Goro: 056, Kokoro: 556, Hiro: 016, Zero Two: 002), confined to renounce their individuality and being forced to swear loyalty to Papa (the elites who control the entire world), even not caring about their humanity as it was the case when they\u2019re left alone in the Garden for several days until their protectors Hachi and Nana (also named by their codes) intervene.\\n\\n\r\nThe soul searching of Zero Two is quite magnificent, as she wants to be more like a human, several fights with her fellow parasites, especially Ichigo, finally breaks that hard shell she had, opens herself to Hiro and co. and enjoying fighting with his Darling. All of this happens while a sweet girl named Kokoro finds a rare book about taking care of a baby, a forgotten art in the dystopian world; soon, Kokoro will go deeper in this strange book, while trying to sort out her feelings towards Mitsuru, something that upsets the sturdy Futoshi who is also in love with Kokoro.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the bigger reasons that this happens is that all the parasites are having higher mood swings due to entering their adolescence and trying to understand their bodies, no wonder when they now see each other naked, they get very ashamed and vehemently oppose the other sex watch them, exemplified of the volatile duo of Miku and Zorome, always the most loud and obnoxious members of the Garden and the most representatives of the nature of a growing woman and a growing man, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe higher peak of the middle part happens when finally Kokoro and Mitsuru open themselves to love and climaxing in Kokoro\u2019s bedroom and sleeping with each other. The parasites later plan their wedding just to be stopped by the more Papa loyal Nines, who in before find the real state that the Squad 13 are currently and what they are really planning, the Nines being similar to the classical soviet spies who doesn\u2019t express anything, but are astute in detecting dissidence; and of course in typical soviet style, Kokoro and Mitsuru are sent to some kind of \u201crehabilitation\u201d which forces them forget what happened those last days.\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the most confusing parts of the series, happens a lot of strange cases, why Papa conquered the world and what\u2019s its real nature, why adults are immortal and why parasites never reach adulthood (something that Zorome thinks a lot) and what happens when the parasites doesn\u2019t die, what happened to real klaxosaurs, Ikuno finally confessing to her dear Ichigo. These parts without doubt generated a huge negative reaction (somewhat justified) and if they were written correctly and with more clarity, I\u2019m pretty sure we could be talking as this series as part of the far side of the anime Heaven.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, before the final fights with the Franxx start, it\u2019s when we know that what really happened in that night where Kokoro and Mitsuru were alone, they created new life, a baby ready to make understand everybody there what it\u2019s needed to recover their old world (and also the reason that both have to stay), the extinguished fire lost a lot of decades ago. Ichigo finally accepts the relationships of Zero Two and Hiro and also Goro\u2019s love, and now she\u2019s ready to move on. The old world is trying to be reseeded and replant with the old ways of their ancestors after many years of unlimited magma extraction, and of course, that current Earth doesn\u2019t have the same fertile soil of its olde years. \\n\\n\r\nHiro has to departure to complete the saving of the world with Zero Two and tells that they\u2019ll come someday; the now former parasites and adults try to reconstruct the world left with what both taught and left them. Kokoro gives birth to her baby girl, who unsurprisingly puts the name of Ai (love), and settles in her new life with Mitsuru and her children, Ikuno became the scholar of the new world and settles with Naomi, a former parasite-in-training who was isolated because she never had the \u201cconditions\u201d to be a parasite, Goro travels the world to finally settle with Ichigo, Zorome and Miku became teachers of the new children being born, Futoshi moves on and is the new chef, with all of them trying to repopulate that new world, all while their old leaders Hachi and Nana give them the keys of that new world and become something like the guarantors of it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Hiro\u2019s and Zero Two\u2019s ascent to the outer space to protect the new world, all of the former parasites still on Earth pray for their wellbeing and hoping their sacrifice is not in vain, while at the same time thanking both for re-enlightening them, giving new reasons for being helpful with their new others, and wishing and preparing for their second coming. \\n\\n\r\nA true story of how the young parasites overthrew their old soviet liberal establishment, all of them understanding why the old ways are still timeless and why we should never surrender our liberties and humanity just to play and be God.\\n\\n\r\n-Art and sound (9/10):\\n\r\nNothing much to add here (and also don\u2019t want to), animation is pretty fluid, what you most expect from Trigger and A-1 Pictures, but there\u2019s a little decay when Trigger stops animating it in the third quarter. No weird frames or weird animation, all characters are well drawn and have very natural proportions. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening Kiss of Death is an underrated 2018 masterpiece opening, and the endings, while not keeping up to the OP; they mostly entertain you, good singing by the unit of the five parasite girls. All the voices are clearly on song with their respective characters, higher praise to Miku and Zorome seiyuus who made the characters much more entertaining (and/or annoying) for me.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters (10/10):\\n\r\nWhen you see that they are 10 main characters, you may say that this show is actually bad or it\u2019s some kind of error, but quite the opposite is actually. No character here will make you feel indifferent towards he/she, all of them serve a purpose and while having or not a mini-arc dedicated towards one of them, taking just one of them out of the picture and Darling in the Franxx will not feel the same at all; and in contrast of other anime who have heavy focus on just the characters, DitF balances extremely well the story, the execution, the characters and the conservative moral of the show.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two is the best character by far, changing from an isolated girl whose only focus is beating klaxosaurs towards a more caring person, not only to Hiro, but for the rest of the parasites who had heavy suspicions of her, when she calls Hiro \u201cDarling\u201d, she truly means it and it\u2019s actually committed to him. Hiro comes from the leader of the current Squad 13 to outcast to the spiritual leader of the group, clearly committed towards Zero Two, and understood the true reality of the group and the Garden, just to suffer a small cruel fate of defying the almighty Papa world.\\n\\n\r\nIchigo is the actual leader of the Squad 13 and has a laser focus to keep order over all the parasites and fighting in the Franxxs; she admired Hiro from standing up to the soviet-esque establishment to the point to accuse unfairly Zero Two for taking him from her, always fighting for what she considers right. Goro is the most \u201cnormal\u201d guy who, like her partner and love interest Ichigo, has a laser focus when riding the Franxx and is mostly jealous of Hiro, but he also serves as a species of masculine role model and also a guarantor of sanity for the other boys.\\n\\n\r\nZorome and Miku are exactly carbon copies of each other, loud and obnoxious who consider the other one as the rival to beat and somehow still having the time to care for each other. Zorome is the typical boy who lauds the current system as the most perfect system ever made by man and tries to become part of that system, only to become the biggest opponent of the Papa\u2019s world once he knows the harsh realities that intrusive governments have not only on economies, but also on the social life aspect. Miku also understand what\u2019s going on and also becomes one of the highest dissenters of it, also keeping her feminine personality and also being totally against to being the object of the lecherousness of the men, attracting the other girls towards her position. No coincidence that this wild couple (if I can say that) represents the true nature of why a man (Zorome) should be masculine, that it\u2019s not only bad, but also natural and necessary, and also why a woman (Miku) should be feminine as such.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro and Mitsuru are arguably the finest couple of the series, from \u201cdifferent\u201d upbringings and sufferings; they manage to connect each other really well in the latter parts of the series. Mitsuru is the biggest examples to how to stand up when you are thrown to the floor to suffer, that there\u2019s no reason that somebody should stay in the same state forever and a proof of will is power; like Zero Two, he was tortured and \u201crehabilitated\u201d many times to be just one more of the system, also embraces Kokoro warmly and manages to forgive Hiro for \u201cforgetting\u201d his promise, and on the last episode, supporting Kokoro and their offspring,. Kokoro is a shy girl who is somewhat resigned to her parasite life without any aspiration, but after the finding of a mysterious book about taking care of a baby, she starts to discover this strange old way of living and caring; decided to be loved by Mitsuru, she plans to take care of him even on the most tiny moments, once in love, she, like most of the parasites, has a laser focus, this time on trying to have a baby, and after succeeding, she suffers the same fate to the people who manage to defy the system and gets \u201crehabilitated\u201d, this didn\u2019t manage to break her will even after getting pregnant and remaining confident in delivering, despite \u201cwarnings\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFutoshi is that guy who always gets the worst scenario of the many possible on the series; this doesn\u2019t deter him for trying to overcome an infinite and a half of problems that the system and the luck give him. That means suffering the change of his partner and love interest Kokoro, having eating problems who make him heavier and being always the butt of a joke; this clearly shows up when himself officiated the wedding between Kokoro and Mitsuru, and of course after the final moments, he clearly looks at peace with himself and managed to move on from Kokoro and forming his own family. Ikuno is a very underrated characters who doesn\u2019t like to shine on her own, the system makes her resigned and upset to the point to forcing the changing of partners after breaking up the chemistry with Mitsuru, unbeknownst to everyone is that her interests are on her side, actually Ichigo; she suffers of not having her and having many boys around her makes her jealous, and after confessing her, she clearly felt more alleviated, moved on and began a relationship with a rejuvenated Naomi, and accepted her fate of aging faster than the rest by overexerting the last remnants of energy she had, to the point of still caring for Ichigo and her future baby (from Goro) with the same care and dedication she devoted to the establishment and scholarly of the new world.\\n\\n\r\nEven the outer characters, Hachi and original Nana mostly show a cold and distant nature towards the parasites, but deep into them, they care for them a lot, and also for each other, the new world made by the old parasites has the guidance of them. New Nana is colder towards the parasites, but eventually helps her other Nana and Hachi to give the needed advice to the future of the world, the former parasites.\\n\\n\r\nThe other group, the Nines, also fight against the klaxosaurs, but their upbringing made them cold and distant to everybody, and in some occasions, they serve as the secret service of Papa, trying to monitor the lives of the parasites. Interestingly enough, as they are abandoned by their bosses, they become crazy and later help the former parasites to their last battle to fade into the time and give them space for the new world.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nWhat hasn\u2019t been said about Darling in the Franxx yet? It\u2019s all resumed in what you think and you may be right or not, opinions are subjective and should be treated as such. For what I considered above may be wrong in the mind of a certain person is equally valid as if other person were to support my thesis made about the series.\\n\\n\r\nMany have said that Darling has been based on the old mechas like Gurren Lagann or similar, however, I\u2019m not the one to make such comments because I haven\u2019t watched it any of the other old mechas mentioned, so this essay-review is just being made from what I thought about Darling in the Franxx when I was watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAs this review is published, seeing the current score of 7.80 and the top reviews is not only disappointing, but rather criminal and dangerous where we criticize what the anime establishment imposes as a way to think. Sure, Darling in the Franxx has a quite big quality dip in the middle part to somehow justify lowering the average score over and of course things could (and should) have been done better, however, this doesn\u2019t affect my writing of this essay masked as a review; in comparison, there are many anime whose real score is way higher that it should be, an example is Charlotte, whose rating is an unfairly high 7.93.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if I made a more neutral and colder review of the anime, could I have penalized it to a 9 or an 8? It could have been a yes as I could have been a no, but since the middle of the series is when I truly saw what was really behind this series and I decided to review by that way. So maybe taking 3 weeks to finally complete this review seen with conservative lenses was the best idea as I think this is the correct way to watch Darling in the Franxx. Could Darling have a better outlook if it was aired in 2008 or earlier, rather than 2018 in an era where true conservatism has all but disappeared, and somehow it\u2019s having its best months in a very long time? We'll never know, or it\u2019s just maybe my higher than average paranoia tricking my mind.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that I enjoyed could be appropriate, as I enjoyed a good bunch of adolescents trying to understand their world and each other, and why it\u2019s like that and why they have to suffer, while at the same time, discovering each other and doing what our human nature mandate us, it was funny as hell most of the time. But my highest emotion on the latter half was mostly of fear, tremor and anxiety, and it\u2019s not because the confusing part of, well, a good chunk of episodes, but rather the very normal things that we do right now are in great danger to be destroyed by an elite whose only wish is to obliterate our current lives and existence as we know it.\\n\\n\r\nSo this conservative critic asks this question: Are we on the point of no return where we are monitored by the state and like Orwell, war is peace? No, and by a long shot actually. In spite of that, this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have to rest on our laurels, rather keep fighting for conservative values until the end of the world.\\n\\n\r\nSo for many, Darling in the Franxx is an overrated mecha, for others is the greatest thing since sliced bread, for others is a wasted potential, for others it\u2019s just a mug anime who only fills in the season. For me is the glorification of true conservatism, where the family, community and environment are given their spaces to live in peace with each other; moreover, the central piece that makes love and later family is the much needed remedy to a great quantity of ills that we currently. All in all, Darling in the Franxx\u2019s objective is not only glorifying our classic normal ways to live, rather serves a warning about a possible collapse of our current system that took us millennia to create and could be destroyed in mere weeks.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 10/10.",

            "content": "For what I have seen, Darling in the FranXX is the new pineapple on pizza discussion topic. As a person who likes pineapple on pizza, I feel pretty much obligated to write my review in this series. For this review, I will start with story, followed by characters, leaving art and sound at last. This is due to the Story and Characters being the main point of branching between opinions (obviously lol). I will not include ANY SPOILER (plot content).\r\nAlso, this review will be based on the point of view of a normal viewer, and not a fully-pledged series and movies reviewer.\r\nAnd finally, before starting,I will put you on track with the main issue, that I will refer to many times during this review: Character backstory filling. The first 6 episodes are great, but from episode 7 to 11, they focus too much on filling spaces. And that is what stops me from giving it a 10/10. Now, let's begin:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9):\\n\r\nLet's be honest. Almost anyone who has watched all the episodes to date -14 until the day of this review- has noticed the abrupt change in argument, from an intense drama where we will not know what will happen to the main character and that appealing girl who showed up, to something we didn't really sign up to. When I saw A-1 Pictures on the studios list, I knew storytelling would be an issue, even if they weren't directly related with it. If we hide the episodes that try to give backstory to some of the OTHER (will explain below) characters, we have an amazing plot. Synthesizing, storyline is great, storytelling is poor.\\n\\n\r\nEven with this issue, the starting episodes have all they need to keep you on track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7):\\n\r\nLet's start stating something very important for the new viewer: Not all characters are main characters. As stupid as it may sound, MAL has every character from the group listed as main characters, which isn't necessarily wrong, as story revolves around them. But, considering that the plot concentrates mainly on Hiro, Zero Two, and Ichigo, we may as well call them the 'true' main characters. And this is why it is just a 7 rank on this topic; because it's not bad, but not great either. It keeps a balance that's really necessary for this kind of anime, as it tells us about not only the 'true' main characters, but the 'other' characters as well. And this balance was lost when the starting drama ended, and it took the series a little bit of time to recover from it (5 eps. or so).\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nAs much as I really would like to give Art a 10, it is not perfect. And that is an issue, as it really fits its role, and I don't think its replaceable. The design of some characters may be plain (uhm, Hiro), but it really goes unnoticed when Ichigo, Zero Two, or the FranXX appear on screen. It must be stated though, that every one of the characters' designs represent their personalities very well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, at least for me, lacks the appeal it needs to attract more action anime fans, but it does fill the purpose it looks to fill.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the art of is really appealing, even when locations feel dead inside. And the latter is an achievement.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7):\\n\r\nGood. Not bad, not great. Just 'good'. The opening (Kiss of Death) is amazing, but the BGM goes unnoticed. I'm not saying the BGM is bad, its just that the songs lack the means of drawing your attention and make you look for them. The ending themes by XX:me are also amazing tracks, and I love the usage they give to them when an episode is about to end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I've enjoyed so much so far, that it actually made me write my first review on this website. The first episodes gave me all the hype needed to follow the series every week, even when they ended and I was left with something I wasn't really interested in, as was the 'other' characters' backstory. But, even with that as an obstacle, I'm really enjoying this series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\nOverall (lol), this is an anime I would recommend to anyone. I love the fact that they show us children meant to develop no feelings, not only with them developed already, but developing them even more as the plot goes forward. The characters are weak, yes, but the 'true' main characters I stated earlier do have the necessary points to be appealing by themselves, as their cases are really unique, not as the ones that the plot tried to put in our face after letting the initial drama behind.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime derails itself from the story line, but when it goes back up, it feels it was worth it to give the anime another shot, episode after episode, until you reached the one where the anime goes back into what it was (which for me was episode 12).\\n\\n\r\nAnd that finishes my review.\\n\r\nI plan on updating it as the series goes forward, and clarifying it as time goes on.-",

            "content": "There is a great deal of depth to this anime, far beyond the surface level cries of 'sexual exploitation' that some are spouting. The society depicted in this anime mirrors our own in a few unique ways. For one, I do not look at the process of piloting the FRANXX as 'male dominance'. The themes evident here are immediately sexual. As such, the male-female duo is not unlike the act of procreation in our world. Much like our world, the female is responsible for generating 'life'. The male plugs into the female and both work together to create a child. In DARLING in the FRANXX,this same duo is creating the energy, or life, to pilot the mech. Indeed, while many may blindly see this as 'male exploitation of women', can you also not say that the male is dependent on the female partner? The plot even says that they must be in perfect resonance in order to function. They both NEED to rely on one another in order to succeed. There are no duplicitous motives, only harmonious ones. \\n\r\nPhilosophies aside, the animation is top-notch, and Zero Two takes the spotlight as an engaging character that adds much to the movement of the plot. She is sporadic, barbaric, romantic, and unusual, and has both a primal and refined take on 'love'. Her affection for her 'darling' is slightly overbearing, if not excessive at times (blood and saliva seem to be regularly shared to symbolize their connection), but it is also refined as she employs the heartfelt and classic pet name 'darling' to describe her feelings. The way she gazes upon him fondly, caresses his head, and confronts those who might challenge their relationship, is indicative of a more civilized mind. \\n\r\nAll in all, I found myself really enjoying each episode and racing to finish it and see how everything unfolded. It did pass my expectations as a whole and I found myself crying at the end. I went from hating to falling in love with Zero Two as a character as well, and to say it again, I am fond of each character and the show. Please do watch this, it'll make you think about a lot of things differently about our world and I promise it will exceed your expectations and leave you feeling satisfied.",

I consider myself a somewhat tough critic of anime, but I truly think this show was for some strange reason misunderstood by some of the anime watching populace here on MAL.\r\nI won't go into too much detail, but the story is about a kid who was a super strong candidate for piloting a mech who fell from grace when it actually came time to try and pilot one for real. He ended up losing his status as one of the top candidates and the show starts off athis low point. He later finds a special enigmatic partner who is luckily able to bring him out of the gutter, and make him useful again as a co-pilot of a mech with her.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in the show are all kids, and I would liken a good portion of the story to a coming-of-age type thing where everyone is trying to figure out their own emotions. Episode to episode they're always facing something new, some type of social relationship problem that must be placed second beyond fighting a klaxosaur (the monsters the mechs were built to fight).\\n\\n\r\nThe main point of me writing this review is just so I can ask all you review lurkers to give this show a chance.

            "content": "I gave DITF a review after 6 episodes, which I decided was both unrepresentative and unfair. Now that I've completed all episodes, I'm back to give a more comprehensive review. Unfortunately, my opinion only got lower... \r\nI've made a quick pro, con, and \"irks\" list, followed by a quick summary of my opinion on the show, a more in depth discussion of those pros and cons, and finished with a short mention of what I see as the context of and some reason for the show's wildly varying scores.\r\nAfter the pros/cons and summary, the review is possibly more just a rant than anything else -if you don't want to read a lot, I'd encourage you to just stop after the summary\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nPROS: Some nice character design/some enjoyable art.\\n\\n\r\nCONS: Feeble \"plot,\" both content/theme-wise and development-wise. Poorly developed characters - no actual character growth. \\n\\n\r\nIrks: Inconsistency with the art. Overly-similar \"mecha\" themes *which lack meaning and value within DITF*, and so read as shallow copies. Eye-roll worthy theme which I largely found pandering.\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\n     DITF as an anime lacked not only compelling themes, but also a consistent plot, interesting world-building, as well as creativity. Where creativity was applied (character, mecha, and enemy design), it far too often fell short - the exception being 002, whose character design is the only real reason to watch the show. Other designs were, frankly just overly silly, and looked dumb to me - it looked like nick jr animated all of the mecha fights, which is doubly frustrating when the writers are shakily trying to push plot and character motivation forward through those childish looking fights.\\n\r\n    The show watched as if it was being written as a fanfic by a group of middle schoolers', which would make more sense to me given the \"I'm 12, and this is deep\" themes given throughout the show, and which would also explain why the show felt like it was written on the fly each week, or by 50 different people (exemplified by the following two words: \"beach episode?\"). Plot inconsistency could have been reduced with interesting world-building, but the world, too, was underdeveloped, only borrowing heavily from previous mecha shows to form a skeleton of a world to house the dissatisfying plot and themes.\\n\r\n    DITF feels like a slap to the faces of the audience, and seems to lack respect for the audience and their intelligence. It watches like an attempt at combing Neon Genesis Evangelion's thoughtful nature, with Kill la Kill's edgier but fun jab at anime, while lacking both the depth of the first, and the self-awareness and satire of the second, and possibly taking the worst of both. Out of context, this gives the show an insufferably pretentious air. It leaves behind a generally shallow experience that comes off as a romantic drama attempting to give a moralizing lecture to its audience (while placating those interested in mecha action, as you would placate ducks in a pond by tossing stale bread), all the while taking itself far more seriously than it should and delivering nothing compelling in either romance, theme, or action.\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nPRO/CON DISCUSSION:\\n\r\n    The best part of DITF is 002's design. Plain and simple. I could leave it at that, because frankly, whoever designed 002 I think is the metaphorical \"Atlas,\" who has single-handedly allowed for the show to be anything more than average scoring on MAL. 002's design is gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\n    Beyond 002, there are bits and pieces about the animation that are really lovely. Some of the landscape shots are peaceful and attractive. I found myself being intrigued by the hair of some of the female characters, which was drawn in the most lovely way. Some of the lines of the animation were nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\n...Aaand that's unfortunately where reality hits. Once you're over some of the enjoyable art, there's really nothing particularly compelling about this show.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk plot:\\n\r\n      I like the media I consume to have a good, consistent plot. I think I'm fair with suspension of disbelief in fiction (e.g., I'm not going in to a mecha show to critique the reality of the mecha's existence, or the exact physics of an explosion), but I do expect a show to give its audience a certain amount of respect for their intelligence. \\n\r\n     With DITF, I'm surprised I didn't snap my neck from constantly throwing my head back to roll my eyes while watching DITF. Inconvenient character development, world building, and plot/character motivations were far too often abruptly wiped away to make room for new plot direction, sometimes with the convenient hand of Deus Ex Machina, and sometimes with the convenient hand of \"flashbacks.\" \\n\\n\r\nNow you may object, saying, \"flashbacks can be perfectly reasonable as a story telling device!\" And you're right - they can be!! But not with how DITF used flashback - DITF flashbacks watched as if I could literally hear the writers saying \"oh shit - we need a reason to change direction, and we didn't develop any character motivations that support it - lets just insert those motivations in here so that the audience won't notice the character's 180 degree change in actions and behavior, and will think it's excusable!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis gets into the concept of \"show, don't tell\" in plot. Too many moments, too many motivations, too many themes, were literally spoken by the voice actors to give the audience an indication of what was happening, or why a character was behaving in some way. When combined with the inconsistency in the plot, and when used randomly throughout the show, this kind of attempt at a sudden first person narration reads as contrite, as well as more inconsistent and heavy handed rather than thoughtful or purposeful. If the entire show were based around each individual's perception of various situations, I think the show would have overall actually been far more consistent, and possibly better (for one, it would have required a little more soul, or at least motivation development in all of the characters). But, it wasn't used consistently or in any way meaningful to the other half of the plot: the \"post-apocalyptic-world-meets-faceless-Illuminati-overlords\" attempted plot, which was also underdeveloped, and never went beyond a shallow recreation of Neon Genesis Evangelion's Seele council. No really - they never contributed *any* forward momentum to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n     The plot inconsistency feeds into the issue with character development - primarily being that there wasn't any. Characters were *changed* after flashbacks or convenient plot points. Instead of going on a journey where subtle changes may build up, leading to character growth, DITF watches as if you've skimmed through episodes - in one episode, a character may be one way, and in the next episode, they're completely different with no indication that their previous traits or motivations ever existed at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis has gotten far too long, so I'll end by saying that I think the biggest reason DITF has anything above a 6-7 is that it was so hyped as a Trigger animation in particular. When the hype-train is moving at 60 mph, it's harder to feel like you can or should jump off, and it's far easier to continue to be swept away. I recommend going into this show by some form of transportation other than the hype train. In doing so, there will likely be some episodes you enjoy; I find the 002's character early on to be overly tsundere and insufferable, and shallow later on, but a lot of people loved her character in general - you very well may enjoy her character too. You may like some of the world building, even if there's not very much of it. But as a whole, with all of it's pieces, I found it to be underwhelming, and not much worth my time.",

            "content": "For a little while, Franxx really was right on edge of greatness. It really could've been something special, a show that would've become a \"must-watch\" for anime fans. But after a rushed, bizarre final quarter or so, I was tempted to give Franxx a score I'd merely call average. Eventually, I decided that its early success was enough to qualify it as a solid 8.\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story itself was simple enough to start. Boy-girl pairs pilot massive robots to defend the few remaining human colonies against bizarre alien lifeforms that live under the earth. That's how Franxx began and remained throughout much of its run. First6 episodes pretty much stick to this with our protagonist slowly being worn down by his powerful partner, or the flagship pink-haired girl you've probably seen around even if you haven't watched the show, Zero Two. This part of the story was fairly interesting though not anything we haven't really seen before, and probably gets a 7 from me. \\n\\n\r\nThe next 5-6 episodes functioned as a slice of life world/character builder and while some people may have dropped it in this period, I think this risk really paid off. It gave the large cast more individual depth and really brought some questions into the world of Franxx. Yes, it may have bogged down the pacing a bit, but I think the benefits clearly outweighed the cost. These were a good 8. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 12-15 were probably the highlight of the show. You really would feel the emotion and struggles, and sometimes, you'd be touched by how the show was portrayed. These episodes were easy 9/10, probably close to what I'd consider a 10/10 even. But after Franxx's peak here, it slowly deteriorated. \\n\\n\r\nThe next 5 episodes continued to world build a bit, but pacing wise could have been accomplished in maybe 2-4 and just really set up a crunch time-wise. These episodes were a 7, or fairly average. And finally, the last 4 episodes were a mess. The story itself was absurd and totally unexpected, not in a good way, and on top of that, it felt as if they ran out of time. I don't like to criticize the plotline of shows, but I can't help but feel that a less out-there ending would've remedied both the bizarreness as well as the pacing issues. Episodes 21-24 deserve a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nFranxx looked great the majority of the time. Maybe a few battle scenes, especially near the end, were subpar, but the artstyle worked and it was satisfying to watch the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nCatchy opening and ending themes, and nothing bad voicing-wise. Not a ton to criticize here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Hiro, initially drew a lot of comparisons to Shinji, but we saw him develop his own character and overall was a fairly interesting main character. The development he, as well as the female lead Zero Two underwent was well done, not really feeling too rushed, nor did it really feel like they did things \"just for the hell of it\". They acted in character and changed in a good fashion. Franxx earned its 9 here because of how it was able to develop and shine spotlight on almost all of the side characters. Slice of life-esque episodes 7-11 arguably hurt pacing as I mentioned before, but the payoff in helping us see these characters in a different light was well worth it in developing and helping them interact with one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nFranxx, for me personally, was a delight mostly. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 20 episodes, and couldn't wait to see what happened next. I probably enjoyed following Franxx as it aired more than any other show I watched weekly. But with how the ending was handled, there were times when I just shook my head and chuckled at how weird or unexpected it was. I was initially going to give Franxx a 5 or 6 here because of the way they played out the final stretch. But I couldn't bring myself to give a show I enjoyed so much the majority that low a score, and it gets a 7 here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nFranxx is the equivalent of getting consistent A/A- grades on your assignments and then getting a C on the final. It probably deserves a B+, maybe even an A- depending on how much you weigh it, but at the end of the day, it still drags down your grade. With a good ending, Franxx would've been an easy 9, but with the way it stumbled down the final stretch, I couldn't bring myself to give it more than an 8 overall.",

            "content": "After 24 turbulent episodes, and fan backlash at every corner, FranXX bloomed into a beautiful flower of unique creative decisions and cucking. Was Darling in the FranXX worth the hype? Or rather, was it worth people getting so invested in the show that they sent death threats to the producers and seiyuu for FranXX? The answer for both of these questions is no, but at the same time, I think Darling was worth my time. \r\nI guess what I should say about FranXX is that there are two perspectives most people have about the show, the first is that the early episodes of FranXX werethe best and later in the series, the show loses its edge. The second school of thought is that the early episodes of FranXX were trash and the further on in the series we went, the better it became. Personally, I think FranXX was at it\u2019s best when it stopped emulating Evangelion and formed it\u2019s own identity that was heavily influenced by Diebuster. The problem with FranXX is that it isn\u2019t actually saying anything about relationships, it is as shallow as a puddle, and how the early episodes covered that fact up was by using obscene amounts of symbolism as to give off the appearance of being smart or deep. When I was watching the first 7 episodes or so, I kept asking myself, why is this so difficult to watch? Why does it take itself so seriously when in reality it is saying nothing at all? Why is this written with the same nuance and subtlety as BnHA? But my opinions on the show changed when Mitsuru cucked Futoshi, and took Kokoro from her. At this point in the series, most of the side characters had no interesting character motivations or traits; but when Kokoro cucked Futoshi so that she could pilot a FranXX with Mitsuru, I saw something that I have never seen in anime before. I have never seen a rejection in anime quite like that, it was pretty interesting. What compelled me even more after that point was that it was revealed that Mitsuru had a grudge against Hiro as a kid because he was questioning his sexuality when he was like 10 and wanted to pilot with Hiro despite both of them being male. I think this is good writing because it implies to things, first and foremost, Mitsuru is a bisexual, and secondly, his grudge against Hiro was in actuality a personification of Mitsuru\u2019s deep seated self-loathing over the fact that he is a bisexual. FranXX reforms every character\u2019s initial unlikeable personality into very likable characters; I heard quite a lot of complaints when reading FranXX reviews that the show had unlikeable characters, this is true but the audience is never given reason to like any one of those characters until they reform. We aren\u2019t supposed to like 02 until episode 15 or so because she has been manipulative and duplicitous for the entirety of the show up to that point. We aren\u2019t supposed to like Ichigo until she accepts that she will never be what Hiro wants romantically.\\n\\n\r\nFranXX is about self-loathing, Futoshi hates himself because he is fat, Mitsuru and Ikuno hate themselves because they have non-heteronormative sexualities, Zero Two hates herself because she was born different, Ichigo and Goro hates themselves because they feel that they are not special. Kokoro hates herself because she believes that she won\u2019t leave anything behind for future generations. Hiro hates himself because he has to rely on others to survive. Virm is supposed to represent the loss of these identities, and the message of the show is about embracing one\u2019s flaws and  moving forward in life. This is by no means a deep message, but it is one that flew over a lot of people\u2019s heads; Most people think that FranXX is about the power of friendship/love, or some dumb shit like that. But in reality it is about understanding those around you, the reason that Hiro becomes more dinosaur the more he pilots a FranXX with Zero Two is because he is becoming more understanding of her as a person. The reason that Zero Two\u2019s final form is reminiscent of  Zero Two in a wedding gown is because it symbolizes that Hiro and Zero Two are in total unison and understand each other completely. A lot of people say that FranXX jumped the shark post episode 19, but I couldn\u2019t agree less, the show has always been building up to this point. There was never a defined logic to the series, and going to space doesn\u2019t really break the logic that series has had up to that point.\\n",

But it's to be expected as it's done by three \\n\r\nstudios and one of them is TRIGGER.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6.5\\n\\n\r\nIt had some good, some bad tracks. But it had really good impact on me in some emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\\n\r\nZero two is best girl..\\n\r\nHiro is too dense (there is a reason though)..\\n\r\nIchigo is a great character till episode 15 (her personality completely  changes)..\\n\r\nGoro is best BRO..\\n\r\nAnd the other pairs were precious..\\n\r\n(fuck futoshi)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I said above I had pure fun with the series giving an 8/10 but cause I watched it weekly the fan reactions and the memes gained +1 (at least for me)..\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6.8\\n\\n\r\nThe series had it's moments but it also had a disastrous finale \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it way more than I should have.. I am kinda happy about that cause I watch anime for fun..\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to take it seriously well then it's not for you and you also missed the best weekly watch you could have ever asked for ..\\n\\n\r\nIt's not interesting and illogical sometimes but if you can handle that it had it's moments (because of which it got famous), so yeah that's about it..\\n\\n\r\nThanks   \\n",

            "content": "So what should I tell you. This anime actually starts and looks like really good anime. Everything is new and you are just exploring the story, trying to understand everything. Well the anime itself has really interesting story but it's way to slow. So the guys, which did review before me (when they wrote down the reviews somewhere to 6th episode) are really right just to one thing but I won't to spoil anything!\r\nMain character is a kind boy. He is trying to stand against his destiny, because he is kinda... useless. He doesn't possess the ability to fight with his friends, or he does,but he cannot release it (well it's not really on him, cuz they are fighting in pairs and his \"partner\" has to help him to release the ability). One day our famous pink-haired girl appears. She is known as \"partner killer\" because no one could fight with her more like 3 times, they just died. But this girl actually can fully release the ability of our main character. And after this event (which is actually still ep 1 I think) everything is SO SLOW! \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, they are just fighting toghether again, again, again and again. Yes, of course they are fighting against different enemies, in different terms and sometimes but the story actually stands. These fights are being crossed with episodes that shows us \"the normal day\" of main character and his group (or team if ya want).\\n\\n\r\nBUT I HAVE TO SAY! The story looks really easy to understand and it looks it's just some normal \"little trashy\" anime BUT the truth is... There is so much happening in background and you just have to focus on it. I saw every episode up today (ep 13) and I am now so hyped to ep 14, because the plot twists are just falling down and I am honest right now boys and girls, the whole anime I just watched (until now) just flashbacked in my head. Because these plot twists just absolutely turn upside down every feel I had about everything and I am actually full of questions like: \\n\r\nWHO THE **** IS THOSE *** dont' wonna spoil*** ?!!\\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this goddamn world?!\\n\r\netc... \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAnime is really good and it looks really simple but the truth is that this anime puts in your head so many questions just thanks to that little details you'll see in background of this show. The animation is actually really good, nothing fancy or crazy CGI like new Tokyo Ghoul:re has but it is really good for this story. It can be soooooo much emotional (I just cried I'll be honest, that's why I am writing this essay). Sound is actually good too guess the opening could be better, it's not really my style. Characters are interesting, each of them has some backstory. Main character is kind and he is trying to help everyone if he can. \\n\\n\r\nWarning:\\n\r\nAfter few episodes you can feel a little... well... how this world looks so nice but in depth it's so wrong. You will have plenty of questions. You can be shocked what happens in some episodes (because those twists are just hopping in without any notice. It's just 'something happening .... BOOM! TWIST! and you are like 'WHAT?!!').\\n\\n\r\nHope this messy text helps you out! Oh yeah and it's actually Action, Love story with great and original world (in my opinion).\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: this review is for my own personal use only. i've noticed after a while, i forget why i rated a show highly or poorly, so i'm going to write reviews after completing each series so i can reference them in the future.\r\n~~~\r\noh my. what a fucking ride this has been. this show had so much promise, but ended in such an awful and terrible way. i want to rate it highly because the beginning was so expertly done, but the end was just so garbage that i think i have to peg down the rating all the way down. like always, i guess i\u2019lljust vomit on the page with all my thoughts in no particular rhyme or reason\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\ni\u2019ll start off with all the little things i liked about the show. for one, i absolutely LOVED the use of negative space. it made the show feel unique and gave it a pretty stylized feel to it. it was pretty jarring, but in a good way. it sort of made you wake up and really pay attention to what was happening. a lot of times it was more than just to emphasize a scene. sometimes it augmented a scene, like transition from widescreen to fullscreen to mimic an eye opening as hiro confronts some sort of realization. sometimes it\u2019s used to play with perspective. like in this scene [https://i.imgur.com/D45tV0J.gifv], negative space is used to switch up the placement of kokoro and mitsuru showing that they are looking passed each other, further emphasizing their disconnect. this use of negative space is by far my most favorite thing of the show\\n\\n\r\ndarling in the franxx also constructed some scenes extremely well, paying very close attention to how they wanted it structured. for instance, this scene [https://i.imgur.com/G4G0w8O.png] shows hiro\u2019s side very cluttered with naomi\u2019s side more open. those two big pillars on the left symbolize how hiro is trapped by his failure to become a franxx pilot. naomi is positioned on the right facing backward showing that she\u2019s at the end of the line (even though it\u2019s later revealed that she doesn\u2019t die), while hiro is the exact opposite. darlifra had a ton of other scenes like this and it\u2019s blatantly obvious. but these kind of shots die down as the show continued.\\n\\n\r\nspeaking of symbolism, darling in the franxx had a bajillion. everywhere you looked there was some sort of symbolism or metaphor or parallel. it\u2019s unbelievable how much they were able to fit. and they really beat you over the head with some of them. like the male vs. female symbolism. all the guys\u2019 uniforms had an upside down Y on them representing the Y chromosome while also making it look like a penis and balls. the girls had an X on them, also representing their chromosome. made more apparent toward the end, the red and blue color schemes each represented the characters sex (like how hiro had blue horns, but 02 had red ones).\\n\\n\r\nthe show also beat you over the head with its sex metaphors. a lot of scenes of the cockpit of the franxx bots were framed to make it look like the guys were banging the girls doggy style. the male pilots were also called stamens (the male sex organs of plants) while the female pilots were called pistils (the female sex organs of plants) and the stamens \u201cmounted\u201d the pistils.\\n\\n\r\ndarling in the franxx also had a lot of really small symbols and metaphors that were harder to catch. a majority of it either went over my head or i just got too lazy to research them. this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6GPp3CzZVo] goes into great detail about a lot of them. i respect the show for putting so much effort into all these literary devices (are they still literary if it\u2019s a film?) and really shows how much thought and care they put into the show (at least the first half). i think it adds more to the show and only serves to deepen the experience and it by no means ever detriments the show.\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\ni guess i\u2019ll talk about some of the bigger stuff now like world building. i think this world was masterfully crafted (up until a certain point). but i\u2019m a bit biased because i\u2019m a sucker for the whole dystopian future, especially when people just \u201cdisappear\u201d but no one really pays too close attention to it. i love the unfolding of this mystery. who are these kids? why do they live in seclusion? why are they forced to be the warriors? etc etc. and i think they way they tell us a lot of the information of the world is the best way to do it. it\u2019s oversaid, but they \u201cshow not tell\u201d. we don\u2019t get the background and history of the world shoved down our throats via dialogue. instead, we\u2019re thrown into this world and shown everything we need to know. things like how the world is just one big desert implies the world is dead and the plantations are the only human inhabitable places. the clothing designs (especially the adults\u2019 clothes) imply wealth and power. etc. the best part of it all, is that it feels real. i\u2019ve said this before, but it feels like it lives and breathes instead of existing solely for the purpose of the story. this is hard for me to explain but when world-building elements are only used or appear solely because it\u2019s related to the story, the world starts to feel less real and more artificial. for instance, i think re:zero\u2019s world feels very artificial. all the parts that make the world what it is are only shown to us when it affects the main character or the story. the crazy cult only exists because the story needed a villain. the marketplace was only there because the main character needed people to interact with. the city has powerful knights guarding it because the main character needs powerful friends. everything else feels pretty normal. the buildings, clothing, and scenery all look bland and familiar. nothing is put there with the sole purpose of creating depth to the world. compare this to made in abyss (i don't think it had the best world-building, but it has a good example). something as simple and familiar as a classroom is changed. the chairs are arranged vertically along the wall instead of horizontally on the floor. this didn\u2019t serve any real purpose, but to reflect the abyss\u2019 vertical nature and create a more interesting world. that classroom doesn\u2019t even show up ever again. it\u2019s only in one scene, but they still took the effort to make it unique which makes the world feel real. to tie this back into darling in the franxx, a lot of small details are added just to deepen the world. i\u2019ve already talked about the clothing a bit, but they could\u2019ve just given all the adults nice looking clothes that we\u2019re familiar with, but instead they give them these ornate white uniforms. and they don\u2019t even fit into the traditional shirt + pants combo. they\u2019re jumpsuits with a cape, headdress, and a heart attachment. the architecture of the city also added to my immersion. the gold and orange hues covering the city with huge buildings all leading to a huge pillar in the center was breathtaking. again when they could\u2019ve used traditional buildings, they used these ornate buildings instead to accentuate the wealth of the plantations inhabitants.\\n\\n\r\nmoving on to the characters, i thought they were all pretty bland. each of the main cast really falls into the generic group of highschool friends tropes. you\u2019ve got the main character whose character design is always just a blank canvas so that the audience can project themselves onto the character. he\u2019s always got black hair that isn\u2019t too expressive and visually doesn\u2019t have a lot of defining features. you\u2019ve got your childhood best friend who loves the main character, but the main character will never love them. she\u2019s usually kinder and ends up supporting the main character in the end having come to terms with her unrequited love. you\u2019ve got the main love interest who shows up out of nowhere and steals the main character\u2019s heart. she usually acts unconventionally, often being aggressive, and ends up with a super unique design. you\u2019ve got your best guy friend who gets the second most screentime amongst the guys and ends up being a pillar whom the main character can rely on. and then you\u2019ve got your comic relief guy who acts really childish and always reminds me of young naruto. franxx introduce a few more characters into the mix, but they don\u2019t have a lot going on for them. none of them are overly interesting. each character (not miku) gets their own mini-arcs that makes them a little bit less one-dimensional, but they don\u2019t expand on or even mention each character\u2019s internal struggles after they\u2019ve been brought up with the exception of kokoro and mitsuru. i just think when i can describe most of the main cast with two words, then you know your characters aren\u2019t very well fleshed out. and some characters straight up don\u2019t have any character. miku never once shows us anything that worries or motivates her. nothing defines her character. ikuno\u2019s whole thing is that she\u2019s gay, but she\u2019s given such little screentime, i often forget she even exists. even the most main character doesn\u2019t have a lot going on under surface. he\u2019s got a bit more than the rest, but hiro\u2019s only ever motivated by one thing and doesn\u2019t do anything outside of this. at first he strives just to become a franxx pilot and later strives to just be there with zero two. but he doesn\u2019t do anything else other than work toward either goal. he seems almost alien when interacting with his team. if he\u2019s not interacting with zero two, he\u2019s basically a robot. he doesn\u2019t show too much emotion or devotion to his squad. he doesn\u2019t seem to care about anything other than his dino girlfriend. he only becomes emotional and passionate when zero two\u2019s with him which makes his character feel very awkward. zero two is probably the best written character in the whole series. she\u2019s a mystery for a while and has multiple things that drive her. she\u2019s in a constant battle with her inhumanity, has strong desire to kill klaxosaurs, and ultimately wants to meet her darling (who is later revealed to be hiro). we see her balancing these things all the time and sometimes it even bursts out, becoming too much for her to bare.  \\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nwith all that out of the way, i want to talk about the show chronologically because it actually matters. i thought the start of the show was fantastic. the first episode had basically everything i look for in a show\u2019s start. it implies there\u2019s deeper levels to the show, starts it off nice and slow, and gives us a taste for what\u2019s to come. the use of negative space and scene construction as stated above also took me by surprise and pleasantly so. the stunning visuals along with the aformentioned worldbuilding tools really signaled to me that this was going to be a show worth watching. and franxx carries this momentum for a good long time. we\u2019re slowly told things about the universe, unraveling little bits of the mystery. and we get to learn a lot about the main cast and their relationships and situation. we get to see the whole group grow together and become stronger. and while all this is going on, the show slowly gives us all the information we need about the world and the mechanics of this universe. there were a couple parts that irked me, however. the beach episode followed by the gender dispute (where the house gets split into boys and girls sections) left a bad taste in my mouth. it felt really out of place with it\u2019s sudden change in tone and pacing and made the show feel more like a slice of life comedy with minor fanservice. but at the very least these episode are not without purpose. the beach episode shows us some history about the world and serves as the beginning of kokoro\u2019s desire to give birth. and although i think it\u2019s done in a lackluster manner, the gender dispute episode served to strengthen the bonds between the team, especially between kokoro and mitsuru. the episodes that followed also weren\u2019t the best. there\u2019s one dedicated to furthering goro\u2019s character, introducing his unrequited love for ichigo. the next one is about zorome\u2019s character whose problem gets solved by the end of the episode and has no effect on the rest of the series. that episode also does a lot for the world building and history, but feels out of place. this marked the fourth episode in which the plot hasn\u2019t moved at all, so it feels like the show came to a standstill and really started to lose my interest. the show really picks up the pace after that though, showing us more lore, important character interactions (kokoro choosing misturu over futoshi), and zero two\u2019s character development, while all leading up to the cour finale (episode 15) which was absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nat this point i think the show is a solid 9/10 with the possibility to become a 10/10. but that all changed (when the fire nation attacked) right after the cour finale. right after episode 15, the kids learn to live on their own in their destroyed plantation. this goes on for three episodes culminating in the marriage between misturu and kokoro (pregnant). Papa interrupts this marriage because it\u2019s illegal and has their memories wiped. i don\u2019t have too much problem with these episodes. but i do think it destroys the pacing of the show (slowing it to a halt), drastically changing the tone, and really killing the sense of urgency the last episode had. the transition between the cour finale and this mini-arc felt way too abrupt. and these episodes really got me worried that this would be the scond cour\u2019s beach episode+ again. but it\u2019s not that bad. it\u2019s forgiveable and doesn\u2019t change my 9/10. but then we\u2019re given a flashback episode that explains about the history of the world and it starts go downhill. first off, i don\u2019t like whole episodes being devoted to giving us background, but this alone isn\u2019t enough to knock my score down. but what this episode does is progress a plot that completely ruins the show. also as a side note, i think the klaxosaur queen was a stupid idea, but again, if they played their cards right, it wouldn\u2019t affect my score.\\n\\n\r\nlet\u2019s take a look at episode 20, when shit really starts to hit the fan. the whole goal is to have an all out attack against the klaxosaurs so that strelizia can pilot a klaxosaur superweapon. this sounds like a big cop out on its own. and it makes me wonder why the klaxosaurs don\u2019t already have possession of said superweapon and why they haven\u2019t thought about using it. the klaxo queen knows everything about it. but she just let the humans create a huge tunnel leading to the weapon. she even gave them enough time to build equipment and a bigass elevator down there. but then strelizia can\u2019t get in the door, which begs the question, why didn\u2019t the humans test this before hand? they staged this all out attack and now they can\u2019t even use their trump card. like what?? could\u2019ve spent 10 minutes to figure out if this was even possible. anyway, the klaxo queen shows up, smashes zero two, and takes hiro and strelizia hostage. she enters and pilots the superweapon called apus which looks like a giant centaur with a horn. the design looks stupid. but then, OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE, a new enemy shows up. apparently the klaxosaurs existed long before humanity and had a fight with some aliens called the virm. they held off the virm using franxx ships (which may or may not be living) but knew they would return again. so the klaxosaurs hid underground, built apus as a defense weapon, and waited for the virm to return. and for some fucking reason, some klaxosaurs became magma. like what?? hello?? so the klaxos got mad that humanity was mining magma for use as energy. and now that the klaxo queen has apus, she\u2019s going to use it to destroy the virm who are just in space for some reason. and then these purple fucks come out of nowhere and attack everything. so klaxo queen uses apus and finds out it has a virus implanted by the virm and we find out in a twist that the heads of APE are the virm. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK? ALL OF THIS SHIT COMES OUT OF LEFT FIELD? and then just like that the klaxos and humans become friends to fight off aliens from space. SERIOUSLY? WHAT IS GOING ON? IT\u2019S WAY TOO LATE TO BE JUST NOW BE INTRODUCING THIS. nowhere at all during this show has it EVER hinted at any of this. this honestly sounds like a 14 year old kid lost his dad\u2019s script and had to make up the ending himself and this is what we got. \\n\\n\r\nand then they continue this shit into episode 21. some shit happens, but zero two gets to hero in strelizia who is now dead. there\u2019s some heartwarming stuff about how she loves him and that brings him back to life (which is bullshit). zero two pilots apus which then becomes STRELIZIA APUS and gets a makeover which is dumb. she resists the virus implanted by the virm and together with her love for hiro, they blast the fuck outta the virm. this scene was honestly so good. the swell of the music and the yelling really gets me. it gave me chills, teared up my eyes a little bit, and really felt like it wrapped up the show. if this was the ending (which it should\u2019ve been), i probably would\u2019ve given the show an 8/10, maybe a 9/10 if i was feeling generous. BUT THEN THE SHOW JUST KEEPS GOING. HAHA. FUCKING KILL ME. the episode ends with zero two in a decrepit state. i thought she was dead, but she\u2019s not.\\n\\n\r\nfrom here on out, it gets EVEN FUCKING WORSE. episode 22 shows the kids trying to live in this harsh new environment. because for some reason all the fights have stopped. they don\u2019t properly explain it, but literally all the klaxos are being launched into space so the humans have no one to fight i guess. and they just stopped giving a shit about the virm i guess? i don\u2019t really know. it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. zero two is shown to be in a coma and myseteriously gets cuts all over her body. hiro is kind of dead. without zero two he has nothing. kokoro is really pregnant now. there\u2019s some stuff about nina or whatever their caretaker\u2019s name was. but honestly the transition between the last episode and this was so horrible. just abrupt like. everyone was fighting in mechs and then immediately everyone\u2019s just trying to live a normal life. there wasn\u2019t even a title card that read (a few days later) or anything. anyway, it\u2019s revealed that zero two\u2019s consciousness is actually inside of strelizia apus and so hiro decides he has to go to space to meet her. LIKE WHAT? WHY? HOW DID THAT EVEN FUCKING HAPPEN?\\n\\n\r\ngoing into episode 23, we\u2019re given so many fucking coincidences and stupid shit. fuck me. first off, they have go get to space. and just coincidentally there happens to be a \u201cklaxosaur ship, but for some strange reason, [they can] access its internal systems\u201d LIKE WHAT? WHAT A FUCKING COINCIDENCE. ITS OKAY SHOW. DON\u2019T EXPLAIN IT. THAT\u2019S FINE. and i quoted that because it comes straight from the show btw. and then while aboard said ship in space, they said the controls were similar to what they\u2019re used to. LIKE WHY? fuck. also the franxx ships get space upgrades. for no reason. they look different and now adorn all black with alien weapons. and they just explain it with one sentence, \u201cnew space equipment for the franxx\u201d. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK. WHERE DID THIS SHIT EVEN COME FROM? AND WHY?? this is just classic trigger. they ALWAYS have to have some costume change at the end and it always has to end with friendship wins in space. and it honestly doesn\u2019t fit. also we know that the nines can be used as stamens or pistils regardless of gender. but do we ever find out why? no. even though it\u2019s explicitly stated that two of the same gender can\u2019t pilot a franxx and the genders actually matter. but fuck it. this rule doesn\u2019t apply to the nines because we said so. it doesn\u2019t need to make sense. hiro makes it inside strelizia apus and there\u2019s some thing about how zero two doesn\u2019t want him there, but he loves her and love prevails. and then strelizia apus becomes STRELIZIA TRUE APUS because the hero needs an ultimate final form. and the worst part? this gigantic, mountain tall robot SOMEHOW FOR NO EXPLAINABLE REASON HAS ITS BODY CHANGED TO LOOK LIKE ZERO TWO? [https://i.imgur.com/UYffbYY.jpg] LIKE WHAT? HOW IS THIS MACHINE CAPABLE OF CHANGING THE WAY IT LOOKS??????? ALSO. ZERO TWO\u2019S BODY ON EARTH TURNS TO STONE. TO FUCKING STONE. WHY? IT DOESN\u2019T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER. NONE OF THIS DOES. WHAT THE FUCK?????? we then learn that there are some asteroids near mars that are actually satellites that create a wormhole and the plan is for strelizia apus to take a bomb (the klaxo ship that they\u2019ve been piloting) to the virm and blow them up. this is a one way trip. LIKE WHAT? IF THE KLAXO\u2019S PLANNED THIS FROM THE START (which they\u2019d have to). WHY\u2019D THEY MAKE THE WORMHOLE SO FUCKING FAR AWAY??? WHY NOT JUST BUILD IT NEXT TO EARTH???\\n\\n\r\nanyway, time for the finale: episode 24. this is basically an epilogue episode. we see the kids on earth grow up and foster a new generation. they get married, have kids (a ton of fucking kids) and create a new society. meanwhile, hiro and zero two have been traveling in space for YEARS. like why doesn\u2019t the wormhole lead straight to where they\u2019re going? even after going through that wormhole, they still gotta travel for like 3 years. and then they finally get to the virm homeworld or whatever and start their space battle. and when things start getting tough, FOR SOME FUCKING REASON, THE CREW ON EARTH ARE LIKE. I THINK THEY\u2019RE IN TROUBLE. SO THEY ALL HOLD HANDS NEXT TO THE PETRIFIED ZERO TWO BODY AND START SAYING SHIT LIKE WE BELIEVE IN YOU. AND THEN HIRO HEARS THEM???? and then strelizia apus gets a hold of an enemy weapon and THEN THAT WEAPON GETS A MAKEOVER TOO FOR NO REASON. the moment they get a hold of it, it turns from purple to red and white to match strelizia\u2019s color pattern. they take it and ram forward toward the virm homeworld and then let go of it for no reason. like it served no purpose. they didn\u2019t fucking need the thing at all. and then they pick up the bomb to blow up the virm. BUT FOR SOME REASON, STRELIZIA APUS DISINTEGRATES, LEAVING ONLY SMALL STRELIZIA EXCEPT IT\u2019S ALL GOLD NOW FOR SOME REASON. BECAUSE THEY WANTED ANOTHER ULTIMATE FINAL FORM. then the bomb explodes, but the virm aren\u2019t completely destroyed and vow to come back. so i guess there wasn\u2019t a purpose to hiro and zero two\u2019s sacrifice?? and then their souls drift off into space i guess. BUT THEN BACK ON EARTH, ALL THE PEOPLE KNOW THE FIGHT IS DONE. LIKE HOW?????? WHAT THE FUCK? THEY\u2019RE FUCKING MILLIONS OF LIGHTYEARS AWAY, BUT YET YOU ALL KNOW SOMEHOW THAT THEY JUST FINISHED THEIR BATTLE. AND THEN ZERO TWO\u2019S PETRIFIED BODY FUCKING DISAPPEARS AND BECOMES DUST. AND THEN A FUCKING TREE GROWS WHERE THE BODY WAS. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK? IT DOESN\u2019T MAKE AN OUNCE OF SENSE. FUUUUUUUCK. and then in the distant future where mankind is thriving, two kids meet under the tree that grew where zero two\u2019s body became dust who obviously look like hiro and zero two, but younger. AND IT HAS THE GALL TO END THE SHOW WITH A WHITE TITLECARD THAT READS \u201cAND A NEW STORY BEGINS\u201d. fuck those endings. i hate them.\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nthis ending has got to be the worst ending i\u2019ve ever seen in anything. it somehow took the most promising show i\u2019ve seen in a long time and fucking trashed it. at least if a bad show ended poorly, you kind of already know it\u2019s going to happen. but darling in the franxx started off so well and then took the biggest, moistest, steaming pile of shit right on the screen. like fuck man. this is the biggest fucking letdown ever. i think i\u2019ve decided on a 4/10. but honestly, i could see myself rating it lower in the future. i feel like i had to give it some merit for doing so many things so well, but i can\u2019t get over how fucking horrible the end is. i don\u2019t know. this show is definitely lower than a 6/10, but deserves more than 2/10. i don\u2019t really know what to give it.",

            "content": "WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS \u2013 I will not be holding back on spoiling every little detail of this show, so if you haven\u2019t seen the show but want to, then go finish it first. Thank you.\r\nDarling in the Franxx. Where to begin with this utter disappointment of a show? For the most part, this show left me gobsmacked at how stupid it was. I really couldn\u2019t comprehend how STUDIO PROFESSIONALS, who have been doing this stuff for years, could produce such piss-poor garbage. This is probably one of the most headache inducing shows I\u2019ve seen since Sword Art Online, which is saying a lot, because ifyou\u2019ve seen Sword Art Online, you know how abysmal it is. The fact that this show is what is popular and trending in today\u2019s anime community is very concerning, and I fear we will see more lazily written, rubbish anime like this because of how big it\u2019s become. Now, allow me to rant about how much this show upsets and enrages me.\\n\\n\r\nThis show started off pretty great, I won\u2019t lie. I started watching this show at around episode 2 and kept up with it every week until it finished. So, I\u2019ve basically been here since before the hype started rolling in. Starting off, I loved it. I thought the show had a great premise and had so much potential. The setting was an intriguing and mysterious world with many secrets, and the characters all seemed to have something more to them. Though I thought the whole \u2018ass piloting\u2019 thing was stupid, and the mech designs were incredibly weird and whacky, I still generally liked what I had seen. The show felt like a perfect blend of the over the top style of Gurren Lagann and the personal drama of Evangelion, two other mecha shows that clearly heavily influenced Darling in the Franxx. \u201cHow could our beloved studio Trigger do any wrong? They\u2019ve made nothing but great shows in the past\u201d is what I stupidly thought as I watched this show progress more and more. I mean, I loved the other works of Trigger. They worked on Gurren Lagann with Studio Gainax before departing into their own studio, then made other highly enjoyable shows like Little Witch Academia. I kept ignoring all the red flags because I thought \u201cOh, there\u2019s still plenty of episodes to go it\u2019ll fix its problems and get better surely.\u201d Again, I was wrong. Clearly my blind love for Trigger has lead me to nothing but despair, as this show proved to be nothing but disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe first red flag for this show I ignored was episode 7. The whole first story arc of this show, which involved Hiro, the main character, trying his hardest to get permission to pilot with 02, a strange klaxosaur-human hybrid girl, ended at episode 6. Klaxosaurs being the strange tecno-organic shape-shifting creatures the characters fight in their mechs through the whole series. Episode 7 was the, well, \u201cfan service\u201d episode. It was the episode where all the characters go to the beach. How generic. Yet, I let it slide because there was some (very minor) world building. After all, it\u2019s episode 7, there\u2019s still way more to go, right? Then came episode 8, which is an episode I can\u2019t forget because it nearly made me drop this show. It\u2019s an episode where the boys accidentally see the girls nude, which leads the girls to act immature and draw a huge line in the middle of the ground that the boys can\u2019t cross. This episode offered absolutely nothing to the show what so ever and was nothing short of filler. Not even the minor world building episode 7 had. In the end of the episode they learn they have to get along or else bad things could happen. That\u2019s all that happens. It\u2019s incredibly stupid and was an utter waste of an episode slot and was the biggest red flag that was to come, yet I forced myself to keep watching after that anyway. Once more, I thought \u201cTrigger can do no wrong.\u201d Yet, they did do wrong. The whole of the show proved to be nothing but a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is pathetic. The fact that they dedicated entire episodes to fleshing out some of the main cast only for me to still not care about them at all proves how poorly written it is. All of their backstories, and I mean ALL of them, are basically the same. \u201cBlah blah blah, something in their childhood.\u201d This whole childhood thing started off pretty reasonable, until it became the source of each character\u2019s motivations, which then it started coming off as a very poor, lazy plot device. The only characters whose backstories were actually engaging at all was 02\u2019s and Hiro\u2019s, but even then, I still couldn\u2019t care less about either of them. I believe the first \u2018character development\u2019 episode was episode 9, which centred on Goro. One of the more central male characters in the main cast. It was revealed he\u2019s in love with Ichigo, a girl who\u2019s the leader of the squad and who is also his partner, because, well, \u2018something to do with their childhood\u2019. Mitsuru, another boy in the squad, who was once close to Hiro, is mad at him because he\u2019s forgotten a promise they made when they were younger, which again, happened in their childhood. Ikuno, a girl in this squad, also confesses her love for Ichigo, which, you guessed it, is because of \u2018something in their childhood\u2019. The show has the balls to have a lesbian (or at least bisexual) character, but then also just forgets about it. The whole \u2018childhood\u2019 plot device becomes redundant VERY fast. Not to mention, it doesn\u2019t even really matter because these events are never referred to again. Ikuno and Goro\u2019s love for Ichigo is never mentioned again, Mitsuru\u2019s friendship with Hiro is never mentioned again, etc, etc. There\u2019s even a \u201cchubby\u201d character in the show, a boy named Futoshi, who is shown to have an eating disorder, as he has bulimia. Then it\u2019s never mentioned again. They basically make all this drama and just forget about it. Most of the show is teen drama, which becomes annoying very quickly as well. The show loses sight of itself and becomes directionless at this point. It becomes full of characters who are all in love with each other \u2018because reasons\u2019, it becomes full of teenagers crying and being emotional, and the worst part is I didn\u2019t care. To contrast with another show, Evangelion\u2019s characters have certain depth to them, they all feel real and relatable with their struggles, hell even the side characters are memorable in that show. Yet here, I\u2019m struggling to even remember the main characters. Hiro, who is the main character, doesn\u2019t have any depth or any real reason to care about him. He lacks any kind of real personality other than the fact he just loves 02. 02 in her own right is not interesting either, she just wants her \u2018darling\u2019 and goes berserk when she can\u2019t have him. That\u2019s all there really is to those characters. Hiro and 02 just succeed in everything they do \u2018because reasons\u2019. The love plots are pathetic, the teen drama is pathetic, it\u2019s all really pathetic. At some point Mitsuru, and a girl in their squad named Kokoro, get married, and that was just dumb. Then Kokoro has a baby with him in the last episode. Ugh. Again, Hiro is the main character, he\u2019s meant to be interesting and we\u2019re meant to root for him when he succeeds, but instead we sit there feeling nothing at all. Let\u2019s compare this to Simon of Gurren Lagann, a main character who\u2019s generally similar to Hiro in concept. We watch Simon go from zero to hero. He starts off as a scared nobody who, over the course of the entire series, grows a lot and completely changes as a person, becoming a badass, brave hero that we all love and root for. He shows that with enough confidence you can become anyone you want to be, that you, too, can go from zero to hero. While here, we have Hiro. A character that doesn\u2019t really change or develop at all over the course of 24 episodes. He starts off as a depressed loner who wants someone to pilot with, to someone who is allowed to pilot. That\u2019s kind of it. Yeah, he loves 02, but the whole love plot between the two feels unauthentic. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re teenagers, but still, that\u2019s beside the point. Hiro doesn\u2019t really develop or \u2018change\u2019 at all. He\u2019s just the same the entire series. From the beginning he clung to 02 because that\u2019s all he has. In the end, he\u2019s still clinging to 02. As I said before, his personality is nothing but the fact that he loves 02. We don\u2019t feel excited or feel emotional over Hiro, as we might do with Simon of Gurren Lagann, we just see nothing but an extremely tropey main character who spends the entire series just chasing after 02 blindly. This is why he\u2019s a garbage main character. This is why all the characters are just written poorly.\\n\\n\r\nThe action. It\u2019s crap. There\u2019s no real impact or \u201coomph\u201d to the action; it all feels very plain and generic. Watching Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers movies would be more satisfying than the action in this show. The fight scenes are insanely forgettable and they aren\u2019t exciting to watch at all. The mechs feel like they have absolutely no weight to them and the enemies they face aren\u2019t threatening at all, and the action just isn\u2019t enjoyable or exciting. Again, I will contrast this with Evangelion, more specifically The End of Evangelion. In this film, there is a fight scene with Asuka in her mech fighting off a massive swarm of enemies. This is one of my favourite action scenes in any anime, because there\u2019s so much weight and realism to it. Asuka lifts a large sword in her mech, and you can really see her struggle to contain the sheer weight of it. When she swings at an enemy, you can really see how heavily it impacts them. It\u2019s so brilliant to watch and you can really feel the sheer weight of the mechs and the impact of their attacks. Darling in the Franxx lacks this, all the mechs feel like plastic toys and the action doesn\u2019t have any impact like that at all. You don\u2019t feel the weight of the mechs, you don\u2019t feel the impact of the attacks, you just feel nothing. It\u2019s completely missing what makes action so fun to watch; the struggle and ambition to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s visuals are nothing worth mentioning either. There isn\u2019t any atmosphere and the art style isn\u2019t particularly special. I didn\u2019t feel engaged in the world or interested in it at all. The world building, for the most part, doesn\u2019t amount to anything. The world comes off as bland and boring. Even when the characters go to space it looks boring. In a lot of anime shows that involve space, like for instance we will say the anime short film Voices of a Distant Star, they made space look beautiful and breath taking, while in Darling in the Franxx it just looks so lifeless and bland. The character designs are \u201cmeh\u201d and the mech designs are just goofy and dumb. Visually, this show is nothing special at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is terrible. Genuinely terrible. As I\u2019ve said, most of the show is teen drama. Then it seems the writers completely forgot that they were writing an actual story and shoved the ENTIRE plot into the last 5 episodes. Episode 19 is a big backstory episode, which is basically a carbon copy of Evangelion\u2019s backstory episode, even going as far as to say the mechs are made from klaxosaurs (sound familiar?) and in the span of 3 episodes later, literally 3 god damn episodes, a new enemy has arrived, some alien force named VIRM, which the show never hinted at or built up to at all what so ever, just randomly shows up, then one episode later tons of characters have died and a massive fight happened, then one episode later 02 has turned into a GIANT ROBOT GIRL HYBRID, I can\u2019t even make this up if I tried to. Words can not explain how shocked I was at how pitifully stupid it was, my jaw was on the floor in thinking that a professional writer could actually come up with this crap. Lots of characters die yet you don\u2019t care of feel anything for them, they might as well not even be in the show. There was just nothing. The plot is convoluted as all hell, and I don\u2019t care nearly enough to try and unravel everything about it. I really just don\u2019t care, I\u2019m completely apathetic to anything in this show. The ending to the story was also incredibly rushed and at least 6 or 7 episodes worth of events transpired in the one final episode. There\u2019s literally an 8-year time skip in the final episode on its own. It was more rushed than any other ending I\u2019ve ever seen to a show, and so much was forced. Just nothing more than a dumb ending to a dumb show, it honestly isn\u2019t even worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t even have its own identity. As if everything else I talked about wasn\u2019t enough of a problem. It straight up just steals elements from the likes of Evangelion, Gurren Lagann, Diebuster/Gunbuster, etc. The show makes references to these shows a lot in hopes that people will think it\u2019s \u2018cool\u2019 and \u2018hip\u2019, to distract from the fact that the show itself is garbage. Hell, the backstory episode, which is episode 19, straight up just steals from Evangelion\u2019s backstory episode, even going as far as to say the mech\u2019s are made from klaxosaurs, just like the Evas being made from Angels, as I mentioned before. It doesn\u2019t contribute anything to the story, it\u2019s just a \u201cle epic reference xd\u201d. People speculate 02 turning into a giant girl-robot hybrid is some kind of reference to Diebuster, and the list goes on. I\u2019m not saying the show can\u2019t make references, but the fact that these \u2018references\u2019 seem more like just stealing elements from other shows because it doesn\u2019t have its own ideas and tries to convince the viewers to like it because it references some of their favourite anime. It really does feel like the show doesn\u2019t have its own identity, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s relying on people\u2019s love of other shows to mask the fact it\u2019s complete garbage and to try and get positive recognition. When in reality it\u2019s basically just copying them because it\u2019s too afraid to be its own thing. Some would say this is a problem with a lot of anime in today\u2019s world, that they just keep relying on referencing iconic shows to get positive reception and to mask the fact that they just don\u2019t have any original ideas, and for the most part it seems true.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a show that started off really solid, and quickly ruined itself. Poor action, mediocre visuals, stupidly convoluted plot, piss-poor characters with piss-poor development, the show not even really having its own identity, annoying teen drama, just to name a few. Simply put, it\u2019s just bad. I give it a 2 purely because it started off good, even though it quickly became an insult to anyone who watched it. Not only that, but also a straight up insult to itself, its own plot and characters, just everything. The ending was insanely rushed and really was the final slap in the face to anyone who watched that far. This show feels like an insult over all. I can\u2019t really name anything redeeming about this show and I absolutely cannot recommend it to anyone. That\u2019s honestly all I have to say about it. Thank you for reading this behemoth of a review and have a good day.\\n",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers. Read at your own risk.*\r\nDarling in the Franxx (DitF) is certainly a ride - and I have rarely felt so ambivalent towards a show. It's a sad example for a show that could have been good if it had better writing and more time (even though it already had 24 episodes). DitF has a quite good start with a strong metaphor already in the first few seconds. We are introduced to the characters and the setting and theres a really good, gloomy atmosphere surrounding everything. But as the episodes progress, it all goes downhill.\r\nThere are many things happening in DitF -we got things like APE, the Nines, Garden, Plantations, Klaxosaurs, Franxx, VIRM and the development of the characters relationships. It's a huge task to have such a complex plot fit into a 24 episode show and as we can see with DitF: It just doesn't work. Subplot after subplot is stacked onto another and the outcome is a huge clusterfuck of events that aren't connected well and some could even be called useless. The best example there are probably the Nines: They are introduced as antagonists, little to nothing is revealed about them (except what they are) and then suddenly they are supporting our heroes and sacrifice themselves. They added nothing of value to this show and frankly: Neither did APE besides being a plot device for the shows narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building is also lackluster or should I say: It's absent at all. We have a dystopic world, gigantic beasts that are attacking humans, shouldn't there be a need to explain why everything came to be how it is? The only time we are ever given explanation is in episode 19 when most of the story is already over. And episode 19 is really the only episode that gives us information in the form of an infodump. There is no progressive world-building and for the major part of the series, we are thrown into a setting that is never fully explored.\\n\\n\r\nDragging through the the show is the focus on the individual problems of our Plantation 13 children as well as their common backstory with their time at \"Garden\". We see Hiro giving the other children Names and we see them undergoing a harsh \"education\" to eventually later become capable Franxx pilots. This is the minimum amount of backstory one can have and I consider it far from \"fleshed out\", but I guess the minimum amount is better than nothing ... On the other side in the present we have a focus on their life now: Ichigo being in a one sided love with Hiro, Futoshi being in a one sided love with Kokoro, Mitsuru having his inferiority complex because of Hiro, Miku going apeshit because boys are perverts, so of course there's no better idea than to split the dorm so boys and girls don't interfere with each other. You shouldn't expect major themes and to be honest: Most of the problems DitF takes on is just a bunch of melodrama. \"I'm in love with you because you gave me a name.\", \"I want to be with you forever\". There are a lot of unnecessary conflicts and cheesy lines and character development is only really noticable with Zero Two, Mitsuru and Kokoro (I get to those 3 later on when I talk about the positive things). Miku, Zorome, Futoshi and Ikuno are pretty much just plot devices because aside from their common backstory with the other kids from Plantation 13, we never learn anything about them and their importance for the overall course of the story is little to none.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"villains\" in this show are bad. And I don't mean just APE, it's also the Klaxosaur Princess, VIRM and the Nines. Klaxohime could have had some motives when you think about that humans were stealing magma energy and later on attacking the Klaxo Sapiens, but not much else is ever explained about her and she suddenly just joins Hiros side and sacrifices herself for him. APE lacks any motive whatsoever and the same goes for VIRM. The introduction of VIRM was especially bad because it introduced another element to the world that is severly underdeveloped and even in the last episode the conflict with VIRM is not getting resolved.\\n\\n\r\nLast but no least: DitF is filled with logic errors. These range from small to critical. To give you some examples:\\n\\n\r\n- When Hiro tells Ichigo about the concept of \"kissing\", Ichigo is confused because she doesn't know what kissing is. Yet she kisses him so passionate as if the only thing she ever practiced was kissing. If she never had kissed before, it should have been way more awkward\\n\r\n- Why are the girls uncomfortable if boys see them naked? Take into account the setting of DitF: Children grew up without the concept of sexuality, so they should not be able to judge the girls bodies from a sexual point of view\\n\r\n- Near the end of show, Kokoro is piloting a Franxx together with Mitsuru. At that time she is already pregnant (though she doesn't know it yet). Later, her pregnancy is revealed and the new Nana tells her that pregnant women can't pilot a Franxx, even though Kokoro did it just an episode earlier\\n\r\n- Ichigo piloting a Franxx alone, even though it needs a boy/girl pair ...\\n\r\n- Why did APE only wipe out Kokoros and Mitsurus memories and not those of the other children?\\n\\n\r\nI could go on with this list, but I think my point is clear. The authors haven't thought enough about the integrity of elements and events happening in this show and it becomes obvious if you take a closer look.\\n\\n\r\nNow, why would anyone want to watch DitF? This show has 2 love stories going on at the same time, both of which were well done, although I'm especially fond of Mitsuru and Kokoro.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuru starts out as your typical rival with an ill-willed attitude towards Hiro that gets worse because Hiro piloted Strelizia together with Zero Two. But later on he starts to bond with Kokoro during their regular talks in the green house (after he more or less saved her life in the abandoned city, where Kokoro was nearly crushed) and starts to undergo a fantastic development, overcoming his problems with Hiro and developing a mature and kind personality with Kokoro at his side. Kokoro starts out as a kind and optimistic girl and feels herself more attracted to Mitsuru as the show progresses. Over the course of the story, she makes the transition to a caring and loving mother.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro received a lot of hate from fans who called her sex-hungry and found her determination to have a baby creepy, but again take into account the setting of DitF: It's been hundred years since the last time a child was born from a human. Kokoro, a young girl in puberty of course has still her maternal instincts but is not able to put them into action or even words because she doesn't know about the concepts of sex or pregnancy. After she finds a book that tells her about these topics, she now is able to put her subconcious wish into words and develops the determination to have a baby in order to feel emotionally fulfilled. Kokoro is anything but a slut or thirsty - she just has the pure and innocent wish to have an intimate relationship with a boy and have a baby. It's also not weird that she is physically just 15 or 16 years old: In the world of DitF there is no legal age so we can't compare it to real life standards. And regarding her \"betrayal\" of Futoshi: It was just a simple promise. At least she is honest about her feelings beforehand instead of cheating on him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Mitsurus and Kokoros memories are wiped by APE we have a gut punch when both state they cannot imagine falling in love with each other. However, we see both unite again when they learn that Kokoro is pregnant, showing that true love finds its way no matter what. Mitsurus devotion towards Kokoro and her unborn child was just beautifully shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe birth of Ai is an especially powerful scene and one of the best (and my personal favorite) from the entire show because it just shows Mitsuru and Kokoro overcome with joy after all the hardships they have faced during their time as Franxx pilots. In that sense, we really got to see Mitsurus and Kokoros love flourish. They become even more affectionate after their daughter is born and Kokoro becomes a caring mother for her. Mitsurus and Kokoros relationship is the only one in the show that feels at least a bit mature, because they go far beyond the simple love confession (and even though they aren't shown to have sex, we got a nice \"morning after\" scene).\\n\\n\r\nHiro and Zero Two at first have a strange relationship. Zero Two just kinda spawns out of thin air and calls Hiro her \"darling\" but until episode 13 we have no clue where this attraction comes from. It's first in this episode that we finally learn about their backstory and in turn that they both have once met as children but had their memories wiped. This is the only backstory in the entire show that was done well and acts as a great catalyst for the story. Hiro re-develops his love for Zero Two and wants to change the world for the better so he can live with her.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two at first has a twisted view of love and is hard to read. She is cruel, selfish and cold, yet at the same time she seems to really like Hiro but is also realistic about everyones fate as Franxx pilots and that everyone is probably going to die anyway. Especially her relationship to the other children of Plantation 13 is complicated: They all see her as the partner killer and struggle to get along with her, with Ichigo even going violent and trying to separate her from Hiro. It's first during the second half of the show that she begins to change: After Hiro gets his memories back, Zero Two learns more of the true form of love and begins to change from a selfish to a selfless and more sociable person.\\n\\n\r\nHiro and Zero Two are a good pairing because they have backstory to them and they both fight for a better life together. What hits us hard is the last episode: Hiro and Zero Two sacrifice themselves during their fight against VIRM, just so the other children of Plantation 13 can live in peace. The final scene is sure emotional, considering everything they went through, but at the same time it gives us hope. It shows that the cycle of life doesn't end with death and that Hiro and Zero Two are able to be together in their next life.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode was bad and good at the same time. It gave us a bittersweet ending for Hiro and Zero Two and a fantastic ending for Mitsuru and Kokoro but otherwise it was desastrous. The VIRM and Klaxosaur conflict wasn't resolved and the other children from Plantation 13 were just paired up with someone to force a happy ending. Ichigo ending up together with Goro came out of nothing and there was no proper buildup (such as a moment where Ichigo realized she is more attracted to Goro than Hiro), Futoshi just ended up with a random person we never even saw before and Ikuno has an implied relationship with Naomi, also with no proper buildup. It's also funny how literally everyone in the last episode is pregnant. Someone wants to tell us to make more babies ...\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nI was captivated by DitF during the first few episodes but my enjoyment started to subside when all the flaws became more obvious. I think DitF tried to be too much. It took inspiration from TTGL and NGE but it became a fucked up mix of elements from both of these shows. Especially with all the logic errors occuring, I cannot call DitF \"good\" as a whole. I really liked HiroTwos and MitsuKokos love stories but they alone are not enough to balance out the severe flaws this show otherwise has.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on what you liked about DitF I can recommend you some other shows you might like: Eureka Seven (love story with a lot of mecha-action and way more world building), Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (thrilling mecha/action/comedy show that goes insane), Neon Genesis Evangelion (similar setting, character-focused drama).\\n\\n\r\n3.5/10",

            "content": "People have two different perspectives about this show : \r\n- The failed new Evangelion with a pinch of [Enter Mecha anime name here] with a major disappointment due to the advertising preceding its release \r\n- The rebirth of the Earth through the eyes of self-growing children \r\nObviously I loved this show, the first episodes were a kick, and I thought like everyone else that it would take the same road as other Mecha anime with a high political influence ( Aldnoah Zero / Code Geass ). Then it was vague, I was lost after the action was done. The characters started to look dull andnot important compared to the side ones. \\n\\n\r\nBUT, the real story being unraveled at episode 19 ( Which a lot of people saying that there was no explanation to what happened before apparently missed ), it made a lot of sense. The anime is about uneducated children discovering the world as it is, they discover emotions, justice and life while being held in leash by \" Papa \" and brainwashed superiors. They fight for their freedom, for what they think is good and make mistakes from which they keep learning. Their development is incredible and very pleasant to watch, everything is put on their path, yet they keep growing. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is scored low because it's mistook for a post-apocalyptical mecha-fighting anime with deep emotions. Of course they would fail on that point, because this is absolutely not what it is about.\\n\\n\r\nNow that everything has been cleared out regarding the overall opinion everyone has over DiTF, let me brievly explain my scores \\n\\n\r\nStory : 9 - Two characters bounded together find each other back through lost memories to become the savior of humanity and every other living form on Earth. Experimental children created by the actual enemy to fight an unknown ally, a three-way party revealing their trump card one after the other to shake the storyline. What else did we need ? It missed the 10 because of the few time spent on \" How does that giant living Mecha work ? \" \\n\\n\r\nArt : 8 - While the characters look quite good, the fighting part is not as bright \\n\\n\r\nSound : 7 - I was expecting a Kimi no Uso ending with a beautiful song spread through the discovery of what earth became. But the overall sound was not as kicking as other emotional anime I've watched so far \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10 - Nothing to say, every character grows on his own and discover different emotions and experience compared to the rest of Squad 13. Outshining the other brainwashed contestants and giving every viewer a character to relate to, this was simply brilliant and I shared a  many emotions with each of them. The villains were expected but their true nature wasn't, while the scientists and other side characters also had an interesting tale to tell. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9 - Laugh, Joy, Love, Cries .. All I needed \\n\\n\r\nWhich makes 8,6 on overall. A well-deserved 9 in my opinion",

            "content": "\"Much like Death Note, a 25 episodes series in the eyes of any reasonable anime watcher, it is likely that this anime will end up crashing after a while. Until that, sit back and enjoy.\" Being right sucks.\r\nIn the current anime medium, using mechas is a surefire way to make people compare your series to Evangelion.  Heck, the producers of Darling in the Franxx made sure to connect their series to Evangelion to generate hype and interest. Boy, it backfired.\r\nFrom death threats to dedicated trolls, this series was constantly plagued by a level of hate even SAO started to envy. I wasn't so investedin anime when SAO came out but I expect that a lot of people felt like I fell now - completely lost and confused about the burning hate some people have for a simple series.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx ended up being a cultural phenomenon more than anything, reminding us once again that every community has an overwhelming amount of toxic\\n\\n\r\nNow that I finished this rant, I want to start this review by saying that Darling in the Franxx is NOT like Evangelion. Both series use symbolism to convey some pseudo-intellectual philosophy, the hedgehog dilemma - how we end up hurting people closest to us - in Evangelion and some very pure (or actually immature) view of romance in Darling in the Franxx. I fail to see how the series are similar, but hey, what do I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is primarily a coming of age story following a group of teens going through puberty, putting up with temperament changes and overall enjoying their youth - with a twist. In this post-apocalyptic world, they're child soldiers protecting \"the adults\" and an evasive \"Papa\" that acts as a god/father figure. They're given little to no backstory as characters because, shockingly, they have none. Turns out you don't put too much effort in the childhood of someone brought up to be child soldier. Nevertheless, the cast leads, Hiro (a play on hero) and Zero Two ( a play on o ni - demon) are given a pretty satisfactory backstory that is indeed very cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the series is extremely childish. It's full of sex jokes and sexual innuendo - something that goes completely over the children's heads, everything seems happy and there's a light aura of mystery which slowly reveals the actual brutality of the plot. A lot of people started judging the series here, complaining about fan service and saying that the series is a steaming pile of manure. I believe they failed to understand that all this was done on purpose, the aim of this introduction being to show that they're oblivious children with no idea about the world.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of hate, and by a lot I mean an incomprehensible amount (just check the forums), was generated because of the way the mechas (dubbed Franxx) are piloted. Male-female pairs called stamen and pistil (a play on flower sex organs) sitting in a position similar to the sex move \"doggystyle\". Now I have no god damn clue why someone thought it's a good idea, but I must agree it was pretty funny. Unfortunately, many people took this to mean that it symbolises sex and that riding with a different partner is basically cheating. Many people were outraged and the anime started getting called \"Cuck in the Franxx\". I'm honestly sad for everyone involved in this idiocy, but I guess it is their way to come to terms with their own sex lives *cough* *cough*. Anyway...\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding, in the beginning, is AMAZING, Mother's Basement explained how it is a great example of the \"show, don't tell\" style of narration, that is letting the viewer figure out what happened in the world instead of spoonfeeding them information. This was abandoned in episode 20 when they decided to just set the series on fire and watch it burn.\\n\\n\r\nUp until a certain point, Darling in the Franxx was great but, similarly to the original Fullmetal Alchemist, whoever wrote the series decided to take a very, very odd turn for its end, completely ruining the enjoyment of anyone watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode was one of the worst things I watched recently and it left me questioning if I actually enjoyed the series. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it as a whole and it pains me that so many people mindlessly hate it.",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX Final Review\r\nThis anime has definitely been the most talked about, the most controversial, and the most interesting to follow in 2018. In these past six months we\u2019ve seen this anime be praised, criticized, analyzed, and(last but not least) compared to another famous anime such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. Some have said this anime is a masterpiece while others find it to be trash. While I do understand some of the criticism this show has faced, I feel the need to set three things straight before I start this review.\r\nFirstly, this was never a Trigger show to begin with.A lot of people who have criticized this anime are confused on why it\u2019s disappointing compared to Trigger\u2019s previous works, such a Little Witch Academia from last year which was a huge success. And it\u2019s understandable considering that this anime has Trigger\u2019s signature animation style. However, it needs to be made clear that Trigger only animated certain episodes of this series and that its name was mainly used for marketing purposes. No one on Trigger\u2019s was involved in the creative process of this series. That was entirely done by A-1 Pictures.\\n\\n\r\nOf course(and I know I\u2019m getting sidetracked here) that doesn\u2019t prevent A-1 Pictures from getting flack because\u2026 it\u2019s A-1 Pictures and they suck at everything they do. Look, I\u2019m well aware that A-1 typically centers around the more generic side of anime but the constant bashing of this studio is getting old and we all know who started that whole thing. But the fact is A-1 is still a an anime studio and they\u2019ve had their fair share of hits and misses like every other studio. It doesn\u2019t matter how generic an anime is or what studio makes it. It\u2019s the story and characters that count in the end and that\u2019s what this anime does incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, this is not an action packed mech anime. In fact, it never intended to be. This is anime is much more that. It has a theme and a story to tell. It has significant meanings and it has characters who are flawed. If you\u2019re not up for that kind of storytelling are just watching anime because you\u2019re bored and just want to see a bunch of mindless action fights, look elsewhere but that isn\u2019t what this anime is about. This anime is about the characters, who indeed start out as stereotypical and cliched but unlike most anime which only does this to fill out a certain checklist they are actually made this way for a certain reason. This anime also carries a great deal of symbolism and meaningful dialogue, not cheesy lines or long moments of exposition explaining someone\u2019s special power or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, for all those who have harshly criticized because you find it boring, full of cliches, and has overdramatic teenage drama,  I feel that none of you ever took the time to take a deeper look into this series and discover what it\u2019s really about. And in the beginning I was one of those people. But then I discovered Nearly On Red reviews on YouTube and my opinion changed entirely. If you really want to understand this anime and why it\u2019s actually better than you realize I strongly recommend you watch his videos. The guy who runs that show does an episode by episode analysis, bringing out the anime\u2019s themes and meanings and why the characters are what they are and why they do certain things. Sure, his videos may one to two hours long but trust me when I say it\u2019s worth every second of your time. That guy knows his stuff and he really brings out the best parts of Darling in the FranXX while also pointing out it\u2019s flaws so I\u2019ll likely be using some of his own words.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Darling in the FranXX is quite possibly the anime of the year for it has one of the best storylines I have seen in a long time in anime. It\u2019s not perfect, but then again it didn\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s a masterpiece in it\u2019s own way and I\u2019m going to tell you why it is and why should watch it all the way through in this reviewso let\u2019s get to it. \\n\\n\r\nEASY TO UNDERSTAND\\n\r\nIn my initial preliminary review I asked the question of what exactly was the point of this anime? Well, after seeing Nearly On Red reviews on the early episodes I feel like an idiot because I should have recognized it right away but didn\u2019t because I got distracted by the show\u2019s narrative. The show\u2019s biggest themes is sexuality and fertility.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is set in a post apocalyptic state in which humanity has sheltered themselves in gigantic domed shaped buildings called plantations and is led by a mysterious council of beings called APE. However, humanity is also under threat by monstrous creatures called Klaxosaurs who attack the plantations and other important facilities. The only weapon capable of countering them are special mechs called FranXX that require a male and female pairings, called Parasites, in order to pilot them by placing them in rather awkward positions. Now while one can easily think this was just done for laughs, it\u2019s actually done on purpose for it has a great deal to do with the series symbolism. Our characters, Squad 13, have just been assigned to Plantation 13 and their job is to protect it no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see the kind of world the characters like and how it isn\u2019t as utopian as the characters are made to believe. Nearly On Red described it perfectly by comparing the society in this series to a beehive, specifically of western honey bees. If you look around in the background during episode 10, you can see the similarity in the building\u2019s structure and its orange color. APE is the Queen Bee, the Adults are the Workers, and the Parasites are the Drones. In this society, we see that humanity has lost the need to reproduce with the exceptions being the Parasites who require their reproductive organs to pilot their mechs.\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO FOLLOW\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, the characters are what makes this story. The battles, mechs, and monsters are all secondary. At first glance they just seem to fill in the typical characters tropes in anime, and in the beginning they are. Hiro is the typical brooding male who you can\u2019t help but compare to Shinji from NGE, Zero Two at the start was practically nothing more than waifu material, and Miku was pretty much the tsundere of this anime. But that\u2019s just it, that\u2019s how they were in the beginning. Throughout the series we see the characters grow and develop as they go through life, learning new things and exploring new worlds. By the end of the series, they\u2019ve grown up. They\u2019re no longer the people they once were. How many animes do you know actually have characters like these?\\n\\n\r\nNow granted only four of the ten characters get developed all the way through: Hiro, Zero Two, Mitsuru, and Kokoro. However, the other are not ignored either. What people fail to realize about these characters is that each one of them is flawed in their own way. Hiro lacks self confidence, Zero Two struggles between her human and monstrous sides, Ichigo is trying to be a good leader while trying to suppress her feelings for Hiro, Mitsuru can\u2019t bring himself to trust others because of his past with Hiro, and Kokoro avoids being confrontational. This is what it\u2019s like to be human. It\u2019s so easy for us think that we\u2019re perfect and we can\u2019t do anything wrong in today\u2019s advanced world that we tend to forget we\u2019re still human.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is no exception to this. We see the members of Squad 13 make mistakes and bad decisions. And naturally we get pissed off at them. For example, when Ichigo forced Zero Two and Hiro to be separated by eventually sending her away, it was both a poor yet understandable decision. She had a good reason but she ended taking it too far, yet she soon learned from her mistake and quickly made up for it. Then there are those who are brave enough to make difficult decisions, the ones that will cause someone to get hurt no matter what, such was the case of Kokoro teaming up Mitsuru. In that episode so many were mad at her because she broke her(not so serious) promise to Futoshi, her original partner. True she could have handled that better, but her decision was not selfish one. She did it because Mitsuru needed help and she was the only one who could do it, even though she had put her own life on the line in order to get through to him. That\u2019s real bravery right there, not selfishness.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most fascinating character I find in this anime is the creator of the mechs, Dr. Werner Frank himself. Throughout the series he gives off the vibe of a mad scientist and to be fair he is, especially when he consider what he did to Zero Two in her childhood. It\u2019s not until episode 19 when you see his back story, along with what happened to the world, that you start to understand him and why he did certain things throughout the series. It doesn\u2019t make him a hero, but it does give you a broader view of why he\u2019s so involved with Squad 13. Think about it, was really by chance that Hiro and Zero Two met again at Plantation 13 or that Kokoro found a certain book at that abandoned town during the beach episode?\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO CARE ABOUT\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so fascinating to watch is the journey Squad 13 undertakes. In the beginning they\u2019re ignorant, obedient parasites who are determined to proves themselves as pilots and to please their Papa. But then everything changes when Zero Two enters the fray and turns their world upside down. Through Zero Two, Hiro, and others later on, they begin to learn more about themselves and the outside world to the point where they don\u2019t like it and they want to change. This is where the show\u2019s ideology and philosophy comes into play.\\n\\n\r\nThe world we see the characters live is a false utopia. It looks perfect on the outside, but in the inside\u2026 not so much. As mentioned earlier humanity in this world lost its ability to reproduce. The main purpose for reproduction is to replace the current generation of species and to keep the population going. How do you take that natural instinct away entirely? By giving them something better. In this case IMMORTALITY. Why should anyone worry repopulating the species when you can live forever? Why leave some mark on the planet when you\u2019ve been promised eternal paradise?\\n\\n\r\nThis is when things start to change for Squad 13 and you\u2019re with them the whole way. You want to see them succeed. You want to see them have their own lives. You want them to accomplish the impossible. Come on, guys, how is that not relatable to us who gone through hardships in our lives?\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX does have its ups and downs but overall it\u2019s a very solid anime. I give it an 8/10 because I feel the series wasn\u2019t long enough especially with the last five episodes. Throughout my time watching this I kept asking the question of if there was any kind of civilization out there, like a underground civilization that was fighting a rebellion against the APE council. I think I would have like this show more if it been a trilogy of sorts, or a 4-6 cour anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an example, the first season ends with Squad 13 escaping the plantation and finding an underground civilization consisting of a perfectly normal society. The second then revolves around the squad discovering everything there is about this new society while at the same time battling APE and the Nines before ending with the discover of APE\u2019s true origins. The third season then goes to the squad taking the fight to space while giving new life to Earth.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a newcomer to this anime or are perhaps one of those who thought it was trash for whatever reason, here\u2019s my suggestion. Watch the first episode of this series, then watch Nearly On Red\u2019s analysis of that same episode. Repeat this again and again as you continue to watch and then maybe, just maybe, you\u2019ll understand why Darling in the FranXX really is a masterpiece in it\u2019s own way.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

            "content": "Darling In The Franxx is hot garbage \r\nDarling in the Franxx is like someone saw Neon Genesis Evangelion and thought: hmm this needs more ecchi, annoying characters, bad and cringey writing and much worse fight scenes. And then a studio-approved of the idea and made it into an anime. Later that year it would air and become one of if not the most hyped anime of its season. I honestly do not get what kind of person would enjoy this kind of show. Darling in the Franxx is just a bad drama with as bad action. I cannot understand what kind of person would relateand actually like these characters. Maybe someone that hasn't talked to a REAL person in a while or even EVER. These characters are so over the top and unrealistic that I just couldn't get into their drama and problems. But at the same time, they don't have any outstanding personality traits either. This show thought that it would be more appropriate to focus on 10 yes 10 MAIN characters, instead of just the four with what kind of resembles an interesting plot line. \\n\\n\r\nOk, now that I\u2019ve got my initial rant out of the way we can start by analyzing the ten main characters of this 24 episode series. And I\u2019ve got to be brutally honest here, I had to search up 6 out of the 10 main character\u2019s names because I just couldn't remember them. Their names are Hiro, Zero Two, Ichigo, Goro, Kokoro, Mitsuru, Ikuno, Futoshi, Zorome, and Miku. I will also analyze their so-called personality in the order that I listed them. (And I might end up spoiling something here, so beware). \\n\r\nSo let's start with our generic \u201cKirito\u201d wannabe main character. Hiro is the one that the story mainly focuses on. He was the prodigy mecha pilot when he was young but suddenly lost all his talent and became depressed. Hiro despite being the one that the story revolves around doesn't actually do or talk that much. He\u2019s kinda laid back and silent I can\u2019t really think of any strong personality traits of his except that he\u2019s really dumb and is really quick to give up. And then when Zero Two comes into the pictures he becomes this \u201clover boy\u201d spewing corny lines that almost feels like a twelve year wrote them. One of my favorites are \u201cthese sakura flowers are gonna bloom and become as beautiful as your hair Zero Two\u201d. Its impossible to sympathize with this main character as he is so goddamn annoying. Hiro always makes the opposite of the most logical choice and makes his friends angry at him many times. How he still has people calling him their friend at the end of the series is a question I cannot answer.\\n\r\nZero Two was the one character I was hoping would turn out good by the end of this anime. But no, damn did they mess up her near the end of the show. In the beginning, she\u2019s this cool girl that gives of a dangerous vibe. Everyone that rode with her for more than three times in a \u201cfranxx\u201d had died. She was the one character that actually acted kind of normal and had some knowledge about stuff in life. But over the course of the show, her personality gets more and more like the plastic and fabricated personalities of the other 9 main characters. Later in the show, she came to realize that Hiro tried to be Kirito so she then tried really hard to become Asuna. The one thing that was interesting about this anime was Zero Two\u2019s storyline: how can I become human, and what actually classes as a human. They tried to touch on this subject many times, but Hiro and Zero Two through their conversations never met at a conclusion. They always had the same mindset at the end of it as they had in the beginning. But they fast abandoned this storyline and Zero Two would never become a real human because of this show\u2019s bad writing. \\n\r\nIchigo is the bossy leader of their squad. She has a crush on Hiro but he\u2019s too dumb to realize it and then ensues some really bad lines between Zero Two and Ichigo as they fight for this really boring MC. I\u2019ve already said all there is to Ichigo\u2019s personality \u201cbossy\u201d. Honestly, I can't think of any other words that better describe her. She constantly stirs up unnecessary melodrama because of her bitchiness. \\n\r\nGoro is Hiro\u2019s best friend and he is a really one-sided character. He doesn\u2019t have any flaws actually and I don't mean that as if he was a good character. He always makes the right choices, always know what to say to cheer up the other characters, he\u2019s smart and a good mecha pilot. You know when you get these papers in grade school where you\u2019re supposed to write what you like in a friend. You then write something like \u201cMy friends need to be kind, smart and comfort me when I\u2019m sad\u201d. It was like someone took one of the papers from a grade schooler and then made Goro\u2019s character after it.\\n\r\nKokoro. I don\u2019t know what to say really, she\u2019s shy I guess. And she wants to make a child because she found a book or something. I don't know. They just abandoned the only interesting thing about this anime for this storyline, and I couldn't care less. \\n\r\nMitsuru, he\u2019s the one that Kokoro wants to make a child with. I guess that he was mad at Hiro because of some dumb reason and he mistrusted everyone because of it. But then suddenly he wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing more to him really.\\n\r\nIkuno, she\u2019s lesbian and suddenly gets white hair without explanation. IDK\\n\r\nFutoshi, he\u2019s fat and kind of a crybaby. He got dumped by his girl and then cried about it for 10 episodes. Then he got over it but started crying about it again later. \\n\r\nZorome, he tries to be this bad boy but is actually really naive and dumb. He also was mad at Hiro for some dumb reason I can\u2019t remember, but then suddenly wasn\u2019t.\\n\r\nMiku, basically the girl version of Zorome but without the mad at Hiro part. So there\u2019s pretty much nothing left. \\n\r\nThese characters just barely resemble real human beings, so maybe it was for the best that they abandoned the human theme after all. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s dive into this really unfocused and badly written story. The premise of this show is that there are some kids in the far future that are from birth made to be the best mecha pilots they can. These mechas are so-called \u201cFranxx\u2019s\u201d and they are supposed to protect big domes full of humans from some monsters called klauxosaurs. These mechas are to be piloted by a girl and a boy because that makes for a perfect setup for some ecchi scenes. As when they connect together they can say \"I feel you inside me\" while moaning. But Darling in the Franxx is also a romance anime and tries to build this future world. This story didn\u2019t know what it wanted to be. Either a mecha anime with big fight scenes and big explosions or a romantic drama about a love triangle. So they just thought \u201clet\u2019s just combine it and why not throw in a bit of what makes us human nonsense while we\u2019re at it\u201d. None of these plots have a satisfying conclusion and all just fall flat on their faces by the end of the show. I wish that they just would\u2019ve focused on the human and world-building part because that is honestly interesting. And I don't even wanna get started on the so-called plot twist at the end. I'm not gonna spoil it, just believe me when I say that it's actually one of the worse twists I've ever seen. In any medium, it's so goddamn dumb.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and voice acting isn\u2019t something special really. It just looks like your ordinary A-1 pictures anime with a few splashes of good-looking studio trigger scenes throughout. There are some cool shots but the action is really bland and uninspired. It all feels the same, they always make the same moves to kill the klauxosaurs that all blow up in the same blue explosion. The action is extremely repetitive and not that interesting or different, to begin with. I won\u2019t call the animation and voice acting bad, because it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just really average. Btw the comparisons between Asuna and Zero Two doesn\u2019t get better here, as they share the same voice actor.\\n\r\nWhile we\u2019re talking about sword art online I need to mention that these two animes are very similar, at least in the romance department. Some of these scenes between Zero Two and Hiro gave me some serious flashbacks to when I first watched SAO.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t picked up on it, I do not like Darling in the Franxx and would very much not recommend it. Unless you masturbate to SAO everyday. Then go for it buddy, you do you :). \\n",

            "content": "This is the second time when a really good piece of entertainment have betrayed my expectations. First was Game Of Thrones, GOT 7th season completely betrayed its main formula and disappointed the the audience. I call this falling out of love the with something that you cared for so much in the beginning but by the end it became bad and boring. Same thing happened with the Darling in the franxx, it had so much potential but as story progressed it become former shell of itself and never really interested me since then. \r\nThe Story:The is simple in distant future people in in the dome like structures and there are giant robots (Mecha's) that can only piloted by pair of male and female children. Our hero can not be paired with any of female pilots until a new female pilot arrives.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\Animtion:\\n\r\n                  For giants robot fights studio trigger and A1 pictures do not rely on CG like other studio and thats really good. Animation is top tier, like you get from from studio trigger show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n                Ah, so many really good characters have been wasted or are not developed in this anime. The two main characters get any real development. So many good are wasted here just sitting in the back doing nothing which bothers me so much. Other from main characters, other two characters get some development\\drama love story, but in my opinion that was forcefully shoved in the story and it had no purpose overall. This forcefully shoved story's time could have been used to develop the other or maybe why not build the ending in a way that it could have made any sense but no.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n           It had potential but it lost its way in the middle and thats sad because I loved this anime so much but ending takes away everything that the beginning had build over time. I hope any other anime never do this ever again because it hurts fans so much. Darling In The Franxx you will be remembered for fir the beginning but forgotten for the ending.",

            "content": "\u201cwhyd they call it darling in the franxx and not eureka sixty nine\u201d -@burgeroise\r\nGainax had been one of the most influential studios in the formative years of the anime industry, being responsible for projects such as Neon Genesis Evangelion, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and FLCL. However, it has fallen from those heights in recent years, partially due to departures of key staff in two major waves \u2013 one headed by Nishigori Atsushi who left to go produce The iDOLM@STER at A-1 Pictures, and another headed by Imaishi Hiroyuki who left to create Studio Trigger. Gainax technically isn\u2019t involved with DarliFra \u2013 it\u2019s a collaboration betweenA-1 and Trigger \u2013 but with Nishigori as Director and Imaishi as Action Supervisor, it feels like a reunion project.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s definitely the vibe they were going for, since this series is loaded with callbacks to those past works, particularly in the first quarter and in the endgame twists. At the beginning, this serves the purpose of establishing what type of story this is going to be, but as the series goes on, these allusions become superficial. Instead of being there to contribute to the narrative, they\u2019re there just for the sake of evoking nostalgia, and they\u2019ve been stripped of any meaning that they originally carried. This disregard for anything below the surface level often has the series at odds with itself \u2013 for example, while Evangelion and Gurren Lagann are both coming of age stories with mechs, they are radically different tonally, and trying to reference them back-to-back feels jarring. It would take a careful balance to combine all of these allusions harmoniously, and this series just isn\u2019t up to the task.\\n\\n\r\nSo with DarliFra\u2019s handling of its inspirations covered, it\u2019s time to move on to the new ideas that it has to contribute. The main focuses of this series are the concepts of sexuality and gender, though its messages about those subjects are either vague and noncommittal or actively regressive. The mechs in this show \u2013 the franxxes \u2013 require a male and female pair to pilot, and are a metaphor for a viable family unit. With that in mind, the constantly repeated idea that those who can\u2019t pilot a franxx might as well not exist takes on new meaning. When Ikuno, the one lesbian character in the show, tries to pilot with another girl, of course it doesn\u2019t work; in the eyes of society, she and her love aren\u2019t valid.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, having problematic messages also weakens the characters by having them be mouthpieces for those ideas. I was rooting for Ikuno when she tried to confess to the girl she liked, but it was harder to support her when she was trash-talking the nonbinary members of the cast. Rather than behaving like actual people, these characters would change to whoever they needed to be for the show to deliver its message. This absence of consistency made character drama one of this series\u2019 greatest weaknesses; with personalities and relationships being different every week, it was exceedingly difficult to continue to follow them and be invested in the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I actually really liked the designs of the characters. They\u2019re fairly simple, which allowed for lots of expressive animation. It was easy to like the characters when they were in motion instead of standing around talking about gender issues, and this expressiveness also carries over to the designs of the mechs. The female pilot\u2019s face is projected onto the face of the mech, which is a really nice touch. Honestly, the mech fight scenes in the first third of the series were spectacular, but they unfortunately weren't sustainable. These fights were rather sparse in the middle, and by the end of the series, just like everything else, they had fallen apart.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t think of any other anime series I\u2019ve seen that has been so specifically targeted at the Japanese audience. Sure, that\u2019s always the intended audience, but most anime tells stories that can still be appreciated by people in other parts of the world. But the issues that DarliFra deals with are almost exclusively Japanese. Japan has an aging population, and young people aren\u2019t getting married and having kids, mainly because they just don\u2019t have the time to raise a family. The future of the country is in jeopardy, so I can understand why a show would get made touting the importance of traditional family values. It\u2019s just, while I\u2019m not really informed enough or in any position to tell Japan how to fix its issues, I somehow don\u2019t think demonizing everyone who doesn\u2019t adhere to standard gender and sexuality is the way to do it.",

            "content": "This was probably one of the most hyped shows for 2018. When I heard there's going to be a collabration between Trigger and A-1 Pictures and saw the first trailer, I got really excited. It started with a blast and caused alot of discussions and theories. However, now I'm here saying that this has been the most dissapointing Anime of 2018.\r\n(warining: This contains some spoilers)\r\nLet us start with the Story (1/10): \r\nDarling in the FranXX has been a show which seemed to have a alot of potential at the beginning. The characters and plot seemed promising and mysterious enough to catch a lot of people'sattention.... These themes stayed for the first 6 episodes, which were the only somewhat enjoyable part of the series. The pacing became VERY slow after that. I was fine with that at the beginning, because I thought they would want to take their time with \"developing\" the characters and going in depth with it, which should pay off for the conclusion of the show. Thus I continued watching it, still with my hopes and expectations high and thinking that they had everything planned out to make this a decent story. How wrong I was...\\n\r\nThe slow pacing rather ended up ruining the show. Episodes 7,8,9,16,17 and 18 were just dragged out fanservice episodes, which could've easily been summed up in 2 episodes to leave room for the ending to be properly built up.\\n\r\nThe ending was rushed as hell and contained countless plotholes and asspulls. It was like they only started thinking about the conclusion once the Anime reached episode 19 and suddenly pulled out this \"VIRM\" plot out of nowhere. Thus making the entire Klaxosaur plot totally valueless and the first 19 episodes a total waste of time. I don't now who the hell had the idea to add such a massive, new fraction within the last 5 episodes....\\n\\n\r\nIt's rathher like they were trying so hard not to be predictable by throwing in VIRM. \\n\r\nSaying \"We were always there. You just didn't know it\" is no excuse if you don't build it up or at least foreshadow it properly.\\n\r\nNot to forget about the countless copypasting from Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. I doubt FranXX could even stand without those two series. They spent too much time, trying to surpass or at least reach the standards of those 2 shows and failed miserably with it. Additionally comes the use of repetetive plot devices (such as continuously sepearating Zero Two and Hiro)\\n\r\nThere is so much more to complain about. The last 6 episodes were obvously the worst part of the series and I haven't seen anything so badly executed in a long time. But that'll take waaay too much time.\\n\r\nOverall wasted potential, wasted time, horrible pacing, countless plotholes and bad directing and storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nNot much to talk about. Probably the only decent part of the series\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nSame as with the Art. Soundtracks were good for the first half of the series. However, became repetetive for the second half. Opening was good, endings were decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\r\nNow on to the next horrible part of FranXX.\\n\r\nDespite them investing so much time into \"character developement\" they ended up even failing at that. At the end I can only think of one character who had a good developement: Mitsuru.\\n\r\nIchigo's only character trait and motives were to look after Hiro obsessively by ignoring his own motivations\\n\r\nKokoro... The only thing which was used to make her interesting was the book about pregnancy she found, which influenced all of her actions and controlled her character. One could say that Kokoro was just a living personality of the book to cause conflicts. Not to forget about her making a promise to Futoshi, only to break it instantly afterwards.  \\n\r\nTo be frank: She was just used as a plot device.  \\n\r\nGoro had potential and could've been a decent character if he got enough screentime and focus.\\n\r\nFutoshi didn't change at all. He was rather useless from the beginning to the end or rather just got thrown away. Almost nothing would've changed, even if he would'nt have been  in the show. Just an invisible, annoying crybaby who didn't contribute to anything\\n\r\nIkuno also got trashed. Her only character trait was her being attached to Ichigo, which never got handled with again after she only once talked it out with Ichigo.\\n\r\nMiku and Zorome didn't really add much either. Zorome could've been properly developed after episode 10. But that as well just got thrown away, which made episode 10 pointless.\\n\r\nNana and Hachi were just random, useless additons who didn't influnece the plot. \\n\r\nDr. FranXX was a total catastophe of a character. His backstory, which didn't even make much sense, was cramped into one episode. His \"developement\" afterwards was totally out of context and at the end he just became a template for a mad scientist.\\n\r\nNow... On to Zero Two and Hiro\\n\r\nZero Two: She didn't really have that much character developement despite getting so much screentime. The only thing identifying and carrying her was her Darling obsession. Additonally she only changed because of memory-loss and -comeback. The fact doesn't change that she would've still just killed off her partner if he wasn't her \"earlier Darling\". Her getting attached to the squad was also only possible because of Hiro, though I admit that that is at least some developement since she learned to appreciate the whole squad. \\n\r\nHiro: Your typical useless main character, who is plotholed af and only having eyes for his relationship with Zero Two, while not caring about his fellow squad members.\\n\r\nNot to forget the Nines who weren't more than Papa diehard fans and unexplained characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo get to a point: Despite many characters getting so much screentime, practically none of them had a decent developement, many were unexplained, caused a lot of plotholes and didn't seem different at the end compared to the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10)\\n\r\nAs I said I probably only enjoyed the first 6 episodes. What kept watching was me thinking: \"Don't worry. They have this planned out by taking their time like that\" until episode 19 dropped and I finally realized how much I've been baited.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a series I wouldn't recommend anyone. Ruined potential and a ton amount of plot holes. (2/10)",

            "content": "So far, Darling in the FranXX has been a solid addition to the anime world, adding some great storylines and some awesome art. Judging from the first half of this series, this anime does move slowly, though that in itself is not too unexpected given it's length of 24 episodes. Personally I think that this anime has many good elements, and that it is more good than bad. Keep in mind at this time only 11 episodes have been published so this is not a complete review of the series. \r\nSTORY: 7\r\nAs I've said before the story has two big flaws. One, it moves quiteslowly for an action/mecha story. And two, the story itself is quite redundant. On point one, it is a 24 episode long series, so having a more drawn out story is not a bad thing, but sometimes there is a lack of action and interest. As for point two, when there is action, the premise of each fight is very similar. Zero Two and her love interest Hiro are a very strong coupling, and for the first couple of episodes the story is just a repetition of itself, showing off the power of Zero two and Hiro. There are some curveballs, but most are quite weak and dont really affect the story too strongly overall, they're just there to create suspense. The story is too strongly divided, there isnt much that can happen, which makes the story quite easy to predict. If they can create conflict between the protagonists, or even create a rebellion of protagonists against the higher power, that would make a stronger statement as a story.  However, the premise, the establishment of the enemy and the progression of the protagonists all make this story a \"good\" story as of now. Unless things start shaking up plot wise then it will only remain a \"Good\" story. Also, shoutout to all the sex references in the beginning episodes. I'd love to see more of those. \\n\\n\r\nART:9\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. Period. The combination of the pale palette and its simplistic design does well on the eyes, and the animation itself is crisp and light. Everything flows smoothly. So far over the course of the first half of this series. The art itself is arresting without being overly complex and detailed; it is eye catching without the shenanigans of \u00fcber- sharp art. It treads the line of minimalism to a T, and that is very good for the anime. Characters are designed well. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:8\\n\r\nNot a huge stickler when it comes to sound, but I have listened to both the OP and ED once or twice. Which is once or twice more than many other anime's that I've watched. The sound is nice, has an electric feel when it comes to song selection. As for sound in the story, its not bad either, very subtle. And for the VAs, nothing seems out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nHere is where it breaks a bit. For the first 8 episodes almost all of the characters are completely stagnant. The only change is in Zero two and Hiro. There is a very definitive lack of progress for the characters. However, moving past these few episodes, we are then thrown into a spasm of character development that is both very sudden and unexpected. This drags the story down, but it also does not follow up on the development of said characters. So overall, the characters are not bad by themselves, but there is a definite lack of development for these characters, at least for a good third of the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nDespite these flaws, I still really enjoy this anime. The combination of romance with mecha, action, and some quality art really makes me invested in the story. As of now, I can't believe that the anime has already gone for 11 episodes. It makes me sad that there have already been 11 episodes, until i remember that there are still 13 more to go. I look forward to this anime every week. Although the Characters and the story are somewhat weak, this anime still excels as a simplistic anime with some social commentary and an interesting take on the new dystopian world genre. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:8\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is pretty damn good, but its not an amazing anime. Storyline wise it brings some new elements and plot, but overall it is nothing new. The art is great and the sound is also pretty good, but the characters are a little to flat and negelected by the storyline. Overall, so far, I'd say that a 3 for art + 2 for story + 2 for characters + 1 for enjoyment = 8 overall\\n\\n\r\npeace. \\n",

            "content": "Let's take a moment to understand everyone has different tastes and interests. \r\nSo just because of the amount of negative reviews, does not mean you have to instantly turn away from the anime itself. Btw there are many cliches but I really didn't care about them, better to have this story than a story where every innocent character dies.\r\nSo I personally enjoyed the anime so much (prolly cause I binged all 24 episodes straight from 8 p.m to 7 a.m (yes I enjoyed it that much)). Now the reason this anime caught my interest was most likely because I love romance/drama anime. This is ahuge factor for me so literally after each episode I would have a feeling of 'I want to see more' or 'I want to see more moments of them together'. I should also remind you that just because your ship doesn't seem like it will sail you should just go with the outcome since it's up to the writer to do whatever he wants to do with the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nThe story doesn't really have a lot of action like what you would expect from big anime like One Piece or some shit, in my opinion the action is pretty enough. If I were to compare this to Evangelion, I would rather pick this since Evangelion really gave me a headache. Back to the anime, the first few episodes seem like they aren't going to give you much of a good time, I know, but it is worth the watch. Ending was kinda rushed a little honestly (last episode) but hoping there will be a second season to continue that ending. No, it is not a huge cliffhanger, just like a scene so maybe an OVA would be nice.\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nThe art style is just amazing. Well, that is to be expected for an anime released in 2018. Since i'm not a big mecha fan, the mechas are okay I guess? I mean i don't really watch mecha anime so the models don't bother me.\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nMy gosh the voice acting was so good. Well, specifically Haruka Tomatsu acting as 002. The soundtrack could've been better. The opening is not bad. I love the idea of not changing the opening song but changing the m/v.\\n\r\n(9/10)\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nHoly crap the character development is astonishing (imo ofc). Though when it comes to who likes who, it just gets pretty miserable and sad, though it is just fine since everyone that i shipped with reached their destination. But it hurt my heart to see some of the scenes where you know, people get kinda jealous of others and it is cute (lol). The Main Characters have great personalities and it is like god has answered my prayers when Hiro (Main Male Character) is not a bloody wimp.\\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nI really do recommend this anime if you like Romance and Drama. I did tear up a bit but wasn't enough to make me cry like a bitch. This anime is more focused on romance and the drama so if you are not really into that kind of stuff then you would less enjoy this anime since action is not really the most focused genre. Though I do need to say that the world here is kind of small but not that small until it's enough big. < idek wtf i wrote here but the open world is really open.\\n\\n\r\nI can't promise you will enjoy this anime but I do hope you enjoy it.",

I'd assume the typical virgin MC is what most people would imagine themselves being, and having a dominate female to take the lead because you're too much of a wuss to do anything, I'll tell you it'll never happen irl, only in animes, hence why this anime is \"popular\" get that dominate rolefrom a female because shit never happens unless you want a lil annoying girl like Sakura from Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nFYI the MC was sexually assaulted in episode one but everyone seems ok with it bc female initiated, but if it was other way around everyone would be hating the MC and pitch forks would be raised, double standards btw haHAA\\n\\n\r\nTypical \"impossible to do this\" type of scenario and the MC just happens so to be able to do the impossible, really a lot of cliche, no idea why it'd be popular besides dominate female for the people's dreams.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly everyone was suppose to die in episode one until the MC \"took control\". If it wasn't for the female character interacting with the MC this show would've ended episode 1 LMAO\\n\\n\r\nMC is the biggest scumbag in all anime I've seen. If you watch this show with hatred for it you'll see all of the bad points, if you watch into the hype you'll be blinded by it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is easily a 6/10 if it were averaged by people that weren't blind.

            "content": "If you came into this expecting a Mecha anime then you came to the wrong show. DITFXX is a 24 episode advertisement to buy Zero-Two figurines (as I write this, before the anime has ended, there are already 3 made + 1 Strelitzia figurine). \r\nDarling in the FRANXX has a really interesting world and concepts but, falls flat on everything else. You've met every character before in various other animes because every character is just a stereotype. Our MC, Hiro, is extremely bland and I believe this was done on purpose so, that viewers are able to self-insert into him and thus self-insert themselves intoa relationship with Zero-Two. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that the writers of this anime spent all their time making us fall in love with Zero-Two that they forgot that they needed an overarching story with the rest of the characters and world until about the final 5 or 6 episodes where there's alot of crazy stuff that's explained poorly or not at all going on. \\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be alot of homages to Neon Genesis Evagelion in this anime some are very subtle while others are extremely blatant to the point where it seems to be directly ripping off.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a seasonal waifu that you'll forget about by next season like Hestia or Rem then this is the perfect anime for you. Zero-Two is cute. She's designed to be. That's her entire existence, go ahead and buy the 3 figurines of her that were out before the anime even ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme songs are also really good. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****************************************SPOILERS****************************************************************************************SPOILERS****************************************************************************************SPOILERS***********************************************\\n\\n\r\nI wrote this like 4 or 5 weeks ago on Reddit. It contains spoilers. I've updated it for the past few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service at the start of series was completely unnecessary. You literally get introduced to Zero Two as she's naked for no reason. Thankfully they stopped doing it. \\n\\n\r\nThey've spent so much time making the anime into \"love Zero Two pls we made her real cute 4 u\" that it seems like they forgot about the rest of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe Klaxosaurs have almost never felt like a real threat. Until they introduced the Klax Princess. The Klaxosaurs have been poorly animated CGI for most of the series except these past couple episodes and we've barely seen them. It would've been so much better to have hints of the Klaxosaur Princess put in earlier and then the could've been a larger plot twist than it ended it being.  \\n\\n\r\nFor most of the beginning of the series there wasn't really a goal, or an objective, or an established antagonist, I try not to compare this anime to Neon Genesis because it's extremely large shoes to fill. But the Angels in NGE was clearly the thing we were suppose to be fighting and they always felt dangerous because the stakes werent just the EVA units. It was the entire NERV base with everyone in it. Unlike EVA01, Strelizia always feels like a Trump card. Like as long Strelizia is there, then everything will be okay. There's no stakes and they exemplified that when they show Strelizia just mowing through Klaxosaurs like they're nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of first like 10 episodes was just \"this pink hair girl is pretty cute let me pilot with her\" \"Hiro no\". \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are standard anime stereotypes. I've met almost everyone of the cast before I even watched the anime. \\n\\n\r\nHiro is as bland as stale bread. His personality is be with Zero Two at all costs and nothing else. He has no faults, he is a generic shonen protagonist that I really believe was made that way intentionally so, that the viewer can self insert into him and thus imagine themselve with Zero Two which inturn would sell more 02 figurines. Which if you've noticed, there's multiple out already. Anyway, I'm glad that Goro punched the fuck out of him because he deserved it but, literally 2 minutes later they're cool as if nothing ever happened and we're going to space together!\\n\\n\r\nThe world of DITFXX is incredibly interesting and they do nothing with it. They decided to drop all kinds of subtle story telling and just exposition dump on the Dr. Franxx back story episode. Like, the beach episode, when they're exploring the ruins of the old world. The viewer is exploring with them. We're left to wonder what happened here. What happened in this world, where did all the people go, how long has it been, etc. But instead they're just like \"hey let's wrap this shit up. just tell them everything immediately\" all we got out of that episode is the book that motivated Kokoro to have sex. \\n\\n\r\nThat episode with Zorome getting lost was a good example of how they could've handled world building and once again shows that they know how to do these things but chose not to and instead continued to go hard on please love Zero Two thing. \\n\\n\r\nThis series has alot of ideas and doesn't know to execute on them. For example, Goro loving Ichigo. What happened to that? He's a teenager, why didn't they drive this point harder. They just forgot about it. Ikuno loving Ichigo like FUCK Hiro and Zero Two. Give me that story.  Miku's white hair. They forgot about it and if they come back to it then it doesn't even matter because, we've seen that Ikuno's used all he energy and her hair lost its color. She's fine. Nothing happened to her. Futoshi's eating disorder could've been an interesting subplot but, instead they were like \"hey stop that. okay sorry\". Kokoro and Mitsuru's little arc was sorta interesting and i liked it but its like...what was the point of that? What did it actually accomplish? Why did it even matter, I guess this pregnancy is the point. The 9s squad, what was their propose? What did they actually do this entire series other than having done petty beef with Zero Two that went no where. \\n\\n\r\nEven just now, why is Zero Two's soul in Strelizia Apath? Why does her body take damage when it hasn't before with Strelizia? How can she pilot Strelizia by herself when every other time she has tried, Strelizia turned into a Panther or something? I guess because she has the power of Zero One inside of her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \\n\\n\r\nThis whole VIRM thing came out of no where. Wish they used some episodes to better establish this new antagonist and their motivations better. \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, did it go to shit so fast. It was shit from the start but, it went to straight diarrhea. Nothing like time skips because \"we forgot to plant seeds for an actual story\". This show doesn't even have the signature TRIGGER animation that you get excited for when you see the words TRIGGER. I'm triggered by that. \\n\\n\r\nThe final big climatic \"battle\" that tries to be reminiscent of Gurren Lagann by downsizing from Zero-Two Apath to Strelitizia Apath to Normal ass Strelitzia wasn't even sick. The animation was on par of Shokugeki no Soma. In that it was just slideshows. Slideshows with minimal movement, minimal action. Just people talking. There's nothing special, yeah there were a few cool stills of Hiro as a Klaxosuar, i'll give it that but, everything else bad. \\n\\n\r\nThey came here to make you buy some figurines and those things are already sold out. Congrats, you fell for the trap. \\n\\n\r\nThat opening song bangs tho",

            "content": "Mecha anime has unfortunately become less popular over the years. Not many anime studios these days don't seem interested or have the budget to make a mecha anime. If they do, they normally incorporate different genres in their mecha anime. They hardly ever get talked about these days. That is until this particular mecha anime series comes out and becomes one of the most talked about anime of 2018. An anime made by two familiar names in the anime industry, Tirgger and A-1 Pictures to mabye spark interest in mecha anime once again. But the question is, was this show actually good? \r\nWell i'm aboutto tell you. Sit back, Relax, put on your pink wig and say \"Yu....\" I mean \"Darling\" as I present to you the anime review for Darling in the Franxx. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has resided into mobile plantations since the world is left barren and overrun by mysterious beings known as Klaxosaurs. In order to protect the plantations, APE, the government in charge of taking care of humanity, uses teenagers known as parasites to pilot mecha known as Franxx. One pilot, Hiro, cannot somehow pilot a Franxx until he meets a mysterious girl who is half human and half Klaxosaur by the name of Zero Two. From there, Hiro vows to know more about Zero Two and starts to see the world he knows from a different angle. \\n\\n\r\nNow obviously this is not the entire plot as more of the plot is uncovered as time moves on and we know more about the world. Speaking of which, lets start by talking about the show's world building. The shows world building is cleverly done as it slowly builds as more of this world and its residents is revealed through the eyes of our characters. Our cast of characters don't know much about the world as we do. We learn as they learn about the world and what it was like before they lived in plantations and outside The Garden, a facility where the children grow up and train to become Franxx pilots. It's cleverly used with a lot of subtle hints placed across the show, giving us an idea about the world and how society views these teenagers. That is until until we get a massive world building explanation dump near the end of the show where it tells us the backstory of the world and reduces interesting plot developments into uninteresting and generic plot reasons that pretty much kills the mystery of the show fast. It feels like the creators didn't no how to tie up all of this world building, so they must of thought that a text dump would suffice. That is just being lazy. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also a double edge sword. By doing this type of world building, this show starts really slow. It does have a rocky start that struggles to get itself any traction of moving the plot forward. Without a good hook, you will struggle to keep watching this show. With how generic Hiro's character is (and we will get to that) it can be quite a slog. Over time though, the plot does get more interesting as more is explained to us and the characters personalities gets more fleshed out...during the middle part of the show where the plot really shines. However, the show struggles to keep that momentum during the final act of the show where it uses recycled plot points that is overall just lazily done with a plot twist that really feels out of place and doesn't work with the context of the show. It more or less tries to get to a conclusion, rather than building for a second season. With the plot twist that was in the show, it could've worked. It rushes to tie up all plot points so things get little to no context behind them, leaving us with questions which the anime doesn't provide. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLets start on a pretty low point with the characters section and talk about our main protagonist, Hiro. Hiro is just a standard, generic protagonist. He just doesn't have anything that makes him stand out and that is a problem when he is the main protagonist. You normally want your main protagonist to stand out among the cast but he doesn't do that. What makes him generic is that he is nice to his friends, he broods a lot and doesn't really get what other people are thinking as he is just unaware to it. He does what other countless protagonists do and there just isn't anything that makes him unique. That is until we get into the middle of the show where he actually starts to become more interesting as more of his backstory is revealed and we understand why he is the way he is. So thankfully, he does get better but that doesn't deserve immediate praise when he starts out generic and then goes back to being generic by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen we get to Zero Two. Zero Two is best girl. You may argue with me but deep down you know i'm right. She has a very lively personality that she uses to cover her more darker side that makes her character the most interesting of the show. Early on we see her character being shrouded in mystery as we know little about her when she is introduced. All we get from her is that she is a very lively character that does what she wants and she doesn't want anyone to stop her. Over time though, her personality starts to change as things are getting more and more curious by the second and we see that she isn't always an upbeat and lively person as her Klaxosaur side gets to show its face more often. Zero Two is indeed the character that has the most interesting qualities as we want to know more about her and why she is like the way she is. She also has the best smug face. \\n\\n\r\nNext, I want to talk about Ichigo, the leader of the parasite squad, Squad 13 since she has points that are worth talking about. Ichigo has a very interesting personality which, unfortunately, stirred up some controversy surrounding episode 14. She is very much a character who has her feelings and emotions cloud her judgements half of the time since she has had a big crush on Hiro ever since they were children. This also gets her emotions to dictate her decisions for better or for worse. She is a very polarising character because on one hand, she is very much a character who cares for Hiro and the rest of Squad 13 and that makes her a caring person. On the other hand though, it does mean that she can be unbearable sometimes as her emotions and feelings can get the better of her and clouds her judgement. This is what makes her a good character though as she is only doing what she thinks is best for Hiro and Squad 13 because she is a caring but selfish person. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on talking about every main character on this show but I'm not going to otherwise we will be here for a while. But all of Squad 13 have personality traits that makes them unique and recognisable. It makes their interactions with one another intriguing because each character have their own traits that make them fun to watch and care for when things go south. It kind of makes sense when they are surrounded by side characters with similar or the same personalities. These characters stand out because they need to. They need to be recognisable in order to stand out. That doesn't mean the characters are stereotyped. They aren't. Each of our main cast is fleshed out in some way that makes them easily stand out in the main cast overall and makes their conversations more grounded in reality as they learn and understand new things when they have no idea what they are. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow what happens when you combine the art style and over the top action of Studio Tirgger and the polish and beauty of A1 pictures? A really good looking anime. It is like if A1 pictures took Trigger's art style and sanded off all of the sharp edges to make it look smoother. It still has that studio Trigger style with fast paced, awesome visuals that we know Trigger can do but with a more polished feel to look even better. This is especially true with the environments as they can look gorgeous sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs as well leave subtle hints about the world they live in and that is clever, being part of the overall world building. That being said, Hiro looks generic but everything else looks good. This is especially true with Zero Two's character design as she really does look like a half human and half Klaxosaur with her red horns and inhuman eyes but still manages to look human. \\n\\n\r\nThe design of the Franxx goes for a more slicker mecha design feel with some mystery behind them. They don't look chunky like most mechs, instead they go for a more slimmer approach which honestly make them look good. They animate well and are recognisable because of their designs were intentionally meant for them to stand out. But when Streliza comes into play, things start looking awesome. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the animation does take a dip in the fight scenes in the final act of the show as A-1 pictures took over that aspect from Trigger and considering how good the fight scenes during the beginning and middle of the show, that's disappointing.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the things that Darling in the Franxx gets right. Whether it is used for the mecha scenes or when it's used between conflict between the characters. There is always a soundtrack to match the situation when it is required and definitely adds to the atmosphere. One track that stands out to me is when there is conflict between the characters and a ominous music plays in the background where it feels like there is some tension building and it is not looking good. This one would stand out as my favourite..... if it weren't for the show's opening song. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the openings, they are both amazing. From its visuals, its sybolysm, and of course, the song \"Kiss of Death\" by Mika Nakashima x Hyde blends it all together to make them incredible openings. It also takes the Guran Lagann route of the second opening merely updating the visuals and including the second half of the song to make it more appropriate for the second half of the show. While both really good, the second one is my favourite for having better visuals. Fun fact, if you translate it, it is about Zero Two telling her Darling to say \"I'm here, please don't be scared and run away from me.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe endings as well are also generally good and are good to listen to. But the one that stuck to me was the one that was only shown in one episode, episode 13. It shows the plot device used in the episode and acts like it is foreshadowing something that is going to happen in the future. \\n\\n\r\nI have slightly positive feelings about the English dub. On one hand, I applaud all the voice actors and actresses on doing a good job with the dub to make it enjoyable and a good alternative to the Japanese dub (it is done by funimation after all). On the other hand, i'm not a big fan of Matt Shipman being cast as Hiro. Even though it is just one complaint, being the main character means we have to listen to him quite a bit. He just sounds older than he looks and sounds a bit too \"negative\" all of the time.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx is either a show you are going to love or you are going to hate. There is no in-between. While it has a great cast of characters, very good animation and a great OST. It does have a slow start and it does lose quality during the latter half of the show as well as having a generic protagonist in the form of Hiro. For a show to be truly great, it has to nail its quality from start to finish. Darling in the Franxx struggles with maintaining its quality, only really peaking during the middle of this show. It does have things going for it sure, but it also has quite a bit of problems as well. But one thing is for sure though, it is nice to see a mecha anime get this much attention as it has. Mecha as a genre, needed to get this kind of attention in order to show that there are still plenty of people who love mecha anime. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx is anime I recommend you watch if you are looking of a good mecha anime to watch. I don't think it lived up to the hype this show was getting but on its own, it's still an enjoyable anime to watch. But I won't fully recommend it since the story is a complete mess. \\n\\n\r\nMy Personal enjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.5/10   Recommendation: Consider it\\n",

            "content": "This isn\u2019t your typical action and robots show.\r\nAs someone who is a huge fan of mech shows like Gundam and Macross, I was a tad skeptical to watch this show.  The show began with a group of inexperienced pilot kids with girly-looking robots and a ton of sexual references so my first impression of the show was not that great.  I had heard good things about the show so I decided to push through and continue watching.  The first 5-6 episodes of the show did not \u201cwow\u201d me, but my feelings towards it changed shortly after.\r\nIt was at this point that theshow started peaking my interest.  The characters that I thought were young and immature began to experience lessons about life, came face-to-face with death, and started developing into something much more tolerable.  In fact, I began to really like the characters, especially the main two \u2013 Hiro and Zero Two.  Love begins to blossom in the show and more character backstories are revealed, which are unique and make you really feel for the characters.\\n\r\nAs the story continues, there are other things taking place behind the scenes.  There is this whole mystery of why the kids were born/made, what the higher powers are really up to, and who exactly Zero Two is.  The kids begin asking themselves things like \u201cWhy was I born?\u201d, \u201cWhat is my purpose in life?\u201d, etc.  I didn\u2019t think a show like this would even touch upon deep life questions such as these and it really makes me appreciate the show in general.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started off as an unappealing sexualized mech show turned into a show about love, learning from your mistakes, and dealing with fear and unknowns in life.",

If you can emotionally invest, you may like this. \r\nDARLING in the FRANXX is the new coming of Neon Genesis Evangelion paired with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and hints of Kill La Kill. In this wonderful mix of styles we get to experience a marvelous story that takes us into the chaotic and emotional mess that is childhood & puberty.\r\nIt gets its mecha and teenage drama from Evangelion, the style and cartoonishness from Gurren Lagann, and the Ecchi seems mostly to like that of Kill La Kill.\r\nContrary to popular belief, this show is not aboutsurviving in a post-apocalyptic world fighting giant monsters with mechas, oh no no. Rather, it's a metaphor for the emotional turmoil our main characters are going through. They're thrusted into a cold and callous world in which they're abused and restricted and they have to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get emotionally invested in characters then this might be a show for you. You will experience sadness and hope and many other emotions. The show accomplishes this remarkably well and, in addition to this, is able to hold my attention. It's well-paced and the characters are relatable and likable. There's no real edginess or pretentiousness to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI'll update this once the show is done.",

But just the day before I started watching it cause I had nothing else to watch and you know what I binged all 13 episodes that came out,believe me guys this anime is WORTH it but the first few may be a little boring.It was a bit at the start for me aswell but the romace is simply BEAUTIFUL.The characters start to grow on you and its just so good.\r\nThe art for the \"villains\" or monsters is superb and the characters are drawn well too.\r\nTheresso much depth into the plot that you wont understand unless you watch it,if youre like me and you like romance or overpowered/special main characters,good background music.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have to watch this,but again this is just my view:)",

Darling in the Franxx, is going to tease you giving  you appetizer worth servings of the world, and its interesting inhabitants, while serving up a fullscale menu of continually putting these parasites in your face. Parasites the name given to the pilots of these giant mecha units called \\n\r\n\"Franxx\" a Pilot \"stamen\" and Pistil.\\n\\n\r\nFor my green thumbs out there the flower symbolism, will hit you right away. I dare not classify this show as a ecchi, but more classy imagery meant to pass off some obvious metaphors. The positions of the Pistil and Stamen or \"pilots\" , \\n\\n\r\nPistil if you did not know is are the name for the female organs of a flower.\\n\r\nEven there \"Franxx\" allude to a flower\\n\r\n-Strelizia\\n\r\n-Delphniun\\n\r\n-Argentae\\n\r\n-Genista\\n\r\n-Chlorophytum \\n\r\neach name a flower of some type, each pistil and stem raised and born in the garden. There are heavy tones about reproduction in the early stages of this show. Keep an eye out for Kokoro and her later ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of an easier deeper premise to grasp. The hefty servings of building up the group made each episode more enjoyable to come back to. I would say if you can try and watch the English version during the simul dub i enjoy the personality of Hiro in English vs his what seems emotionally weaker Japanese counter part.\\n\\n\r\nThe community these parasites exist in will at times remind you of a nice school Moe Slice of life, while delivering a bit of a seninen atmosphere as darker and more adult themes are brought into focus.  The parings of each Stamen and pistil stand out among the heavy mysteries that lie between the main characters of Hiro and 002 each character seems to share a unique and exotic bond that makes for a very good dynamic cast.  \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between 002 and Hiro is the part of the story that makes it stand out from any other show in this philosophical mecha sc-fi genre, that place used to belong to Renton and Eureka, but the bond that they were able to establish between 002 and Hiro and how episode 13 added to backstoy to bring it together in 13 episodes they have surpassed that spot once held by Renton and Eureka. \\n\\n\r\nThere world is a mystery, but through the actions, inner thoughts, and observation of the cast you love from episode one it begins to revel itself bit by bit in a way that makes it understandably, and easy to grasp but mysterious enough to still hold some room for desire and hope as you anticipate the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx right now is just pure enjoyment and I cant help but give it a 9/10 have we had anime like this before yes, but never in a way so digestible. You can get attached to this type of story telling. Cant wait to see were this ride takes us Darling in the Franxx 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nStory-9 (read Review!) \\n\r\nArt-8 (Curse that foot)\\n\r\nSound-8(Each scene transitions well with a sound track fitting for the environment and tones that is being set) \\n\r\nCharacter-9 (Each Stamen and Pistil are amazing and the show does not make you wait to learn there inner desires and dreams)\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9 (Have loved every episode)\\n\r\nOveral -9\\n\\n\r\n*Of Course this can change but im very impressed with what I have scene. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The art and soundtrack are quite good, but insufficient to salvage this mess of tired tropes. Darling in the Franxx sets out with the goals of character development and worldbuilding, and succeeds at neither.\r\nAll of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes: our generic protagonist-kun, his unlucky childhood friend, his magical tsundere girlfriend who is in love with him just because he isn't afraid of her horns, the big guy who loves to eat, the studious girl who wears glasses, the childish rival... Nonetheless, entire episodes are devoted to characters making the discovery that they are in love with their piloting partner, who they have obviously compatiblepersonalities with. The only interesting character is Zero Two, the half-human love interest with a quirky yet dark personality, and she is out of focus.\\n\\n\r\nBut what Darling in the Franxx suffers most from is painfully slow pacing. I enjoy stories that take their time when done well, but Darling in the Franxx has no direction\u2014 it feels no closer to a conclusion halfway through than it does in the beginning. At the end of an episode, it never feels like anything has been accomplished. Whenever something interesting happens, it is cast aside: the tiny glimpses of worldbuilding lead to no further exploration; a character develops a mysterious disease seemingly as a result of piloting with a certain partner, only to be suddenly fine and dandy in the beach episode with no comment. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also the blatant aping of Neon Genesis Evangelion. There's a SEELE-like governing council of mysterious masked men, an arrogant, talented female pilot in a red suit, video displays with orange text and caution lines, a mech entering \"stampede mode\" revealing sharp teeth... homage is fine but without the despair and horror this is all without reason and, frankly, insulting.",

            "content": "Warning, there will be spoilers below.\r\n I've seen a lot of 1s recently here, mostly from people missing what DiTF is about, and so I'm here to help you understand this show better, and if not like it, maybe appreciate it a little better.\r\n The following is a rant I'm taking from another post in another website, so I'm sorry if it's not as well written as it should, but it does it's job in conveying what I have to say about this show.\r\nDiTF isn't about Hiro, nor mechas, nor romance, nor about space battles. All of these are simply tools used tomake a story and talk about the themes in it. It's a show about a dystopian society coming to ruins and the rebuild of the world and humanity.\\n\r\nSomething I've seen a lot is parallels of Magma Energy and Oil - to say this parallel is central is the equivalent to say that Harry being british is a central theme of Harry Potter.\\n\r\nDiTF starts innocently as a lewd show with mecha fights and sex innuendos, but it cleverly uses this superficial appearance to hide it's intentions and sneak them for latter, and them twists the innuendos to make the whole icing on this cake. The real problem here is that they made such a good job at it in the beginning that by the time they wanted to talk about the central themes 90% of the audience wasn't ready for them because they couldn't expect this coming from this type of show.\\n\r\nIf this is a failure of the audience or the author, I don't know.\\n\r\n The show is full of symbolism. The first is Magma Energy. Yes, it has a few parallels with oil and such. But that's not what Magma Energy is meant to symbolize. Magma Energy is the soma of DiTF, it's a miraculous objects that sits at the core of their society. It's the ignition to the changes in their world. Therefore, Magma Energy can not and should not be explained scientifically - it's purpose is simply to exist as something we can connect to real life. If it is explained to the point of turning into tangible object in the viewers mind, all parallels stop making sense. Yes, this is a \"it's magic\" explanation. Much like the One Ring is meant to be a symbol for evil, Tolkien never cared to explain how it did the things it could, because it was never necessary.\\n\r\n Now, talking about the VIRM. The VIRM represents many things. At first, they are the World Government, much in the likes of Brave New World. A central power that completely controls society, with a monopoly of means and information. That much is obvious, but their philosophy is rather interesting.\\n\r\nThe VIRM believe in abandoning the physical body and entering a state of pure happiness in the collective of minds in another plane. This is the Garden of Epicurus. No, not the something from the show, but from the (non) greek philosopher Epicurus. A man who believe that through isolation and meditation people could, and should, leave this world from their minds and get a glimpse of this inter-plane state where the gods lived, where there is nothing physical and existence is pretty much nothing and matters of the terrain are meaningless. This is very important to understand the entire show.\\n\r\n The VIRM not only created a machine that exactly reproduces this Garden of Epicurus (as seen by the old-woman's husband), but they pretty much send Hiro to this Garden during the final fight. A place of nothing, disconnected from this world entirely. \\n\r\nAnd how is Hiro brought back? Through faith and connections.\\n\r\nHere we can see how Hiro's arc makes a brilliant follow up to the whole plot of the show.\\n\r\nHe starts as one of only ones who fight against the VIRM, and then meets with a superior being, 02. Here 02, although she looks like a demon, takes the symbol of an angel. Both suffer, and both are tainted by the VIRM. As they develop together, Hiro regains his memories, 02 is brought back to her angelic position, and eventually Hiro transcends his humanity in what is pretty much a Origin Mythos becoming a saint to the people left on Earth. All of these transitions happen naturally up to the last minute, where you can finally grasp what their author's intentions were.\\n\r\n This is why the 02 statue is so important. It makes absolutely no sense in logical terms, BUT it makes absolute sense in the symbols and themes of the show. Hiro - \"Hero\", if you didn't catch it already - and 02 spawn a semi-religion within the people in Earth, and sacrifice themselves for them. They even perform several miracles throughout the whole series, and specially in their last moments.\\n\r\nIt's this newborn faith in the humans at Earth that saves Hiro. It's this faith, that goes against everything Epircurus preached, that breaks his Garden and brings Hiro back for his final moment.\\n\r\nOf course, this has nothing to do with religion, as faith and spiritually do differ from religion, and even any buddhist parallels are thin here, but that's not here not there. What is important is that from now on all we will see is about the struggle to defeat the VIRM and reconstruct the world, and the authors considered spirituality and faith as two fundamental pieces of this .\\n\r\n So, if Hiro transcended humanity and became a saint, who died for humanity's sins and postponed the VIRM war, then what about the Klaxosaurs?\\n\r\nThey are a failed race. Not in the sense that they are inferior, but that they were far superior and were ultimately defeated by the VIRM. Meanwhile, the humans are far weaker, and surrender to the VIRM, only to be saved by Hiro and their own struggle. \\n\r\nThis is how we can understand the character arc of the most important character of the show, Dr. Werner Franxx.\\n\r\nWerner starts as a important scientist who pushes his field further by means that are considered imoral. This isn't a cautionary tale against science, however, but against lack of understanding, as Werner will learn.\\n\r\nThere is a lot of clever dialogue in his episode that explains his intentions, but to delving into that requires a rant as big as this one to explain it all, so I will focus on the ideas here.\\n\r\n Werner loves humanity, and his goal was to make better humans by removing their weakness. A metaphysical weakness, mind you - he didn't want to make us stronger or faster. The APE brings him under their wing and together they create immortal humans at the expense of our reproduction. In Werner words, this strips us of any beauty. And he was right, the post immortality humans are shallow, lonely, living in the emptiness of a semi-Garden of Epirucus where they await their final call, simply existing for the sake of it, without being able to leave lasting imprints, without being able to fight or change or grow.\\n\r\nThis realization leads to his disappointment in humanity, that culminates with the death of his last hope, his wife, as he further and further falls in love with an ancient race of better humans: the klaxosaurs.\\n\r\n Only after Werner turns into a mad man obsessed with klaxosaurs is that he turns from a somewhat questionable scientist to a truly evil man. His arc ends with him giving up on the klaxosaurs by giving a new chance for humans to fight.\\n\r\nThat sets the other important matter for the reconstruction of the world. Family. Werner's greatest crime, which led to the end of human beauty, was destroying the family unity. Immortal people who couldn't connect to others and couldn't procreate couldn't make families.\\n\r\nAnd so, on the other hand, we have Kokoro and Mitsuru, who's connection was so strong, thanks to their daughter, that it transcended their \"death\" - if we are our consciousness, and that is made of our collection of memories, erasing years of memories is effectively killing a that person.\\n\r\nThis is also shown in other aspects of the series, such as Nana's motherly instincts and feelings.\\n\r\n With this, we can already tell the downfall of humanity in DiTF: people willingly surrendered to APE and their promise of paradise in the Garden, which ended up with the destruction of families and, latter, of human beings themselves. Locked in the metastasis of contemplation, they simply awaited, for nothing, unable to change. It took angels and humans from outside of that Garden to take the fight to the VIRM.\\n\r\nThis culminates in the battle of VIRM against Klaxosaurs, where humans are left out for most of it, confused to what is happening, all of them having to choose between falling into the Garden or taking up arms. The sense of confusion in the viewer is partially out of a pacing problem, but also deliberately caused to put us in the shoes of the characters. Again, if that was a good decision is hard to say, but it servers it's purpose well.\\n\r\n Finally, as they fight of the VIRM and Hiro and 02 reach the final stage of their arc towards ascension, back on Earth we see humans struggle to rebuild what was lost.\\n\r\nIt's important to notice here that their main motto is not to develop on top of the Garden, but to go far back to their roots and learn from the humans of before. This could not be more Japanese, although it still is an universal theme. They reject the new and try to at least imitate the old ways, some that they don't fully understanding, but that bring meaning and beauty to their lives. This is very well presented by Kokoro's and Mitsuru's marriage. The kids don't fully understand marriage, but they can see it's good and fulfilling. And thus, the final nail in the reconstruction comes: the traditions. \\n\r\nHumans lost their traditions, but the kids brought them back, as much as they could, and even set up new ones for the future generations.\\n\r\n To conclude this, DiTF is truly not about Hiro, 02, romance or nothing of the sort. It's central theme is far deeper: it's about the destruction of human society from the inside, by loosing sight of the things that are beautiful and give us meanings, replacing them with a desire of not suffering. It's about understanding that suffering is another part of life and it cannot be separated from us. It's about understanding the importance of beauty, family, traditions and faith - and no, this isn't political at it's core. \\n\r\nIf you can't understand this, you surely can't enjoy DiTF's presentation. After all, if you take the theme out of a work, it's pretty much just meaningless colors on the screen (or mindless symbols on a paper). I don't hope to change anyone's opinion nor taste, but I do hope to make some of you at least to appreciate it a little bit more and maybe get something of this show.",

            "content": "After just having finished the series, coming to MAL seeing some negative reviews i was wondering if i really not getting what everyone else was. Seeing everyone else very insistent that this anime is the worst thing to ever come out the entire year and it deserves 1/10s across the board, i was really afraid that 2 entire decades of media consumption really left me tasteless and soft. Full disclaimer: This is my very first MAL review and i am normally never on this website, i visit it once every blue moon just to see what people thought of some stuff i end up caringabout. If you think that reason is good enough to discredit my review feel free to do so, i wouldn't hold it against you. And this review will be spoilers free, all i will mention will be vague words like \"ep 19 twist\" or \"ep 20 twist\" which no one should be able to know about without watching them.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly i just wanna start by mentioning how i was weirded out at first, i was seeing 1/10 reviews pop up left and right with everyone agreeing with them, i was seeing people be overly harsh and at first i thought i was going insane, that i legit lost my taste and my ability to discern good media. But after reading some of the reviews, i think i see the problem. You see, everyone seems to be under the impression that DitF is a mecha shounen anime made by trigger to recapture the glory of TTGL, but, well this isn't definitive, but myself and most people i talked about this with can't view DitF as anything BUT a romantic drama DISGUISED as a mecha shounen anime. It's a show where the entire world and everything are mostly allegories used for how we all were as teens, discovering love and lust we felt for the first time, how the unstable hormones made us feel and act like and how we ended up discovering a lot about ourselves and everything revolving us. Course that's not to imply the entire show is an allegory when some things are definitely done for the world itself and not as a meaning for something else altogether, it's still definitely a mecha shounen at various places, but at it's core, i don't think this show is anything but a teen romance drama. And that's why almost every choice made in it, even if it may seem illogical or unreasonable at first, links back to that. It's trigger using the medium of mecha shounen as a way to tell us the romantic drama of teens going through their lives. \\n\\n\r\nNow as i said this is not 100% true, and it definitely focuses on it's mecha parts and builds it's world for itself and not as an allegory numerous times and at some of them, well, for me an especially notable moment where it failed to do so was episode 20. I was really, weirded out by episode 20, i still think it means nothing at all and they just wanted to make a weird twist, and i think when i look at episodes like ep 20 i can certainly understand the disappointments of some people. However i do not think the entire series deserves a 1/10 just because of a bad twist in a single episode. The point is arguably subjective depending on how much you feel like that twist ruined the series but i don't think it did, i just think it should've been better handled. At it's core i enjoyed franxx because i never viewed it as TTGL reborn, i viewed it as a teenage romantic drama about characters discovering their feels and themselves. As such i don't consider it the best mecha anime out there, i still think it's a good mecha anime because i did like the world it ended up creating even tho aliens dood was really not necessary, but the worldbuilding and lore was pretty well done outside that tadbit in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSummary;\\n\r\nStory - 6: A fair story that tripped itself with ep 20 but still managed to have a good lore and world \\n\r\nArt - 8: I don't know how to word this without being subjective, i'm not an artist, i just really enjoyed the art and unique, star driver esque mechas\\n\r\nSound - 8: Again, not much to go on without being subjective, good sound design and a good soundtrack\\n\r\nCharacters - 9: As i explained in the review i wrote, when you view DitF as a romantic teen drama, and you understand why they tend to do illogical or emotionally driven actions, you tend to realize they are deeper than they appear to be and a lot of them reminds me of me and my friends in my teenage years, going through discovering ourselves too.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7: Gonna say 7 here because if you view DitF as a mecha shounen, TTGL is just better at enjoyability.\\n\r\nOverall - 8: And maybe i really am going insane here, maybe years of media consumption really left me soft and non critical, where i accept anything i find small personal reasons to attach myself to. For that reason i'd understand if you disagreed with that review, but please do try to keep an open mind instead of viewing this review as the ramblings of a fanboy.",

You\u2019re probably asking yourself, why is this guy giving this a 9 with so many reviews around saying the anime is bad.\r\nI\u2019d guess most ofthe people who disliked the show didn\u2019t reach episode 10 or just really didn\u2019t like the show, because unfortunately that\u2019s around the moment the anime becomes interesting... I myself almost stopped watching and it is the reason I didn\u2019t give it a 10. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance, mecha and action you will come to love this anime, the romance story became wider and more interesting than I thought at first, the plot also was also very interesting as it is quite mysterious and most importantly the characters of the story change quite a lot during the story... As I started watching many of the characters annoyed very much and felt cliche but their development came to make me like each one of them. \\n\r\nArt and music for this anime as well as the voice acting are great and if you put up with the lacking beginning it surely is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime focuses on what it means to be human it tells a quite beautiful story, \\n\r\nWatch it and enjoy it ^^\\n\\n\\n\r\n(I apologize for any writing mistakes as English is not my first language)",

            "content": "If I had to say anything about Darling in the Franxx, it would be to not trust the negative reviews on this one. When I first found this, I scanned the reviews and saw nothing but negativity. A little wary, I decided to watch it anyway. This turned out to be the best decision I could have made, and this show now holds my first review and my first 10/10.\r\nDarling in the Franxx is a heartwrenching story about young mecha pilots fighting giant biological creatures from deeper within the earth's layers. Those who are now in charge of the earth have chosen children to pilotspecialized machines in order to fight these creatures, known as Klaxosaurs. At the beginning of the story, we are introduced to a young boy called Hiro. He has sought isolation after failing the tests required to become a pilot, and retreated to a private location to sulk. It is here where his life is changed. He meets Zero Two.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two comes in with a bang. Though from a distance it may look like her character is shallow and chiche'd, there is no presumption more false. 002 and Hiro develop a bond unlike any other either of them has experienced, and change the face of the Franxx program. As the viewer watches, 002 becomes more than just an edgy, self-obsessed teen and becomes a character deserving of love, attention, and respect. Her transformation was one of the most incredible developments I've seen thus far.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes as well for the rest of the main characters in squad 13. Though most of the reviews I've seen say differently, I felt a real connection to the characters and I grew greatly attached to them as the show and storyline progressed. As I watched their struggles and triumphs, I grew with them and bonded with the hidden depth in each of them individually. This was a show where at the end, it was truly heartbreaking to have to say goodbye. \\n\\n\r\nAs for storyline, it was fantastic. There are no spoilers in this review so I can only say that there is a big plot point at some point in the series that blew my mind right out of the thermosphere. It enthralled me completely. While it does take a while to get there, the storyline preceding that point is still very well written. You still develop connections to characters, you still comprehend plot points, and it's intriguing enough to leave you always wanting more. There are plenty of animes I've seen with storyline much less compelling than this one. At the end of the show, I was left with more emotions than I could handle, and to me that proves the writing is worthy of great praise.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much for me to say about the art style. It's gorgeous animation and art, the characters and creatures are detailed and fun to look at, and the world is interesting and thought-provoking. All-around amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Darling in the Franxx really baffled me. I am in love with everything about it, and it has definitely left a lasting impression on me. If you're reading this and questioning if you should watch just like I was, this is your sign. I highly recommend this for anyone and everyone.",

            "content": "I should have written this review when the anime stopped airing, but I felt compelled to write this now. \r\nAnd of course, if you haven't watched it yet....\r\nSPOILERS!!!!\r\nI'm just going to summarize the good parts here. Darling In The FranXX started off strong. The first half leading up to the mid-season finale was great. I loved it. This was turning out to be 9/10 material and I was excited for the last half of the season. 002's Character was great as well as her bond and chemistry with Hiro, and him trying to be a better pilot and find the right partner. The symbolism ofintimacy and love in this show was, at times, a little over-the-top and sometimes rather sweet and lovely. The worldbuilding was top-notch, hinting at things without giving it all away in exposition dumps. There was the rest of the cast to explore as well as this interesting world. The art is fantastic, the sound is fun as hell and the world this story is set it is very interesting and fascinating. The story in the first half started off kinda slow but it got really good. It even explored some really dark stuff.\\n\\n\r\nTHEN THE LAST HALF HAPPENED.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the last half of the season hit, it took a nosedive. The rest of the cast got explored to some extent, but they mostly got awkwardly shoved into romantic triangles or things were taken to uncomfortable levels; two of the characters trying to have a kid for example, when they themselves are still kids and not even young adults. In a way, I understand trying to show how these kids \"deal\" with these emotions since they've been locked up and not been allowed to explore themselves like human beings, but this could have been handled MUCH better. The marriage part was also weird, and it was made even weirder with the baby being added to it since again, THESE ARE KIDS. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist that the Klaxasaurs (I hope I spelled that right) were originally fighting aliens who wanted to basically make everyone a part of them felt rushed and felt like bad writing. A good twist is one people can guess and see coming, but not to a point where it's incredibly obvious. That's part of a good mystery. This was a twist used for sake of NO ONE COULD LITERALLY HAVE GUESSED IT. Then the Franxx went into space, and it was never shown in any shape or form they could handle going into space, and 002 turned into a giant, space mech which was not explained and completely random. The show went full WTF at this part. I was so angry and upset by this that I couldn't bring myself to watch the last episode, and watched a summary of it instead, and it was exactly as I thought it was. I actually liked the twist of the Klaxasaurs having a queen, and saw a contrast between her and 002 and would have LOVED to see them have a Showdown, but that, of course, it didn't really happen, at least to the extent that I wanted. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx was 2018's biggest disappointment for me. I really liked this anime in the first half and was so excited about it. Now I never want to watch it again, and thinking about it only breaks my heart because it had so much potential, but it's like Studio Trigger and A1 Pictures couldn't get their shit together in the last half, and it caused this anime to bomb HARD. The rating for this anime went down A LOT as the last half aired, going around 400 to 500 on MAL, above an 8, to being above 1000 and now at 7.5. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE and the last half of the show is the reason why. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could enjoy this anime as much as I did in the first half. I would have happily bought the Limited Edition Bluray that got released if the last half was of the same quality as the first, but it wasn't. and I can't bring myself to watch it now because it just breaks my heart to something so good get wasted. The anime does open itself for a second season, and if one DOES get released, I will be VERY cautious. But if they do, I hope they fix the many mistakes they pulled in the last half. \\n\\n\r\nSo as of this, I give the aspects of this anime these ratings.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 \\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nAll of these low scores would have been higher, but the last half lowered them that much. In the first half, the lowest score you'd have seen would be a 6 for the characters, but everything else would be higher.",

For this show I see incredibly mixed reviews. It seems that either people love it or they hate it. I disagree with these views. I really like the show, but I know it isn't perfect. If you are planning on watching the show, here is what I'll say:\r\nThe \"plot\"(so far) has alot to do with teenage drama and relationships between characters, which is done surprisingly well most of the time. I'd giveit a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty damn good. However, the soundtracks are meant almost solely for the show and aren't great on their own like many other shows. I'd give the music an 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. However, I was expecting the art to be better considering it's trigger's big comeback. I would put the art somewhere below One Punch Man and above Overlord II. I'd give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters... This is probably the hardest thing to rate because the characters in this show don't have much backstory to them. That said, the lack of backstory makes many of them surprisingly interesting and mysterious. 02 alone is probably one the most interesting and mysterious characters that I've ever seen in an anime. This show isn't amazing, but for some reason I am more excited to watch this show than any show I can remember for the last 5 years or so. If I was to pick a category that has caused this the most, I'd have to pick characters. I'll give them a 10.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall Quality: 8",

            "content": "I find this anime very difficult to rate in the same way I rate other anime, because of its Structural issues, and problems which ruined what it had going for it. \r\nFirst I would like to discuss the first 15 episodes. These episodes had an amazing quality to not only animation, characterization but also story in general. The show heavily borrowed from other Mecha shows such as Evangelion, and Gurren Lagann, but in these episodes it managed to show them in a newer way. However many people can dislike the show for its \"lack of originality\" I enjoyed its unique take on the themes toother similar shows. Through a balance these episodes achieved an effect on me that I had not felt for a while since I started watching anime, So I give this aspect of the show 9-10. This is because it created unique characters and a great setting and feel in these episodes\\n\\n\r\nHowever, just because the first 15 episodes where handled in my *opinion* almost perfectly, it cannot excuse the lackluster, and awful quality of the remnants left over namely episodes 16-24. These episodes display an extreme lack of quality and direction. I believe that after 15 they had Absolutely No Idea where the story had left to go, and instead focused on the battles which was not the primary thing that interested many in the story. Diverting their attention from more pressing drama they instead decided to add a backstory episode ruining the immersive feel of discovering the world with the cast, only to add more fights and end with a lackluster space battle. All of this DESTROYED the tone, character development, and story in my opinion. ALL of these episodes are below a five. There are so many different ways they could have ended it, maybe one that actually aligned more with the themes showed in the first episode, but instead they had to ruin everything. \\n\\n\r\nIts possible the ending could have worked if they had more episodes to flush out the story, and fix problems that could have been fixed with more planning. It feels as though they only planned up to episode 15 and then just went 'well... what now.' the characters are together and happy for a moment how do we end this off?' and someone replied 'PUT IT IN SPACE AND TURN EVERYONE INTO A FLAT CHARACTER, F*** YEAH!' and they actually listened and did it.\\n\\n\r\nTo fully show my opinion on the show I will average my thoughts of the episodes individually to show how I rated the series.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the first 15 episodes with a 9.5/10 making 142.5\\n\r\nthe 16th episode is a 4\\n\r\n17 and 18 are 3\\n\r\n19 is a 1\\n\r\n20-24 is 2\\n\r\nAveraging 142.5 +4+6+1+ 10=163.5/24 = 6.8125 which when rounded is a 7 so that is my overall rating. Instead of completing the themes it brilliantly layed out in the first minute of the first episode with its imagery and symbolism it ruined everything it built with a poor fitting ending and destroying anything positive\\n\\n\r\nI suggest that if you are going to watch this show watch the first 15 episodes, and no more. Also the manga is looking pretty good so far, but it could turn into a crapshoot as well. Hope they decide to make it good.",

It seems most people compare this to Evangelion or Gurren Lagann, but I couldn't help feeling I was watching an Eureka Seven alternative. I throughly enjoyed Eureka Seven (while not typically enjoying mecha animes), so that was my bias after the first few episodes.\r\nStory: 2\r\nThis was is no way interesting, let's get this straight. The premise had potential, but in the end this show offers as generic an ex machina plot as you'll ever find. Predictable, weak character development, terrible world building, inconsistent pacing, incoherent & vague themes & ideas,and some moments make you question \"what were the last 3 episodes for?\" But hey, I wasn't here for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nThe characters were great. As unoriginal as they were, I loved them. They played out their tropes like they should've. Evil guy was evil, looks evil but not really evil, good turned bad, good guy main character and friends. But again, not here for their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThey were all nice to look at & were as consistent as you'd expect from a shounen. I didn't find the \"filler cast\" to be abysmal either. They (for the most part) did enough to warrant their screen time. In the end, they were nice to look at, and that's all that matters-- especially our seasonal waifu(s).\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound: 9\\n\r\nExcellent. Animation MUST be good for this type of anime, and it was. Nothing groundbreaking, but it felt clean, looked great, consistency seemed surprisingly solid throughout, and world detail never seemed to be lacking. Fight scenes always felt up to par-- and that's a huge plus for a shounen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThis is really the thicc of it. If you're looking for any shred of decent plot, you won't find it here. If you're looking for aesthetics, your fill of shounen fights, and a waifu or 2- maybe even 3, this might be worth a watch. This isn't amazing, but neither a waste of time. If you're looking for the best, THIS ISN'T IT. If you're scavenging through seasonals and in need of some hyped up bullshit, go for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI binged this in 2 days and never got bored of it, so that's something. I also don't want any more of it, so that's another thing. I got my share of shounen action & waifu time out of here, so I'd say it was worth my time of that purpose. Would I recommend this? Nah, but if you're interested don't let the MAL reviews deceive you, its neither a 1 or 10. There are much more disappointing animes with a similar score.\\n",

            "content": "Man oh man. This series has been a wild ride. Personally, Darling In The Franxx has been one wild ride since I started this show back in April and let me tell you, this show is absolutely amazing.\r\nLet's start with the basics.\r\nCharacters - 10: The characters in this show are absolutely done well and the development of them gradually get's better and better. At first glance, they seem like cliches such as the tsundere (Miku) or the childhood friend (Ichigo), but once you get to know them better you'll start to see that each character is perfectly written and each one of them has theirown detailed backstory. The best part about these characters. especially the supporting cast, aren't just there just for the sake of being there, they are part of the story and not just some cliched annoying side characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9: While the story was amazingly told, I have to give it one major con, it get's rushed (especially during Episodes 20 and 23) although it wasn't AS rushed as many people say. Nevertheless, the story is fantastic and ins't generic like most mecha anime's. Also. another draw back is that some of the earlier episodes contain A LOT of fan service, which I found was annoying and dumb to include, although it disappears after a few episodes. Alot of people where VERY unhappy with the ending but myself personally, found the ending to be a beautiful closure to everything we have experienced. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8: The art in this show isn't on the level of Makato Shinkai level of animation but it was good nonetheless. The battles are amazingly well done, especially when the FRANXX take out the Klaxosaurus' by impaling them although there are times where the animation get's a little silly and there are times where it get's lazy but it was a sight to see nonetheless\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Darling In The Franxx has many ups and downs, happy and sad moments, moments that made our jaws drop, and moments that moved us, but in the end, this anime has to be one of my all time favorite mecha series and I would consider it one of my all time faves. Darling In The Franxx, with a combination of an exciting plot, great characters and fantastic art, makes this show one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "In this passage, I\u2019m not writing about the individual staffs behind this show, nor attributing its flaws to them. I\u2019m trying to give a comprehensive review of this show, or explaining why it fails, plus some of my personal issues with it. It\u2019s long but I feel necessary. Also, it is subject to my expectations*1 and personal feelings.\r\nThe most severe problems definitely lie in the plot. From my perspective, this show is just selling TOO MUCH. I\u2019ve got mecha action, drama, \u00e0 la Gainax plot, lots of characters and tons of nuanced implications, and, in horror and despair, watched them blend into an atrocious pileof trainwreck, which is executed in an equally schizophrenic manner with below-average art for a mecha anime.\\n\\n\r\nBelow I will try my best to analyze them.\\n\\n\r\nFirst let\u2019s discuss about the worldbuilding. When I first saw the PV, I was deeply intrigued: barren world, struggling people and unknown menaces, just like any other classic shows of its kind. I kept quite a bit passion to the premise alone\u2014until I started to observe inconsistencies in earlier episodes. But that was just the beginning. As the show progressed, my passion was overwhelmed by questions originated from plot holes and unexplained items. But I maintained a sense of curiosity: How will they explain it? The final episode slammed the cruel answer on my face: they won\u2019t. If any of them does get explanation, you'd expect it done without articulation. Those ignored plot devices have a profound impact on the show\u2019s quality. The same speculation can be applied to those hard-handed nomenclatures. A ten-minute googling cannot add much depth to a barren show. It becomes even more disastrous in the last few episodes when gaudy things popped up one by one. When they are unable to conclude the story, the production team just kept cramming those fancy stuffs to the end, preventing us from using our brain.\\n\\n\r\nPacing is another major flaw. the production team prefers to conclude every plot arc within one episode. Critical episodes are very rushed and underdeveloped, while some others are complete waste of time. This problem with pacing is exacerbated due to crude plot arrangement, we have one third of all episodes dedicated to side characters and drama. There\u2019s simply insufficient space for any in-depth character and plot development.\\n\\n\r\nThe flaw above can be traced back to a more fundamental issue: theme. Apart from ripping off elements from its predecessors, the production team desperately incorporate commercially successful tropes that seems to be from a starter\u2019s book, but they are obviously unable to determine what matters for them. As the show progresses, I have to adjust my own expectation. Finally at the last few episodes, I gave in.\\n\\n\r\nAnother storytelling issue is that they heavily rely on recyclable tropes, they literally use Deux ex Machina to resolve plot conflicts and eliminate the nuisance to make quality fights.\\n\\n\r\nSince the show is more character-driven, I will talk about those characters in a more specific way.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists: the male protagonist is more of an archetypical Japanese male protagonist. On the contrary, The female protagonist starts with very distinct physical and personal traits that earns her overwhelming compliments and even a personality cult*2. During the first course, the interaction and development between these two are enjoyable and endearing, yet heavily foreshadowed. Its one of the more likable part of the show, but things start to change in later episodes. The two protagonists towards an unfavorable end: they become overtly obsessed with each other.  Hiro became a jerk who cares more about his girlfriend than anyone else, even those who grew up with him. Zero Two lost her original attractiveness and plummeted into a love-driven yandere as shown in ep14, one episode after the zenith. Promises and love manifestations became ubiquitous. Their behavior in the second course disregards, and blatantly exploits, their former selves, wrecking their characters beyond salvation.\\n\\n\r\nThe deuteragonists: I picked them out from rest of the squad not because they are the most controversial, but how they became such. They receive considerably more characterization than their peers at an early stage, as well as a more complicated story. From my perspective, these two are supposed to be inspired by the protagonists and go through their unique growth. Sounds like Kamina and Simon, right? The problem is, instead of being integrated, their story arc severely interrupts with that of the protagonists and the main plot. Furthermore, they don\u2019t do a good job distinguishing themselves from the rest of the team, giving false expectations to audiences and later infuriates them.\\n\\n\r\nRest of the \"main\" characters: They are two-dimensional from start to end. They have identical backgrounds and ended up homogeneous. They got their own character arcs, which takes a significant portion of the show, but did make some of them likeable. After that, they just degrade to puppets of their labels. The only characterization they\u2019re ever entitled is shouting the exact same lines in different ways. And they don\u2019t serve any purpose for late-show central plot. That leads me to a sad verdict: they are redundant. After all, no one can sufficiently portray so many characters even in a half year show along with other stuffs. Maybe animations like The Idolm@ster (I did not watch) can manage to do it, but sci-fi is another realm.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest are essentially plot devices, some of whom are themselves plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nThe final major problem with this show is the animation. The art style is distinct, using minimal shades to emphasize the lines and a rather muted tone which suits the show well. We\u2019ve got characters by the same person behind Anohana and Your Name, which is an eclectic choice. To be fair, there are decent mecha action shots here and there. However, as a mecha show carried out by some of the best team we can expect, it\u2019s a huge disappointment. Those quirks I mentioned above was overshadowed by mediocre battles, filled with out-of-place CGs, cheap special effects and recycled shots. Facial and body errors are rampant, even in those long, static shots. Some episodes look like products of layers of outsourcing. It would have been more acceptable if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nIf we turn our focus to something other than the show itself, we may find some efforts that the show lacks. The production companies are really ambitious. They made 4-coma comics that summarize each episode and caricature famous artworks and movies. They cooperated with Kadokawa to publish their official manga, which seems essentially R-18 doujinshis right from Comiket, except thicker. Trigger also organized online Q&As on Reddit and 4Chan. Comparing the answers from the producers and what I really got just disappoints me even more.\\n\\n\r\nSome more personal issues:\\n\\n\r\n1: Before this show airs, I immersed myself in finished, more classic Japanese animations, of which quite a few were made by Studio Gainax and its later incarnations, namely, Trigger. Gainax impressed me with its elaborate, psychological characterization, wild deconstruction and interpretation of Sci-Fi animes from 70s and 80s, experimental narrative, story, and execution, as well as opulent animation, which most contemporary animations lack. As a matter of fact, I still reserve EVA, for a more mature and knowledgeable self. So, when I first knew the show in September, 2017, I was hyped, and maintained a high expectation that is unrealistic in hindsight.\\n\\n\r\n2: Personality cult\u2014I found it accurate to described what happened to the subreddit r/darlinginthefranxx. It started with some lovely fan arts of the female protagonist and related exclamations. But during the later episodes, these contents started to overwhelm the whole subreddit and became ubiquitous, alienating anyone else who would like to make some memes or have civil discussions about the plot. Similar incident, though less prolonged, happened again, when people outraged towards another main character, and started some sort of witch hunt. Theoretically, adhering to a group will inevitably polarize one\u2019s opinion and weakens individuality. In this regard, this subreddit is an excellent evidence.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the very first show I invested to watch simulcast, even its original airing on Tokyo MX despite language barrier, as well as the only one I followed through the last half year. Now I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s the last.\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna be honest, I bought into the hype of this show early on. I tried hard to defend it, but after several episodes, it became pretty apparent that Darling in the Franxx was a load of crap. Being a collaboration between two big studios, Trigger and A-1 Pictures, it is obvious that Darling in the Franxx would generate a lot of hype throughout the anime community. While it did start off with some potential, the end product certainly missed the mark.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nIt's gonna be pretty difficult to talk about the \"plot\" of this show without mentioning some spoilers, so be warned. \r\nWow, theyreally shit the bed with this one. The story in Darling in the Franxx is just plain awful. Everything is told at an extremely slow pace, and ultimately ends up being unoriginal and not worth the time. Have you seen Evangelion? Gurren Lagann? Eureka Seven? Elfen Lied? Gunbuster? Shinsekai Yori? Well then, absolutely nothing in this show will surprise you in the slightest! The core problem with this show is its lack of identity. It tries to tackle many different themes and make references to many other popular shows, but does so with poor execution. This show has absolutely no balls and none of the plot lines go anywhere. Everything is just severely underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main themes of this show is sex. The pilots are all underage and have to control the Franxx robots together in a doggy style position. Given how much fanservice is in the show and the absurdity of its metaphors, it is almost impossible to take anything seriously. I do give credit to the show for attempting to tackle these issues, but the execution was really clumsy. Many of the episodes try to comment on puberty and marriage, but end up being really cringy to watch. Franxx tries to take itself seriously, but none of the commentary bears any meaning. It seems like more of an excuse for underage fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI have already mentioned the world building, but let me elaborate more since it was one of my greatest disappointments with this show. Take episode 10 for example. Zorome gets lost and is taken in by a couple for most of the episode. Both the man and woman are adults, but the husband is kept frozen in storage. Is this every mentioned again? Nope! This is the most boring dystopia I have seen in recent memory. Darling in the Franxx does not develop on any of these details. It prefers to pull out beach episodes and talk about sex instead of creating an interesting world. In retrospect, it seems like the studio had no real plan for this show, and just made stuff up along the way. This is evident by how stretched thin the plot is and all of the boring twists that occurred in the last few episodes. Everything stopped making sense by that point.\\n\\n\r\nAnother key aspect of Franxx was the romance. It was obvious from the beginning that Hiro and Zero Two were going to get together. What leads up to it is a bunch of teen drama and inconsistencies between the characters. Only in an Elfen Lied-esque flashback episode do Hiro and Zero Two finally accept each other and become a lovey dovey couple for the rest of the series. Honestly, even Elfen Lied had more emotion behind this lazy plot device than Darling in the Franxx. If I'm saying that Elfen Lied did something better, then that should REALLY put into perspective how half-ass Darling in the Franxx is. Honestly, resolving the romance half-way through only made the show even more boring. After episode 15, I had lost all interest in the show and knew that nothing could save it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was the final nail in the coffin. I was nearly on the floor laughing at how much of a joke the ending was, if you can even call it an ending! All of the ex-Parasites work together to rebuild society while Hiro and Zero Two go off to fight VIRM with no definite answer on whether they will actually win? At the very least show the could have had a satisfying final battle, yet the studio denied fans even that. Usually I don't think an ending can break a whole show, but stringing viewers along for several months only to give such a disappointing ending is a huge punch in the face. There are still plenty of plot holes left open. Who is going to govern society? What's the deal with the adults? Are they all sterile? If so, are all of the parasite, in their short lifespan, expected to bear enough children to continue the human race? Are they all going to be manufactured in test tubes? What about the rest of the world? Did VIRM control this city, or the whole planet? Are the Klaxosaurs just gone now? I could go on and on. Sitting through this show for 24 episodes gave absolutely no satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is plenty more to discuss, I feel like most of it has already been said in one form or another. The story of Darling in the Franxx was really bad, and probably the worst aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Darling in the Franxx is extremely boring and uninspired. By the end, I did not give a shit about any of them in the slightest. Let me give a brief rundown on each character.\\n\\n\r\nHiro is the main character. A complete joke of a main character I might add. In the first few episodes he had some sort of internal conflict going on. He was not getting along with the rest of the squad. Very quickly this got phased out and he became duller than wonder bread. Hiro is more like Kirito from SAO. A Gary Stu with no real flaws. He really lacks development in this show and words cannot emphasize how boring his personality is.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two is the only reason why people watched this show. Honestly, she was certainly an entertaining character in the first half of the show. She had a fiery personality and was the center of attention in every scene that she was in. Once the romance is resolved however, she became a boring moe and does almost nothing for the rest of the show. Her character development is a joke. She does a complete 180 when she finds out Hiro was her real \"dahling\" and suddenly gets along with the whole cast!\\n\\n\r\nEveryone hates Ichigo, but honestly, she was ok by the end of the series. It was frustrating to see her gang up on Zero Two in the beginning. She didn't end up being a good character either, but I at least felt indifferent about her by the end.\\n\\n\r\nGoro seemed like a cool character but basically got no attention in the second half of the series. Basically a background character for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro wants to have babies with Mitsuru, whose character was really confusing. Mitsuru had this burning hatred for Hiro at the start of the series but this sort of fizzled out. Mitsuru cuts his hair to signify his change of character and decides to make babies with Kokoro instead of bullying Hiro.\\n\\n\r\nZorome and Miku were basically background characters too. Zorome did have an episode of his own and he also bullied Hiro in the beginning. Even with this attention early on, he came off as really uninteresting, sometimes even annoying\\n\\n\r\nIkuno was a lesbian I think?\\n\\n\r\nFutoshi's entire character is being fat. He likes food and Kokoro. Gets forced to run the wedding between Mitsuru and Kokoro. How embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nNaomi was Hiro's original partner. She was in the first episode and came back in the last episode. Ok.\\n\\n\r\nDr.Franxx appears early in the series, gets an episode to flesh out his backstory, and then dies. Cool.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are interesting enough to mention. I give this category more points than the plot since they try to develop some of the characters. There were a couple that I liked and I couple I didn't like. Nothing offensively bad, just really underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Franxx is usually pretty good. While there are some shortcuts made, everything about the show looks pretty nice and smooth. The scenery is very lush and colorful, everything stands out well in this show. Each of the parasite kids wear the same outfits, but they are still easy to tell apart by their hair and facial features. Zero Two, while not necessarily original in her design being a cross between Lum and Lucy, certainly looks appealing and stands out among the cast. After all, her design is the sole reason why people probably watched the show in the first place. Franxx designs look like McDonald's toys, but I found the Klaxosaur designs to be interesting at the very least. The few action scenes in the show, primarily occurring in the earlier episodes, are well animated and fluid. The action scenes toward the end were anticlimactic, but didn't look bad at all. Visual direction is solid in the show. Future events are definitely foreshadowed earlier in the show using the visuals. I should also mention that both of the openings for the show are well animated, but honestly nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art of this show deserves praise, it is not without its shortcomings. I have already touched upon the usual shortcuts made in the visual production and the stale designs. The greatest issue I have with the animation is the missed potential when it comes to the mecha battles. After the first few episodes, the mecha battles are kept to the sideline and are barely even highlighted in the middle of the show. While I thought the mechs themselves looked silly, the show would have been more worthwhile if there were more action sequences to compensate for the stale narrative. Instead, the show switches between a lot of the same locations which boring really quickly. Darling in the Franxx is honestly a good looking show, but was still lacking in this department. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, Darling in the Franxx wasn't bad, but certainly underwhelming. Most of the battle music is pretty average, with no tracks that really stand out. I thought the OP \"Kiss of Death\" was fairly good, and it fit with the narrative of the show, but it still wasn't a piece that really stood out to me. The second OP was just a remix of the first, so I don't have much else to say other it being a lazy move. I really liked the first ED \"Torikago\" and thought it was really catchy. I especially liked the way that they ended each of the episodes off with it. However, the show really disappointed me by only using it for the first six episodes, and switched to mediocre tracks for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was alright throughout the show. Most of the voices fit the characters and their \"personalities\". Although most of the performances felt kind of boring, I did think that Haruka Tomatsu did a fine performance as Zero Two. Simply uttering the word \"dahling\" causes millions of adolescent males around the world to squeal. As for the English dub, I thought it was ok. If that's what you prefer, then by all means go for it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first six or so episodes of Franxx were fairly enjoyable, but it only started to go downhill from there. Franxx's lack of identity made for a conflicted viewing experience. Did it want to be a cool mech show? A teen drama? Nonsense? Probably the latter is most appropriate. The filler and fanservice were cringe worthy. The plot went absolutely nowhere and I had to force myself to finish the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI admit that I bought into the hype of Darling in the Franxx, but I was completely delusional. I do not recommend watching this show. If you really like Zero Two then litter your room with figurines or watch some highlights online. Alternatively, if Darling in the Franxx does interest you, or you finished the show and actually did enjoy it, then I would suggest looking at the recommendations below. Almost all of the shows there are probably better than Darling in the Franxx. My personal recommendations are Eureka Seven, Evangelion, and Gurren Lagann.",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is a collaboration between Trigger Studios and A-1 Pictures, it's a sci fi mecha, with inspiration of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Laggan. \r\nOne thing before reading anything else, most of the work in production is done by A-1 Pictures, Trigger has only helped in some fighting sequences and as of episode 23, Trigger hasn't put a hand in production since episode 15.\r\nStory (05/10)\r\nThe writting is a mess. Most of the first episodes were done almost perfectly but after episode 6 it began to stray it's way. Giving each 'main character' an episode, which is done wrong because after those fewepisode focusing on the 'main characters' they return the way to Zero Two and Hiro (or two real MCs). To tell you straight, in the official page and official info delivered tell you that all of Squad 13 are the main characters but since the start of the series, everyone except for Hiro and Zero Two, were just there to stop the story from advancing. Then in episode 13 we get a flashback episode explaining half of the origins of Zero Two, which rose again the quality of the series, but after episode 14 strayed again it's way, showing that the creators didn't knew the reason for the story, and as for episode 23, they still don't know.\\n\r\nAnd then episode 20 threw it all away, because of how slow the pacing in the story is, in which some points in the series it doesn't even move at all because of the others in Squad 13. They threw another flashback episode, in this case, telling us the past of Dr. Franxx, throwing away all the possible misteries. And leaving a rain full of doubts and nonsense with the following episodes, showing that they didn't even knew what kind of logic they were putting into their universe.\\n\\n\r\nArt (07/10)\\n\r\nThe art is cool, but not original or fresh.\\n\\n\r\nSound (05/10)\\n\r\nBeside the cool OP and EDs, everything from the OST to the SFXs is too simple, to the point is forgotten really fast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (05/10)\\n\r\nAs I've explained, they tried to have a choral main character, but failed to do so. The main characters are Zero Two and Hiro. But in all those 23 episodes, they just had ONE actual character development and that is the acceptance and love between them, because they continously repeat the same 'Zero Two is distant and Hiro tries to became closer to her'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (06/10)\\n\r\nYou can really enjoy the first few episodes, but after that is just nonsense after nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that after being so popular it didn't managed to fulfill those expectations.\\n",

Later in the series when they change intros, the new intro artwork is absolutely gorgeous with neon colours. The music is also topnotch. The story is wonderful as well. Just when you think its going to end good or horribly, the next part comes and everything is resolved with such determined little kids. The character development is very sad. It makes me cry how sad  as well as happy this anime can be. For me, I'd addthis to the \"Cry my eyes out\" Anime List. If you don't like the beginning just like I did, hold on: it gets so much better. Im glad I kept watching when it got boring, because the boring was necessary to progress the story and the whole show was beautiful",

The whole plot was just really disorienting and confusing, and it often took several episodes to finally realize what had happened in a certain scene and its significance when it shouldhave been more explicit. Although there is some character development, it isn't necessarily relevant to the whole plot in general and was usually cast aside when the anime shifted focus (way too often and failed to establish a main focus until the end of the series). \\n\r\nTL;DR: Not worth your time unless you like to have so BK anime going on while doing homework or something. You could probably get away with watching the first few episodes and then skipping to the end and finish it off because the middle is just fluff.",

            "content": "This is my first review on this website, so as such I am going to type up a worth while review.  Be aware that I have little to no experience with these studios as I usually just watch an anime on occasion when the whim strikes me.  So, this is a review without bias for or against the studios.\r\nFirst and foremost on my mind about this series is this:\r\nThe way the mechs are piloted.  I am a scientist and engineer, so watching this technical choice really annoyed me.  Fan service should not replace good technical choices, but should compliment good technicalchoices if the fan service is needed at all.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly:\\n\r\nI have read disappointment in the character development, but the character development is rather accurate psychologically.  People need time to change and will actively fight change, especially if they think they are right and don't want to change their long cemented way of thinking.  Emotions and relationships are often messy, so incorporating militaristic group tactics with the minds of emotional pubescent children struggling to understand these emotions with zero psychological oversight is rather interesting.  This show seemed to be about the dynamics of human nature emerging through indoctrination, with a main love interest being the center piece.  I really like Kirito in this anime (I couldn't help myself).  The main character is probably the least realistic character and needs more depth.  At episode 18 there is development, but it took a little long to get there.\\n\\n\r\nLastly:\\n\r\nThere is a building twist coming, which is the second main focus of the anime; world building.  I am hoping to see something truly thought provoking, but I think I know how things will go.  If you read enough old books and recognize certain cliche's, it is hard to be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked this show.  I was watching it to see different 3D animation styles because I am starting to animate with my brother for future VR endeavors and I was not disappointed.  I will continue to watch the show and see how it fairs over the last 6 episodes.  I would recommend this show, but would like to liken the progression to Violet Evergarden, meaning the Emotional aspects are the absolute main focus and the secondary feature is the world around them.  It's good on many levels, but could have been amazing had the studios took more time to really blend emotion and world building aspects.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nDarling in the FranXX is an anime that disgusted me: the most despicable and insulting anime I have seen. I would watch a full season of Pupa over this if it even exists.\r\nStory: 2\r\nThe story has a plot which basically revolves around the relationship between the heroine Zero Two and the hero of the story, simply named Hiro, and anything outside of their relationship is basically trying to separate the two, including but not limited to everything. Somewhere along the line, they and the other people of their team get into those robots which are called \"Franxx\", which are piloted with amale and female, controlled by getting into what is basically the \"doggy style\" position. And sometime else, the heroine and protagonist's relationship wavers, but moments later they're back together stronger. The genre listed \"Mecha\", but for those Franxx becoming stronger purely because of \"love\" is complete nonsense. Zero Two and Hiro have demonstrated this power in the anime, but why did they not share this with the rest of their team? It doesn't make sense to not give out the way to get this gain of power and therefore have stronger support. If I would predict something to happen, it would probably be that out of nowhere, the rest of the cohort would have a similar upgrade to their Franxx and defeat some threat in episode 24. If anything, the plot does not even relate to sci-fi or mecha; the plot can easily be in a high school anime, and would still make far more sense than in a mecha setting. Furthermore, while this story is set in a dystopian future, the technology that is presented in this anime is baffling. The gate bypass shown with Zero Two and Hiro might be a \"bug\" in the security, and that's acceptable. However there is no reason technology couldn't have a robot that could be piloted by a single person, and even if they can't, why would they engineer it so that people could feel pain through the Franxx? Why do they have to pilot in a doggy style? Honestly they should have the \"Ecchi\" genre because piloting the Franxx is really just a metaphor for sex. Or a metaphor for their relationship. I don't know, and frankly it doesn't work in the field of logic. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nHonestly, if the show were to get any award out of luck, it would be for art. But even then, if the art awards was simply based on the best outlines, Darling in the FranXX would potentially be a contestant. What I mean by this is that the outlining is good but the colouring feels as if the artists just used the paint bucket tool all over it and tinted the colours to fit the scene. Alright maybe that was an exaggeration seeing that I believe most anime are like that, but the art in this anime seemed to feel... bland. Furthermore, the colouring of the main cast's Franxx in comparison to the other teams' Franxx is questionable: If the teams were meant to fight with each other in Franxx, why do the main cast's Franxx have the colour palette of power-ranger suits? (Probably for merchandise or to let the audience know that there are main characters inside them). Well, the action scenes have some commendable merit, but I've watched all of Naruto and most of Naruto Shippuden a long time ago, and I can say that their action is better than Darling in the FranXX by a very large margin. Also the art seems to vary quite a lot. I've seen massive, detailed explosions, the vast, bleak but well-created environment, and the detailed flowers on the table close to the window in the anime, however I remember more flat colours in the anime than I could recall detailed patterns. I believe that the story and art don't correlate. The budget is in action, but the writing is in drama. I would like to make a small nitpick though, at the first episode Zero Two was bleeding red blood from her head. What's important was that later, Zero Two was shown to be bleeding BLUE blood. Which colour is it???\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nHuh? Sound?\\n\r\nAll the sounds that I could hear in one episode are the intro, cool sound effects, people talking, and that soft background music turned down to 25% in adobe after effects. I'm not saying that I watch the anime with my eyes closed and my ears wide open, but I'm saying that the sound does not make more of an impact than it should. If there's a fight scene going down, that \"music\" is either toned down just because the anime producers are too afraid that the music will drown out the voices and sound effects. Or when Hiro fights again after discovering a diamond in the rough, that epic music is also toned down. I don't remember the music as much as say Boku no Hero Academia's OST, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's OST, or even Monster Girl Quest OST. It's just my opinion, but it's not my fault that I don't feel hyped, sad, or anything more when sound exists in this anime as it is. That one memorable part of a soundtrack that really makes you powerful, like probably in Attack on Titan or The Avengers? It sticks into your head and makes you want to cheer for the good side. Darling in the FranXX? I didn't hear that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nAs the story revolves around the relationship between the protagonist and heroine, Shrek does it better. The main character is a fumbled mess, he gets depresso, the heroine gives the protagonist a figurative espresso (or maybe a little \"something\" better than espresso), and then somehow he defeats the monsters with the same robot he failed to defeat them with, only with more power than all of the gods combined in Norse Mythology. See, I've vaguely repeated this part in the story section, however the part I want to focus on is how Hiro is an obnoxious dude who despite literally everyone else telling him not to pilot with Zero Two, Hiro nonchalantly says \"Nope, gonna do it\". Zero Two is in the same boat, pushing everyone away and doing everything, even harming others to just be with Hiro. But when Hiro sees the suffering Zero Two caused to his friends, he runs away in fear, making Zero Two all sulky for sympathy points from the audience. And then they get back together. There is initially no reason why they should bond with each other, and then later it was revealed that there is a reason, but it has been forgotten. Okay I concede that how they executed this idea didn't impact the story much, however what grounds does Hiro have with Zero Two that makes him attracted to her in the first episode? The only sane person with the guts to stand against her is a comrade to Hiro, named Ichigo, who despite her backstory as a childhood friend and wants to be with Hiro, is nonetheless a passing thought in Hiro's mind, just another love interest, just another background character, just someone else, and later just another \"cockblocker\", as named by the audience. Ichigo was trying to pull Hiro out from the danger, but due to the anime god being so merciful on bland self-insert protagonists, Hiro only thinks that piloting with Zero Two is the only way he's be of any use. The score for character is only a one just because of Ichigo, I wanted to rate this lower. All the other characters are basically cliches, I believe the other characters were Naruto, Fatso, Iida-kun, guy from Koe no Katachi, and I forgot the rest. There are literally three memorable characters in the anime, and two of them are assholes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nAs I stated in the beginning, I usually watch anime before bedtime, but boy... I don't feel so good.\\n\r\nThe clock will strike midnight, but before it does, seven hours earlier I pass out due to a sleep-inducing drug called \"Darling in the FranXX\"\\n\r\nHonestly, if you're into mediocre mecha fights with pointless, jumbled drama and having the protagonist being watched by God as the protagonist gets revived over and over with newfound strength, you could maximise your enjoyment with this anime. I didn't enjoy it but don't take my word for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is a twisted and disfigured project made in chaos and stuck together with sticky tape. I would like to rate this a 1, however I can give merit for its effort to attempt to disguise a mecha sci-fi drama anime as another bland ecchi anime. Sure it's one of those anime where the main character gets the girl, but then what? Maybe if our real world society states that \"Nothing matters if we just love each other\" I could understand the direction it went in, but realistically it's not going to happen. I would laze around all day with a picture of my waifu and I would rise to the middle of society if I love it so much.\\n\\n\r\nSure, this review seems like a essay-long rant, but at the end of the day I'm just giving my opinion: make what you do now that you have read this.\\n\\n\r\nOh also play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, it's basically a game that lives up to its hype, unlike Darling in the FranXX.",

And after all of that (and even more) she (and the show) has the audacity playing the victim when she finally has to pay for her actions.\\n\\n\r\nBut you might be saying right now,\"she actually regrets treating her darling like shit\" and you would be right, she doesn't regret treating Hero the boy who was always supportive of her and killing all the previous parasites. She only starts to feel regret when she discovers that that fodder she didn't care about and was about to mindlessly kill just happened to be her darling.\\n\\n\r\nShe doesn't care that Hiro cared about her and didn't see her like a monster , NO IT HAS TO BE THAT ONE SPECIFIC KID SHE MEET 10 FUCKING YEARS AGO,AND IF IT TURNS OUT MY CURRENT FUCKBUDDY ISN'T THE KID I'LL KILL HIM JUST BECAUSE.\\n\\n\r\n02 doesn't feel like a tragic and flawed character that even though she makes various mistakes and sometimes acts out of selfish love we can sympathise with her like, for example, Homura Akemi,but no,02 feels like spoiled,self-centered brat that starts crying and screaming when something doesn't go her way,ever since she meets Hiro she has had dozens and dozens of time that she could at least tried to befriend,but no,the poor girl has very specific tastes and if she doesn't like her partner she'll kill him,if you really think about it she is the real victim here (sarcasm).\\n\\n\r\nb-b-b-but the adult and the parasites treat her like monsters:no,the only adults that treated poorly where the scientists,who eventually started treating her like the second coming of jesus,and in the case of the parasites there is only one instances of other parasites treating her poorly,and that is squad 26 who only hate her for being responsible for the death of one of their comrade (those fucking bastards).\\n\r\nIn fact,when she returns to her previous partners,the alphast,they are waiting for her with 10 new stamen (wich she kills without hesitation) as a welcome gif.\\n\r\nNot to mention how stupid her motivation is,she wants to become human,but why,her darling didn't care about her appearance,is it because of the book,but the whole point of the fucking book is that it matter if the girl changed her appearance as long as she was still a soul-eating monster,(the book also skips the part where the girl kills one hundre innocent men in order to change her appearance)\\n\\n\r\nYou know,it's hard to feel sorry for a character when all she does is make stupid decisions and feel sorry for herself without caring about all the people she is hurting directly and indirectly.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've established the 02 is a piece of shit lets get back to Hiro and his relationship with her.\\n\\n\r\nHiro is the textbook definition of someone who suffers from codependency, he can't live without 02,he can't experience joy,happines,fulfillment if he isn't with her,she is the only thing in his mind and he is willing to go on a suicide mission just to see her again (two days after she tried to kill him),to anyone who knows what stockholm syndrome is this might sound like a perfect example of it,and that Hiro is in serious need of psychiatric help,but the show begs to differ,the show sees his obsesion with 02 as sing of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe funny thing is that,there is a character that I actually feel really sorry for:Ikuno,now,remember how the Franxx could only be piloted by       \\n\r\nmale-female pair?,at one point you probably thought \"wait,what if one of them is gay,how would they feel?\",Ikuno is the answer to that question,the sad thing about Ikuno is that she can't do nothing about her situation,if she comes out she would probably be killed in the spot,so the only thing she can do is suffer in silence,resignated to be alone without any chance of getting her feelings reciprocated,now that's  tragic.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if they will ever bring up her sexuality,and,even though I would love to see her come out of the closet and openly challange binary nature of the franxx,I am wary that they might not treat the subject matter with the most delicated of thouches,honestly,I wouldn't be suprised if it turns out that the reason she is a lesbian is because a boy was mean to her,so now she hates men,but is eventually cured by futoshi.",

            "content": "This is by far the worst thing trigger has ever made and should not be hyped up at all, and I am happy this shows overall rating has been dropping since it does deserve an 8 in the slightest. This review is about halfway through the series, I will edit it once the show ends but I can tell that it will not be much.\r\nArt 4\\10\r\nYou would think that studio trigger and A-1 would make good animation and they do, but they both have conflicting styles so the art just turns out slobish and mediocre. The anime falls flat for 2018, and the fight sceneslook like they are from 08, took everything from kill la kill that did well in the fight scenes and  reversed it.\\n\r\nStory 4\\10\\n\r\nWe really do not get much world building, the story is kinda thrown out for the most part after episode 1, we will learn more but I am pretty sure most theories out there have it correct and to be honest, its not interesting at all just poorly made sex jokes by this point.\\n\r\nSound 3\\10\\n\r\nI really love how the most memorable track was the first ending, they took it out after six episodes and kept the OP nobody liked. The OST is just generic nothing notable or enjoyable and unlike most of triggers work, nobody I know who is a fan cares about the music in this series unlike other works.\\n\r\nCharacters 3\\10\\n\r\nZero 2 is a great character, I like her and I would rate her highly. Now everyone else is just a borderline 1 out of ten so thats why I am putting the score this low. Generic trope characters, the MC is a budget kirito and he makes me wanna vomit. I have never hated a cast this much until the first time I saw school days. The fact they do not know about love hurts me even more watching this, its pure cringey seeing the interactions and to be honest, I hate the whole female cast with a passion and darling in the cuck every episode instead of actual mecha fights or something important.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2\\10\\n\r\nThis whole show rides on zero 2, they have less zero 2 thus the series went to shit. This is the worst mecha anime I have ever seen, the mecha parts are disgusting and the worst I have ever seen in my life. I do not consider it a mecha even just a pure insult.The mecha's come on and my eyes bleed, the characters are just awful and honestly I am hoping for improvement.\\n\r\nOverall 3\\10 \\n\r\nThis series is overhype and it got that way because of zero 2, without her this anime would be rated overall a 6 while airing and go progressively worse. Anyone familiar with trigger or a decent anime taste can see this is overhyped and not worth a dime, easily the worst mecha anime I have ever seen because they threw out the mecha part for terribly made sex jokes and I like sex jokes, they are all just cringey and awfully made in darling in the cuck. Too much cuckery as well and I do not mean that as a joke, I mean actual cucking in this series happens quite often, and as someone who is not into any NTR or cucking it disgusts me, I can't enjoy this show.",

            "content": "A story is divided into: narrative, plot and concept. It is normal to confuse a poor execution of plot and a bad narrative, consequently, with a poor concept, nevertheless there can be a great concept with a very bad execution; but this is not the case with Darling in the FRANXX.\r\nDiTF has a bad, absurd, concept; but this is not the major problem. It is possible to have an absurd concept and have a great source of entertainment, after all, the absurd is interesting to watch; as long as the absurdity is not sold as something that should be taken seriously, and that is theproblem here. Darling in the FRANXX sells a concept of world-building that spits in your face while wearing a purplish galaxy clown costume and still wants to be taken seriously.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FRANXX is far from entertaining, much less a serious show.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a whole construction of the world that refers to a -vague- criticism of society, with emphasis on the vague, because it is no more than that; tries to reach something, a message underneath the cloths but only for the sake of S I M B O L Y S M.\\n\\n\r\nBut you did not get the message!\\n\\n\r\nYes I understood and all I saw was an anime trying at all costs to sell the image of intelligent without being in; fact; intelligent. Darling in the FRANXX is nothing but a patchwork of Evangelion, Gurren Lagann and Eureka Seven; a lot of flaps that do not mix and that do not work well.\\n\\n\r\nWe have two concepts, two cores, which do not connect at all and that is why 45% of all the mess that this anime is; the first core being what is presented to us until the ep. 20 and the second core, which practically arises out of nothing, in ep. 21 ... the two concepts have absolutely nothing to connect them in a way that works, throughout all plot twists (which is where all the narrative bets, another fatal error) and it is not at all natural to think that the signs have always been there, right under our noses; with every plot twist that is presented to us, we only feel more underestimated as a viewer and as a thinking human! At no time do we get the feeling that things are happening in an ergonomic way, develops from kicks... only for the anime to sell itself as smart.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FRANXX tries so hard to be more of a classic; like Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann and Evangelion, tries so much that forgets what makes a classic indeed a classic:\\n\r\nCoherence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at no time do we see coherence throughout any narrative development; either by the design of the mechas, by the -ride- jokes, by the construction of the world, and by the -absurd- ignorance of the children who know what romanticism but do not know what a kiss is (and I will not even get into the instinctive question that any animal possesses to know where to put his pipi). \\n\\n\r\nCoherence is where DiTF fails terribly, it's your second mistake and, then we have the error of narrative pacing. Everything in the narrative is out of place, to begin with that the explanation of world is in the middle of the anime when it should be in the first episodes, that is, Darling in the FRANXX also suffers from: out-pacing.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps, throughout all the suffering to finalize this anime, something has caught my attention; the characters, even in the midst of all the drama (in which the viewer is not taken care of at any moment) was what led me to continue watching. The characters do not have any development (except for Kokoro and Mitsuro, doubtfully), but it led me to think that:\\n\\n\r\n1. If DiFT did not sell itself seriously;\\n\r\n2. If the two concepts were worked out properly;\\n\r\n3. And, especially, if the narrative were performed at the right time;\\n\\n\r\nMaybe we would have an acceptable anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the case: Darling in the FRANXX is absurdly bad.\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off with a small disclaimer: I am but a humble plebeian who simply enjoys good storytelling and compelling characters. If you are expecting to find a tear-down of why this show is bad, go somewhere else. I will try to be fair, but know that this review comes from a place of praise rather than cutting criticism. Also, I watched this show after it had been fully released, so this review is for all those who did not have to wait weekly for an episode to come out (or however it was released).\r\nThis anime surprised me in a lot of ways. Iwas surprised to find that after watching about 10 episodes, I checked what the fans thought of this show, and was astounded to find that this anime only has a dismal 7.5/10. I came expecting something along the lines of Pacific Rim, and was surprised to find something much more than that. I wasn't expecting how they would develop the story, and there were many times when I thought they were just going to end it, but oh wait, there's 12 more episodes (which was good in my mind)! I was surprised to find myself actually crying at merely thinking about the show afterwards; and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nI got far more from this show than the shallow sex-mech show people portrayed it to be. I was glad I gave it the usual 3-episode treatment and didn't let other's criticism taint my view of the show, as this show had me asking all the right questions about the world and characters to keep me vested beyond those first three episodes, which I would say is crucial to any well-made story. The way the world was portrayed was organic, without the usual full-episode information-dump other shows employ, but rather through character dialogue and observation. While the overall feel I got at first was like Pacific-Rim mashed with Elfen Lied and Evangelian (I actually have never seen the latter, so forgive my ignorance) with a touch of Anthem (by Ayn Rand), it brought something new to the table for me in how it portrayed all those differing ideas.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that people portrayed it as a sex-mech show earlier, and this is something I can maybe see where they get the impression from, but where I think people may have mistook this show. At first they really hinge on piloting the Franxx (and yes it seems a bit sexual initially), but later on there is in fact a large portion that is just the characters learning to live together as a community and has nothing to do with piloting the Franxx. Even the supposed sexual nature that we see at the beginning is explained in much more detail later, and really shows that all along you were supposing the wrong things.\\n\\n\r\nThey did well showing how each character would react to their given situation, and to me the characters didn't feel cookie-cutter at all. What you thought one character would do is subverted by instead what another character did which affected how the original character reacted to a situation, giving you this sense of how developed each character is. Or at least, that the writers took time and effort to show how each character would react, making the characters feel more dimensional than the usual cliched, flat, dead-panned responses. You have some of the initial tropes, like the audacious go-getter, the sheepish girl, the bookworm, the smart and intellectual guy and girl, and then the crazy new girl (among others); but they expand and develop these characters to be so much more than the initial tropes you thought they were.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is starting to get a bit long, so let me end it with a few more short points:\\n\r\n1. The love story in this was spectacular, and while some might argue that it was a bit cliche, isn't that what any love story is? Romance is about two people falling in love. And if that's cliche, then life might as well be cliche because people are born, live, then die. How utterly monotonous (says the sarcastic me).\\n\r\n2. Towards the end there were a few twists, which may have felt slightly (I hate to use the word again) cliche, but one which I could embrace because it was so interesting I wanted to see what happened next.\\n\r\n3. I've never written a review for an anime, but this made me want to, especially seeing how much crap people were throwing at it. Which for me speaks volumes.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, this is now ranked among my top favorite anime (of which there are few, and only one of which affected me to the same degree this one has). The love story made me wish that some day I could have so deep a love for someone else as what the characters had, it had me laughing and crying, it moved me, and it told a heartfelt story about what it means to live a full life. To me, that's more than I could have ever expected from this story, and I hope I can soak in more stories that move me in the same way this one has.",

This series has a few really creative elements and is very engaging with only three exceptions:\r\n1) Some of the characters are solid tropes... not too terrible, but annoying.\r\n2) The mechas have eyes and mouths. It's a terrible design choice and the trend needs to stop. It breaks immersion and looks stupid and childish.\r\n3) There's nothing that tanks a show faster than completely unnecessary and in-your-face fanservice. The idea that it takes both male and female to pilot a mech could have worked, but forcingher to bend over in doggy position, using her as a control stick, and all the talk about them entering them when activating (complete with sexual moaning) is just too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'm enjoying the show, but I'm watching it alone because it's practically an ecchi show. Apparently the mangaka or anime studio didn't think the story wasn't good enough to sell itself. Too bad.",

            "content": "Darling in the Franxx began with so much potential, much of which can be attributed to the team's past works, with Gurren Lagann being one of my favorite anime of all time. Darling in the Franxx begins with decent marks, with a straightforward \"get in the mecha, shinji\"-esque plotline. \r\nHowever my enjoyment and overall excitement for the show dramatically increased with the introduction of side characters, the largest of these being the introduction of the 'Nines' and the 'Klaxosaur Princess'. However, I was slowly let down in this regard because none of these characters actually recieved any attention whatsoever and were moreso just thrown intothe story as filler, with the only development of them coming from seemingly nowhere with nothing to support their dramatic change in character. \\n\\n\r\nMy other gripe with this show is the plotline in general. As of episode 10 I was lead to believe that this was going to be a story about overcoming the dystopian society and 'breaking out' per-say. However, past episode 10 we never see the inner workings of the society or the mastermind's motivations for creating this system. Instead we receive the most irritatingly slow 8 or so episodes all centered around the love interests of Squad 13. This is what kills the show for me. Instead of integrating the extremely interesting dynamics of the world, or developing new characters such as the ones listed above, we receive a \"love interest of the week\" style show where a different character falls in love every single fucking episode. And yes, I understand that the main motif of this series is \"what it means to be human\", HOWEVER, it is completely unnecessary to have as many love stories as this show has in order to achieve that motif. My main problem with this is the love that develops between 2 certain characters, as unlike the others, they haven't been together since childhood, and haven't even been piloting together for more than a month(?). It comes seemingly out of nowhere yet this is the side character love interest that the story chooses to develop the most! The 8 episodes in the middle of this series are just completely useless in developing the story of the show and by elaborating on the love interests within squad 13, the show neglects the cool and interesting plots and characters that are elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, just rewatch Gurren Lagann as it does everything this show does but without all the bullshit.",

            "content": "I feel like Darling in the FranXX was badly read, and although I don't feel particularly strong to it (the score is very barely an 8), what the anime actually ended up doing is lost inside what was expected it should do, and also in how derivative it was in regard to what it was perceived as its influences.\r\n(This review contains spoilers)\r\nThere's a quote from Kurt Vonnegut in his Paris Review interview that explains what is so frustrating about Darling in the FranXX's story: \"If a lover in a story wins his true love, that\u2019s the end of the tale, even if World War IIIis about to begin, and the sky is black with flying saucers.\" Vonnegut is saying this pejoratively, about how a love story consumes is context and renders the surroundings void. It's how he explains why he doesn't writes love stories. Darling in the FranXX is a love story.\\n\\n\r\nBut to tell this story, it was created a whole universe with an extensive background of cosmic proportions, of ancient advanced races in a million years old war: but this war doesn't concern us. Humans are somewhat neutral (morally, at least) victims of this war, appearing through evolution in the wrong planet, and then used by the big evil alien devouring space conscience as pawns in this conflict. This use happens through cloning, control and overall emotional abuse of teenagers, created and trained to sacrifice themselves to their monarch or god but actually alien overlord. A big part of the cruelty of APE's control of their lives is the negation of their emotions, and the wiping of their memories.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this actually impacts the themes of the anime in several ways:\\n\\n\r\n1) Structurally, the episodes of the anime are dedicated to the relationship of the characters in a greater proportion than the cosmic arc that appears at the end. Most of this cosmic backstory is actually told via two intensively expositive episodes. I don't feel like this is neither rushed nor bad, but actually an expression of the show's intent (being a love story).\\n\\n\r\n2) The anime touches on several classic anime philosophic tropes: what it means to be human (or monster), what are the characters place inside those societies, and so on. Those are answered with a single word: Love. Is this a good answer? Probably not. But it is an answer.\\n\\n\r\n3) Love is actually what differentiates humanity in this conflict between VIRM and the klaxosaurus. For one, love is the answer to VIRM's proposition of incorporation, and a life of tranquility in a spacial consciousness -- instead of losing oneself in a big, amorphous consciousness, we connect with each other through love, achieving an oneness that is actually stronger, and more fulfilling, than VIRM's alternative. This is the one-winged bird metaphor that opens and guides the series. Second, klaxosaurus answer to VIRM's invasion was to abdicate of individuality and transform its population into either magma-energy, or giant war machines in wait for the next phase of the war. What is significant between those two approaches is that they're both about power. What is different in humanity's approach is that it very much isn't.\\n\\n\r\n4) This leads us to the end stretch: Zero Two goes to fight the VIRM out of love for Hiro. It's not particularly to save the world, not particularly out of a sense of duty. Hiro joins her out of love, so that she doesn't suffers alone, out of the promise to love her and be with her. There is no need to defeat the VIRM for their fight isn't about power, but about protecting humanity's life choice. And this they do. The end is about rebuilding life: life beginning out of love (i.e. babies), negating the exploration of other species (stopping the use of magma-energy). Meta-textually, is about retreating from a sci-fi future to a simple, old and organic one, leaving the big robots to gather moss and devoting themselves to agriculture and so forth. Is also, and very paramount, about living without the fear of death (which is what APE used to enslave humanity to begin with), which is also a very important point of japanese philosophy.\\n\\n\r\n5) And Zero Two and Hiro's love is so strong that, even as they sacrifice everything to save the world (and to be together), their souls spend centuries voyaging through the universe, until they find each other again, now as a part of a humanity that their love has saved. But now Zero Two can love in peace, without the pain of feeling like a monster, and they both without having to be war heroes. They are allowed to achieve what the anime posits as the climax of humanity's way of life: Love.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think those points answer if this is a good anime (I think it is, somewhat), but I wrote mostly as a way to defend that, for an anime that is so defined by its influences, I feel like its originality is actually being lost in the static created by those influences, and it deserves, at least, a fair shot.",

            "content": "A bit of advice before watching this show? Stop after the first 6 episodes. Seriously, because it is all down hill from there. Well, if you wanna watch the beach episode then stop after 7 eps. If the show had only been 6 episodes then this review would have been like a 9 maybe even a 10. I loved it...... and then it kept going, and going, and filler episodes kept happening until Trigger realized, \"Oh shit we only have 5 episodes left and we haven't done anything.\" Lets see what happened. \r\n**This will contain spoilers**\r\nThe story is complicated in that you can separate itinto 5 arcs. \\n\r\nThe first arc is the 6 episode introduction. The world is lost and whats left of humanity gets around in giant mobile cities. The energy these cities run off of, attracts monsters. So the cities are defended by robots, piloted by young-ish teens. For the teens, this is the highest honor and if you cannot pilot, then you are a waste of space. This is the main characters problem until he meets a weird horned girl, known as the partner killer. The story over the first 6 episodes, is that \"can this MC survive the 3 ride minimum with this girl.\" The rest of the cast tries to stop him and keep him alive. Over the arc we learn about a love quadrangle. The first arc is almost perfectly paced and stuffed with emotion and story. \\n\r\nThen we hit the second arc, and it is a big boot on the breaks as we are given 6 episodes of essentially filler. Gone is the focus of robot battle, in is the struggle of teen angst, antics and relationships. Some of these episode are fun, but keep in mind that watching this as it came out meant over a month of no serious development. It was a world full of questions and we were getting almost nothing. \\n\r\nThe third arc is 2 episodes and they are GREAT. We learn about the past that the main character and the horned girl share and that they were linked by destiny.... or an STD or something.\\n\r\nThen we get the third arc and guess what? its 7 MORE FILLER EPISODES. Including 2 \"special non-episodes.\" Sure over this time, there are some things revealed and relationships deepened. However, its not the main characters, its two side characters that get the spotlight for most of this arc. \\n\r\nThen finally we get into the rushed, horribly paced/explained 5 ep. ending arc. Here the story takes a sharp right, as Trigger tries to turn the show around with a Gurren Lagann style space war between two galactic powers.... OUT OF NOWHERE. The only reason we see this coming, is that all Trigger's shit expands into space. But this time to shake things up, they do not show you the battle. ALL OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS STAY ON EARTH AND START LITERALLY FARMING INSTEAD OF IN SPACE WITH ROBOTS FIGHTING. Then in the last episode they go \"OH SHIT, WE'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND WE NEED TO GO TO SPACE.\" The last ep is the worst paced episode by a mile. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the saving graces of the show. It is consistently good to great. Both the animation and artwork holds up until around the end when it just turns into a bunch of laser shooting. One thing I noticed is that for an important scenes the camera switches to a widescreen shot. This is an interesting choice. However, after a while you become conditioned to not pay as hard attention unless the widescreen is on. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not very noticeable outside of fight scene music. The mood music and sound effects are not really emphasized. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters seemed very tropey to me. This is where other peoples enjoyment may differ from mine. However, I did not hate these characters at first and wanted to know more. Then as the show goes on, you learn that they only have one or two defining characteristics and cannot hold up the amount of filler demanded by them. I do not think characters like miku or zorome ever get any development. They are pretty much the same for 24 episodes. There is also a group of \"rival elites\" who never get any development. The show wants them to be important but does nothing to help build them. There is also never a fight between the MC's and these elites. Then on the last episode the elites decide to help the MC's and sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Even though their face turn was done mostly off screen. It is like trigger forgot to write these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that this show would have been better if it were 12 episodes, they cut out the rival elite characters and slowly told us the story instead of doing long stretches of NOTHING, followed by literal plot dump episodes. I am very disappointed in Darling in the Franxx and so far it is 0-2 for trigger flagship shows. I did not like Kill La Kill for similar reasons, but I can at least see why people liked that show. I do not know how anyone can defend this show. Thank goodness for Space Patrol Luluco and Little Witch or I would avoid Trigger like the plague in the future.",

Ughh.. what a huge disappointment this is. And oh btw! There are some SPOILERS AHEAD so read at your own volition.\r\nOkay so here we go! Let me explain something here first (gonna do some rants about this). This anime is trying its best/hardest to connect on certain veiwers (mostly teens) which they clearly destroyed and ruined the whole show by putting stupid plot twist and stupid ideas incorporate with some super cliche moments and afew fanservice (wtf dude we are tired of this sh*t) too cringy. I bet the guys who made this has not yet hit their puberty such immature amateurs. I wanna punch somebody in the face! Who should i punch? I know who! The director! What a waste of a good anime with lots of potential only destroyed by bad directors. Whats the rush? Are you trying to put SukaSuka, Evangelion, IBO all in one go? Wtf. (Btw those animes mentioned are one of the Best)\\n\\n\r\nStory: To be Honest! At first Darling in the Franxx was a hype! Everyone talks about it, because it was cool to see new characters with interesting personalities, that was also my first impression, but it changed from 9 to 2. \\n\\n\r\nSo the story goes on about a boy (Hiro) who just lost his ability to ride a Franxx he then wanders around and then suddenly met this beautiful girl named Zero Two which turns out to be a humanoid Klaxosaur Sapien or something bla3x which is also a (SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT SAY IT? OH FK IT!) a clone of 001 the princess of the Klaxosaurs (their mortal enemy at first but then not, its so f'n confusing). So many twist! I can't stand it anymore! I dunno what its all about or what does this anime trying to do? Sadly i felt no connection at all. Btw, to cut the story short (WARNING MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!) they both died in the end and the Villians Escaped. Like yeah they just escaped like woooosh! Goodbye muddafackers!! And vowing to return again in their new Super Saiyan form i mean evolutionized body and F*CK THINGS UP again. Don't worry guys we have DRAGON BALLS we can revive them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is the only part where its good at, and its the Art department i couldn't agree more how beatiful it was, but what's a Monaliza a masterpiece if it's in the trashbin. Wasted such good art on such stupid plot. I give it a 9 just to give some justice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: uhh.. after hearing the OPEDOST in first few eps i skipped it til the end. I did not like it at all 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEjoyment: did i enjoy? Well it's a BIG NO. Nope! Nadda! It's borring, to be honest it has no sense of direction, and when its right til the last few eps they slammed everything in like wtf is happening!?.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: i wish they would make a remake or atleast an alternative version of this with a better plot and ending and i would gladly watch it, btw you should watch GUNDAM IRON BLOODED ORPHANS (DITFRANxx is just a RipOff of this anime) i recommend you to watch it if you haven't, I highly recommend it, it has way more character developments and the MC is a F*cking Badass.

            "content": "Normally I don't write reviews unless I feel something needs to be said. This is one of those times. \r\nThe first few episodes of the series had me thinking this was just another anime light porn setup disguised as a mecha series. However the longer the series ran the more it was obvious there was much more to it.\r\nStory: Consistently written. Confusing at first until you have all of the information, then it makes perfect sense. I know a lot of people think this is some propaganda by the government of Nippon/Japan, but it hit home for me as a U.S. citizen. Blind devotion, unquestioningsacrifices. There's a lot to unpack but it's worth the effort.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The fight scenes are very well done. The characters and the machines are given equal attention. Nothing feels like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music fit the anime really well. There were no standout songs but it was still pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main characters felt real. They are children tasked with adult roles and behave accordingly. You feel empathy even for the side characters, which isn't common.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is one of those series I'm sure I'll come back to for a rewatch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Again, there are some reviews that seem to follow a disturbing trend of bashing shows because they saw one thing one one website that told them it was bad. This is not the case. \"Darling in the Franxx\" is a show that should be watched and judged on its own merit and not the whim of others.",

            "content": "The art gets a pass. That's everything positive I have to say about this mess of a series.\r\nDuring it's mid-section I kind of enjoyed the plot because they started to focus on the characters a bit, but I don't want to talk about it because then episode 19 and 20 happened and that's all you need to know.\r\nThere is a certain level of 'asspulling' that can be believable and not immersion-breaking, but this show takes the cake in taking that line and smashing it beyond recognition. For a show that spent a lot of time on worldbuilding and establishing characters, they did their damn hardestto throw it all into the wind.\\n\r\nEverything up to episode 19 is mediocre at best with some flickers of enjoyment, which would usually warrant a 2/10 at least, but then episodes 20-24 happened. The worst episodes I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThey start off episode 20 just normally, but around the 15 minute mark they just go APEshit (see what I did there) and shit out like 6 copout/stolen plottwists in the span of the episode's final 5 minutes. I was baffled and proceded to rant about it with someone I met on Misty/Chronexia's Discord server.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 21 didn't make it much better by killing of a potentially interesting character which we had little to no exposure to and in the end they kind of suggested that 002 was dead.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 22 was a lot of edgy bullcrap with Hiro 'Not wanting to live without 002' which is probably a perfect TVtropes entry for him. In the end they take off to get him to 002 because they speculated that maybe somehow Strelizia Apus needs a male pilot to function properly too and based on that assumption alone, they took off.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 23: of course they were right. Big dumb uninspired space battle with those lazy round anime explosions that look totally ass but are there to suggest a lot of explosions at once. And when Hiro finally got 'INSIDE 002', Strelizia Apus for some reason becomes 002 in the flesh but it looks like a wedding dress and if for just one second you think about 'Yeah why would it work like that' or 'How is it designed like that' and your immersion is shattered. And there was also a conveniently placed Warpgate, which has been totally established to be a thing and is integrally woven into the plot.\\n\r\nI once again took to Discord to rant.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 24 is the toddlershit cherry on top of a mudcake. Starting out, 002 and Hiro travel through space for years and 002 weirdly reminded me of spongebob in that episode where Squidward told him to be more 'normal'. All the edges and quirks in her personality are gone. She has been bleached and is an eternally white canvas.\\n\r\nFor some reason Hiro became tired around the 700 day mark and he fell asleep during the final battle. What a coincidence. But don't you worry, power of friendship is there to help you. They literally gather around 002s petrified body and establish some kind of bond and they can suddenly hear each other?? Which wasn't a thing before when they stood around the statue... Then they transformed two more times and rekt the VIRM planet, which was weirdly unsatisfying because the actual VIRM entity still lives on.\\n\r\nThen they robbed us of all the character development by just slapping tangentially related characters onto older looking versions of our character's bodies and timeskipped themselves put of having to show any form of character development.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the ending... oh boy the ending. COPOUT is all I have to say. 'And another story begins'.\\n\\n\r\nI have intentionally ranted about this as an isolated series up until now because this would have turned into an incoherent mess had I just added 'COPOUT' or 'RIPOFF' at every point where it was appropriate.\\n\r\nIt's a giant mess of Eva's plot, Gurren Lagann's presentation and there's a bit of Kill la Kill as well with the sexual undertones, though I can't say that Eva didn't have those either.",

            "content": "Darling in the FranXX is quite the wild story that kept me questioning what would happen next at the end of each episode. [Minor Spoilers]\r\nSTORY 7/10:\r\nThe first part of the story is a frenzy of emotions with Hiro who is about to fail as a parasite himself discovering the woman who will forever change his life, Zero Two. It seems pretty cliched and lighthearted from that point going forward- they learn more about each other, their relationship grows, etc. But Hiro and Zero Two's relationship isn't what makes it special. Seriously, when the whole \"destiny\" factor is taken out it's really all just platonic truelove.\\n\\n\r\nThe story thrives with the other characters of Squad 13 learning about these emotions that Hiro is experiencing with Zero Two, finding remnants of the past in the Garden and learning new things, and seeing destroyed structures of the past while on their trip to the beach. The way the Squad reacts to all this is what makes them who they are and fills up the first part of the anime. I'll say more on them in the Character sect.\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the story is where Trigger adds their usual side of craziness to the mix. This part gets a lot of hate for being all over the place and pretty hectic. Honestly though, they just swapped from an anime that focused on the romance complex with a side of Mecha to one that dealt less with the romance and more with the Sci-Fi part of the series. All the questions that arose in the first part of the show couldn't have been answered then, but, with what had happened to start the second part, DiF set itself up to answer everything that we had been wondering from the very beginning. The relationships between the characters remained generally unchanged throughout this part, so they focused on the origins of the world and what Squad 13 would do to change it from that point on. Even if it was quite sudden and nothing extraordinary, it was decent and ended the anime on a note where some questions (mainly one about VIRM) remained but still would satisfy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 7/10:\\n\r\nThe characters all grew in their own way and were generally ideal protagonists from the start, from when Hiro named them to when they lived in as unique a place as the Garden. They are decent as characters themselves but their individual growth is where they truly shine. I'll just quickly analyze Squad 13 and Zero Two:\\n\\n\r\nHiro: a generic protagonist with really nothing outstanding about him besides his relations with Zero Two. He's more of a plot device that spreads his new experiences about what makes someone human to the rest of the squad (once again via his relationship with Zero Two).\\n\\n\r\nIchigo: regardless of popular belief, she isn't bad at all. In a matter of fact she grew the most out of the squad, learning about jealousy, trying to deal with it in every possible way until she just can't anymore, and coming to an acceptance with her unrequited feelings for Hiro. She becomes the best leader that she can for the squad and learns how to deal with the insane decisions that Hiro makes in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuru: he literally changed so much it kinda scares me. I had assumed that he'd be a quiet spiteful character but in turn he actually became very passionate after coming to terms with Hiro and finally realizing his reason to live. Even after what happens to them he's able to find the same light in his life and takes from Zero Two and Hiro's relationship to make the most of his and show his true caring self.\\n\\n\r\nGoro: his persistence and unwavering feelings for Ichigo, almost like Hiro's for Zero Two (just not as extreme), defines his personality. A brave co-leader, someone who can keep the squad in shape and keep himself in shape too. He's a very rational person who uses this to help others with their feeling and decisions.\\n\\n\r\nZorome: a bit of comic relief but also pretty naive at first, always believing in the authorities decisions, no matter how irrational they were. He learns about independence and adapts to the many situations in which he can't rely on Papa by instead relying on his own friends.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro: a lot of her changes include spoilers, so in general what's significant about her is what she learns about the past world and her curiosity to recreate what she reads about, practically to the point where she'll do whatever she can to understand what she doesn't through experience.\\n\\n\r\nFutoshi: a bit like Ichigo's complex with Hiro, and just like her he grows from it and becomes filled with a passion to motivate what he can't attain for the happiness of the person he holds unrequited feelings for, Kokoro.\\n\\n\r\nMiku: she's a bit like Zorome with her behavior but less reluctant to leave her life in the hands of others compared to him. She was more compelled to live for herself like the others were when that time comes. Outside of that she didn't really stand out much which made her a bit of a redundant character, especially when she's a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nIkuno: she was pretty apathetic in the first part of the anime, but as things progressed she too realized what she wanted to live for (like Mitsuru), and although she herself knew that her feelings, which she had been hiding, weren't going to get any response, she comes to terms with it and uses it as her driving force to help the squad out from that point onward.\\n\\n\r\nZero Two: her internal conflicts between whether she could live for Hiro or wouldn't be able to because of their species barrier was fun to see unravel as she broke down over and over and Hiro would fix her up yet again. This alone isn't good enough to make her best girl, but with the constant strife that she goes through and is put through throughout the series shows not only her toleration but also her reluctance to give up on the treasure that she had found in Squad 13. Along with her gradual but eventual acceptance of the rest of the squad (namely Ichigo) she finds that there is a bit more tat she can live for than just Hiro. \\n\\n\r\nWith a main cast this big, some of the characters were dwelled on either poorly or quite well. Together they are just your average rebellious group, but apart they each have their own complexes that intertwine and help move the story along. That, as I said, is where these characters truly shine.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10:\\n\r\nStudios Trigger with A-1 Pictures. Honestly, what more could you want, the art of the characters and explosions easily had Trigger styled elements to them, but the scenery and landscapes were all handled by A-1. Great job overall.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10: Outside of the amazing OP and the EDs that were as good, the OSTs to DiF are okay, but nothing all too special. Nothing much besides the OPs and EDs, though some of the emotional scene music is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10: Although many people would rather watch normal romances or different Mecha anime, DiF is truly enjoyable. The first part gets you hooked with the flying emotions and the dynamic in which they are placed to create a squad that can tackle the second part with barely any setbacks. They leave you with questions after every episode (except the last of course) and answer them in their own way at the best of times.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10: Darling in the FranXX gets very discredited as a whole because of its haywire ending to the series, or the last few episodes at least. This however should never distract people that this series brought back some elements of anime that we haven't seen much of in the past couple of years. Whether you'd want to compare this with Evangelion and see what Evangelion did better than DiF is up to you, but this anime standing alone is really good and something that we probably won't be seeing in a while. It wasn't wildly innovative but it did try new things that can hook anyone to the series. It's generally easy to pickup and hard to put down even if you dislike it because it keeps you wanting more until the very end. If anything it'll leave you with a feeling disappointment compared to just plain disliking it. It's a very good series by Trigger and A-1 Pictures. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler Free - Full Series Reivew\r\nFor a moment, take Neon Genesis Evangelion and Guilty crown then try to put them together. This anime took what those two anime series failed at and made it work. If you're not into romance, then right away this series is not for you. If you're watching this series for action, then this series isn't for you either. While both of these are genres for the series, one is simply the driving force over the other and that's okay.\r\nThis is an anime that I just thought I'd give a try and wow, did I love it. It was a greatride through it all and I'd say I was mostly satisfied. Since this is spoiler free, I won't go into details, but there are some thing I would've preferred to have gone differently. But overall, this is one of the best anime of the summer.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10- The general concept of the story is good and certainly interesting. However, it isn't necessarily something new. These post-apocalyptic types of anime are popping up all of the time now. However, the story between Hiro and Zero Two is very cool and amongst the other children too. I'd say as far as the events going on with the characters, is the best part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- All around very good art. The colors and animation are very pleasing are almost never lacking.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- The soundtrack for this series is certainly nothing short of great. I can't complain about any of it, but it isn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10- This is definitely a character driven series. If you like to get into characters, then this series might be for you especially if the rest sounds intriguing. The development is astounding for all of the characters. There is definitely more focus on others and I was left a bit hanging with a couple characters at the end of the series. But that was more of my preference rather than a true critique. It is also worth mentioning that these are very likable characters that are easy to get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10- As much as I have already talked this up, 8/10 might be a little bit random. While it is a fun, cute, serious, suspenseful, and enjoyable show it isn't without some boring moments. Not to mention that some of the action is lacking. However, I've come to learn that mecha anime have not technically been very strong when it came to action--which seems slightly odd to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10- I definitely reccomend this series, if any of what I have said sounds like this series might be for you. Well, chances are it definitely is. It's always nice to have a great series going on that is so short.",

            "content": "Like most of Trigger\u2019s previous anime, Darling in the FranXX is one grand presentation in service of a greater idea or message. It\u2019s been thought through just as much as you\u2019d expect from the studio, so you can pick it apart for days on end and still be finding new visual details, dialogues, or cuts of animation that carry some level of meaning or significance that\u2019s trying to get your attention. Something that I think we can all agree on is that all Trigger shows, whether you think they\u2019re good or bad, are trying to say something specific and, more importantly in this case, they\u2019retrying to deliver that message to a very certain someone. Please know that Darling in the FranXX is no exception; if it\u2019s not trying to talk to you then it may seem lackluster, but if it just so happens that YOU ARE the target audience, then you will almost certainly fall in love with it.\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is trying to talk to romantics. It\u2019s appeasing to your sense of emotional connection, and it\u2019s equipped with a fully stocked cast of characters that are all meant to give you some form of catharsis. The setting of Darling in the FranXX is a post apocalyptic one, so the teenage characters (who are conveniently in male/female pairings) are living in military situations that are extremely mentally taxing. The melodrama that ensues from their relationships and lives as soldiers is the typical set up for emotional conflicts and their following payoffs. Every character conceit is planned, and their execution is predetermined from the start, so you\u2019ll never feel like side characters were betrayed by the writers. Everyone gets their own arc and message to tell you. The thematic takeaway for each was also very intentional, and they take good time to portray these themes when appropriate so you can both listen to what the show is saying, and learn from it. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is also trying to talk to theorists. It\u2019s appeasing to your sense of wonder and intrigue. The codified language of the show really has you asking questions from the get go, and it answers these questions periodically such that you have enough time to come up with your own conclusions, just in time for it to surprise you with a twist, or reward you with a confirmation. It\u2019s a war story set in Earth\u2019s future that has the teenage characters fighting a war against Klaxosaurs, which are basically robotic dinosaurs, on behalf of a shadowy figure they call \u201cPapa\u201d. It\u2019s all extremely interesting in nature, and your questions will drive your investment in the story: Why are the soldiers called \u201cParasites\u201d? Why are they even fighting? Who is Papa? What are Klaxosaurs? How did the world even get like this? All these questions and more will have you excited the whole time, and the plot will do nothing but throw you down the rabbit hole of mystery and discovery. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is also trying to talk to connoisseurs of animation. It\u2019s production value is through the roof, and every episode looks better than all the low effort garbage you\u2019re watching elsewhere. It\u2019s no Kyoto Animation, but it pretty much has everyone else squarely beat. Trigger\u2019s past anime such as Kill la Kill, Space Patrol Luluco, or Inferno Cop are infamous for being rather comedic and inventive with their animation; you can\u2019t say that they\u2019re technically well animated, but they work with what they have creatively enough to pass and be consistently entertaining. Darling in the FranXX IS actually well animated: It\u2019s a mecha show, and all the main character pairs have their own uniquely designed robots that are all consistently hand-drawn throughout the entire show. The environments are creative, dense, and straight up cool so you\u2019ll always be looking at art instead of a boring slate. The character animation is expressive, poppy, and generally telling of their respective personalities such that you can tell every frame had some level of care and attention to detail that most other studios simply cannot compete with. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is, lastly and most importantly trying to talk to optimists. For a show that takes place in a hopeless, desolate wasteland of a world, you\u2019d expect every scene to have a very drab feeling to it, but that\u2019s very much not the case. In fact, Darling in the FranXX boasts not one, but two fulfilling love stories that have both emotional and even sexual payoff. Both are warm and lovely to watch, but the main couple, the two main characters Hiro and Zero Two, has both more screen time and more meaning to it. If you think about it, this world that Hiro, Zero Two, and the rest of the cast live in is truly horrific, and even despite the fact that people are dying constantly around them, even despite having no volition over their own military circumstances, these kids have found a reason to keep fighting and, in each other, found warmth, relationships, and true happiness. Hiro and Zero Two even found true love, something that might inspire the others around them.\u00a0In light of these hopeful circumstances, you can find yourself questioning your own life choices and circumstances: Are you really living your life to it\u2019s fullest? Are you really being honest to the people you care about? If these two can continue fighting and loving one another in such a broken world, then what excuse do you have in a world that's still (mostly) held together? Whatever the answers to those questions are, the show still has you thinking about them, and that\u2019s what matters. I\u2019m still a virgin; I\u2019ve never kissed anyone; I\u2019ve never gone out with anyone; I\u2019ve never even held anyone\u2019s hand. I\u2019m pretty certain I know where life is going for me. Though, one day, if fate is on my side, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find my \u201cDarling\u201d, and it\u2019s stories like Darling in the FranXX that remind me of this.\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s it, yeah? \\n\r\nAll positives; no negatives? \\n\r\nPerfect ten out of ten masterpiece, right?\\n\r\nWhat are you? Stupid?\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t say Trigger.\\n\r\nThat says Trigger AND A-1 Pictures, so strap the fuck in boy and girls, because I\u2019ve got something important to tell you.\\n\\n\r\nAs it happens, the script of this anime wasn\u2019t written, in part, by Trigger staff at all. In fact, it was chiefly written and composed by A-1 Pictures. Thus, and I\u2019m really sorry to tell you this, the script is an absolute fecal tornado; It\u2019s a toilet typhoon; It\u2019s a shit squall; It\u2019s a turd tempest; It\u2019s a dung downpour; It\u2019s a manure monsoon; It\u2019s an excrement earthquake. I seriously don\u2019t have any other methods within my lexicon to express the reality of this situation to you. The script is simply BAD. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, so you got a two cour show, that\u2019s about eight hours of screen time. Long time. Now, what do you expect? If your answer is cohesion, flow, organization, or anything at all related to good pacing and satisfying execution then you couldn\u2019t be any farther from the result. Remember those ingenious plot concepts, character conceits, world building, and thematic messages I wouldn\u2019t shut up about? Well, Darling in the FranXX takes every possible pleasure in squandering all their potential in the most unnecessarily disappointing ways you could imagine with incompetent genre juggling, non-sequitur character actions and reactions, filler style episodic stories that rush character arcs, endless info dump storytelling, full flashback episodes to explain concurrent events, laughable amounts of plot-armor, fully retconned events (that were supposed to be important), contradictory narration, and a good \u2018ole switcheroo that flips the whole show on it\u2019s head in the last four episodes to rush an unearned climax out of nowhere. Plot points and characters alike become jokes to you; it\u2019s a complete and total mess. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I said before is all true: Darling in the FranXX is trying to talk to romantics looking for meaningful relationships and emotional catharsis, theorists looking for a thought provoking plot and world, connoisseurs of animation who are looking for a well animated show of epic proportions with densely drawn artwork, and optimists looking for joy, happiness, and hope. I am all off the above, and this show did successfully reach me on those levels, but it\u2019s objectively broken script and messy execution made it impossible for me to appreciate most of it\u2019s efforts. In the end, what could\u2019ve, and very well should\u2019ve been the Neon Genesis Evangelion of this generation, turned out to be the Guilty Crown of this generation. \\n\\n\r\nIt genuinely saddens me to say this, but I do not recommend you watch Darling in the FranXX. Especially if you\u2019re a Trigger fan like me; it will do nothing but disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Alright, so enough of these 6 episode reviews suddenly becoming a trusted source of information from people who think they're hired by the local news agency and got an A in one test of English class to warrant their paragraphs about every little god damn thing. I'm just gonna be as simplistic as possible but hey that's pretty much me, except I write reviews once a series is over not when it's just fucking begun.\r\nSo lets get this straight. This series is pretty much over at the time of writing this and I personally believe it's slowly descended into an overall below average anime. Ithink it started out with real potential and well worthy of being one of those weekly series which you know is gonna be interesting or like one of the \"biggies\" if you're like me and basically watch everything a season has to offer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much it's this futuristic Earth where shit has gone down because a minority of elitists with optimistic but strange characteristics have took over as rulers of the earth voluntarily and their main changes are discovering that the Earth's core can be harvested as a great alternative source of free energy, but doing so has awakened far into this future some creatures that have been attacking the colonies of humanity thought to be attracted by this earth magma that's being resourced. To defend the colonies, the Franxx pilots were introduced which are kids brought up with complete obedience to the rulers who have called themselves 'Papa.' The story follows them gaining their own conscience and realising what they're fighting for, if anything and basic philosophy of their own purposes in life, including relationships and all that shiz.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically it, of course you can trivialise and explain how much more to it there is but I couldn't care less because it would get to spoilers. I am not very experienced with Mecha genres but I really don't think there is any need to. This opening concept is pretty interesting and in the first couple or maybe half of the series it's great at building this world and the kind of environment in which these kids live, however I'd argue it's main flaw later on is abandoning this great concept and focusing too much on the character relationships which turn into a confusing shit show with it turning into some kind of waifu argument over anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of battle scenes etc are well animated. Not to the point of One Punch Man or the Gatari series or whatever, but sure it's good. Some others however feel quite confusing to watch, as during battles you may not understand what's going on with all the lasers flying everywhere and expecting that just because you hear a typical \"HEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAGH!\" from a character as they're preparing an attack in their mech, something must be going on because you sure as hell cant visually see what's happening. Sound is also pretty passable, with the voice acting being nothing to complain about and soundtracks being fitting enough but not necessarily fitting the same impact as the context on screen.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with this series is how it turns from an interesting hook on future reality to some kind of teen rom com, which although I don't shy away from usually, there's an extent where I am willing to join the ride and I did stay till the end but just to see how far it would go. I like the little relations between the characters but it just seems way to quick of a jump and ignoring the premise of what happened to this world and why things are why they are, being replaced with all these mind boggling plot lines that add pandemonium and not really being explained, leaving someone like me to go \"Wat just happened.\"\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it's a decent series and I guess you can watch it if the synopsis and theme is interesting enough but I'm just saying none of that synopsis explains anything about face mechs or random 'magic' that just happens.\\n\\n\r\nI rate an 7.5. 8 for me seems to generous seeing as I never give anything a 10 and rarely a 9. I apologise for giving as little information as possible in this so called review, but most of all I think this series requires some kind of warning to it's initial hook. It's really not concerning as you get what you see, but it really does strange, confusing and hard to find any real conclusion that you actually understand. \\n\\n",

            "content": "EDIT: tacked on some post ep-24 thoughts at the end\r\nthe short version of this review is: watch eureka seven\r\nthe long version of this review (feat. some spoilers) is:\r\ni'll start off with the good things about the series because there's a lot less to talk about there. the art, animation, overall production quality is very good. this makes sense because of the studios behind the project so as far as the visuals go franxx more than makes the cut.\r\nunfortunately, however, good art =/= good story (but i'm getting ahead of myself). i do think that characterization is done fairly well: i'd say there's not a single(major) character in the cast that doesn't have some type development and i do like some of the writing choices they made (specifically the way they handled futoshi -- who pushed aside his own feelings because he wanted kokoro and mitsuru to be happy as well as ichigo wrt ikuno's feelings). \\n\\n\r\nthe show's overall writing, while a mess, also had some good plot points (zero two and hiro's scenes were especially moving near the middle of the season but that may be my bias towards those tropes talking). \\n\\n\r\nbut that's about all i have to say about the show that's positive. the rest is... not so good. for one thing the way the major plot regarding the \"true adversary\" of the show is silly. it's entirely left field and while i'm willing to give the writers some credit if a season two is planned (which would make the twist less Out There if still not introduced poorly) it was ultimately clumsy and far too abrupt with absolutely no build-up. i sat there in awe when the twist was revealed and not in a good way. they pretty much damn the pacing for the remaining episodes to be awkward.\\n\\n\r\nadditionally the world building itself is rather weak.\\n\r\nwhile franxx introduced an interesting take on the concept of immortality, the timeline and actual lore behind the technological advancements nullify any sort of philosophical impact the topic could've had. it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is, again, handled clumsily like pretty much every other plot element of this show.\\n\\n\r\nreally, it just seems to lack direction. \\n\r\nnothing is explained in a satisfactory way and at times one may even question if the writers even know what they're doing. \\n\\n\r\nit's just. sloppy.\\n\r\nthe high notes are high, of course, but not nearly enough to salvage this mess of a show. if the writing was a little more focused, definitely, this show would be much, much stronger but as it stands, even as beautifully as it portrays certain tropes, you're much better off watching something else that does an entirely better job of handling the topics that franxx wishes to portray.\\n\\n\r\nthis show went from mediocre to somewhat tolerable to absolutely insufferable because of the pacing and overall world building. if i had to recommend someone a 'mainstream mecha' i'd definitely choose something else. \\n\\n\r\n==== ==== ==== === ===\\n\\n\r\nep24 edit:\\n\r\nthe show still does a terrible job of exposition.\\n\r\nwhile i'm normally a fan of endings like franxx's the lack of buildup leaves the ending feeling hollow and a lot of the other plot details that hadn't been addressed previously (see: nana and hachi, ikuno's hair turning white, etc) are clumsily shoved in at the end leaving viewers with dissatisfactory answers.",

            "content": "**ANIME FINISHED*\r\nMy goodness, this anime has truly proven itself to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year: and we're barely into the summer season. \r\nIn the months that it has taken for me to digest this series; I have gone through numerous versions of this review, and now, as it seems to be turning to it's final page; I feel confident enough to release it to the public.\r\n- - - \r\nSTORY (2): Originally I chose to ignore immediate faults of this anime; at the time I was blinded by the excitement that was Mecha. Unfortunately for me, the more I began to watchthis anime: the harder it became to ignore the seemingly brighter flaws. \\n\\n\r\n\"Darling in the FranXX\" is an episodic mess: and I believe that owes to the fact that the director, Atsushi Nishigori, has previously only produced the anime iDOLM@ASTER and various  unconnected episodes of other minor anime's. Although each episode in \"Darling in the FranXX\" is well done, it fails to deliver a comprehensive and enjoyable overarching plot.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND (6): The artistry and acoustics in \"Darling in the FranXX\" is perhaps the only redeemable quality of the anime. Although they aren't terrific in comparison to other pieces of work released by Studio Trigger and A-1 Pictures; they do paint a clear picture of what this anime was attempting to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the entire anime is fairly well done, that much I can commend the producers for: however, that is where my compliments end. The animation itself is none too special and the designs of characters and the main antagonists are lackluster and without creativity. The designs and animation may look good at a first glance; but that is all they are, and for that very reason, I can't give this category above a six.\\n\\n\r\nIt simply doesn't tick enough boxes.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (3): The caricature in this anime is so appalling that I can't begin to fathom the writing process that it underwent. From the unlikable characters, seemingly improvised backstory, and poor resolution: this anime has enough symptoms to be diagnosed with a terminal illness. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is not to say that all the characters in this anime have been distasteful: it's just, when the writers of \"Darling in the FranXX\" produce quality, they seem to carelessly destroy what they've produced without much thought. For example; one of the main characters, Zero-Two, is originally portrayed as a rebellious and downright uncontrollable fiend: that's quite the necessity when the remaining 90% of your cast are practically docile sheep. Nonetheless, the writers chose to tune down her personality in order to compromise with plot and in doing so turned a once enjoyable character into a dull machine.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5): If you ignore all the major issues that I have listed above: this anime is decently enjoyable. The flashy battle scenes and cutesy romance is enough to keep most viewers entertained, however, without it, \"Darling in the FranXX\" would be left sitting sorely in the dirt.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4): This anime is filled with enough regret to fill an Olympic swimming pool. There is no doubt in my mind that \"Darling in the FranXX\" originally had the bones and plot premise to produce an anime that would blow any competitor out of the water. Unfortunately, due to studio error, poor writing, and poor production: this anime is very out of contention for that title.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's decently enjoyable and will be able to keep most viewers entertained. However, if you expect \"Darling in the FranXX\" to rock your world with outstanding quality, you will be very disappointed. If you're craving a Mecha; \"Darling in the FranXX\" will do the trick just fine, but in my humbled opinion, there are so many better choices out there.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nOnce MAL has returned to normal service, I welcome anyone to PM me with criticism or compliments: I hope to begin to produce better quality reviews in the near future. Thank!",

            "content": "This will be an edit of my last review.\r\nPeople need to get this into their heads, this isn't an anime worth Series of the Year, and the reason being, is because just 1 episode made you think about it. Everyone went nuts, just with episode 15, but before it was just neutral and nothing out of the ordinary, if you guys are gonna say it's the best one of the year, you seriously need to watch other stuff. Or get your thoughts together, this isn't a chit chat on how you liked the last episode and why it should be the best series just becauseof it, it is decided because of every episode, and this clearly is lacking everything in previous ones.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the first 12 episodes i thought this show was something special, but it really wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nThis show started with a good premise, at a high level from animation to plot, but the last one failed from there. It is a rather generic story full of bland characters that have such ordinary designs. It just follows an MC that is rather useless, in a world where unknown beasts are threatening humanity, but this place superior entity just use him/them for their benefits. They knew how to implement this into the plot, but it fell in itself rather quickly, the story is so goddamn slow and the development is so boring, the so \"special plot\" ended as nothing. They keep dragging the plot for something so used such as brain washing.\\n\\n\r\nAs long as art we are talking about, the animation is spectacular and the art is stunning, from the hands from one of the assistants of Kill la Kill, aswell as the character designer from Anohana. Every detail they make is remarkable that you know instantly who is doing each part. Althought, while i enjoyed this point, the character design for the Squad 13 felt boring and bland, they don't stand out and their designs are what you can get from a random character creator, but it's only that, their personalities are what makes this worth it. The desing of the FRANXXs are what i liked instead, they are colorful, their color palettes are really nice to the eyes and their robotic/human parts make them insanely interesting. While some people seem to dislike some characters, i personally like most of them just because of the way they act, just like normal human beings but without knowing their roots or what they are. It's like instinct, and people don't seem to realize this, but rather they threaten a person (ha) because how they made them. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design and production are nice, again, you can recognize this kind of music from shows such a Kill la Kill for example. The first Opening is amazing and goes well with the whole mood, as well as the ending. BGM feels surprisingly in tone with the scenes shown, it seriously made everything way better. If we talk about the re-edit of the opening for the second part of the series... just don't watch it, it's all over the place, the scenes don't make sense with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI decided in the end to drop it, because i'm tired of it already. They keep dragging it, something that could have been a good show of the season, but no, instead let's just slow the fuck down the progress made and keep introducing new stuff that makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

            "content": "This Will now be my 3rd time redoing this review. Every time, My opinion has gotten worse and worse. \r\nAll my interest died off the around episode 6 or so. \r\nWe get this annoying drama with the characters and It just helps to ruin this already tumbling show.\r\nThe story structure Is bad and It got to the point that I was talking to myself saying how this Is dumb or what they could've done better instead.\r\nThe plot Is one of the most obvious out there. I am baffled by a large number of people that are still surprised by the stuff that happens. \r\nThe storylikes being overly dark and the term \"Edgy\" Comes to my mind. The show Seems to be trying to do a story that leaves you with questions. But this Is really one of the most cliche and obvious shows I've seen this year at least, Let alone from an awesome company behind It like Trigger Studios.\\n\\n\r\nThe show Is trying to do a coming of age type story. It just... There are better out there that do what this show does but better. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the plots are stupid and It leaves me not interested. \\n\\n\r\nLatest episode Is where I finally decided to just come out and say It. This Is not that great of a show. I feel that people are mostly focused on the Animation, Zero Two or the Studio behind It and will look past the major flaws. \\n\\n\r\nThe last episode Is just so annoyingly dumb In my opinion. I can't properly explain why without going on a massive rant. \\n\\n\r\nSame time I feel that It's a good idea for anyone reading this review to keep In mind that I'm not a fan of stories with post-apocalyptic Earth. \\n\\n\r\nReally the only thing that the story has going for itself at this point story wise Is the Princess chick. From what little I've seen of her, I really like her. I think If this show was about her fighting against Humans trying to kill the Earth, That It'd be tons better and more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOnly thing I can give props to this story for Is the animation, OP and few of the characters are good. \\n\\n\r\nBut, No joke, That OP Is probably one of my favorite. I would get chills when watching the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, This Is just a massive disappointment. This Is from Trigger Studios and I do love their other major shows. I get the feeling that they are better at comedy shows.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: So after episode 19 I fully came to realize that this Is a really dumb show with no potential of redeeming itself. Some of the most cliche worlds are all jammed into one. The show turned Into a generic dumpster fire of a show. The characters have all lost their charm and nothing about this Is fun anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIt had already gotten to the point that I was hesitant to watch the newest episode of the show whenever It aired. But after hearing from everyone that episode 20 Is what really killed the show. Than I've come to the decision that I'm gonna drop this crap.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nI have already said that I do not to official reviews of anime that is still currently airing but I had to make an exception to that rule.\r\nBut I am horribly confused about how I feel about this anime. There are a lot of great things and a lot of bad things. In fact im actually stuck in the middle with how I feel about this. \r\n[Story] 5/10 - This anime is filled with cliche story developments and filled with equally appalling rich story developments. There are a lot of things that keep me interested, but the pacing for said thing isstill a little slow. While the cliche parts seem to be paced quite well. I can't really fault an anime for being cliche but it gets distracting after a while. My favorite scenes happen to not be cliche ones, if only this anime had been like this for it's entirety.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 10/10 - So far there is one scene that I hated the design of. ONE. And i don't even think it was the animators fault either! There was a scene where they all got out of their Franxx and after a couple of frames the quality just dropped. I even paused and made sure that it wasn't my internet connection. I'm not going to knock points off for something that could just be my fault or the platform in which I watched the episode on.  Other than that one thing I think the design of the characters, monsters, the mechs is very well done and the animation is just the icing on the cake!\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10 - There has been at least 1 scene in every episode where they could have timed the entrance of music to a silent scene better. That's the only thing I have a problem with in the sound department. The music is great the OPs and EDs are good. Nothing amazing but they are good. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 4/10 - I keep getting the feeling that this want's to be a character driven anime, but it just doesn't live up to those feelings. I love the character development but sometimes they go back on said developments literally the next episode. Or even forget about a character changing event the next episode. I can say that over these last few episodes the development has been getting better and better. But for now im not to happy about it. In fact I actually despise about 4 of the characters, which is about half of the cast. (Go figure right?)\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 7/10 - Only way I can describe my experience is by comparing it to the most beutiful train in the world almost crashing but stopping 1 millimeter before it does. There are both times that I wish I wasn't watching it and there were times that the anime kept me completely involved. Though I have had more good experiences than bad ones. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 5/10 - Im giving this a solid middle rating for the time being as the anime is only at about 17 episodes in at the time of this review. Since the anime has me constantly going in between good and bad it has been a rough time attempting to come to a solid term on my feelings about this. I rarely feel conflicted about what an anime's rating should be but this one is just too hard to decide on right now. \\n\\n\r\nI was told by a lot of people that this anime is really good, but right now I don't see why. Call me ignorant or too dumb to understand the plot but im looking at this from all angles and can't come to a good conclusion!\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Sure. Give this anime a chance. I can't guarantee anything though.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Torn and Confused for all the right and wrong reasons",

            "content": "Only spoiler is for episode 1.\r\nDarling in the FranXX offers an interesting take on a coming of age story involving a group of young children born and trained for the purpose of piloting giant mechas called FranXX, their sole purpose in life is to protect the human race from the Klaxosaurs. They are mankind's last chance at redemption, their only way of proving their existence is by defending their race. The story mainly revolves around 2 characters, Hiro and Zero Two, Zero Two is known as a mysterious and infamous girl with 2 horns in her head, she is known as the \u201cPartner Killer.\u201d Hisfirst encounter with her is sudden, because a Klaxosaur has attacked the fortress they live in known as a plantation, he joins her in their struggle to fight off the Klaxosaur and pull it off and the story continues from there. This show offers many things in its arsenal of strategy in the creation of this anime, from the unique and original take on the use of mechas with a female and male companion, although the plot of children using mechas to save the world is not an original idea (Neon Genesis Evangelion), but a plot involving relationship drama, both romantic and relationships with one another, and the compelling story it involves with the children not knowing of the outside world or even knowing the truth behind why they never see the adults they are sworn to protect,  it makes you crave more and more of the beautiful work of art that is Darling in the FranXX.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 Story isn't all that interesting, after all its a coming of age anime\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 Nothing insanely great about it like Violet Evergarden per say, but it has a nice atmosphere and mecha's have a nice design as well\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 Don't personally like the intro all that much but the atmospheric and background music is nice\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 It's a coming of age story so of course there's gonna be a lot of major character development, although Hiro doesn't have all that much compared to everyone else, and Zero Two has the most\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 I am on the hype train of Darling in the FranXX\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.6 but let's round it to a 9",

Darling in the Franxx indeed is disappointing.\r\nAt the beginning i didn't want to belong in the group saying stuff like \"Anime of the year\" and neither wanted to fall into the group of \"copy of evangelion\" or \"copy of gurren lagan\", but this anime proved me that both groups are wrong. This anime can't be catalogued in any of those because they are too big for him. \r\nThis anime probably will be told as one of the best anime's from 2018 but it will only be for all the hyped and overrated reviews that has been aroundit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd comparing this anime to evangelion is honestly humiliating, one of the things that made me keep watching evangelion was the fact that the protagonist was so fucking coward, and that itself, made the story intresting because the plot didn't need a coward protagonist, probably needed a badass protagonist so it could be cliche. I haven't watched gurren lagan but i bet that his protagonist is far more interesting. Yet the protagonist of Darling in the Franxx is a mediocre guy who met a girl that kept his interest and shows that he is a submissive guy who permits everything because he doesn't understands it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on top of it the character development along with the overwhelming drama made me realize that i really don't give a shit if any of the main characters die. Because i haven't really found any reason to care any of them.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly i hope this anime can redeem himself by the end of it or else it will be nothing different from a japanese tv drama show made for girls in their puberty.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't recommend this anime yet, but my opinion might change by the end of it.",

Each cliffhanger made us dying to know what's next, each character development episode had us craving for action, the daily activities of these teenagers had us wishing for our ships to finally sail among the characters. If one doesn't term this entertaining and engrossing, I have no idea what else would interesting refer to.\r\nI had my hesitation about this as the name was \"Darling in the Franxx\", where the darling part had me expecting crazy fanservice with plots not worth my while,and the first few episodes of mechas being ridden doggystyle wasn't something that got on my good side either. However, the plot is about a group of awkward teenagers going through their development amidst the dystopia they were in and the fact that they were left in heavy ignorance about the world, had us empathise and sympathise their experience, as we got to know the characters much better throughout the series. The story of unrequited love, generous love and true love, the anime had expressed and developed these different types of love with much attention, care and detail.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wished the side characters would be better developed rather than 1 or 2 episodes appearance to show us the difference in the environment the main group was brought up in, the episode had given us multiple climaxes in the story and the way they solve the huge world of mystery in the anime had been great.  The reminiscent art style from anohana had been very pleasing to watch as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still many mysteries to be solved, and I hope the rest of the episodes would all had us satisfied in the end. Overall, this anime had been great and had me in tension just like steins; gate, SAO, Kill la Kill and the like.",

I am not really invested with any of the characters even on episode 19. Zero Two and most anime girls are cute, but the balant hype she generates for this show is misleading. This show has plot points that most people will not be able to reach before getting extremely tired of the drama. There is also not a concrete purpose in this show. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*EP 13 Review*\r\nThis show has largely been memed about and talked a lot aboutlately. It shows elements of Gurren Lagann and Evangelion, but lacks polish of both. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Kids in puberty fighting monsters in a post-apocalyptic scenario - So far the show is more kids dealing with puberty than fighting monsters though.\\n\\n\r\nThe show depicts humans without traditions, without culture, just authority. The cast we see and follow are most of the normal people, or at least they attempt to be. We follow those that are the results of human genetic experiments, and we all question what the point really is? So far the story and plot is clouded with melo-drama.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Show was advertised as mecha-action, but it turns out to be melo-drama and barely any action, at least none that was meaningful. I sometimes forget it is a mecha anime where the kids can actually die instead of a school kids with part time job as monster killers. I don't think its very good, but it could be surprising like Steins;Gate, or disappointing like Alhnoah Zero.",

I might be wrong with this but many people seem fixated around the Franxx, the adults and the battles where as for me, its just a side story and maybe a base for something. The main story for me is the past of the team, the past of Hiro and zero two and all the drama and hardships that unfold between them all. From what i have seen the character development isn't all that bad becausei have learned things for everyone and the story unfolds beautifully. Drama compensates for the lack good battles but i believe battles are not the main thing so its ok. Characters are very interesting and seem to develop quite nice as the story goes on. Up until now i loved it. I left the sound last because i dont really pay much attention to it other than op and ed so.. thats that. I give it a 8,5-9 overall. Hope this helped",

            "content": "Okay, before I write this review, I want everyone to know that a lot of these reviews that are given out with such low scores are either elitists who don't enjoy a hyped anime actually being decent or trolls who dedicate their lives to make sure that every popular anime gets a low review from them, take their reviews with a grain of salt. \r\n*NON SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nThat being said, I think this anime is at a very middle ground in terms of it's overall quality. It's a two cour anime series made by the two anime studios; Trigger, whose works consisted of Kiznaiver, Killla Kill, and the more recent LWA, and A-1 Pictures, who has had a more so controversial track record, but are nonetheless good in their own rights as well. \\n\\n\r\nMy general review goes as this:\\n\r\nStory: 8 (As of episode 13)\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nLet's get this out of the way first. I believe that Darling in the FranXX story is not the best in terms it's genre, being cliche at some points as well, but it overall has a pretty captivating narrative. The story is very reminiscent of Nier:A and Persona 5's story (A mix in between of sorts) where it throws some philosophical questions on existentialism and what it's like to question your surroundings instead of continuously following orders, which episode 13 dwells deep into. It also has an obvious moral compass, showing that adults in this anime are evil while the kids who are held captive and done experiments on to protect the said adults are the good people. It's a good mix of both games in terms of story. The first cour of this anime focuses more on the world building and characterization of specific characters; and while boring and sometimes deemed unnecessary for some portions of the anime, it all comes together for a perfect closure, and that closure being episode 13. I don't want to dwell too deep into why I believe episode 13 is a masterpiece in terms of a standalone episode, you have to experience it for yourself, but what I can say is that while the first cour wasn't suited for everyone, episode 13 gives the right blend of everything (characterization, ambitions, ect.) that makes it so that even if you hated the previous 12 episodes, you can't seem to hate episode 13. Before I would've given the story a 5/10, but episode 13 just easily bumped it up to an 8/10 by itself. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art I don't really have to go too deep into. It's beautiful, that's all I can say. If there is one thing A-1 pictures can consistently do right, it's make beautiful character designs and have consistent art throughout their series. The animation doesn't feel choppy, and side characters are still drawn to detail, even if they aren't a big part of the scene. Just seeing that made me happy as the animators wanted to go all out on this project, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is also something that is consistently done well. I have no qualms on saying that even if the shows story or characters are complete crap, the Art and Sound could still easily make this anime a 5/10 alone. A lot of the ost is played at the right time in the right scene to give more of an emotional output, and that alone makes the sound worthwhile. The voiceacting in this anime is also top notch, I can not fathom how good episode 13 proves this point to be, you have to watch it to experience it, but the VAs are dedicated and I can't wait to see them in action for the second cour. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nIf you prioritize your 1st cour of a 2 cour anime series on world building and characterization, you better damn be sure that the product turns out good. Fortunately for Trigger and A-1 studios, it paid off in the end. Characters are controversial towards many individuals who review anime. Sometimes a character doesn't bode well with the person watching the anime, so they tend to score it less than people who resonated more with a character. For me, I thought all of the characterization that they have done was magnificent. Each episode was more so focused on one specific individual, there was not a time where it was focused on just one pair for more than 2 episodes, that includes Hiro and Zero two. An example of this was in episode 10 where it focused on Zorome and Miku's relationship, or episode 11 where it focused on Kokoro and Mitsuru. Every character, be it main or side, has some development to them and because of that, you can feel their pain and their emotions more as you continue watching the episodes. What I like about Darling in the FranXX and their characters are that none of them feel one sided or stick to their cliches for too long. Each character has their own ambition and motivation for doing what they are doing, and not all of them are fixated onto one viewpoint. An example of a character I thought progressed very well was Zorome. Zorome had a fixed viewpoint on his infatuation with the adults. He would always want to receive praise from them, and do his very best so that he doesn't upset them, believing them to essentially be gods, but once episode 10 rolls around and he finally gets the praise he deserves, but then gets denied by one of them (handshake), he starts to change his perception and as a result, isn't fixated onto that viewpoint anymore. Each individual doesn't stay to what they believe in, they mimic us people IRL, we always change, and they always change as well once they start realizing more about the world around them. To say that the characters in this series aren't well flushed out or are one dimensional, you have to be crazy, because I think that the characters in this anime are the best. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThis anime was not too bad in it's first cour, but once Episode 13 comes along, this anime just brought my enjoyment factor through the roofs. I believe that if you're able to bear through the slow build when it comes to the world and characters, then you'll have an amazing payoff, and will enjoy this series a lot. It's not meant for everyone, and that's understandable, but give it a chance before you brush if off, as you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, This anime is not suited for everyone, but it's nonetheless an amazing anime in terms of it's story, art, sound, and everything else. The people who are giving this anime such low reviews are doing it to suit their elitist tastes, and I don't think it deserves to be ridiculed this much. It def. deserves a rating higher than 8.03, and if the second cour is half as good as episode 13 was, I think this anime could easily be anime of the year hands down. Hope you enjoyed this review! :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "A ruined world full of mysteries in which the main characters begin to question and try their best to understand themselves, and in fact, the current status of humanity itself. Darling in the FranXX tries its best to focus on this theme, and is doing it quite well.\r\nStory-8\r\nThe idea of a destroyed world in which the small remaining human population tries to survive is no new idea, as it has been used many times not only in the anime universe, but just about everywhere else. Because of the Klaxosaur attacks, much of the world has been destroyed, and these small remaining groups of humans utilizetheir new understandings of technology to fight back. Darling in the FranXX points out many times how this huge advancement of technology is a dystopia and is taking away the aspects of humanity, especially by characters like Zero Two, who sometimes states how the city of adults are \"lifeless\". Parts of life such as puberty are seen as negative and dangerous, and many important emotions such as love seem unknown. This enhances the already overused theme, making it much more interesting and thought provoking.\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nTrigger studios and A-1 Pictures are well known for producing some of the best art in animation, such as Sword Art Online from A-1 and Kill la Kill from Trigger studios.  The overall art is amazing, with a western and cartoon character style. The visuals are very beautiful, and especially shines during the mecha fight scenes against the Klaxosaurs.\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nI don't have too much of an opinion on the soundtrack, but the OST sounds quite great. Some of the OST's have a similar style to that of Yuki Kajiura, where operas are used to enhance the current mood of the scene. The opening song is quite good, as well as some great ending songs.\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nA large character cast is hard to handle, as each character needs a proper amount of development. If a character is ignored and rarely used, then that character loses its purpose and becomes a dead-weight to the series. The story has to juggle back and forth with characters so that each character feels important and vital for the story while not reverting too much time from the actual main protagonist. Done correctly and you get a story with enjoyable and likable characters, but done poorly can result terribly, as most likely the character is only used as an excuse to force the story forward for a small moment. Darling in the FranXX does a decent job with its large character cast, as each character seems somewhat useful while still keeping a good amount of focus on Hiro and Zero Two. Still, some of the other main characters lack a good background or base, and seem only important for a small amount of time(currently referring to anyone other than Ichigo, Hiro, Zero Two, and Goro). But this is most likely subject to change, as the series is still only halfway through. The mysterious character Zero Two also adds more interest to the series, because of how much she seems to go against the current human ideals. Regardless of her rude personality, her larger knowledge and cold demeaner make Zero Two a much more compelling character. Unlike the other characters, she seems to possess much more information about the world they live in, and definitely not anything positive.\\n\r\nOverall:8.3\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is overall a great series, and while does contain many negatives, can still be very enjoyable. Throughout the recent years of anime, there have rarely been any decent mecha animes, and Darling in the FranXX finally somewhat keeps the mecha genre from dying away. Darling in the FranXX is similar to the book \"The Giver\" where both contain a world in which the human race has unethically used the tools of science to create what logically seems to be a huge improvement to society, or utopia, but ethically is not. Both worlds contain a character that becomes much more different than the other humans, especially the adults, and take matters into their own hands to understand the mysteries of the dystopia they are living in. Darling in the FranXX has reached it's halfway mark, and with its amazing 13th episode, I have high expectations of this show. Enjoy watching!",

            "content": "\"If you put your hopes in anything, they will be betrayed. Promises will go unfulfilled and faith will let you down\"\r\nStory & Art (7)\r\nLooking at several reviews, I think rating this a 1 is either reaching for attention or just extreme bias. For lovers of the post-apocalyptic genre, it is likely you will thoroughly enjoy this anime up until about halfway whereby the anime rapidly shifts its focus to the characters as opposed to the world surrounding them. I felt the last episodes were a bit of a push as I felt the dilemmas were often forced and as much as the characters were interestingat times, I wanted to learn more about the world and how it came to be that way. The art style was nothing special, but sort of reminded me of Kill La Kill, it felt refreshing but it was not groundbreaking to the point I felt it affected the story in any positive or negative way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but feel the above quote only foreshadows what could've otherwise been a great anime. Like most hyped anime, (looking at you SAO) they tend to start off with strong and present themselves as a possible gem in the genre, but as the anime progresses we resort to Mommy & Daddy filler nonsense and in this case it's hearing the word Darling more times than you'd care to. Take a shot for every time you hear Darling or Hiro emotionally cry out Zero Two and make sure you have the ambulance standing by for alcohol poisoning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter & Sound (6)\\n\\n\r\nIn the latter half of the show, the focus goes from the world surrounding the characters to focusing more on the characters. I feel it does this well, with the exception of some forced scenes between Hiro & Zero Two I feel the struggle of understanding human emotion has some relativity to it. Darling in the FranXX tries to tug on the heart strings of the audience, as to how well it does it, is down to the individual watching more than anything. Feelings of unrequited love, confusion and jealousy and emotions often shared by everyone going through life are highlighted in this show by characters not fully understanding what is happening to them. I felt the voice acting was nothing special, but it wasn't bad either. I felt every character did well to represent their current emotions or show their passion in combat. I did want to punch Hiro in the face a few times though. But that's just me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (7)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show. For lovers of the post-apocalptic genre I would definitely recommend giving this a shot. You might feel frustrated when the focus shifts from the world to the characters, but the anime does a good enough job of developing these characters prior for us to care enough about them to carry on watching up until the end to see ultimately what happens. I give this a strong 7. Thanks for reading my review. \\n",

            "content": "This is AMAZING, and I hope it makes the best of its potential in the episodes to come. \r\nIt feels like the lovechild of all different sorts of anime, what with the staff behind it too. Almost in spite of that though, Darling in the FranXX is reining in on a narrative style slowly developing as its own, with things like the recurring use of cinematic black bars to highlight a scene or the particular way the characters are set up to interact and mature along the course of the story. Zero Two is the flagship character that seems to establish the new identity givenbirth here in the face of all these narrative influences and references. \\n\\n\r\nI think a large part of watching this show CRITICALLY, not to undermine its value as an independent work, is to understand where it's coming from and the things its referencing, whether it's in the show being a loving antithesis to Evangelion, or in its merging of the male sexuality in Gurren Lagann with the female sexuality in Kill La Kill to make a show that seems to speak about both, and on much appreciated softer levels throughout. A very clear facet of the show is how it fascinatingly becomes a closed critical history on its own side of anime, being a commentary on that history by introducing its personal take on it.\\n\\n\r\nBut not thinking about criticism for criticism's sake AS I FEEL MANY PEOPLE ARE UNNECESSARILY DOING, when you sit back to see what this anime has to offer and take it all in, there's no need for the comparisons. It stands up by itself as something unique and special, which you can feel as you watch it, especially coming off the first episode. I think it has one of my favorite first episodes ever.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say too much on the ost for now. At this point, all I can really say is that I've not felt any gap in the good usage of ost so far. Strelizia's Awakening is awesome and it along with the OP and ED's contribute to the overall distinctness of the anime quite well. And on the opening. WHOA! At first subdued and alluring, but then with the perfect amount of smooth yet energetic vibrato accented by electronic sounds set to a familiar pop rock backbone (with great lyrics), it sets the tone to this show since the themes bouncing around here aren't groundbreakingly new, but the atmosphere breathed into them is something nuanced in a way that I'm loving!\\n\\n\r\nBack to looking at it critically, the only thing I could wish for so far is more concrete plot development with each episode, as it doesn\u2019t yet carry a goal rushing momentum from episode to episode. It seems to sacrifice that for character interactions to carry through in the future with some being more isolated \u201carcs\u201d than others as well, which all by itself isn\u2019t a bad thing since it\u2019s a great decision to dedicate that time when given the ability to. However, it leaves some more \u201cSO THIS IS WHERE THIS ANIME IS GOING!\u201d to be desired, even when that looseness is brought to the fore as part of the anime\u2019s appeal. Still, I don't dislike this direction of the story and characters since I think it does what it does right for what I seem to be understanding of its core intentions. \\n\r\nConsidering that, the most recent episode did well to advance the underlying plot of the story a little more-- if not momentarily-- in introducing background plot threads along with its character focus, which I hope can be built up more fully alongside the character development and interaction.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, some remarks on its fundamentals. The directing and dialogue are very good. Not every line has to contribute to a deeper understanding or story, but if you notice, they DO contribute to a richness in immersion and can be identified as tangents to a deeper character. Pay attention to the dialogue!! It's a lot more engaging than you'd take it for on first glance, especially with the expressive character animation. \\n\r\nSpeaking of which, anime is known for just sticking to a frame and changing the mouth. Darling in the FranXX doesn't do that much and is great at bringing in a variety of shots to a single conversation, which is part of what goes into the smaller things you have to realize in order to appreciate when watching it. It has solid directing when the moments call for it, which is what I was trying to get at in mentioning the black bars earlier, and THAT RIGHT THERE is what's setting it apart from the ground up.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it feels like everything\u2019s been fun while working towards the show\u2019s thematic purpose. Anyways, it's got me hooked, so with that, up to Episode 10 I give it a 10/10.",

The sci-fi world that the creators have elaborately designed is... I guess cool... but that's not the reason why I eagerly get up every Saturday morning to tune in.\r\nWhat truly stands out in this anime, what truly makes this anime so damn entertaining, what truly sets this anime apart from the rest is........ .... ......\r\nthe Dialogue.\r\nYep. the dialogue.  The dialogue is fking great. It is so creatively written to the point where my jawsdrop at moments in this anime just because of something a character would say. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime's central characters are a group of kids. And the creators do a damn incredible job making these kids seem like actual kids. The stuff they say are resemblant of what kids in real life would actually say if they were put into this sci-fi world these characters are put into.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also made incredible by the dynamic facial expressions these characters display. When they feel shock, shyness, anger, love, their facial expressions concisely capture that exact emotion. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, this anime is so FKING SWEET. Whoever lists the genres for this anime forgot to put romance b/c, my god, there is a lot of romance in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSome sexual romantic scenes. I guess a lot of reviews are complaining about that. But all the reviewers who give this anime a bad review b/c of that must be blind b/c there are so many genuine, innocent romantic scenes that are so incredibly well incorporated into the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIf you choose to give this anime a shot, my god, I'll warn you now, the breakfast scenes are so sweet that I get diabetes every time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh yea, btw, Darling is my new favorite word b/c of this anime.

            "content": "I'll start this off by saying that mecha anime are not my favorite genre, I do like a few and aside from Gundam, they all tend to veer from the stereotype and have some unique elements. I think Darling in the FRANXX follows this as well so far. I have seen all the episodes out so far, which is only 7-- so I will update as the series progresses.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI gave the story a 9 because I think it balances similarities to other shows (which is impossible to avoid these days, regardless of if the creator thought they were totally original, since everything has beendone in some form at this point) and uniqueness. \\n\\n\r\nI like that it touches on some social issues and has a lot of deeper meaning in the characters interactions and world, psychology would have a field day researching the minds of kids who had grown up in the environment that these kids have. Especially that they seem so well-adjusted to the situation, which is much more mature than a lot of other with dystopian/post-apocalyptic scenarios. They know that they don't get normal lives but they accept it, and in ways are proud to be the ones that protect everyone. Though some speculation on the future-- I think we will see some unexpected things arise which some of them may not deal with well.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of potential in the story and I hope we get to see more into the world itself, how it got that way, and the bigger picture of their roles within it. I really like the snapshot we get in episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't very unique in itself but I think it is still very good quality. I especially like the scenes with a lot of nuance, the ones where the characters are emoting with the world sprawled before them, they do those especially well in this. I am thinking of scenes like where Zero and Hiro are up on the ledge together, looking out at the city. I think it also helps to showcase the differences in their personalities. I also just really like Zero's design in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I am not really big on sound in any anime. I don't notice it much unless it's super outstanding, or very bad, but so far the sound for this seems pretty good. Nothing incredible but I from what I can recall I think they use it appropriately for the settings and to give suspense. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nI think I could also give this a 10, but I am being safe and giving it a 9. I really like Zero as a character, and I love that all of the kids have such distinct personalities. Some of them really annoy me, like the one boy who keeps causing the problems and tried to ride with Zero. But I think that is intended, so it also gives them points. I also think we'll see more deepening to him and the other characters along the way.\\n\\n\r\nI really like how distinct they are, but not too stereotypical. I'm not sure how to explain it well, but I feel like the nuance for them is perfect, they feel like real personalities. And the fact that they did not grow up regularly and are still exploring what it means to be human really adds to the interactions. At first Hiro was a bit too weak for my tastes, but I think he is really growing into his character. I hope we get to see a lot more about Zero though, she is still very much an enigma. I have a lot of speculation about her and her origins but I won't go into them here. I enjoy her as an outcast character, since I tend to relate to those the best. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 10 because I just really love it so far, it has a lot of great aspects that make it better than your average mecha, or average anime in general. I wouldn't call it a Masterpiece, so my overall score is still 9, but I like it enough where I'd say my enjoyment while watching is a 10. It is certainly one of my top anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, I would recommend this show to people who are familiar enough with anime to get to the real meat of the story and overlook some silly anime tropes, like how they ride together (lol). While not a Masterpiece, this is still a great show. Especially for a mecha (in my eyes).",

Instead, each episode leaves me with the feeling that I am missing something, an absence which prevents me from fully enjoying what is happening in the story. In short, I want and expect more than what has been delivered. If Zero Two were any less interesting, I would probably stop watching altogether.\r\n# SOUND\r\nThe music is generally serviceable, especially the tracks that playduring the action climaxes. However, the score doesn\u2019t contribute enough in setting the tone. It fails to create atmosphere, and that is a problem given that this series has more than a few dark undertones. By way of contrast, compare this with the music of the much-maligned Studio Deen Fate/Stay Night, accompanied by a highly atmospheric and evocative soundtrack that brought some much-needed immersion to an otherwise dubious production.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting of Darling in the Franxx is good, especially the VA for Zero Two who does excellent work here.\\n\\n\r\n# ART\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation of action sequences stands out, generally the visuals of this show are boring. The plantation environments are typically sterile and unadorned, while the exterior settings are generic, uninspired, and lacking in variety. Compare this with the Miyazaki\u2019s classic Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which has many beautiful and striking wasteland landscapes that provide an effective backdrop to a post-apocalyptic story. By contrast, this world doesn\u2019t feel lived-in, nor does it feel like is has particularly shaped the people that do live within it.\\n\\n\r\n# STORY\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue so far with Darling in the Franxx is the lack of an overarching conflict driving the narrative. There is no sense as to why this story or these characters matter, other than it is happening and they exist.\\n\\n\r\nWhile plenty of anime can take a few episodes for a clear thread to emerge, this series has struggled to present any of the events that have happened so far as truly meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nA major contributing factor to this is insufficient world-building. We know nothing about the state of human civilization in the world of Darling in the Franxx. Most importantly, we don\u2019t know what is so worth protecting that the Franxx pilots are forced to endure such a dehumanizing and dystopian existence.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, there is no clear concept of government or who is in power (Papa who?), and as such we can\u2019t guess what the motivation of such actors would be. We don\u2019t know whether they would have anything to gain from the development of a hybrid Parasite like Zero Two, her finding a compatible partner, or anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is this: without sufficient world-building, the we have no idea what is at stake or why it matters. It\u2019s difficult to put characters into context and understand their motivations, and it is difficult to pick up on what kind of direction the story will take going forward. If we don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to care.\\n\\n\r\n# CHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nA weak story can be salvaged by characters with depth and complex relationships. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t the case with nearly any character in Darling in the Franxx.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is the excessive number of \u201cmain\u201d characters: there are ten Parasites in Plantation 13 alone, with yet more supporting characters. I can\u2019t even remember half their names as I write this because of their inconsequential roles in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe result is that many characters are seriously lacking in depth, with insufficient screen-time spent on developing them and their relationships. We are given scant insight into how characters feel about the events of the story, beyond trite one-liners or cliched outbursts. This is the definition of one-dimensional. Without the more personal interactions that come with more intimate relationships, it\u2019s hard to care for most of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nIchigo is the best-developed character so far. She actually shows emotional depth and has clear feelings that provide motivation for her actions. She reacts consistently and in ways that are understandable. She has a well-defined internal conflict, driven by her unrequited love for Hiro, and brought to the fore by the intrusion of Zero Two. The way Ichigo responds to this stress helps us understand what kind of person she is, and allows us to empathize with her situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the challenges that have shaped Zero Two as a character haven\u2019t appeared on screen. While she is clearly supposed to be a major character, her development has been perplexingly sparse.\\n\\n\r\nThe story suggests that Zero Two has been ostracized and perhaps abused for much of her life. However, we have yet to see this first-hand, making it hard to understand why she is so sensitive. She repeatedly expresses distress that others see her as nothing more than a monster; and is similarly uplifted when Hiro is not repulsed by her horns. But there is no evidence that she is being seriously discriminated against for being non-human in the present. If anything, Dr. Franxx seems excessively permissive of her belligerence.\\n\\n\r\nPresumably, this discrimination and othering is supposed to explain why Zero Two has no regard for others, even dismissing her peers as \u201cweaklings\u201d. But again, without showing any of her supposed struggle on screen, it\u2019s hard to sympathize with her. No one wants to be hated or alone, but her behavior so far makes it easy to conclude that she lacks normal feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, Hiro claims at one point that Zero Two is \u201cjust like us\u201d; presumably a person, in other words. But there is little story to back this up, either. Zero Two is depicted as alluring, capricious, rebellious, and increasingly callous; traits that, while fascinating, are not particularly endearing or suggestive of her humanity.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it feels like we are being given an incomplete and inconsistent picture of Zero Two. It\u2019s hard to pin down how to feel about her, not because she is particularly multi-dimensional, but simply because the writers have so far struggled with her development.\\n\\n\r\n# ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx is a series that takes a well-known genre and puts some interesting twists into the formula to create an ostensibly unique story. This has a lot of potential to create an exciting and enjoyable series. Regrettably, I have to say that so far I am disappointed with what the creators have managed to produce. While I am always excited to see a new episode, it is ultimately because I am hoping something really juicy will finally develop with Zero Two. Despite the ample 24 episodes slated to air, it feels like I am being fed the plot through a straw, leaving all the great potential of this series on the table.",

            "content": "Don\u00b4t get confused over the high score I have given to this anime, since I did this to contrast the overall negative reviews that this series has received. I know that it does not deserve a 10/10, but it defenetly does not deserve a 1/10 as many users have rated this.  Now, to the proper review.\r\nAs a \"casual\" anime fan my opinion is not the best, although I have enough cinema culture and such that I can distinghish decent series, which this definitely is included on. Although I loved this series, I am trying to keep as neutral as I can be. Lets getgoing:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good the 15 or more first episodes, but the end, I need to admit that is kind of... disappointing. I won't say more in order to avoid any \"spoiler\". It could be done in such a better way that it seems like the end was rushed and full of \"last hour changes\". With all of that consider, the first arc of the series is really good, giving to it a mark of 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe next topic as specified here is \"art\"; the style of this series is not very different from others, it does not innovate in anything, except for the mechas, which it gives a more sense of human than other examples of this type of series. For that I must give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI will briefly finish with the last topics since I do not have much to say. First of all, sound, which I have given it a mark of 8, is  composed of a good soundtrack, not the best, but defenetly not the worst, since I still remember some of the songs played during the series. About characters I think is one point where it lacks a bit. The problem lies that although having more than 10 possible deep characters, it only develops 5, being the protagonist couple, the second one, and Ichigo. It should have used the rest on some parts of the series more, than just leaving them apart as the have left some of the main characters. On this section I will give it a mark of 7.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish with enjoyment, as I said before, I loved this series. I mut say as a \"casual\" fan, that I am not very familiar with the \"hype train\" as many call the excitement that you share with others in forums and sites like this one, which many include in your reviews about this. I was not exposed to this excitement from the community, and also I have seen the whole series almost straigh, only waiting for the last episode to air. So, my conclusion, if you try hard enough to stay away from the influence from others, including mine, and try to relax and see the series not because of its faults, but because you want to enjoy it, you will certainly give it a 10 on this regard.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, as I said at the start, I give it a 10/10, just to attract people to actually watch this. But for those who have already whated it, I think it deserves an 8/10 minimum. Hope that you enjoyed this review, since is my first one on this site. If you want to say anything you can freely comment and we can discuss your opinion, in a polite way as always.",

            "content": "I'm mainly choosing to write this review in protest to the sea of negative reviews written by those who clearly don't understand the intent of this anime. \r\nDarling in the Franxx was meant to be a homage to many classic Gainax anime. To call it a cheap copy or plagiarism and not understand that those who made it are former employees of Gainax who made the anime they claim it copies. Several studios collaborated to create this as a love letter to those old series. \r\n To watch this entire series and not grasp that, to me, is mind boggling. The series is a bitpredictable to those who have seen all the classic Gainax giant-robot anime. From the costume design to the ending, it's rather obvious. To call it plagiarism is just silly and ignorant. \\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised to see all the references to lesser known works such as Gunbuster and its sequel, Diebuster. Gurren Lagann was also present but a bit more subtle. The Evangelion references were a bit more on the nose as I think that they wanted you to know they wanted to tell a similar story with a different premise. \\n\\n\r\nThink of this series as a sort of anti-Evangelion. Instead of channeling one's loneliness, one must channel their connection to others. It's a bit cliche-sounding but this series develops characters and relationships like no other I've seen before. Yes, the characters are whiny. Yes, the characters all make stupid choices and have irrational feelings. Yes, they are at times totally insufferable. They're children whose bodies are rapidly changing and they have no context or explanation for the pressures and hormones that go along with puberty. This is a major plot point (if not the driving factor for the entire story) that as someone in their mid-20s who struggled with puberty, I found to be enjoyable and relatable. We see the characters mature in a way that may not always be enjoyable to watch but I think it is one of the most realistic portrayals of the attitudes of teenagers ever featured in any media. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is a bit odd and confusing to take in. My biggest complaint is the somewhat forced explanations for the reasoning behind needing two pilots for the Franxx and the other part about why children are needed. There is a lot of important dialogue early on in the series that has stronger implications toward the end that many likely forgot. From reading some of the other reviews, there are lots of complaints about what happened with the ending. I'll say that what happened was rather fully explained early on in the series and I'm dumbfounded that so many not only missed that but complained about it. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'll talk about the art. Fantastic, hands down. The animations are the best I've ever scene in an anime. No expense was spared here and I didn't notice any shortcuts taken to save a buck. Evangelion and Diebuster were plagued with this due to budgeting (the former had a shoestring budget half-ass dream ending and the latter's ending wasn't in goddamn color because they couldn't afford to color it in, not to even get into the use of stills) issues so I like to think the creators did this as atonement for that. The characters are all crisp and rather well designed. The color palettes chosen are consistent throughout and fit the series well. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the sound. Everything was great here. The music was top notch and well written. Effort was put in here and it shows.",

            "content": "First of all, I am surprised to how many gave it low ratings. Many coined it for being overly-hyped and a rip-off of Neon Genesis Evangelion and the like. Yet I beg to review it objectively. And no, I won't even consider comparing it to the anime it may have been inspired on (that is, if it was intended to be inspired by such).\r\nIt was 30th of July when I started watching DITF from Episodes 1 to 24. And what struck me the most is the setting. It gives vibes from \"The Giver\" (a good book you may read too) wherein it portrays a dystopiccivilization bounded by the rules of \"APE.\" I could already guess that many reviewers failed to understand its setting quite well (but there's nothing I could do). Little do we know that the setting affects all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMILD SPOILERS. BEWARE. WATCH BEFORE READING. SKIP TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH.\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were given a development, albeit in a slow pace. The fact that Squad 13 realized something so crucial in a dystopic world gives an epic proof that they all developed in the end. That they realized that their \"Papa\" is a liar. That they realize that the klax is never evil. That they realized they were living in the shadows. That they realize that the \"adults\" are lifeless and live a boring life. As for Hiro and Zero Two, I already assumed that they will be given more attention because the title said so (who else is the Darling besides Hiro?) The development of the two is nice, while I commend the flashback for shocking me even for a little. As for the other characters, I noticed their lack of background. But then, I always remind myself that it may be the creator's intent to retain the elements of dystopia, to which I liked. That they intended to not reveal where the \"rejected\" goes, for it is already implied. That they intended to not reveal their parents, for it takes place in a messed up civilization in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good and the OSTs are nice, given that I already started to play \"Torikago\" (ED song) in the digital piano. The background sounds were not awkwardly played; it is just right.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the last episodes, I felt that some elements may have been rushed. Like the VIRMs suddenly appear. Like the setting started to shift into space. It may sound like it came out of Star Wars, but considering the anime is of original concept and not an adaptation of a light novel or manga, I already imagined the effort of catching up for the schedules. Therefore, it might feel too fast in the end. (Remember Charlotte by Jun Maeda? If you do, you get what I'm trying to point out). \\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws, it won't change the fact that I enjoyed watching DITF. 10/10. I feel like after 5 years, I will still remember the plot and the name of the two main characters since this show made my 8 hrs of watching worth it. You may watch quintillion of anime out there, and some may be better. But what matters is that you enjoyed it. And DITF is one of them for me. 9/10 all-in-all.\\n\\n",

Nothing seemed to come of this though as it was totally ignored later on.\\n\\n\r\nDetached Assessment\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nPacing kept me engaged throughout. Even the relaxing episodes were exciting to watch for character development.\\n\r\nI see a lot of hate on the internet about the ending, but there are plenty of popular shows that have similar endings... so why does everyone hate this one? That might just be a certain vocal group though. Anyways, the ending was very good in my opinion and satisfied me greatly.\\n\r\nThat being said, the show certainly takes a lot of liberty in it's plot mechanics to get stuff to happen. Some could accuse it of being inconsistent with it's own setting and style. This, however, was only realized in hindsight and didn't matter that much when marathoning the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nCharacter growth and interesting personalities abound. However, our main character seems to be a little dull compared to his varied supporting cast. Thankfully, the show takes plenty of time to focus on them.\\n\r\nThat being said, there is some side characters who are done better than others. One particularly uninteresting character was shoehorned into the role of a lesbian with no foreshadowing and for no other apparent reason than to make her unique. Needless to say, it was a pretty dumb twist.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nAmazing fight scenes with very unique mecha designs. The art style fits very well.\\n\r\nHowever, some scenes are a little stiff looking. These are few and far between though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nGreat OP, I could listen to it for days. It gets slightly mixed up for the last portion of the series along with some new visuals, that was nice.\\n\r\nThe show has a lot of different EDs, some are better than others, some are really great.\\n\r\nOST is good and fits the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nWhile the fanservice was somewhat alienating, one could get over that to experience this wonderful show.\\n\r\nThe relationships between the main characters were very satisfying and made me very happy to see fulfilled in the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nFans of mecha, shonen, and action/romance will definitely get a kick out of this. If you've seen some of studio Trigger's other works, you know what your in for action-wise.\\n\r\nThe fanservice may cause some people to give this one a pass, but for all of the sexual angst this show featured it provided a healthy solution: MARRIAGE. Having children was included in this equation as well, despite the in-world society banning childbirth. That certainly makes for an interesting real world analogy... maybe that's why so many people harbor ill-feelings for this show.",

            "content": "(sorry in advance for probably spelling all the names wrong LOL)\r\nOkay, so I was introduced to this anime after seeing fan art a friend made of the pink-haired main girl character (Zero Two I would later learn) and the caption something along the lines of \u201cI started watching this show and it\u2019s pretty interesting\u201d. She wasn\u2019t wrong. \r\nYes it was interesting, but mostly in a \u201cthis is so bad it\u2019s\u2026.good I guess?\u201d sort-of way.\r\nTL;DR: It did end up growing on me but with the poor early character and world development along with weird pacing and a confusing story it was pretty tough to watch throughthe first few episodes. Once I got far enough, it was easy enough to see it through to it\u2019s end although the plot just went\u2026boom. (Like Hiro and Zero Two- LOL)\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS ahead but hey, this review is after the mainstream anyways I'm sure, you\u2019ve been warned.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\r\nOkay, so the story.  What I gathered from the first couple episodes \u201ceechi-looking-anime with robot-riding-kids fighting mechs\u201d.\\n\r\nPretty much, and Hiro the main dude reminds me of your classic protagonist-dark hair with bangs and he\u2019s special and wants to do his bEST TO FIGHT OOOOOO- although it did start off with him being a \u2018failure\u2019 to ride a Franxx/unable to ride his special boy/girl robot properly so at least that was a bit different lol\\n\r\nThe pink-haired girl with horns, Zero Two, turns out to be completely confident in her body and the ways of the world-no she just meets our protagonist while she\u2019s skinny dipping in a river, nothing unusual there. She somehow becomes his/he becomes her \u2018darling\u2019 and hey, we\u2019ve got the series title making sense now! A darling, IN a Franxx!\\n\\n\r\nThey story didn\u2019t do much besides show off the kids fighting robots and laying out some basics of the plot like the kalxxousaurs are evil and humans fight them and only kids can ride the robots but it does little more then drag for the first while.\\n\r\nI think the first 6 episodes are literally \u201cHiro/Squad 13 getting used to Hiro and Zero Two becoming partners and the fact they can ride a Franxx together.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s teenage angst and robots with butts and boobs-what more could you need? World-building? Okay, but wait until like, episode 13 at least.(or so, I don\u2019t remember but it took a while) \\n\\n\r\nThe story in the end was trying to pull a bunch of twists and fine, I'm super easy to fool/never see things coming but it felt like lame cop-outs? I thought it would\u2019ve been cooler had the Klaxxousaurs had been actually man-made and APE actual APES, now that would\u2019ve been more cool imo. Okay, I didn\u2019t really see the second one happening but why DID APE have monkey themed stuff going? That never got addressed pfff\u2026they just wanted humans to become immortal and then they got control over the world, that was their goal and they had little to do after that I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt lazy with the whole \u201cportal to another galaxy where all my frens can\u2019t go oops bye guys we\u2019ll probs die\u201d I\u2019m glad they DID actually die though, I was mostly expecting them to somehow survive and come back with Hiro being Blue and Zero Two red, they did look cool as Klaxxo-sapians or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, girly robots with teenage angst and romance and mostly drama in a depressing-looking future.\\n\r\n 3 / 10\\n\\n\r\nART \\n\r\nOkay, the anime looked nice enough, but I felt it was just average for the most part. Like, I dont think I ever thought \u201cwow, that looks really beautiful or amazing\u201d, it was just fine. I mean I sure couldn\u2019t do it, it was good, dont get me wrong, but nothing stood out to me as special about this.\\n\r\n6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nSOUN D\\n\r\nThe opening(s) were fine, the ending(were there even two endings?? I can\u2019t even remember and I watched this whole anime in the span of like 3 days OTL).\\n\r\nI thought it was fine, not my cup of tea and I skipped it each time but I can see why other people would like it I think.\\n\r\n6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some character development, but mostly with the side-characters, like Goro got some okay development and then the Kokoro girl gets developed by pulling a 180 with her personality or something, she has baby fever and that sorta defines her\u2026the purple haired girl is revealed to *gasp* be a lesbian so that\u2019s her character gimmick and no more development for her because why would she have further depth. Zorome the bratty kid is shown to have strong nationalist vibes and he fights for his papa and I guess he doesn\u2019t know what to do after that\u2019s done-the Miku girl really didn\u2019t get anything as far as I remember\u2026she\u2019s just tsundere.\\n\r\nThe fat kid loves the Kokoro girl and is betrayed when she leaves him for the angsty guy. Ichigo loves Hiro but he friend zoned her so she angsts about that but eventually(like really eventually) gets over him. There were others I think but dont really care, there were a bunch of sorta Zero Two types in the 9 squad that were super strong and snobby and mean to cause plot development I think\u2026like they followed orders and \u201chad no emotions\u201d then became emotional and were all buddies at the end for the final fight so nothing matters.\\n\\n\r\nI could say more but I don\u2019t really care enough to, basically standard tropes, they were overall quite shallow or just went BOOM and switched according to plot development or convenience. \\n\r\n2 / 10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \\n\\n\r\nI thought it was so bad it was good the first episode, then I kept watching, it dragged for ages, then picked up but I was also watching it just to finish it. It kept me watching, but mostly in the \u201cI want this to finish\u201d. I liked when Hiro and Zero Two\u2019s romance was finally mostly stable for the last while because then at least I wasn\u2019t frustrated at them and somewhat enjoyed watching it haha, but just\u2026alright.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m tired from this LOL...I'm glad this is over and I can get closure from writing this meh review.\\n\r\n 5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you like a simple futuristic story + mechs + teenage drama + robot boobs? \\n\r\n4 / 10",

            "content": "Oh boy. Where should I start. I want to say first that I was, I would say many people, had hopes and joined the Hype Train along with me when I heard that one of my favorites studios Studio Trigger And A-1 Pictures would collaborate together to make another mecha anime that seemed really promising. When the anime started airing and I watched the first episodes, I really liked the setting, how the story was progressing and especially the characters. But that didn't last long. It become really strange. What I mean by that? Well in the last episodes something changed completely. It wasn't aboutZero Two or Hiro. It become boring and repetitive. *(spoiler alert) It was just killing klaxosaurs klaxosaurs klaxosaurs nothing else. Not Only that, but they didn't let us understand whats going on about Ichigo, and the others, they completely rushed it and the end was totally disappointing. \\n\r\nAs for the art it was really good and the animation too. But the quality of the show dropped dramatically. *(Again Spoiler alert) For example On the last scenes when Zero Two and Hiro where giving their final fight to save the people they loved, the animation and the art was laughable. Olny little explosions and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the music, Nothing special, Didn't make me excited. They music on the fights weren't even good. The op was only the decent part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about the characters. I will go straight up and say it, most of them are forgettable, I don't remember a thing about them, besides zero two hiro and ichigo (witch its by far the most spastic of all them, he only care for his own sake) But in general all of them lack emotions, they didn't even make feel anything. I didn't even know how to feel. Witch its the worst possible thing for the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment the first 6 episodes where really decent. After all it went downhill to the point I was just skipping the boring parts. So I would say I didn't enjoy it afterall and I regret my time trying my best to like it. It was hopeless\\n\\n\r\nSo its worth watching?\\n\r\nIt depends. If you are fun of mecha animes then I think its a good choice besides Neon Genesis Evangelion \\n\r\nDo I suggest it for any other reason? Nope. There are far better animes out there\\n\r\nArt/animation: 5\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\ncharacters: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review\\n\\n\r\n23/7/2018",

            "content": "Another day, another Trigger masterpiece. This was quite a series. Most of the criticism is going to come from the last 4-5 episodes. Apparently, whoever wrote that watched quite a bit of Macross and reimagined it. If you have a critique for this show, I would remind you to familiarize yourself with the reference material, perhaps with the movie Do You Remember Love? It's one of the finest anime movies, series whatever from the early 80s. \r\nIn Macross, the humans on earth fight anti-loving organisms who hate personality and feelings. Macross also featured dopey pop-songs, of which Darling has in its opening song. Darling's villainsare called VIRM, which is as good as anything. \\n\\n\r\nI was fascinated by the episodes featuring the characters living in a community and getting along with each other as all humans do. In Macross humans must live in a similar postapocalyptic sandscape. Sandscapes were all the rage in the genre, along with cyber cities. Such as Akira. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were out of this world, which is a constant with Trigger and carries through here. Little Witch etc, Kill La Kill, Gurren Lagaan, have some of the strongest characters in all of anime in their time (last ten years). It almost seems as if Trigger first strives to create great characters, and then builds off of that. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps they have overused Tsunderes, 002 and the antagonist friend blonde girl in Little Witch. But nothing captures young audiences like tsunderes, so, good business. The love story here was interesting, Trigger usually doesn't rely on it. A1 also had a fair part in this series, but I think the focus on reimagining Macross is what set them together. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the ending. I was fascinated by the focus on Japan's demographic shift. They lost 300,000 people from their population last year. The series focuses on an old lesson in a new skin. Loving, relationships, dealing with other people, expressing yourself to others. The series was about socialization, and a humanity that had given up on it.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more opaque symbols were ignorable. Oil, global warming etc. These were second fiddle to Japan's demographic trouble. Such is why sex was focused on, the crazy positions of the pilots. An older earth at battle with space really is a good way to focus on environment--a thing Americans could do well to focus more on. \\n\\n\r\nWhen is Trigger going to get tired of saving anime? I'm not sure. People are probably butthurt that 002 and her boytoy didn't lay down the law in the end, but they'll have a second chance. The endless griping by people about the show also proves its popularity and importance. And as a Macross fan I don't think they tread too heavily on that old story. Rather, I was entertained by the influence, following around about the subtle mentioned things and taking no offense at paying homage. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, if you haven't seen Macross from the 80s, even after all the many readaptations, and really didn't understand the story again, the symbol of love should've been enough.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the animation, the budget, the way we never knew what was going to happen in the story. All ends were wrapped up, and I enjoyed Darling in the Franxx as a pop series. It was really great, it reminds me of why anime is important. \\n\\n\r\nSome may try to demean the characters as dopey, but what was with everyone's obsession over their love story around ep 15? You complain about the end, but they're talking about current events in human history. You'll point to Trigger's favored use of using multicolored main characters in green, pink etc EVERY SINGLE TIME, but I never get tired of their use of color. 002's pink hair was iconic. \\n\\n\r\nTrigger does tend to do some of the same things, but we all watched this show. It's a shame to think the complaining still hasn't ended. This series was old-souled. A peon to the 80s spirit of love, hard work, accomplishment. However, their demographic shift in Japan has to do with relationship rights, respect for relationships, as well as working too long into the day. The show references this, such as not believing or living only to fight, but rather fighting to live.\\n\\n\r\nFighting to live could be a great metaphor for current Japan to go by. Most foreigners are concerned for Japan. I'm concerned that they cannot adapt and make anime more profitable for all involved. Yet, by itself, Darling was a phenomenal piece of art with A1. I hope people can appreciate it for what it was. A fine series, really, in the tradition of trigger with some mopey, dopey teenage emotions and romance, and a Macross ending they thought would resonate today. I very much enjoyed this project, and thought the way the writing circled around its subject without copying the original show in the last five episodes was quite the feat!\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show.",

            "content": "What is human? \r\nWhat makes you more 'human' than other? These are the questions that lingers around unnoticeably since the first episode, to reach the conclusion in the final one. A question that defined the reason of the fight that Zero Two relentlessly put up on - to become human. We call ourselves human but do we even care to stop and take a closer look to others around us? Are you only human because you have the ability to speak whatever you want, to think logically and solve problems or passion to get things done that others can't?\r\nThe answer given is rather simple. Becausewe exhibit deeper emotions and can portrays them better. That's what the story of Zero Two and Hiro tried to cover but didn't exactly get the message through because of the many themes that it tried to tackle. \\n\\n\r\nBecause emotions are the fundamental things that makes us human, Zero Two learnt to enjoy every new experience because of how they only come once and losing that single moment could cause her eternal regret. Hiro, being the passive prodigy learnt to fight whenever he has to, and to give it all even when governed by his emotions to protect Zero Two and to be the one that she can lean on. Through their unusual partnership, with some cringy moments, the feelings come into the play. The portrayal of the romance that encourages one to be honest with their feelings and to understand how a single action can be two-layered and the words \" you were awful \" from Ichigo can have so many different translations to it.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the takeaway from Darling in the FranXX that has its fair amount of hates and loves is the symbol of the Jian from the first scene and the story of Prince and the Beast - to be someone's wing. A bird cannot fly with one wing and love cannot be felt unless it's mutual but what would it takes to seek your own love? \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Darling in the FranXX is quite distant from a masterpiece. There are some flaws that are highly criticized like the unrealistic mecha fight, unnecessary fanservice and the cringy love romance which I agreed with. However, there are also some beautiful elements that are missed out from the clouded perspective. I would recommend anyone to give it a try with unbiased mindset and see for yourself, whether it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nFor extra remarks, Kiss of Death is one of the greatest OST I've ever come across and Goro, deserves more character development simply because he's a genuinely nice guy.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The show that brings the word 'Darling' back to the mainstream and a pink-haired female protagonist that got Kim Kardashian in a funky pink hair craze on Instagram. I proudly bring you this year's POTENTIALLY amazing release. So let's dive down to see what verdict has the series brought to me ever since it's recent completion. Just note I want to keep spoilers in this review to the bare minimum so I won't ruin it for audience who has yet to see this yet.\r\n*STORY:*\r\nDarling in the FranXX was no underdog for quite some time, ever since it's teaser and trailer releases it has spiked alotof hype and speculation throughout the anime community, it tried it's hardest to revive the 'Mecha' reputation it's former predecessors left from shows like Evangelion, Eureka Seven, Gurren Lagann (shows that particularly follow the shows theme and setup). To start off, I'll cover my thoughts and verdict of the story by breaking it my thought by 6 episodes (e.g: 1-6, 6-12, 12-18, 18-24) So it would be less confusing. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1-6:\\n\r\nDarling in the FranXX is a mecha series that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where mankind fend themselves of monster like enemies called klaxosaurs and humanity has seem to abandon its usual hospitalities to stay within large dome shaped cities or structures, in order to defend humanity children were raised for a sole purpose to fight these klaxosaurs. The deserted environment and theme of fighting off enemies that plan to end mankind seems familiar doesn't it? Fairly similar to Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. Characters in the series pilot mechs called 'FranXX' that need two pilots one male and one female, the female being able to becoming the brains and mind of the FraXX and the male is it's secondary assistive control. With our basic intro and understanding out of the way let me cut to the chase, the way the story introduced the characters and immerse the audience to the first early episodes were amazing, it really felt unique and the protagonist were introduce in a well orderly pace. The mechanics that this world in the anime were well explained throughout its early episode and it is what got the me hooked right off the bat, it sets right environment for the right mood and everything progresses evenly and paced well.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7-12:\\n\r\nNow this is getting juicy, with me promising to minimise spoilers or not spoil at all, looks like this would be abit straight to the point. This is the part of the series where you can see that the story not only build it's characters to detail but build the world it is in. Slowly but surely you'll grasp the mysteries and twist you'd never expect but mind you whatever happens is just at surface level. The build up of the world seems unexpected as you are watching it you'll be in shock that you realise the show is changing quite a fairbit in just 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13-18:\\n\r\nThis range is by far the best part of the story where build ups bears its fruits, the loopholes have been covered up and the well laid foundation has built into a beautiful building. In this range alot has happened to whole environment, new terrains are introduced, intense interactions and well written twist and turns that left jaw-dropped . There's so much to talk here but nevertheless I bid you to enjoy it yourself. This is by far one of those series that has impressed me in terms of how proper foundation of plot can lead to much possibilities.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 19-24:\\n\r\nNow as a vivid fan of the series so far, this range of episodes is by far awful. Imagine building a successful story like a skyscraper so high and beautiful just to knock it down. The plots direction took a turn for the worst in my opinion, it felt rushed, incomplete and it lost it focus for an anime that focus so much on building it's world. Most part of the plot felt extremely forced, I really could feel that how the nonsensically confusing direction the plot direction went.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically on Episode 24:\\n\r\nYes, alot of backlash on the series went to the author yet again on social media but for various of valid reasons but the finale of the series was something to please the audience vigorously violent feelings towards the show. Yes, it fulfilled it's purpose that's the great part about the finale, it felt like after all the mess the show has been through this was the most decent of compensations?\\n\\n\r\n*ART:*\\n\r\nNothing special but you can clearly see where the budget went in the production, the art were quality at most of the times it needed it to be and production budget for the animation seemed to be staked quite highly. The design of the storybook illustration was one of my most impressed things about the series, very detailed. Opening and endings were beautifully animated with crisp clear hidden agendas, so do pay attention! Nevertheless I loved what Trigger studious did with the art for this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*SOUND:*\\n\r\nAlright I'll cover both the Opening and the Ending aslong as OST. Now I want you the audience to know and pay attention that the OP and ED has alot of hidden meanings and early hints on the character and it's not placed randomly. Now the soundtrack the sound effects were crisp and clear, great job Trigger, it felt amazing watching it but ofcourse its great but it definitely isn't the best. So OP, the lyrics for the OP is basically made to compliment the show but  catchy and rhythmatic to keep me from skipping the song. ED lyrics here gets a bit darker and the notes played are definitely a tad bit more solemn than what you'd expect which I think compliments the show very well depicting how the episode always ends in a mild sour note.\\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTER:*\\n\r\nNow no spoilers here as the development is crucial and their mysterious past is what makes you interested in actually giving a damn about them. I would like to say that the series overfocused on certain characters at critical times and that caused a role in the destruction of the plot and as for characters I'd like to say yes amazing development on the characters, well written and nobody is left out but still some characters made no sense in certain important scenes that almost make it seem like plot armour. The villains development was extremely rushed and it made no practical sense but I'll leave that for you do find out.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nLook I hated alot of the things that happened but I would definitely not regret watching it, I really did enjoy it and it was a great run. But overall, I am still very disappointed, this show has so much potential and I truly believed it has that potential to shine as bright as it's predecessors but sadly after all that has happened, this has been quite wasted. I think I am being more than reasonably fair to give it an overall rating of 5/10. I honestly feel it's average to fairly alright at max. Though for what it has in stored, I would recommend it to people who are new this genre or people that want something different and unique to kill their time with. Thank you all for reading. Enjoy.",

            "content": "Overall really enjoyed this anime. Not usually into mecha style, but this was refreshing with the pistil/stamen compatibility factor. \r\nFleshed out characters, most were fairly realistic for younglings. \r\nSpoiler zone ~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe end was unfortunate, it was super rushed.  It was odd to not see kokoro pregnant at all. She was a few weeks and not showing, and then suddenly the baby was born. Then the baby grew up, and suddenly they had 4 kids and everyone else was having kids. It was rushed, I feel like they could have done an OVA or movie to flesh out them growing up.  But it seemsthey want to continue on with getting hiro and zerotwo back to bodies if they continue on with the story, so I guess that just shows how long they've been gone.  I do hope they continue on with this series, since there were a lot of super real moments, like 'irl we need to change or this is our future'.",

            "content": "Looks like Gurren Lagann, smells like Evangelion and at times reminds me of FLCL, but in the end Darling in the FranXX managed to be its own thing.\r\nWithout going into lengthy opener about how I didn\u2019t plan to review it and just want to vent my opinion somewhere due to forums being down, I\u2019d just like to warn any reader that this review might be a bit more personal and messy than what I usually aim for.\r\nI\u2019m not a fan of Trigger style and I generally avoid mecha anime. But I like waifus and Zero Two produced so many fanarts and doujins that I justcouldn\u2019t skip this title. To my surprise I found so much more than a waifu. Whole cast, even if too simple, was interesting. They didn\u2019t make annoying decisions that usually make me cringe when watching this type of anime. But most importantly, they fit their role in story.\\n\r\nSpeaking about story\u2026 it\u2019s so pretty but also so damn all over the place. I absolutely loved direct and nonchalant innuendos and references to puberty and adolescence. The story didn\u2019t try to be subtle like similar titles, it was pretty clear what is the motive and where it\u2019s going. What I\u2019m talking about here isn\u2019t just \u201cbutt piloting\u201d, but rather whole plot of children learning about being a human and about love. The downside is that I\u2019m still not satisfied. This topic could be explored even more.\\n\r\nAnother strong point for DITF\u2019s story is that it\u2019s first time this medium managed to make me doubt logic and cold calculation. It\u2019s one of those rare cases where I actually saw the beauty of living in the moment, it made me appreciate all the problems and worries of daily life and how precious those memories are.\\n\r\nIn the end I guess it's just matter of \"feeling\" it, as stupid as it sounds. Darling in the FranXX simply happened to touch upon topics that caught my interest and feelings.\\n\r\nAnd while the \u201cinsides\u201d of story were awesome, the \u201coutside\u201d part wasn\u2019t that great. Twists without any foreshadowing, friendship power (not that much luckily) and space magic were a serious blow to this anime. There also were tons of little things that got mentioned and never explored or not explained, making the show feel incomplete in some parts.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m not fan of Trigger. But even I can appreciate quality of their work. This anime does look good, and even though it\u2019s not in my taste, I can admit it. I also haven\u2019t noticed any fluctuations in drawing or animation quality.\\n\r\nAnother thing to note is very solid music. As always, I really appreciate when anime uses music at the right times in story, and while DITF could do it more, I\u2019m not disappointed. Opening and all endings were also above average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the most messy and personal part. It can be seen as a rant so feel free to skip it. It also might contain very minor SPOILERS.\\n\r\nThere was a big shitstorm about Ichigo in ep. 14. I don\u2019t get it. She didn\u2019t deserve any hate at all. I expected something drastic but was left scratching my head over fandom\u2019s stupidity.\\n\r\nPeople complain a lot about teens drama and romance in this anime. In my understanding that was the whole point of story. I also didn\u2019t find those forced or in any way obnoxious. What I mean, those parts were exactly why I watched this anime and I feel their intensity was just right.\\n\r\nEnding, even if a bit forced, was great. Most importantly for me it was conclusive, even if they pulled a bit of Angel Beats there.\\n\r\nSome moments felt a bit too close to other anime and at times I totally expected to see situation develop in same way as in those, but in the end I don\u2019t really think DITF crossed the line that much. A bit yeah, but not as much as you\u2019d expect reading some forums.\\n\r\nThis anime got too much hype and popularity and now is suffering for it. Many people make good points about it flaws, but too many jump on the hate bandwagon.\\n",

It forced too much info down our throats. Some of the events that occurred were straight up dumb. The events were rushed through in a few episodes.

            "content": "Before I go deep into my thoughts on the show itself, I want to lay the groundwork for why I'm about to defend Darling in the FranXX a bit and why, despite its flaws and my own personal grievances, I rate it so highly. Even though I want to start tackling the complaints as soon as possible, I need to state that I still love Darling in the FranXX and my bias will be obvious as we continue. I try really hard to remain objective, but it's hard to not defend something that you love. Anyway, let me start with the backstory.\r\nWhen it was announcedin July of 2017, dropping its preview image, I was instantly transfixed. That was the moment I fell in love with Zero Two's design. More than that, I fell in love with the idea of the show. It could have been whatever genre it wanted and I would have watched it. Now, I must admit that my faith did waiver when I saw that it was mecha show, because, at the time, I hadn't really been much into the idea of a mecha genre. I told myself that I would still give it a chance, even if it wasn't completely in line with my vision. And then, it began to air. From the very first shot of Zero Two in episode one, I knew that my hype had been rewarded. Little did I know how crazy a ride I was in for. Crazy, but so much fun that I wouldn't trade the experience with anything, despite what the popular opinion is now. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, for the things I loved. First off, the characters. I know this is somewhat unpopular, with people saying how they didn't get a lot of development, which doesn't really have any merit in my eyes. Each character got their own segments of development, even if it was in a small way. Miku is perhaps the only character where we can point the finger and say that she got the least attention of them all, but then you can also say that Futoshi got the same treatment. Either way, I'm going to be bold and say that, by the end, every character had gone through an arc, albeit, maybe somewhat small due to the scope of the show and the space arc that is so problematic, but more on that later on. I think we could rewatch Darling in the FranXX and clearly see that each of the main characters came a looooong way from the children that they were in episode one. Connected to the point on characters, I loved the design for every single character in the show. Each was unique in their own way and well drawn. I don't think there's a ton more I can add to that point, I just really liked the art direction in general. \\n\\n\r\nZero Two and Hiro's interactions were a constant positive for Darling in the FranXX. In fact, I would say that their relationship carried the show 90% of the time. In fact, their two biggest episodes, 13 and 15, may be two of my favorite episodes of all time. That being said, from the start their dynamic was intoxicating. From the moment they had their first contact, to when she pulled him into the FranXX, to their touching finale, they remained a constant positive, even if the direction their ending went wasn't so great. It's just a rare instance of two characters balancing each other out so well that neither one seems to be more important than the other in the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of other things that I loved, such as music, but most of the other things are mixed with the things that I had issues with toward the end of the show and I'll try and tackle them here. As much as I adore Darling in the FranXX, I am going to be overly critical from here on out, because most of the decisions were god-awful and could have been avoided so easily. First off, the world that Darling in the FranXX built. There was so much potential here, so many directions they could have taken with the post-apocalyptic wasteland that was left, but by the end, it was by and large, pushed aside for a silly twist that I think everyone could have done without. Don't get me wrong, seeing the children revive the earth in the later episodes was cool, but it was one of the few bright spots in the final 4-5 episodes. Which brings me to the main issue with the show, the last arc. Why? Just why did this have to happen? I get the symbolism involved with may of the choices, but that doesn't change the fact that they just pulled this plot twist out of nowhere. Suddenly, the antagonists weren't antagonists anymore and barely mattered, 'friends' become enemies and vice versa, and space. That sentence basically sums the entire last arc up. It's bizarre. It's like someone burned their script for the last month and they were like,\" How do we make this as stupid of a conclusion as possible?\" It's such a shame too, because they had all the pieces for a phenomenal ending. Instead, they got too ambitious and tried to recreate Gurren Lagann, with a hint of Evangelion, Your Name, and Kill la Kill. I think the only question that we can reasonably pose at this point is: why?\\n\\n\r\nThat issue doesn't even touch on the fact that they threw away the one character that made the show popular in the first place: Zero Two. If you're watching for Zero Two, you may as well stop after episode 15 or so, because she's pretty much a completely different character after those episodes. It's a real shame too, because she was set up for some real growth, but instead kind of becomes...kind of childish, I guess? I can't really put my finger on the character she becomes, but the point stands, she loses the personality that made us all fall in love with her. And I can't say that hated it, I really liked seeing Zero Two genuinely happy for a while, but with the last arc in perspective, I feel somewhat robbed of my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nWith all my ranting, the fact remains that Darling in the FranXX holds a special place in my heart and I would not trade watching it these past 7 months or so for anything. I think that it kind of buckled under its own hype train. It was never going to be good enough to deliver on everyone's hype for the show. I think a lot of anime originals suffer the same fate, where they can't necessarily meet the expectations placed upon them. A recent example of a similar problem would be Tada-kun from this season. It was pretty well loved, until it concluded in a relatively normal way and failed to meet the fan theorist's expectations. I can applaud the writers for shooting for the moon and trying to make something spectacular, but it was all wasted effort in my eyes. I think Darling in the FranXX can teach most of us seasonal watchers something important though. The dangers of hype, especially long anime originals, like Darling in the FranXX. Frequently, we elevate something like this to a level that it never was going to be able reach, and despite our high hopes, always disappoint us. It's just so hard for anime originals to please everyone and Darling in the FranXX is no different from the many shows that have come before it.",

            "content": "How do you quantify a series that was rather good up to a point, but then takes a significant nose dive in its quality? This is the question that I had to ask myself when I finished watching Darling in the FranXX. \r\nDarling in the FranXX is a post-apocalyptic mecha series based in a unique setting with a futuristic utilitarian society fighting to survive against attacks from strange giant blue monsters. However, one of the most immediately striking things about the series is the dual-piloting system of the mecha which many have deemed \u201cbutt controls\u201d. Your ability to enjoy this series in any way couldvery well hinge on whether or not you can at least tolerate the silliness of how these mechs are piloted, but this design choice does serve a purpose as a metaphor of one of Darling\u2019s underlying themes: The development and sustainment of personal relationships with others.\\n\\n\r\nDarling is also perhaps the first ever new, currently airing anime series to ever be referenced by major celebrity. Now, as much as it pains me to acknowledge a Kardashian as a \u201cmajor celebrity\u201d, Darling in the FranXX being mentioned by Kim Kardashian is kind of a big deal since, although it may have been one of the biggest new shows of its season, this wasn\u2019t some super popular shounen franchise or even a show that could have been stumbled on while browsing Netflix or Amazon. This was a new original series showing on Crunchyroll. Now, this has no real barring on the show\u2019s quality, but this is undoubtedly significant to the anime medium as a whole whether you like the Kardashians or not.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Darling in the FranXX began rather strong, or at least rather good and showed a lot of promise. But then, things happened. To go into more details of what those \u201cthings\u201d were, here are my category breakouts:\\n\\n\r\n-----Story - 4 out of 10-----\\n\r\nThis was one of the hardest categories for me to stick to a score for as it had the most drastic shift in quality as the series went on. Darling starts as a series with a very well-paced and balanced story, building its world in a delicate manner and dividing screen time nicely between cool mecha/monster fights, good character interactions, and interesting global intrigue. You wonder what exactly is going on and who the true enemy is and the series seems to have some interesting things to say about the value of relationships with one another. While there are some minor hiccups along the way, the story is rather well executed all the way through to episode 15 where we\u2019re treated to a rather wonderful climax and left wondering what was going to happen next!\\n\\n\r\nThen, everything was kind of downhill from there. We shift gears into a bit of a hard slice-of-life arc. Now, I personally love slice of life and didn\u2019t really mind this aspect of the show, but when the series started dedicating entire episodes to this format it began to lose focus. The pacing became extremely erratic, going from slow progression of next-to-nothing happening and jumping to shoving as much plot into the episode as possible. It felt as if the direction of the story had a total breakdown. It was like they had an overall idea of where they wanted to take the series all along, but then realized that they were quickly running out of episodes in which to tell that story. It was like watching a failure of time management unfolding week-to-week, episode-by-episode. And then there was the episode that just went ahead and explained everything about the story in flashbacks and narration instead of continuing to organically build the world and its story.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the series ended, I didn\u2019t really care anymore. I\u2019d lost all interest in the story that was being told and the message behind it. I was hoping for some kind of payoff at the end, but the ending was at most just \u201cokay\u201d. While the first 15 episodes told a rather good story, the remaining 9 where just an absolute mess. It was all really sad, and not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\n-----Art - 8 out of 10-----\\n\r\nWhen people talk about quality drop-off in an anime, the art and animation quality is usually one of the biggest things to suffer. That\u2019s not really the case in Darling. From what I could tell, the art and animation in the series was very consistently good throughout. For the most part, the CG that was used in the series blended very well with the traditional-style digital animation. There were a few moments of jarringly noticeable CG when it came to some of the monsters, but even then it wasn\u2019t that bad. The character and mecha designs all looked really cool (although the lady-mechs could take some getting used to) and there were some really nice action sequences. I\u2019d say that perhaps my biggest (albeit still minor) disappointment in the art department is that, with this being a Trigger co-production, there weren\u2019t quite enough REALLY BIG epic animation moments for my tastes, especially in the last 9 episodes. In a way it was nice to see Trigger show some restraint and not go full Gurren Lagann for the finale, but I also kind of wanted and was expecting there to be some of that to some extent.\\n\\n\r\n-----Sound - 8 out of 10-----\\n\r\nAgain, no real complaints or drop-off in the quality of the sound in Darling. The score and voice acting was solid. The opening theme song is really catchy and the ending theme was nice. The only really unfortunately thing in this department was the fact that Goro\u2019s voice actor had some health issues and had to be replaced for the final two episodes. I didn\u2019t really notice the change in episode 23, but man, in the final episode Goro sounded very different. I can\u2019t really fault the show too much for that, but I do feel like they should have been able to get a voice that was a bit closer to the original so it wasn\u2019t quite so jarring.\\n\\n\r\n-----Characters - 6 out of 10-----\\n\r\nWhile the characters in the series didn\u2019t deteriorate quite as badly as the story, there was still a significant drop in quality here. The series began with Hiro, our main boy, desperately wanting to pilot a giant robot (you could call him the anti-Shinji). The first 15 episodes are largely built around a boy-meets-girl story between him and Zero Two, a fun feisty girl with a mysterious past. Zero Two can be an especially great breath of fresh air if you\u2019re tired of common anime girl tropes like those who are easily embarrassed, quick to anger, and/or girls who just can\u2019t be upfront about their feelings to save their lives. The relationship between Hiro and Zero Two develops very well as the series goes on and it has a good supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Darling puts all of their eggs in one basket with Hiro and Zero Two. Once their relationship is pretty much fully developed and all conflict around it is resolved with the climax of episode 15, the couple gets regulated to the background a bit. The other characters in the series are interesting in their own way, but they just do not carry the same force behind them as Hiro and Zero Two. I lost interest in most of the other characters largely because they didn\u2019t measure up to the same level and the story being told around them just wasn\u2019t all that interesting. Combine that with the villain of the story being extremely underwhelming when it was revealed and new side characters being underutilized or badly used to begin with and the overall character level of the final 9 episodes gets a resounding \u201cmeh\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n-----Enjoyment - 6 out of 10-----\\n\r\nAfter I finished the final episode of Darling in the FranXX, it was hard for me to quantify just exactly how I felt about it as a whole. While I thoroughly enjoyed the first 15 episodes, the breakdown that followed simply squandered any potential that the series had to be truly great. The series pulled some genuinely powerful feelings from me early on, but by the end of it all I just got bored, didn\u2019t care where the story was going, was done with the characters, and was just waiting for it to all be over. However, while it ended on a very underwhelming note and had some absolutely horrendous storytelling to get to that point, I can\u2019t completely ignore the parts that I truly enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\n-----Overall - 6 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----\\n\r\nMy overall rating for Darling in the FranXX was also hard for me to quantify. In the end I went with the same score as my Enjoyment because I had to go through the exact same balancing act here. Did the last 9 episodes completely annihilate how solidly good the first 15 episodes were? I don\u2019t think so, but for some people the ending is one of the most important parts of a series. For me it was truly sad to see what became of this series, but I am still glad that I watched Darling in the FranXX.\\n\\n\r\nBut after this, would I recommend the series to others? I can\u2019t give a blanket answer to that question. If you\u2019ve read this review, you probably know if it would be worth your time. However, to sum it all up, if you are itching for a new mecha series to watch and you can look past some really bad storytelling and a rushed finale that might not be fully satisfying, then sure, give this a shot. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t see yourself getting past the somewhat silly piloting system of the mechs, you\u2019re really sensitive to a well-paced story, and/or the ending of a series is very important to you, then you probably shouldn\u2019t bother.",

I loved this anime a lot from start to finish, I waited each week and each saturday(!!delayed!! so not every saturday) I was welcomed with another episode that I enjoyed a lot. Simply said this anime made my life better. I have yet to watch another one that left the same mark on me after the ending of an episode. I look forward to being ableto watch more anime like this one from now on! It certainly isn't perfect but for me it is a masterpiece! \\n\\n\r\nThe art was simple yet beautiful and it had a lot of amazing shots as well. But in the end that is just my opinion and I am sure that there are shows way more beautiful out there but the style fits the sory.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the rhythm of the music during the fight scenes but also the songs from the OP and ED it just felf right.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters were not as developed as they should have been but in the end it still made sense and I could see myself in their place.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show every week that it aired and felt better afterwards!\\n\\n\\n\r\nBecause I have watched anime that were better I will rate it  9.5  because some things were done wrong and broke the flow of the story at least for me they did!",

The 3 series only have one thing in common, and that is the Mecha genre.\r\nDarling in the Franxx does a masterful job of delving into and following through on social issues, sexuality and adolescence. Neither GL or NGE even touch on any of the aspects that DITF touched on. \r\nThe soundtrack is really great and always fits well in every scene, the ending of the series made use of it best. The art was always very detailed and crisp, the fights were splendid andwere done very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this show is some of the best. They take the issues and personalities of 7 people and dive into them equally, showing the growth of each individual character. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was great and had twists I didn't expect but that is the whole point of twists. Hiro always wanted to get away and explore the world and the essentially what Franxx is about amongst other things.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the negative reviews bias you to the series, this is one of the greatest series in 2018 alongiside Nanatsu No Taizai. Everyone watching the series was judging each episode before the next, like it wasn't telling a story. See for yourself and think for yourself.",

            "content": "As im sure most of you have seen these past six months. We could not escape the anime phenomenon known as Darling in the Franxx. Whether you watched the series weekly as i did. Or you caught on later. Or you\u2019ve just seen the buzz going around. Whether it be praise or hate, Franxx has helped define 2018 in Anime thus far and its mark will not go away. It is and will be one of the most talked about anime of the year by the end of this year itself. Infamous or over celebrated, awful or beautiful, good or bad. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve allseen something about it going around. Especially for those of us following weekly.  Even if it\u2019s just some art of Zero Two, its been prominent. So i thought i\u2019d do a write up as i\u2019ll call it about the series and what it means to me, how i felt about it, and just how good or bad i thought it to be. Buckle up. This is gonna be a long one. Spoiler Free of course, just vague mentionings.\\n\\n\r\nStory: so the story is a complicated one. We start out with a group of teenagers who are essentially forced to pilot giant robots in order to stay alive and have purpose. They do this all basically cause they dont know what else to do. They have no other meaning to life than to fight ad obey the one known as Papa. The story kicks off with a boy named Hiro who has just about flunked out of his training group, whom are given the designation of Parasites, do to low test scores. Having been originally selected to lead the group,  Hiro meets an enigmatic girl with horns named Zero Two. 02 whisks him away from his dull meaningless life and shows him the bigger world beyond his sheltered life of meaningless fighting. Through Hiro\u2019s interactions with 02 he grows and changes immensely as a person. The Hiro we see at the end is so, so much different than the one we start with. But the story itself is very broad, it covers a bunch of topics and themes as we as the audience go through a lot ourselves too. Emotional rollercoaster is an understatement. \\n\\n\r\nArt: i gotta say that the art and animation are probably the best aspects of the show, while my personal favorite maybe its themes, the animation and art are simply incredible throughout. Its done by a joint effort of A1 Pictures, Studio Trigger, and Cloverworks. All three pitch in well and the visuals are quite strong all the way through. Not much to say here really. Its just really damn good to look at. Art style is really cool looking and animation never really lets down. Action scenes always look incredible. \\n\\n\r\nSound: again, not much to say here. Sound design is good, mechs sound like mechs ya know. Big thing comment on is the dub i guess. So if you\u2019re not a dub fan then skip most of this section. Its alright, the dub. The actor who plays our main character Hiro is kinda bad to me, but the rest of the cast is really good. Shout out to the actress who plays 02, best performance in the dub. But yeah, sound for the show itself is good. Opening song is catchy but not the best. Like its fine. There were multiple different ending song though, they were all pretty good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: ok this will be the largest section yet, except the overall section, as i have tons, and tons to say about the characters. A wide array of colorful folks on this cast. Let\u2019s start with the main pair. Hiro and 02. They are a really solid couple and the emotional core of the show honestly. They are such a story focus, hence why they are the only characters i mention by name in the story section above. Because they are a lot of this show. How much you like them just about determines how much you like this show as a whole. Thats how much they matter. Personally speaking, i enjoyed their journey together, they are forced apart and come back soaring together many times. There\u2019s a very big prince and princess vibe, and story point too, and they fit that motif well. Other characters which make up our Squad 13 Parasite group whom are heavily involved were Goro, the strong best friend type, and best boy. Ichigo the strong willed female leader. Mitsuru the smug punk with a complex, aka me as an anime character. Kokoro the sweet girl. Miku the spunky girl. Ikuno the quiet girl. Zorome the loud guy. Futoshi the big teddy bear guy. With a ton of other side characters to boot. The Nines, Nana, Hachi. Papa, APE, VIRM, the other children, bunch of sides here with of people are parties involved. That\u2019s all i can really describe them as without going into spoilers. But believe me when i say they all make an impact, they all matter. The characters are strong. Even if some make you mad, as some did me, that is still a testament to how well written they are to cause you to feel as such. Love the characters in this show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i\u2019ve you\u2019ve read this far you\u2019ll see how much i\u2019ve gushed about this show. As vaugily and spoiler free as i could of course. It was an absolute blast. Yes there were moments that made me want to pull my hair out. Yes there were moments where i got super pissed at this show. But nonetheless, it was the moment of the week for me anime wise. It was the hype each week, along with MHA obviously. Had too much fun with this show to call it anything other than enjoyable. The lows were low as hell, but the highs were sky high. Its just one of those shows. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: this show is something of an oddity for me in a way. I mean i obviously loved it but i did legit hate it for a time. I will say though that it was a wonderful ride. Its themes were works of beauty. The overall message and metaphors the shows make are so sweet and heartfelt. Not talking about all the sexual innuendos either lots of that too, but not what i mean, the show is very sexually forthcoming by the way. Hits a lot of sexual themes too. But what i most enjoyed were the messages of connecting with people, leaning on each other for support, communication, trust, connection, humanity, love, and freedom. Its incredible thematically. The way it handles its story may not be the best and is clunky at times. But the way it handles its themes is top notch. I loved this show. I also have to quickly note that the ending, which just aired today, was one of the best and sweetest endings to an anime ive ever seen. This show was a joy for me. Its rights outweigh its wrongs by a ton in my book. I wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone who likes character driven stories, anyone who likes a strong message of love and family and purpose, anyone who likes good action, and anyone who just likes to feel emotions when you see a story. Cause love or hate, you\u2019ll feel a bunch from this show. I give it a 9/10.",

On the surface it paraded itself as an action mech anime that screamed fan service but watching it further you start to uncover a hidden agenda that aims to put a thumbtack on what it means to be human ultimately making this more than just a visually stunning anime. \r\nWhile Darling in the Franxx doesn't quite go heavy on the action,something studio trigger has been known to do in the past, it certainly pleases on an aesthetic level. Animations are fluid and character designs protagonists and antagonists alike both share aninstant likability. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime mainly follows two characters in particular Hiro, a potential pilot who at the start of the anime is teetering on losing an opportunity to become one due to his inability to find a match, and 002 a mysterious operator of a special Mech that up until this point no pilot has been able to survive with longer than 3 outings. A fateful encounter obviously results in an outcome that will change the lives of these two individuals forever. \\n\\n\r\nFranxx's plot is masterful in both keeping its secrets though hints throughout the series often make it more than predictable that things are just not adding up. Outside of an interesting plot line, however, is the character growth of Hiro and his surrounding allies. Its deceptive use of adolescent characters living in an environment that adults only observe leads to this constructive thesis about human relationships something I never saw coming from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't the most engaging centerpiece to this beautiful looking anime. None the less, it manages to fit in and complement in no way being a detriment to each episode. \\n\\n\r\nDarling in the Franxx is certainly not an anime that aims to go over the top, at least not in terms of its action. It delivers in its overall message while at the same time pleases in terms of its visual fidelity making it one of the standouts that came out during the winter season of anime and I highly recommend you give this a watch if this one missed your radar.",

That\u2019s not well as Goro has feelings for Ichigo. Not only Goro but Ikuno also has feelings for Ichigo. Ikuno is not in relationship with her partner Mitsuru as Mitsuru is in love with Kokoro. Kokoro also loves Mitsuru back but unfortunately Futoshi has feelings for Kokoro.\r\nAfter reading that I wantto tell you guys that DarliFra is an anime about  Dystopian mecha where mecha pilots fight giant deadly creatures. \\n\r\nDoesn\u2019t fit, right? Well that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s this anime gonna throw at you. It\u2019s 80% soap opera and waifu wars and 20% humanity survival against monsters. \\n\\n\r\nIt is even more unlucky that the bulk of love triangles revolve around characters that cannot be even described with more than 10 lines.\\n\r\nHiro= generic MC-kun\\n\r\nIchigo=Childhood friend and waifu no.1\\n\r\n02=Waifu no.2 and TBH an actual good character\u2026.until she\u2019s not anymore\\n\r\nFutoshi= The fat guy\\n\r\nZorome= The \u2018\u2019dattebayo\u2019\u2019 boy\\n\r\nMiku= The loud girl\\n\r\nIkuno= The token lesbian girl\\n\r\nGoro= The bro dude\\n\r\nKokoro= The pure girl until she\u2019s not anymore\\n\r\nMitsuru=The autistic dude until he\u2019s not anymore\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I\u2019m telling you about characters is that the show itself spends so much time showing these characters eat, take bath, change clothes, and then take bath again. When your characters aren\u2019t good so only two things to make interaction interesting is\u2026.no.1 fanservice and no.2 best girl wars.\\n\r\nThe fact that the manga adaptation of this actually shows uncensored fanservice is kinda sad. The pandering waifu wars worsen the appeal of this show. In other words it\u2019s yet another pandering show.\\n\r\nThe disheartening reality is that the world-building aspects are thrown out of window even when they could be so damn interesting. The world they built is so confusing and fragmentary that I think even creators had no idea where they were going with this. I talked about that this show has 40% mecha \u2026well they aren\u2019t so exciting as you hope they would be.  Now, there is an episode( only 1) dedicated to how the current world came to be and pitiably that episode is the worst of entire show. Everything that is revealed in that episode was extremely integral for this entire show. And in simple words the revelations part was the most idiotic and laughable thing I\u2019ve seen this entire year.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also full of SYMBOLISM **flashbacks to doggy style mecha-riding and \u2018\u2019I want to make a baby\u2019\u2019**\\n\r\nThe final part of the anime feels so disjoint and messy that it actually becomes a joke. Everything about characters that are not figurines worthy is casted aside. I can\u2019t spoil much but what happens in the final few episodes is just so jarring and unfitting that in simple words, makes an already average anime genuinely bad.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Production\u2014\\n\r\nA collaboration between Trigger and A-1 pictures sounds exciting. Leave it there since it only \u2018sounds\u2019 exciting. The animation itself sometimes kicks itself to \u2018\u2019holy shizzz is sakuga time\u2019\u2019 but hot damn the choreography is so messy and mediocre that you actually want the battles to be over so characters could go back and bitch-slap eachother.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is ok, nothing notable here. One thing for sure though the design of zero two is genuinely attractive. Some other characters also have good designs like  those of Kokoro, Ichigo and Goro.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Enjoyment\u2014\\n\r\nFortunately, DarliFra can be fun to watch. Dumb but fun. Keyword \u2018can\u2019 as it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. I mean c\u2019mon 14 year olds talking about baby-making and reproduction gets kinda silly and the innuendos are fun to catch onto as well.\\n\r\nProblem occurs when it tries to be very serious. The drama, action, stakes, world-building are average at best. \\n\r\nPersonally after being through the latter half of this show, I can say that I enjoyed the first half. Everything that came after was painful to sit through.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Conclusion\u2014\\n\r\nIf female characters moaning while bent over in mecha and male characters blushing and panting all the while is your thing then go for it. If you think you can be entertained by a brainless anime then go for it. You are certainly going to come across something enjoyable. Be warn though, it\u2019s not NGE or Shinsekai Yori. Even if it\u2019s wants to be one of them, it ends up being a pale imitation that caters to lowest common denominators.\\n\r\nCharacters=4/10\\n\r\nStory=3/10\\n\r\nAnimation=7/10\\n\r\nSound=7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment=5/10\\n\r\nOverall= 4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u00ac\u2014Extra arbitrary thoughts\u2014\\n\r\n*MAJOR spoilers\\n\r\nApparently energy from magma can give you immortality and cause desertification.\\n\r\nWhy do mechs have anime-ish expressions and facial features? Seriously the entire mecha waifus things is so dumb.\\n\r\nWhat was the reason behind 01 being as younger looking as rest of the cast?\\n\r\nThe rift in Mitsuru\u2019s character was very poorly handled. 02 was so interesting but they turned her into a cheery and sparkly girl. They also forgot the rest of the supporting cast\u2019s issues. All of them were facing something psychologically but none of it mattered in the finale.\\n\r\nThere were multiple MULTIPLE episodes showing these papercut characters eat, fight and talk about kissing but only 1 episode for the origin of world! Even in that episode, the explanation of very unsatisfactory and underwhelming.\\n\r\nWhy was the doctor so in love with 01. That just came out of nowhere. All of the series happened because Doc was an Atheist, huh. \\n\r\nWTH inter galactic battles, seriously\\n\r\n The finale SUCKED man.\\n\r\nNo amount of \u2018more episodes\u2019 could\u2019ve saved this trainwreck.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nDarling in the FranXX branded itself as a mecha show even though its central focus was actually on teenage relationships. I didn't really have a problem with this, as it was done extremely well done, but towards the end of the series the narrative shifted its focus from teenage relationships to motherfucking aliens. With everything the story had to offer, it gave us aliens. Do aliens have anything to do with the central theme of the show? Or better yet, what was the point of half the show being spent on sex and relationships, if it was aliens all along? What narrative purposedid aliens serve? How did aliens attacking our fucking planet relate to the simplistic problems of an adolescent romantic relationship? How the fuck did trigger manage to squander such abundant potential? These guys couldn't even make the 'enemy of my enemy is my friend' bullshit with the Nines seem cool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nHiro and Zero Two are the classic \"bland self-insert male MC and exotic vivacious pixie dream girl\" trope pairing. Usually a successful pairing involves both the main characters being interesting and well-written enough to each hold up their end of the bargain by being each others foils (e.g. Spice and Wolf). But not only is Hiro utterly uninteresting and painfully conventional, he failed to serve as Zero Two's foil and managed to ruin Zero Two's character by transforming her from the mysterious dominatrix she was during the beginning of the show into an utterly uninteresting and formulaic love interest. Ever since Episode 13, she has done literally nothing interesting other than reaffirm her love for Hiro in every other scene. All her personality and individuality vanished. This has to be the biggest character downfall in all of recent media. I thought to myself that no matter how bad the show itself ended up, at least Zero Two would've been a memorable heroine, a domineerng, lively waifu that supports the protagonist to the best of her ability like Senjougahara, but that's gone out the window. She ceased being a character halfway through the show. In episode 22, she literally turned into a vegetable that Hiro must rescue, a scenario that is identical to the infamous ALO arc in Sword Art Online. Moreover, I'd like to ask the writers if they were trying to portray Dr. Franxx as a tragic anti-hero, Seriously? Because for majority of time when Dr. Franxx was on screen, we knew him as someone who does live experiments on children. After a poorly written backstory on him, the writers try and disillusion us into thinking his story is tragic. After this guy was played up as an antagonistic figure who experimented on live children, but in order for us, the audience, to be able to cheer for an anti-hero is to make us sympathize with them, but this guy pretty much does nothing to redeem himself, remember the first time Franxx we saw Dr.FranXX? When he was slapping Nana's ass? This is the character that the writers are asking us to cheer for? Then the Klax princess died for no reason. After millennia of resistance, and watching her entire species turn in weapons, she just sacrificed herself because bland self-insert MC is Kirito's descendant and as a result can be trusted with earth's fate, cool. Klax princess is less of a character and more of an NPC quest that was set up for the main characters. Miku and Zorome are fodder than have absolutely no imporantance, Ikuno was a failed attempt at appeasing the LGBT community, the only reason Futoshi exists is to make fun of fat people, who the fuck cared when 9\u03b1 died? Goro is just the classic \"nice guy who finishes last\", Kokoro and Mitsuru's characters were cheapened by the amnesia fuckery and do you know what I find funny? The fact that the most controversial character in the show, Ichigo, was actually the most well-written character in the show, who's big moment in episode 14 was an extremely realistic portrayal of heartbreak and loss. (iS tHis lOsS? heh, memes are great)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros & and Cons for Animation and Sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\n+ Eye catching sakuga\\n\r\n+ Great character animation for character moments\\n\r\n- Second rate mech action\\n\r\n- Uninspired backgrouds.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\n+ Orgasm inducing OP and EDs\\n\r\n+ Great Voice Acting\\n\r\n+ GUYS THE BGM WAS ACTUALLY GOOD\\n\r\n- Sometimes the music distracted from the scene itself\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10: \\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first half of this series, so much so that I would talk about it with friends, be it online or irl every time the new episode went up. However, after the halfway point Darling in the FranXX ceased making me feel anything close to joy and instead made me skip the through the episode so that I could move on with my day. \\n\r\nDo I recommend watching this show? Absolutely not.\\n\\n\\n",

Really sad about an anime that could have been easily one of the bests of these years.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end i kinda suggest you this show, it's enjoyable but you should have low expecations(unfortunately)",

            "content": "There's already many reviews on this wild ride of an anime, but I would like to add my own, spoiler-free short opinion on whether I think it's worth spending time on it or not.\r\nBefore I start, I'd like to say that I like a lot of Trigger's works. Kill La Kill is probably my favorite anime ever, and I've enjoyed others like Space Patrol Luluco, Little Witch Academia or Gridman quite a lot. But I had heard that Darling in the Franxx had caused a lot of polemic as it was airing and I know some of my friends hated it so I watched itwith low expectations, just another anime to pass the time that I thought would leave me indifferent. But oh boy. That was an experience. \\n\\n\r\nObjectively, Darling in the Franxx is one of the worst written animes I've ever seen. It feels as if the writers didn't know where they wanted to take the story and were just making decisions on the spot with no prior planning. The setting could have been interesting, but the few bits of world development they give us keep contradicting each other. For example, the main characters supposedly don't know what sex, romance, love, marriage or kisses are, and yet somehow they're extremely body conscious, see nudity in a sexual way and know the meaning of words such as pervert or romantic. How does that make any sense? It feels as if the writers had the potential for a really interesting world setting but threw it out the window for some generic ecchi? The story itself has no cohesion either, it's mainly just things happening with no explanation whatsoever (and when there's an explanation, it tends to be either illogical or contradict the information we had been told previously), with a few occasional very crazy plot twits. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all plain and underdeveloped, and sometimes their actions and choices make very little sense to the point that it's hard to understand what's going on. There's no real development leading them to do the things they do, and some of their choices are so exaggerated and hard to relate that the dramatic moments seem quite comedic. The only character who acts like a normal person most of the time is Goro, a shame he doesn't get much development either.\\n\r\nSame goes for the villains btw, they're either terrible at being villains or just make a lot of illogical decisions for whatever reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance is really poorly written as well, it's just characters deciding they love each other and promising to stay together forever with barely any chemistry between them. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I did like a lot about this show is the opening, a really nice and catchy song. The voice actors are talented as well, but no amount of talent could distract me from the nonsense that most of the dialogues are. \\n\\n\r\nBut, no matter how bad this anime is and how questionable and sexist some of its points are, I can't bring myself to actually hate it. I had fun watching all the ridiculous teen drama and all the weird over the top things happening towards the end. I have no idea what this anime was trying to tell and what the hell did I watch, but it didn't bore me. It was pretty entertaining to see the characters take all these illogical choices, and the infamous over the top teen drama in episode 14 was almost hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary, should you watch this anime? If you're the kind of person who likes to watch poorly written shows for the fun of it, then you might find some enjoyment on this. If you want to watch a good anime though, please watch something else. Basically any other mecha show is better than this trainwreck. \\n",

            "content": "The Hype, the Syndrome, and the Disappointments\r\n\r\nThere was a time that when certain anime went really popular and bombastic, eventually they\u2019ll be overrated with such inevitable and silly excuses. But beyond this stage of people 'overrating' a series, lies the last layer of what anime watchers will do to these so-called \u2018popular\u2019 shows. It\u2019s a layer that I, myself would call it \u2018meme layer\u2019 because to be frank, this is the right place to disclosure a condition where there is no point of turning back. The place that you can joke (more like, roast) about the characters, the rotation of the plot, thegraphics, literally anything. With no exceptions and no prohibition, you can send your best meme to the highest bidder (or should I say shitpost accounts) about some character\u2019s thigh and laughed until you\u2019re dying from it. Amongst those pile of memes and trashy community jokes, Darling in the Franxx (DiTF) exists not as a temporary guest, but more of a contracted host. I mean, when we look back at whatever series that exist in 2018, which one of these words are the quickest to ring your bell?\\n\\n\r\nHinamatsuri, Violet, Zero Two, Rikka, Yuru Camp, Bunny Girl\\n\\n\r\nI have to say if you didn\u2019t pick Zero Two it\u2019s either you literally new to anime world or you just had a head cancer with 120 pounds of hypocrisy on it. Even one of my friend (who isn\u2019t too eager to enjoy anime) knows about the existence of Zero Two. When I asked where did he learn this \u201802\u2019 girl, he said to me, \u201cfrom those shitpost accounts, her memes are great. You should check it out, man\u201d. These things were happening like crazy, and such popularity isn\u2019t easy to achieve. The word \u2018Zero Two\u2019 would probably go out from your mouth first before \u2018Darling in the Franxx\u2019 when promoting this series to a newbie like that 15 years-old little John sitting beside you right now. In the end, came an understanding that we can\u2019t talk about Darling in the Franxx without mentioning Zero Two. She\u2019s the literal wheelhouse of the whole series, without her this anime probably went so bad that studio Trigger considering themselves they won\u2019t make another anime, ever. And that\u2019s what makes this series very interesting and intriguing, at least before certain episodes when they \u2018flex-taped\u2019 those ugly plot holes with aliens.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m starting to watch this series when it already aired between episode 16 or 17. Either way, I had pretty decent expectations considering many are talking about its contents, especially that girl \u2018Zero Two\u2019 that I haven\u2019t really got my hands on. Starting from episode 1, I had so many questions left unanswered and quickly attached this \u2018curiosity string\u2019 to me. Following the ten or eleven episodes after that, I believe that my questions are beginning to pile up as if nothing were left unanswered by the series. Speaking of which, between these episodes, I realized that there\u2019re big, unlimited possibilities and potential of what this series to become. I proceed myself and finally reached episode 13, which blew me out of the water. Clearly, they have structured a strong development and connection between Zero Two and Hiro -the main protagonists, emphasized it on the shockingly twist at the end of this episode. Moreover, it was more than just a beautiful scene and I adore it so much that I believe this series is going to be awesome.\\n\\n\r\nA little recap, I think developments on the characters and the world are great and definitely stayed to entertain myself from more extraordinary adventures to come. It becomes even better when Zero Two is detained, Hiro simply wants to meet her but his friend doesn\u2019t allow him. This creates a well-balanced conflict that was both lovely and intriguing. There is one episode when Hiro finally met Zero Two again and they had this quick debate but it ended up with a profoundly, exaggerated, over-the-top couple scene. Although it\u2019s kind of clich\u00e9, you certainly will feel the blast and spirit coming out of your soul. Sadly, after that, the series went a little bit slow and differ from what I expected, and it really becomes worse after the episode which alien figures are presented. It was honestly a very dishonourable moment for wasting such good material at the beginning. Like, they already construct something that\u2019s mysteriously going to be an awesome shit, but now they seem a little (if not, very) reckless about the continuity of the story and have chosen an atrocious plotline instead. The series ended in a poetic way that expressed the deepest love between Hiro and Zero Two, but with no doubt, I came in a plain conclusion that the alien parts have no matter and use whatsoever regarding of driving the main premise. I can\u2019t assure you that DiTF was made to express a romance story that is covered by dystopian-mecha plot, but taking a closer look at what the series trying to achieve, it\u2019s very possible. \\n\\n\r\nSome viewers are so disappointed that they immediately hate this series. I think this series deserves some credits for its high considerations for the characters, and how the world was unravelled little by little. The series failed to cope with what the audiences have perceived and expected, but that happened after the first cour, which is a little bit understatement at most. Overall, DiTF has pros and cons that some people might find it a little hard to be tolerated, but it surely brings care and attention from the community to another level for serving them a delightful annual waifu war. \\n\\n",

They put together perfect characters and a perfect way to make them all connected. The relationship ZeroTwo and Hiro have is one of my favorite out of every Anime i have watched. For me personally i would have liked a better ending , but other than that this anime is great. I watched this whole anime in less that 2 days and now i want more. There is no season 2 as of now, but there may be one later. Ifyou have not watched this anime i highly advise you do. The end made me make this account to make a review and you will probably get why when you finish.",

            "content": "I'm going straight to the point: I loved this anime, but I'm going to be objective about its flaws and give my sincere opinion about the overall enjoyment and the more technical elements of this anime.\r\nAnimation: 10\r\nCharacter Design: 6\r\nThe graphics are pretty, but aside from Zero-Two character's design, there's not much that stands out. Not even the giant robots; their design is honestly tacky.\r\nMusic: 8.5\r\nThere is music. The Opening and the Ending are not very memorable, but they are definitely not bad. \r\nPlot: 6.5\r\nI'm going to give the plot 6.5 because of a lot of reasons. A lot of the reviews about this anime talkabout how it is not original and it gets a lot of its plot from other mecha anime. You see, I'm not really a big fan of the genre, so I cannot say I know what the Darling in the Franxx took from other shows and what it didn't, but I'm going to say this: getting inspiration from other sources is not wrong, and when you mix together a lot of things, you get something new. A cake is not milk just because you used milk to make it. It is not eggs, it is not flour. It is cake. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot gets a 6.5 not because it has elements from other animes, but because I, personally, though the story was rushed, which left a lot of plotholes. The rushed story also left little room to actually develop the relationship between the characters, in my opinion, especially the romantic one between [spoiler alert] Kokoro and Mitsuru. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the things left unexplained are: [spoiler alert] Why did some parasites grow older faster than normal? How exactly did they extract energy from magma? Why and how could the Nines operate Franxx regardless of gender? And etc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI'm going to give the characters a 9 because there is no denying that they have personalities and all of them are different from each other, which is something hard to find nowadays for characters that are not the main couple or part of a love triangle. They have different interactions with each one of the other characters, they are memorable, which is nice.\\n\r\nThe characters are teenagers, and the plot bases itself heavily on this fact. If you don't like stories that are more \"coming-of-age-y\" I believe you won't really enjoy the anime as a whole, because its drama relies a lot on the teenager mindset and their discovery of the world.\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoy Zero-Two and Hiro's romance. I think it was a bit rushed from the beginning, but their past is lovely and I got pretty emotional over the flashbacks because I'm a sucker for this \"fate\" sort of story. I do believe Zero-Two is honestly a bit troubling in their relationship and all, but I also believe she carries a heavy burden on her shoulders due to her creation and desperate need to become a human. I believe one shouldn't judge their relationship lightly, you should look into each one of the characters and understand why they act the way they do. I believe there are problems in Zero-Two and Hiro's relationship, but I think they can be easily solved - from a writing point of view, real life is not that easy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, and lately that is a hard thing for me. I enjoyed how they tried to include LGBT characters with Mitsuru's brief crush in Hiro and Ikuno's feelings towards Ichigo. I enjoyed how they stopped with the fanservice after a few episodes, I enjoyed the character development, I enjoyed the times this anime has gotten me emotional over nothing at all. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think everyone is going to like this anime - especially if you have some kind of experience with mecha anime or if you don't really like stories filled with drama - but I enjoyed it a lot and I do believe a lot of people are going to enjoy it too. Well, that is what I had to say",
