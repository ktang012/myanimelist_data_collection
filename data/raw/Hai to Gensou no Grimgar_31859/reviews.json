            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is a rather unique watch. Shows throughout time have had a tendency to force characters from 0 to a 100 in an unrealistic time frame. This often pertains to the widespread demands of instant gratification. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar challenges these demands by emphasising the natural growth of characters: step by step characters are built through every interaction with the plot. Closely observing this and the plot is paramount as to not miss the abundance of implicit detail dedicated to their development and characterisation. Due to this profound nature of the show, reflection is commonplaceand as such, the watch is recommended for anyone who enjoys reading pensively into things.\\n\\n\r\nAn inherent feature of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its large main cast. There\u2019s a greater emphasis on characterising and developing the group as opposed to the individuals; however, it is decently balanced between the group and the individuals such that neither don\u2019t feel completely neglected; the viewers are briefly enlightened on their individual daily lives (roles, recreation, style of living etc.) and personalities. This opportunity to learn about how each character interacts with the group is one of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar best point. Note this orientates Hai to Gensou no Grimgar more towards those who are interested in group development.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off on a weaker foot but eventually progresses superbly, making it worth the watch if the initial set of annoyances can be endured. Such is also true for the pacing, as it evolves into superbness. Though, it is sometimes deemed \u2018slow\u2019, but slow is not bad. It is only when it is incongruously or meaninglessly slow it can be considered such. In this case, the creators have done a superb job at pacing the show such that the story and characters (development and characterisation) are often progressing and the right mood is established. Also, the isn't show is absolutely slow. Explicitly it might seem so but when explored implicitly, there is profoundness behind most interactions and moments (plot-wise and character-wise). Bluntly put, the show might seem slow or idle if one focuses on the explicit details and misses all the implicit detail, which is possibly consequential of not understanding the purpose of the show (detailed later).\\n\\n\r\nNow regardless of the pacing, it is possible for something to be rushed. To rush something is to reach something without having the necessary details or time for the viewers to follow or agree with the outcome. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is subject to such with the limitation of 12 episodes. This is especially pertinent to an important moment that coalesces some of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar major elements. Whether or not its failure can be pardoned (if it is viewed as such) will ultimately dictate one\u2019s enjoyability of the show. It has been identified and explained it in the spoiler section.\\n\\n\r\nHai to Grimgar's paramount feature is its realism. The characters will have to manage basic needs, such as food and shelter. The characters will have to face the reality of the world. The dialogue, development, and interactions are all seemingly realistic. One example of such realism is the fact almost nothing major happens at the beginning. Though why should anything extraordinary happen? They lead basic lives and hold little significance. It is abnormal for much to happen outside of their daily struggles. Another excellent feature Hai to Gensou no Grimgar employ is not having over-the-top combat abilities. They were mostly just minor extensions of the human ability, which harmonises well with its realism theme.\\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is tailored to fans of slice of life. The combination of realism and narrative focus on character lifestyle and relatively slower progression makes it a natural watch for such people. A conspicuously common issue is approaching this show expecting an action, most likely consequential of the initial action scenes and seemingly shounen setup, and receiving a slice of life instead. It is also important to note that while the premise of the show was to toss the average teenager into a fantasy-themed world, it is not a deconstruction of the fantasy genre\u2014the show lacks the focus on and the necessary intricate details characteristic of a deconstruction to be considered such\u2014and is only one of its enjoyment factors. The watch is instead for those who are interested watching the growth of a group, the bonds they develop, the building of the character etc. It is much more of a character oriented show (60\u201370%) than a plot oriented one (roughly 35%). It is a show where learning about the characters is essentially progression. Understanding this and what a slice of life entails is critical when encountered with such works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory=7.7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter=8.1\\n\\n\r\nArt=9\\n\r\nThe art was dazzling at most times. The beautiful scenery heavily complemented the story by aiding the development of the desired mood. Most noticeably, the watercolour backgrounds evoked a tranquil slice-of-life feel, similar to that of Mushishi. The backgrounds were also unobtrusive allowing a higher focus on the projected characters, which is excellent because Hai to Grimgar is a character-dominated show. However, this conflicted with the action scenes as the projection of the background with 2D art instead of 3D sometimes lacked stimulation, detracting from its thrill. \\n\\n\r\nSound=9\\n\r\nMy praise for the audio component is similar to that for the art. Furthermore, Hai to Grimgar uniquely features many montages. They aided the conveyance of the mood and story and were fairly enjoyable to watch. There were however two misuses. They have been mentioned almost immediately below as to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis section henceforth contains spoilers. This section will offer the main criticism and other comments regarding the show.\\n\\n\r\nIts first use (town settling) was inappropriate. It is only warranted once the characters have truly settled in, which was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe second use (graveyard location) clashed with the mood. The pacing of the song was too fast inhibiting focus on the melancholy scene. The usage of the scene also felt extremely abrupt as Manato\u2019s time with them was seemingly short.\\n\\n\r\nShihoru is a frivolous character. She can be removed from the show with slight amendments and little difference. This was most apparent during episodes 1\u20135. She was, however, vital in combat post-episode 5. They need to rework her such that she serves a purpose (plot-wise) outside of combat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nDue to the limitations of 12 episodes, the development of the bond between Manato and the group is rather lacking. 2 episodes were certainly insufficient for evoking the desired sympathy for the characters grieving Manato\u2019s death. The end of episode 4 is the weakest of the series (somewhat rushed outcome) as it draws heavily on Manato\u2019s bond with the group. Common sense dictates that they were distraught but it is rather limited and superficial. This foundation of knowledge would have also fostered understanding of and sympathy for Haruhiro as he confronted his inner-conflict. \\n\\n\r\nMore application of the characters is desired; while Hai to Gensou no Grimgar does build the character, they lacked the time to further display the final product. This was most evident in episodes 11 and 12 where new details were introduced to the character but without application. This plays into the 12-episode limitation.\\n\\n\r\nIt was exasperating when Haruhiro uttered \u2018It would be nice if you could mend clothes with magic as well.\u2019 and proceeded to blatantly explain it. It seemed as if that line was attributed to him solely to inform the viewers. While it was natural, the interpretation should have been somehow left to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nRanta escaping at the end was illogical. He was surrounded and barely knew the mine\u2019s caving system as opposed to the Kobolds, which know the place inside-out. Haruhiro\u2019s skill is essentially the visualization of that.\\n\\n\r\nExperience from fighting enemies will yield knowledge about their weak points and effective engagement. The streams of light that direct Haruhiro can be interpreted as the visualization of that. However, this \u2018skill\u2019 should have not appeared or appeared so quickly against the Death Spots at the end. As he lacked combat experience specific to Elder Kobalds, it should have been a challenge not something his \u2018skill\u2019 could easily relieve him from. It was an opportunity where the creators could have explicitly and satisfyingly displayed the development Haruhiro\u2019s combat abilities and maturity over the course of the show. However, it was wasted by rushing the fight to a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOther comments:\\n\r\nThey actually fully (and superbly) developed the concept of the main cast being unnatural inhabitants of the world. The main cast were evidently briefly aware of this fact, but overtime the characters neglected it such that it eventually faded. This suggests of their adaption to the world and prioritisation of their survival in the realization of the triviality of pursuing such an oddity as opposed to meeting to the demands of their daily lives; the corroboration follows. At the utter end, Kikkawa (the drunkard) shouted \u2018Australia\u2019 in a carefree manner. They could have chosen any word or omitted it all together, but why did they attribute that specific line to him? They deliberately chose \u2018Australia\u2019 to connect it with the real world and had Kikkawa, the most carefree character, utter it in such a manner to hint their accordance with and acceptance of the new world. Also, when heard in the context of the characters, the statement sounds greatly insignificant, as it was randomly blurted out by a drunkard, suggesting the same of their unnatural inhabitation of the world. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar deserves an 8/10, which accordingly to MAL denotes a \u2018very good\u2019 show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The occasional RPG setting within an anime isn't some new, revolutionary trend. Popularized by the underwhelming Sword Art Online, they seem to be popping up a lot more frequently than before and that isn't something I'm particularly fond of. This is mostly due to the lack of originality that comes with these works. To a novice, this idea may seem spectacular on it's own, but at this point, the same thing has been done over and over again and not once did I consider one of them to be good. \r\nWith that being said, I believe that this is quite close to the epitome ofwhat an anime should not be - from the embarrassingly awful execution to the completely obnoxious and meaningless characters. It honestly baffles me that some people see this title as average, yet alone good. From the legendary A-1 Pictures who've produced such magnificent works of art such as - Sword Art Online, The Asterisk War, The Perfect Insider, Fairy Tail, every single bad light novel adaptation and many more mind-boggling series for our entertainment over the years, comes the awe-inspiring Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story takes place in a videogame setting, a town called Grimgar and it follows our protagonists as they each individually grow as people, go through hardships together and face the cruel reality that 10 of them can't kill 1 retarded goblin. This is not an exaggeration, our protagonists are so weak that it takes them 5 minutes to kill a single goblin. However, I thought this was a very interesting approach, as it obviously differs from the usual Jesus-kun format. Sadly, this doesn't last for long. There was no big transition in between their entire party not being able to kill a single goblin to them doing full-on raids versus an entire castle full of goblins. It just sort of happened overnight, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did think it was a neat change, I see this argument used way too often. \"Grimgar is special because its story is very realistic unlike the other RPG anime!\" I think there is a fine line between realistic and different. A different approach doesn't mean the title is going to be good and this is what people tend to be missing. If it really wanted to be that realistic then it should have cut down a bit on stuff such as discussing a girl's breasts in front of her for 3 minutes straight. Here lies the thesis and basically anything the positive reviews ever say about this show. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually people started calling it a deconstruction of the RPG genre for this sole fact. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Grimgar itself is for the most part very uninteresting and leaves a lot to be desired. It is barely touched upon within the first 2 episodes in some hasty introduction to the basics and the rest of the series is action-driven and focuses more so on the characters. All we know is that there are normal townsfolk and these adventurers who have to fight off goblins in order to survive. We don't know anything about the town, we don't know anything about the goblins, etc. Basically we don't really know much of anything and it would of definitely been better if they tried to implement some sort of interesting lore and went more in detail since it just felt lazy on it's own. Not that I find RPG settings to be particularly interesting anyway but yeah, the worldbuilding was bad.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may tell you that this anime is simply not for you though, due to it's slow pacing which a shonen fanboy such as yourself cannot appreciate. As a fan of shows that take their time in properly developing it's world, themes and characters, I can safely say that Grimgar left me disappointed. It really did not have to be as slow as it was. It just felt like a mere blunder on the production staff's side, rather than a necessity for good development. So even if you do prefer slower paced stuff, I can't really guarantee you'll enjoy Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nSo instead of filling up the weaknesses of the show, they go ahead and introduce irrelevant plotpoints such as: none of the characters having their memories from the real world. I thought this was incredibly useless and stupid, what would knowing anything change? Was this implemented in here just so they could have an easy way out of dealing with character backstories? It is shown early on that none of their items from the real world are transported here to begin with, so why bother? Actually why even bother making the setting a game? Why not just some fantasy world? It's because A-1 knows the demographic it's appealing to far too well.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, gotta give credit where credit is due. The artstyle used in Grimgar is very original and nice, with a watercolor/painterly feel to it. This was definitely a breath of fresh air due to how bland I thought most of the art in these recent seasons looked like so a change of pace was much appreciated. The backgrounds look especially nice, as if you're looking at a painting of some sort. The animation is alright and it clearly excels when the girls' tits bounce. You can just see how much time and effort was put into those jiggles. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art and animation, the sound isn't anything spectacular. Sure, you've got some good songs thrown in there, but for every good song you have the same amount of poor utilization and engrish vocals. This is quite a problem as Grimgar tries rather hard to make you emotionally invested, and when such scenes came along, they mostly felt underwhelming due to the mediocre musical direction. For a series that takes itself seriously, I thought the voice acting was rather lackluster. None of the performances stand out and most are just borderline annoying. The only decent performances were Yume, Mary and Haruhiro (although this is probably my bias due to his role as Shichika in Katanagatari).\\n\\n\r\nAll aboard the cringe train. This is no doubt the worst part about Grimgar, showing further how A-1 has no clue how to make decent or even half-decent characters. This luckily changes as the series progresses but I still felt like touching upon it - every character interaction between members of the opposite sex has sexual themes or implications in it which makes me wonder if the writer is out of his early teens yet. Adding on to this, it is very impressive when in the first scene of the series it is able to portray the females as useless and clumsy damsels in distress, unable to do anything on their own apart from scream and cry until their beta-male white knight companions come to the rescue. This makes for some of the cringiest scenes I have ever seen, like talking about Shihoru's breasts for a good 3-5 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nYou could say that this is just taking the easy route since no matter how bad the actual series in question may be, it's bound to garner some sort of audience. However, I still feel as though it is a very big problem and is ultimately what a lot of modern anime suffer from. While I guess that it just knows what demographic it's appealing to and it's not so bad on it's own, it also means that we have to depend on the male cast to be good or get the proper development. Feel free to take a guess on how it's handled in Grimgar. Yes, not very good...\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people would argue this point because of how well developed they all become upon facing loss! No! The characters can grieve all they want but it won't make them more likable or realistic. Coping with sadness is a great characterization tool if utilized properly and on good characters, but despite these characters being borderline terrible, they barely develop! Most of the characters don't even have a personality that defines them to begin with, apart from Ranta. And, well.. Ranta is just Ranta. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, one of the characters was only memorable for his death, nothing else. They didn't even bother to make us feel anything for the character, he was just a bland teenager who got killed off in order to \"develop\" everyone else. You aren't supposed to remember a character for their death, you're supposed to remember them by their life and their accomplishments BEFORE their death. The drama also felt awfully forced and doesn't work 90% of the time. \" Hey guys, let's go to that place where most of Mary's party got brutally murdered which left her scarred for life :D :D :D Oh Mary why u mad bro?? \"\\n\\n\r\nI giggled a couple of times when the goblins were screeching so I guess some enjoyment was to be had. Sadly it was all just nullified by Ranta and the female cast's cleavage. The pacing also played a key factor in this but it did get noticeably better as the series went along. Despite this, it is not an exaggeration to say that I was forcing myself through most of the show as in the end, Grimgar struck me as incredibly bland and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that had a lot of initial potential and sounded pretty good on paper but A-1 went the wrong way of doing it. Especially if the characters were handled properly, Grimgar could of been the highpoint of the RPG genre, covering stuff like how detrimental loss can be in some cases. Sadly, the script looks like something from an otaku's basement, the pacing and execution are incredibly poor and the characters are very bland, uninteresting and have no defining personality.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n--\r\n(If you couldn\u2019t give a tuna glass about this review and just want to know if you should watch this, skip all the way to the \u201cWhat to expect and enjoyment\u201d Either way, read this review if you want an insight of the flaws it had. This is my first review so don\u2019t judge and give me a break lol. My usage of words might come off as wonky so sorry for that)\r\n Grimgar is an anime that doesn\u2019t necessarily bring anything distinctive to the tables. I personally believe that Grimgar was just an anime of progression, where we wouldhave an insight on a group of six and the enhancements to their amnesia and how they develop from it. Even then, an apparent anime like this had its deficiency and I\u2019m astonished to know it does.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\\n\r\nDespite the very slow adaptation, there was no exhilarating tension or motivation to the anime till the very few episodes. Grimgar was a story that was going nowhere till they picked up an objective that wasn\u2019t even enthralled upon at the few last episodes. Very repetitive episodes as only a very few things would happen as it\u2019s a part of the progression within the anime, which it would conventionally be the party just going out to kill some goblins then coming back. \\n\\n\r\nAs the other reviewers stated, it\u2019s very hard to not reference a spoiler so yeah, spoilers up ahead in the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt very disengaging because of the lack of condolence felt for them. The fact that they killed off Manato in just four episodes immediately created a plot hole because of the lack of profundity put into Manato. I didn\u2019t get to know him as a character; we didn\u2019t get in depth of him at all hence why I couldn\u2019t empathise for him. The fact that the characters would consistently drag Manato throughout the plot and weep for him made me feel excluded. It\u2019s as if the plot was trying to renounce me to comprehend them or empathise for them in the slightest.  They were trying to make Manato as pertinent to the story as possible because it\u2019s the only thing they were dependable towards. Also the foreshadowing of Manato\u2019s death was too heavy; which made his death very obvious, and yes, in a bad sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnd of spoilers\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar fails to give any cognizance or impression of the world the group of six are living within by constantly focusing on them and nothing outside of their party. We are not given an perception of how other parties evaluate and evolve in the world they are living within a.k.a the world we are being shown. When the group of six are struggling to kill goblins, how are another party handling this? How did they handle this when they were or are in their position? Sure, this anime is not deliberately trying to focus on other people but just by describing how other parties are doing within the narrative occasionally would have been justifiable. Also there\u2019s no clarification as to why Haruhiro and the rest were chosen to be summoned within the world we are shown. Why is it that they are chosen but no one else?\\n\\n\r\n There were a very few illogical clarifications for the people\u2019s amnesia. How is it that they are well efficient of remembering their names but nothing else? There\u2019s something about that that is very impactful on the characters. Does anything remind them of their name or something? And how is it that they remember the particular words they use but nothing else? Does anything remind them of the words they use? Grimgar fails to justify this. But even then, Grimgar badly brings the significance of that if we\u2019re not going to know about the life the characters had before they came into this world. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the characters came from Earth but Grimgar doesn\u2019t really make that transparent. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service within this show is what I\u2019m truly dissatisfied about. At first, this anime gives you the intuition that it\u2019s one of those soothe animes that seems to have some kind of abhorrence towards ecchi and all that sort, till you watch it, only to find that it adds a lot of unnecessary fan service itself. Oh but the art style of this anime definitely gives you a sense of suspicion. When it comes to wanting to be goofy and thrilling, Grimgar is very dependent with its fan service and jokes about Yume\u2019s flat- chest for that, which it\u2019s very subjective whenever you like it or not (Which I didn\u2019t really) It\u2019s just the fact that Grimgar would execute these at the wrong time, which is where the issue lies. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime felt like complete torture. Grimgar didn\u2019t manage the time of the twelve episodes properly and just tried to slowly progress the anime, most of the time being way too sluggish. Grimgar was way too enthralled on developing the characters that they completely overlooked everything else, which is giving the plot a resolution and getting into depths of the characters perhaps? \\n\\n\r\nThe amnesia concept completely stripped the opportunity to get in depth of the characters to begin with. However, even though the anime had the chance to tell us about the back-story of each character before they came within the world of Grimgar, something is telling me that that will barely bring any significance to the tables. Their amnesia gets in the way of getting in depth of the characters because there\u2019s nothing to say about the characters within the party of six except Mary. The amnesia concept brought a huge plot hole among the characters at the very start. The characters only came off very one dimensional expect Mary, who was the only three dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\nNo character within the show was likable. This is more of a personal preference, keep that in mind. Every character was just pure mediocre. Even their character design was so generic. Each character just had that stereotypical role of their own. With Mary being that cold one but really when you get to know her, her attitude is very justifiable, Yume being the flat chest yet humble, Shihoru being the shy one who always cries, always has the oppais, Manato being the \u201cJustin bieber\u201d a.k.a the perfect, Moguzo being the quiet, peaceful, Ranta being the obnoxious and the Haruhiro being \u201cthe MC\u201d. Heck, even the outside characters had their own stereotypical roles etc, Barbara = Fan service, Renji = the brave, admired. \\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\\n\r\nDespite Mary, Haruhiro was a well executed character regardless of his lack of back-story (Something good about Grimgar?) Haru was nicely done depiction of the current reputation of the group. Haru alternatively came crucial; I\u2019m quite astonished to see how the anime was capable of making Haru essential to the plot and the group. He is what created the perception put into the party. Haruhiro claimed his own hindrance and concerns as much as he represented that of the whole group\u2019s, and he overcame his own as much as the group did as a whole. Some of you may be thinking \u201cWhat about Ranta?\u201d Sure, I will applause Ranta for his mentality and perspective on the group and how he\u2019s just doing his part, however because of how unlikable he is and how this mindset completely changes within episode twelve, Ranta is just as mediocre as a character could get within his type. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar had rather good characterization (Yes, finally, something positive about Grimgar again) Why is it that they have good characterization? Well, because the plot was much focused on this that they received good results. However, don\u2019t get the wrong idea, it\u2019s not really anything bewildering, it\u2019s just that Grimgar was capable of handling this without any issue.  Grimgar was very victorious with what it wanted to do here and it\u2019s very comprehensible with what they were trying to depict, how the struggling, amateurish and primitive managed to develop into a tactful and rational. Very simple and nicely exposed.\\n\\n\r\nThe water colouring a.k.a art of this anime was very heart-warming and made me feel comfortable and pleasant. I could go on describing it. As an artist, it was very admirable and motivates me into doing some water colouring with its warm colours. I adored how the background was done as well. Little to no effort put into doing it but in a respectful way.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the opening and ending song has a very tedious tune to it, it\u2019s very memorable. It\u2019s something I hum from time to time and I think that\u2019s a good thing. Something about the opening and ending was very clingy and addictive to listen to. It\u2019s even more memorable than the Erased opening and I love that opening more than the Grimgar opening. The first half or the series and the ending song has very lazily done visuals and the second half of the series opening has some effort put into it but I still find something indolent about it. I\u2019m not really concerned about the OSTs; it\u2019s okay. \\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect in Grimgar of fantasy and ash and Personal enjoyment - \\n\\n\r\nBut the real question is, is this anime enjoyable? Honestly, this may come off as anticipating but it depends. Yes, this is one of those \u201cIt depends\u201d types of animes. If you enjoy looking at very slow progressive anime, this is the anime for you. However if you want a nicely done anime but it gets to the point and it has an objective, stay away from this anime.  Be bound to expect a very slow anime with very torturing pacing, one dimensional characters expect one, unsympathetic death (not telling who), nicely done MC, nothing happening between the episodes and much more!\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime special is how it\u2019s very considerate with its development so kudos to that! \u201cBut Pramma, did you enjoy this anime?\u201d Honestly, no. It was so boring and it wasn\u2019t really convincing or motivating to make me binge it till the very end. I wasn\u2019t capable of watching episode 11 or 12 because it was that boring but I pushed myself to finish it lol.\\n\\n\r\n Grimgar had bright potential but just didn\u2019t use it to its full extent. A lot like to say how pragmatic this anime is but if you look into it, it\u2019s not really that realistic. If you look through the flaws this anime had, the realism of it just suddenly vanishes. For a very straightforward concept like Grimgar, I\u2019m rather disappointed that it has this much mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives \u2013 \\n\\n\r\n-\tNo exhilarating  tension  or built up -\\n\r\n-\tNo story or point was made till the very end -\\n\r\n-\tDisconnecting characters; lack of sympathy - \\n\r\n-\tRepetitive episodes ;nothing happens in between those episodes - \\n\r\n-\tLack of information about the world of grimgar or their way of life. - \\n\r\n-\tIllogical clarifications for their amnesia -\\n\r\n-\tShows nothing besides group of 6 -\\n\r\n-\tAwfully slow progression and pacing - \\n\r\n-\tUnnecessary fan service -\\n\r\n-\tTrying to make dead character relevant to the story -\\n\r\n-\tToo dependent towards this dead character; killed off too fast -\\n\r\n-\tCharacters amnesia strips the purpose of characters and getting into depth of who the characters are -\\n\r\n-\tUnlikable characters - \\n\r\n-\tDon\u2019t get an insight on every single character \u2013 \\n\r\n-\tNo reasoning for Haruhiro and the rest that were summoned presences.

            "content": "The show of it's season that everybody likes despite it's pretty bad. We have a group of teens who gets into a world based on RPG ruleset and shortly after this, they forget their previous life... and that's all. We won't get to know who they are, why did they get there, what is that place anyways, why does it operates like a video game, what should they do there. They just live their everyday life, learning some new skills, killing the low level creatures for the loot which they use to cover their living expenses and equipment.\r\nThere are some conflict, they lose a teammate,hire a new one who lost her team and slowly move on after their loss, but this doesn't start a real character improvement. It's trying, but doesn't goes anywhere. During their fights, because of this is a team, we might expect it'll be shown from a strategic point of view. They build up the tactics of their ambushes, comment how the teammates use their class' special skills to effectively operate as a team, but no. They just show their newly learnt skills without any deeper concept. We could think that after these they focus on giving the world some depth, who are these goblins and kobolds, are there any relation between them, what kind of society do they live in, why must they fight with them, why are they hostile by nature, by the way what kind of society do humanity live in this world. But no, we wont get to know anything about these either. The main issue with this show is NOT the slow pacing. The slow pacing can not be an excuse for the lack of world building and plot improvement. At the end there were some improvement in the representation of characters and the fight choreography, then, SLIGHT SPOILER, it ended with a terrible plot armor execution, END SPOILER.\\n\\n\r\nThe art design is correct. The character design follows the typical A1 Pictures design. One of the main characters looks exactly like a brown haired Kirito. Not quite unique. The environment and backgrounds are a bit better. With this sketchy looking, hand drawn like appearance it's easily distinguishable from the other series of the studio. It's a matter of taste if you like it or not, I found it a bit self-serving, but a creative way to work with low budget, the main issue isn't this. The animation seems really cheap. The fight scenes are dull, there isn't any tension in them at all. It's nowhere near UBW or even SAO. Oh, and SAO, do you all remember the fight against the first boss with Asuna and Kirito? It was a good fight, they were working together, they looked like a team. I'm not an SAO fan, but that scene was alright in concept and visuality. Don't expect anything even remotely like that from Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, when I've seen the first promotional image, I knew I have to have low expectations. And thus fortunately or more like sadly I couldn't get disappointed. Not even pleasantly though. It sticks out downwards from average quality. Maybe the light novel was decent, I didn't read it, but there never were a moment when I felt the anime could be any better than a mediocre fantasy shounen. You won't lose anything if you skip it.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, I had some pretty mixed reactions and feelings with this series. It had its' moments in various episodes where character growth, or the story & plot would standout.. then a few moments later an episode it would do a 360. I don't want to call the show a roller-coaster though because I do not think that is the right term to describe.\r\nMoving on from that though, considering where the Light novel left off and where the anime stopped, I think that A-1 Picture's team did a pretty good job with pacing. They were successfully able to covermaybe 94-97% of the original story which is great. Now the story, It had it's moments. Feels, excitement, comedy etc, all of it was in between \"Great\" and \"Meh\" I honestly felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall feeling that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar gave off to me, felt like it had everything together, however when things unfolded or events would take place it just seemed like things needed a little extra boost. I felt like most of the times the producers made things feel slower rather than fast paced because they were trying to add a little more emotional elements and moments especially when Minato died.\\n\\n\r\nI was really glad that most the characters personalities, were drastically changed. Well, to be honest, I'm glad that they changed Yume's personality because I wanted to strangle her character in the novel. Her speech was so damn annoying \"Yume thinks\" \"Yume likes\" UGGGHh!! I am just so happy that they changed the way she speaks. Now, Haruhiro, I'm glad his profile was changed too because I hated his whiny, lazy, useless ass. Now he's still a bit useless at times in the anime, however to be fair, he is changing, he's finally going through that phase most characters go through.... \"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\"... OR \"CHARACTER GROWTH\" :) Which ever you prefer to call it. Compared to their original designs, I have to give A-1 major kudo's. I love it when I look at the original illustration designs for either Manga's or Light Novels, then look at the anime adaptions because they change so much to (In most cases) Look a lot better. This is one of the many cases where the anime adaption of the characters look far more superior than the original designs and illustrations. Overall in the characters department I actually wasn't that impressed. I felt like even though most of the characters have potential to be greater than what they are, most of Haruhiro's team was \"Non-assertive\" or they just had a hard time serious taking action. Except Ranta.. however he was just a reckless S.O.B.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow with Grimgar, I did think it was worth watching however, I also think it was a title that didn't need to be over-hyped. I felt like I expected too much out of it. In fact, I would say that, that was my biggest issue with the series. I kind of felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall animation, soundtrack, story/plot and character was lacking in various ways.\\n\r\nAnimation felt very lackluster. Background settings and quality didn't stand out at all or too much. I feel like if the animators made things pop out and look more visually appealing then I would not have had an issue. However, I personally think with shows like these, background settings add more of a \"realistic\" type feeling. The terrible painted, water-coloring-ish background settings -practically faded, just didn't work out for me. The ending song, with the water-color-ish animation, that looked great. Very beautiful, plus the song sort of complement the art used.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was overrated , not over-hyped, I take that back. If you're going to watch it, do not expect nothing but great things because the series, like many before and after it, is full of disappointments or faults... I have to give this title an 8/10 because I really liked the story and plot. I am a sucker for adventure and fantasy anime so I love seeing titles like these get noticed and put in the spotlight.. but with Grimgar.. maybe not so much. I hope to see a season 2 later in the future.",

            "content": "Mature version of any \"rpg like shows\" the done right.\r\nI'll keep this short but informaive as I can.\r\nMany misunderstand what the show is really about and what it's trying to be. They complain \"just when will they get over with this and go start adventuring?!\" and claim \"nothing is happening bs!\" what they didn't know is it's not aimed to be that. Grimgar is all about the group of people who have been thrown in a world they don't know, adapting their new environment bit by a bit. So as you can see, action is not the highlight of the show. It's how they adaptthe world and how they do it is what makes the conflict. And that's where the interestingness comes from.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of \"adapting the world\" seems so Log Horizon yet it's far from being exactly the same with Grimgar. the reason why is because Grimgar has a mature theme mixed with. it's realistic, more of portraying the struggle of being in that situation. the struggle of having no money to buy what you need, adjusting to the people you have no relation with and so on. \\n\\n\r\nThough I kind of Implying the series is somewhat of a \"survival of the fittest\", an opposite side existed. It has a slice of life vibe that gives you this country side feeling. The way it's done is just amazing! it doesn't feel like out of the place and I even find it pretty relaxing to watch and with the the calming music that plays along with the heartwarming backgrounds even make it more refreshing. How the characters respond to this SoL part is just amazing as well. You can totally see what they do when they are not in a hunt or that how they do their personal lives. through this, it helps them flesh out their character and make it complex the way that even if you try to remove the conflict of the story the existence of characters won't feel empty they would still have something in them.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, many find them boring. I kind of agree that they don't have any interesting side but what makes up for it is their interaction and development(the strongest points of the series actually) and if I have to defend it more, my reason would be because they are not supposed to have an odd or a special personality. They're designed to be realistic. To make you relate to them. Which explains why their team spends so many time to get stronger. Because no normal teenagers would desparetly want to fight for death. which is what I realy like from the series. you can just clearly see their growth. Of how at first they can't kill a single goblin and becomes just like a murderer, the first time they face the act of killing they get nervous and tremble but the afterwards they loses their sense of guilt. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the character development greatness, it's just really top notch. It's realistic, way more believable than any shows does. It doesn't happen right away making a huge jump, it's carefully taking its time progressing their development to make sure it will look real and it doesn't completely change their character which some shows or books seems to always get wrong. Their development to their friend's death, is just so good! each of them shows different signs of reaction and develops differently according to how close they were to their friend. Which proves the uniqness of their character. It flows perfectly not missing any phases. From denial to mourning to acceptance and to learning and you can really see the changes of their actions, reactions, and interactions little by little as they repeat the same thing over and over(killing goblins). They start adjusting-- trying to adjust themselves more to each other.(Especially after Mary, the best girl, was introduced) their teamwork becomes better, they get stronger and their relationships gets tougher. It would just really surprise you that the boring characters you thought were actually complex. Just try to compare the whole character development of most of the show they always works the opposite always getting things wrong lmao.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, instead of cool fantasy action shit, what you're going to get in Grimgar is what I wrote above. It's aimed for those people who wants to see something different. Just a reminder though, the series is so slow which most has a problem with. But it's because it's inteded to be that. Slow pacing doesnt really mean bad it depends if the show needs it or not. Like here in Grimgar it's slow paced because the anime focuses at depicting the growth of a character which have to have long exploration. So if you're the guy who would choose to fall asleep when traveling by a plane instead of enjoying a beautiful view then this might not be for you but if you're that guy who would like to window watch to see that beautiful view you should probably try this.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Free Review}\r\nStory (8):\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimar tells the story of a group of people who all of the sudden see themselves in a completely strange and fantastic world, with no memories of where they come from, or who they where. The only thing they can do is try to survive by forming parties and hunt down monsters to gain enough money to get through the day. The anime shows the struggles of the group in this world. There is nothing really new to this kind of story, but what stands out is the way the story is told. Compared to the light novelor the manga the director chose to produce a more slow paced anime. This resulted in a lot of slice of life/drama aspects that got to be explored more deeply. And also helped to get to know the characters better, seeing some things that usually are not shown at all in this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nThe production was rushed and some times it gets pretty obvious. But overall the art is beautiful, the landscape looks a lot like paintings making it different and really stunning. The animation at the beginning was great, but as the anime progressed it started to show some flaws, but again, overall it is decent, and hopefully getting fixed in the blue-ray.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nIts enjoyable, I liked the soundtrack, it gets the job done. It is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\r\nIf the slow paced storytelling the director chose to follow helped something it was the character development. It is really great. You get to know the characters really well for a 12 episode anime. Character development is probably one of the strongest in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nI rushed through this anime in about 2 or 3 days. It does not have cliff hangers but for me it made me want to watch the next episode just because it is good. Really enjoyed it. Hopefully looking forward to a second season hehehe\\n\\n",

Even though I'm a fan of well build up characters, and slow pacing shows helps them do this very well, just like FMA Brotherhood.\r\nThe slowpacing in this anime didn't help either in the story nor the character development, even the character interactions were slow? like the conversations between them feel like they took ages, to get through.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't review the Art or the Sound in this anime, since for me they were beyond perfect, and it was something that make me go through this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were kind of realistic, not MC who is OP in every situation, but we got cliched characters like the shy girl who can't pronounce a word, the one who is very energetic and we all love, but we know she is not going to win, and the mysterious girl who starts to opens, so nothing too entertaining and for the male cast we have the bulky guy who is sweet on the inside, and the MC rival who is sometimes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment for this series was good, it had a lot of promise and I might start reading the novel just to see if it was just a bad adaptation as a lot of people say, since they all are saying that we got development in the light novel, even though its not perfect I would like a second season tho, it was good and promising and kind of a different isekai anime, not just your boring isekai anime of every season, but unfortunately the slow pacing killed it, I hope they can improve this feature if they do make season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSo what this, if you are looking for a good animation, amazing ost, ending, op and a kind of premising story, and to see how slow pacing can kill a promising anime",

I always give every element a 10 and then take a point off along with any setback I find in each of these aspects.\r\nStory: 9. The story would have been a masterpiece if the first three episodes have been squeezed into one. Nothing much happened. It should have dedicated the second and third episodes to explaining a bit more about the characters' past. However, from episode 4 onward the plot keeps up with the audience'sexpectation - those who still choose to give a chance to this anime up to the 4th episode will definitely finish it to the end. Although one might argue that the plot is very much cliched, it does a great job in bringing all those fun I had in the earlier years when I used to play MMORPG Game, Ragnarok, with my friends. The thrill of the battle from episode 4 onward will keep audience wanting to watch more. However, the anime does so without focusing much on the technicalities of gaming, unlike SAO, which preserves the beauty of the fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10. Beautiful drawings on the background. The strokes and colours really brought up the laid-back fantasy setting to life. Attacks, being physical or magical, were excellently depicted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. Nice soundtracks. Peaceful music fits right into the laid-back setting of the fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9. I took one point off from one of the characters who has been unnecessarily annoying. I did appreciate his presence as it stirs the conflict in the story but I would have appreciated it more if this character is that smart annoying guy. Otherwise, you have the Miss. Shy, Miss. Happy-go-lucky, Miss. Tsundere, Mr. Considerate, Mr. Perfect, Mr. Clueless Protagonist, and Mr. Annoying all in one bowl - just the right mix to keep the interactions among them interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Reminds me of the teamwork and fun playing MMORPG with my friends. which is great. Unlike SAO, the anime brings the memories back without spoiling the beauty of the fantasy world by bringing up all the technicalities of gaming. Excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10. I would strongly recommend this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Getting transported to a game world with fantasy elements. You\u2019ve heard of these type of stories before in recent years. From Log Horizon to the infamous No Game No Life, it\u2019s a recycled idea that has becoming a growing trend. What\u2019s different about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Nothing really at first until you look a bit into the show. Well it\u2019s not vastly different anyways. In essence, this series crafts a refreshing fantasy show with some intruding ideas but also ones that are unbecoming.\r\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name, the series takes place in fantasy world of Grimgar. We don\u2019t getmuch inside scope on how the characters exactly arrived there but just the fact that they are now stuck in this world. Survival is what should be on the first thing on their minds as the party of strangers have to adapt with their newfound life. Consisting of a group of six members (Manato, Haruhiro, Ranta, Yume, Mogzo, and Shihoru), they are also told to be part of the Reserve Army forces and defend the world from monsters. I guess in a simpler way to say this, it\u2019s their way of making a living and try to make the best of it in this new world. \\n\\n\r\nI have to confess a few things though. First of all, the series\u2019 focus on its world fiction is fantastic. By all means, it is rich in resources from the dense forests to the lush landscapes with a decent amount of wildlife. Plus, civilization is exactly what people may picture from a fantasy game. There\u2019s old fashioned towns, rural caves, mountainous regions, and starry skies crafted with high fantasy elements in this imaginary world. Whatever the author was thinking at the time definitely got the general ideas right for the show. Secondly, the story is what I\u2019d describe more as fusion of fantasy, action, adventure, but also feeling that borderlines slice of life. To sum it up clearly, the slice of life part depicts the every day adventures of the party. Of course, this includes forging new weapons, fighting new enemies, and unlocking new skills to survive. It also adapts character interactions which seems to be a pivotal part of the show. It\u2019s easy to see that the party members become close as time passes on. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, they\u2019re complete strangers with little memory about themselves besides their first name. After living in the new world for a few days, we can see the chemistry building between certain characters. Haruhiro\u2019s relationship with Yume and Manato is prominent as they treat each other like close friends. Manato, the leader of the party is also a role model with his charismatic personality and is able to see the positives in people. Even Ranta seems to follow his lead despite being the hotheaded guy of the group, often known for causing troubles especially with Haruhiro and Yume. Speaking of which, Yume is the brave girl. She has confidence and builds a close friendship with Shihoru, a shy mage who struggles to open to others. Then there\u2019s Mogzo, the silent giant who often supports the party in whatever means he can. See the diverse range of character personas here? It\u2019s hard to imagine how they can all get along at first but as time passes, the show is able to capitalize on these characters both individually and collectively as a group. Later on, they even gains new member whom they have a hard time to accept at first but still welcomes her as a valuable member of the team especially upon learning their background story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show is pretty repetitive with a sluggish pacing. It shouldn\u2019t take long for anyone to recognize this especially with the nature of the story. The formulaic structure is basically the group learning new skills, occasionally gaining new equipment, while trying to improve their inner relationships. Sadly, monsters are limited to goblins and kobalds in the show and doesn\u2019t get far in that territory. If you realized this and it\u2019s not the type of feeling up your alley, then turn back now because this show will feel like a snoozefest to you. Otherwise for sheer entertainment value, it\u2019s actually an emotional drive after the first half of the show. The concept of death becomes reality for a certain member of the party while the show exploits interpersonal conflicts. While the series does this well, I feel like it\u2019s spending far too much time investing on certain plot mechanics at the expense of other potentials. Given the way this series is adapted (1 cour) and limited volumes, it\u2019s not really impressive. Furthermore, the show\u2018s relationship dynamics can quickly become a bore once you see how much the show pushes that every episode. Don\u2019t expect any legitimate romance to develop either despite some obvious hints. The show seems to tease that almost every episode especially between Haruhiro and Yume but nothing really comes into fruition. And if you\u2019re not a fan of melancholic songs, then this show could be a nightmare. As a fantasy adventure, Grimgar often feels like a mixed bag; sometimes quite impressive while other times makes you wonder if it\u2019s worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, the show does a fair job at demonstrating how a fantasy series should be about with its mechanics. There\u2019s other adventurer guilds that looks credible, weapons that actually looks like it\u2019s from a fictional world, and also various classes. (thief, mage, priest, etc) While the series isn\u2019t like Sword Art Online with heavy game mechanics, it still knows how to execute some of them. However, the key keyword here is \u2018some\u2019. The mage class is one of the more underwhelming roles in the show with its limited spell set from what\u2019s shown. From an objective point, I think the priest also plays an underwhelming role despite being invaluable for any party. Luckily, the action aspects saves that as it delivers some classic entertainment. It\u2019s pretty fluid once you get used to it with a surprising amount of violence. On the other hand, the comedy is woodenly made. I forget the amount of time when the show makes lewd jokes (mostly because of Ranta). From extended dialogues about boobs to awkward misunderstandings, the show still falls into the formulaic light novel adaptations we see so often.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main highlights of the series is the fantastic artwork. It\u2019s not just elegant but feels excitingly mythical that\u2019s painted by colorful water paint. From mountainous landscapes to old fashioned towns, the show capitalizes every detail to precision. Even character designs looks vividly convincing as the guys and girls wear gear appropriate for their class. If you\u2019re also familiar with shows like Aiura, then it\u2019s recognizable at who worked on these designs. The show\u2019s action is coordinated well with a nice amount of focus on teamwork and body movements. But like almost every light novel adaptations, it\u2019s still vulnerable to some subtle fan service like Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is one of the stronger dynamics of the series as well. While some say that the show\u2019s tendency to constantly use insert songs can be an annoyance, it\u2019s actually quite important to highlight the emotional values of the story. Character expressions matches in unison with the insert songs to show what they feel. This can be a hit or miss to viewers depending on how you take it by storytelling standards. Furthermore, character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t too impressive in general. The most recognizable would be Yume though with her kansai-like dialect. \\n\\n\r\nRyosuke Nakamura\u2019s return to direct the show brings us this fantasy adventure, one that I can say is a good example of portraying an imaginative world. However, the overall storytelling isn\u2019t too impressive while characterization is lacking t times. Still, I think it\u2019s important to address that Grimgar isn\u2019t about conquering the world. It\u2019s quite simple really \u2013 just a party of members trying to make the best of their newfound life while trying to survive. If that isn\u2019t your cup of tea, then it\u2019ll be hardly enjoyable. In introspect, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a well-made show at what it is but not great.\\n",

Each one had to  met my profound expectations and they are very strict.\r\nWhen I chose to watch first episode, I didn't expect much , mostly because this kind of anime never has real plot and everything expected action and violence is put in second plan. First thing I noticed is how beautiful art is, I haven't had seen such good looking anime for a long time, later came I noticed good animation, voice acting, heck even though main charactersare kids, they lookes unbelievable human as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you would expect from this premise is OP group or group that \"knows it all\" but really that's not what it's about. It's about a struggle for survival, finding place in the unknown world, friendship and loss. Man, there were times when I barely hold my tears and people call me person with stone hearth because I don't express positive or negative emotions deliberately , that's how emotional it can get. Also presentation of anime is done well, there were scenes without voice but carefully crafted scenes with nice ambient music, that left much deeper impression on you, deeper than voice acting ever would.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are lively and likable even stereotypes , each with unique personality and charm. Main plot is not revealed yet but few first episodes give you a hint. It's virtual world but unlike in other similar anime, propagandists don't know how did they end up there or from where, nor do they remember anything before \"awaking\" . \\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me this a true gem and everyone should give it a go.",

            "content": "Sometimes an anime will start very well and continue to be interesting for a while, but it ultimately falls apart when it\u2019s time to wrap things up. In some less-common cases, an anime will start very well but fall on its face within minutes. I don\u2019t know which of these categories are worse, but Grimgar is the latter. Grimgar gets you interested immediately, but things go downhill just within the first episode.\r\nGrimgar starts with a fight scene; fight scenes at the very beginning of anything can often be bad since you don\u2019t know anything and don\u2019t care, but Grimgar\u2019s is actually very good because itsets the tone of the series very well. For one, it\u2019s the first time we get to see the incredible watercolor world of Grimgar, but that\u2019s not the point. We\u2019re introduced to the party as they clumsily fight a pair of goblins, often used in role-playing games as one of the weakest enemies to encounter. Through these clues, it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on: Grimgar is some RPG-like world, and the players we\u2019re watching are fucking TERRIBLE. Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash may as well be the antithesis of RPG anime, which often depict their main characters as incredibly overpowered badasses.\\n\\n\r\n(There are also some other things you can point out, like the hinted personalities of each character and the overall decent animation and insert song, but I wanted to point out its drama most of all.)\\n\\n\r\nThe episode continues decently with some quieter scenes that introduce the characters better, and the interesting thing they throw at you is that Grimgar isn\u2019t actually a game to the players, it\u2019s real life. Through the flashback that happens right after, we see how this started: the characters simply appeared here with no recollection of their previous lives, but it\u2019s evident they came from the normal world. Not a bad premise overall, though there\u2019s one weakness to this that I\u2019ll get into later. Anyway, there\u2019s a pretty lengthy scene where the characters and a bunch of other players talk to some flamboyant guy. It\u2019s a decent scene since it provides some info, but I\u2019d like it more if this guy was around for longer than that one scene and if that random player didn\u2019t grab his knife when threatened. WHO THE FUCK GRABS A KNIFE BY THE BLADE WITH THEIR BARE HANDS WHEN THREATENED???? WHAT THE FUCK???? THAT\u2019S LITERALLY THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IN THIS SITUATION???????????????\\n\\n\r\n*ahem*\\n\\n\r\nWhile that scene and the one after are just passable, the rest of the episode hilariously tumbles down its own mountain of potential after only taking a few steps. Haruhiro, the main character, joins a guild like his teammates, deciding to become a thief. He meets Barbara, whose character design is about as subtle as a bomb in a nursery. Holy shit. I mean, being fanservicey is one thing, but this chick looks like someone made a simple thief-looking character, and then a nine-year-old pasted a pair of huge anime tits onto her in Paint. It\u2019s absolutely hilarious! But beyond dumb fanservice, the show practically smacks the viewer in the face by COMPLETELY SKIPPING THE TRAINING. WHAT THE FUCK? This scene builds up what could be a pretty intense training montage, and Haruhiro even laments a little bit, but we never fucking see it. That\u2019s bullshit. Even worse is that no progress seems to have been made afterwards because all six people as a group struggle to kill a single goblin. Noobs.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, we\u2019re \u201ctreated\u201d to an utterly horrible scene where a running competitor for Largest Shitlord of 2016 complains about one of the girls in the party for having small tits, and praises the other girl for having oppai. tHIS SCENE GOES ON FOR FIVE MINUTES WHY DOES IT EXIST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ANIME. WHOOPS MY BAD FOR THINKING A-1 PICTURES COULD HAVE TWO GOOD ANIME IN ONE SEASON. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really sad, because while watching that scene, I turned into Shia Labeouf screaming \u201cDO IT!!!!!!\u201d when that archer chick who kinda looks like Whitney from Pokemon SoulSilver takes aim at Ranta. DO IT. JUST DO IT. NO ONE WILL MISS HIM. That would\u2019ve made for such an interesting scenario and add more tension. Like, everyone wants to get through this, right? But no one trusts each other because someone\u2019s crazy enough to kill another just for saying some bad things. ...but instead she decides to just rub her entire body on the oppai character for no reasON IS ANYONE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AT ALL??? GOD I\u2019M PISSED.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I explained the entire episode because it highlights everything that Grimgar does well. The protagonists are extremely weak, making each battle a struggle. The setting and the overall premise has some flaws, but they\u2019re pretty good overall. But then you\u2019ll be treated (read: tortured) by some scenes that just last way too long, contribute way too little to justify their length, and can often be just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also something that really needs to be said about Grimgar and its pacing. There are many, many times throughout the series where it is not moving at a slow pace, it\u2019s moving at NO pace. All of these slower scenes that, at best, give a few minor details about the characters, can be done in half the time at most. Honestly, they could be removed altogether to make room for more important scenes. I mean, do we really need to watch Ranta argue with the other guys for five minutes because he wanted to spy on the girls in the bath? Do we need Haruhiro to walk around town for five minutes just to have a conversation with Mary about where they\u2019re living? \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar will manifest its current mood into a physical form so you can be bashed over the head with repeatedly until you get the point. Honestly, it comes off as pretentious. No, there\u2019s no deeper layer of symbolism that requires a brainstorm to figure out, it just holds on to its \u201cdeep\u201d atmosphere and asks you several times, \u201cAre you absolutely sure you understand what\u2019s going on here? GUYS, LOOK HOW COOL WE ARE!! LOOK AT US, WE HAVE FEELINGS!!! FEEL SOMETHING!! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?!?!?!?!?!\u201d Fuck off, Grimgar. I don\u2019t need to watch characters cry for eternity to figure out that something\u2019s wrong. There is slow, and then there\u2019s wasting time.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so it messes around with the themes too much. What else does Grimgar do in terms of story? Well\u2026 nothing. Grimgar manages to slightly outpace a half-melted snail covered in glue, but at the end of twelve episodes there\u2019s still bugger all that they\u2019ve accomplished. They got less shit at killing goblins. Okay. Great. If anything, the party loses their progress somehow (shh, spoilers) and much of the remainder of the season is spent on making that up. They spent twelve episodes going from 0 to 0.5. \u201cBut I thought you liked the fact that everyone sucks!\u201d --possible argument. Yeah, for like two episodes. After a while, it got old, nothing happened, and I\u2019m just sitting here wondering what the point of these twelve episodes were.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert! This happens pretty early but it\u2019s still major, so I recommend skipping this next paragraph if you don\u2019t want any spoilers at all.\\n\\n\r\n- So, what do you think \u201cash\u201d in the title \u2018Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash\u2019 implies? My patience? Good guess. Either way, it\u2019s Manato. Manato dies and they cremate him. Ha ha ha. It\u2019s pretty interesting that such a thing would happen early on, but the death is incredibly obvious. They keep hinting it\u2019ll happen as if to say \u201cHey! You know what would really suck?! If this guy died right now!\u201d Plus if anyone\u2019s gonna die, it\u2019ll obviously be him because he\u2019s the least replaceable, most responsible, and the overall leader. His death would be the only impactful outcome. But him dying so early means that the audience doesn\u2019t get to know him much, so I don\u2019t really feel anything from this. Everyone crying about it until the episode ends doesn\u2019t make it more meaningful, it feels more like a girlfriend crying over the death of her dad she didn\u2019t actually know. Then they keep bringing him up at every waking moment. Shut up! I hardly knew the guy! Leave it alone! - \\n\\n\r\n-end of spoiler-\\n\\n\r\nAnd just a quick word about the action itself before moving onto the characters: the action in this anime is okay. It\u2019s a little more cooperative, with the entire party being involved in a fight and playing different roles, but as you can guess by them fighting goblins most of the time, the fights are very basic and not exactly interesting. I can optimistically believe that Grimgar will evolve with its action as the characters get stronger and learn more interesting abilities, but for this season it isn\u2019t much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThis probably isn\u2019t a surprise at this point, but I didn\u2019t really care for any of the characters in the show. Mary is the best, I guess, because she had an actual backstory that explained her personality and actions well. But, was she an interesting character? No. She was simply a bitch, and it was obvious that her reasons were gonna be that someone close to her died. Hooray, friends dying! After getting to know the party more, she becomes less of a bitch and just a level-headed character. \\n\\n\r\nRanta is an interesting one. He actually provides some needed internal conflict in the party. He does whatever he wants and doesn\u2019t really care about what the others think, and rejects the party leader\u2019s desires for everyone to be close and more cooperative. Basically \u201cI\u2019m doing my part, fuck off.\u201d Except Ranta\u2019s also the most punchable, arrogant, annoying piece of shit in the world of Grimgar. I understand his character, but he\u2019s annoying and I cannot get myself to like or even connect with him. And that leads me to the next part\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe players in Grimgar have no recollection of their lives before the \u201cgame\u201d. This means that we can\u2019t understand the characters and why they act the way they do. Ranta is an annoying bastard, yes, but WHY? Logically, he has no reason to be at odds with the rest of the party, but I\u2019m sure that his reasons are because of something that happened in his actual life that may or may not be explained eighty light novel volumes (roughly 67,130 anime episodes by the sound of it) from now. How wonderful. Notice how I\u2019m not bringing up the other characters because they\u2019re about as flat as a cat that\u2019s been run over by an 18-wheeler a good ninety-something times. Haruhiro is decent, since he feels conflicted with his role in the party, but his lack of initiative and confidence make him an absolute bore to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThings get real interesting when you look at the art. Without a doubt, Grimgar\u2019s biggest assets beyond Shihoru\u2019s ass-ets are definitely the watercolored backgrounds. They\u2019re stellar. Truly. But, I wish they had more depth. What do I mean? Well, the backgrounds are nice, and it goes beyond environments--even buildings and shops are styled the same way, but what about the monsters? You\u2019ll see more than goblins in the final few episodes, but all monsters just look like they came from any other RPG. I can understand humans looking like regular humans because they probably didn\u2019t actually come from this world, but the monsters should\u2019ve looked more natural to the world. It would\u2019ve at least made up for their incredibly generic designs. At least the humans are a step above totally generic, but not much higher up.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the animation can hold up decently\u2026 some of the time. The fights look okay, but the budget for the softer scenes must\u2019ve been spent on donuts for A-1\u2019s staff meetings. There\u2019s an incredibly hilarious scene where three characters walk down an alley\u2026 scratch that, they don\u2019t walk, they fucking bob around hilariously like someone stuck their cut-outs onto a popsicle stick and moved them around on some watercolored painting. Thank you, A-1. Just, thank you. Many other scenes simply use little-to-no animation, often resorting to still frames. But, hey, have some more watercolors because that\u2019s all we\u2019re good for! Case-in-point, the OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme quite literally has no animation. There\u2019s maybe five seconds of it, and the rest is just panning shots of the characters. Did they seriously think they were making an ED? ...Well, I guess not, because the ED does the same thing as well! Funny enough, the OP actually was decent for a few episodes--not really stunning, honestly, but at least it was fucking animated. The song stayed the same, but they changed the visuals and just didn\u2019t care enough. Maybe they thought no one would actually watch the OP that long because the song isn\u2019t that great.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OP song isn\u2019t that great. Just gonna throw that out there. Generic rock track meets sharp violin and a pretty weak vocalist to bring you a pretty forgettable song. But, interestingly enough, much of the soundtrack is actually very good, including the emotional ending theme. The real keepers are the many insert songs used. Seriously, there\u2019s probably at least one insert song in each episode, and all of them, with the exception of one or two, are pretty great. I\u2019ll totally be looking forward to purchasing it in a very legal manner.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Grimgar. I really did. But it misunderstood itself very hard. When I wanted it to be serious, it tried being goofy. When I wanted things to progress, it insisted on being deep and thoughtful. Should a second season appear someday, I may come back to see if it\u2019s improved, but it will be through a much less patient mindset.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nPlayability - Youlostthegame/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Mary or Merry idk this website and the subs don't agree\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1 because i yelled at it so much\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

It gives us a look into what life would actually be like in an RPG/fantasy world where the characters actually spill blood (their own and other creatures). It isn't exactly action packed and there is no definite end to the story, it's just about a group of people trying to survive in a new world that they were thrown into. My only gripe is that they mention a certain character too much.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n  I honestly like the story. There isn't exactly a goal that they are working towardslike getting home or destroying an ultimate evil but really just surviving this world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n The character models are kind of generic but the way the scenery is drawn just gives life to the whole anime and since the pacing is slow it gives the viewer more time to appreciate it. Also, the art in the action scenes are good as well!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\n The op I didn't really enjoy but the ending's vibe just fit the anime perfectly.

What made me enjoy the show the most is getting to know the characters since the anime puts in so much effort into character development hence the slow pacing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8/10\\n\r\n This anime was a nice change in pace to the usual action packed anime that I like. The pacing may be a little slow but the character development makes up for it and the action is great too. I definitely recommend watching this to those who need a change of pace for a while.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is yet another anime to take on the \"fantasy RPG setting.\" I haven't had many good experiences with this genre, looking at you, SAO, but I feel this anime was at least a small step forward for anime in this genre. It did some things right, such as how it handled it characters, but almost completely failed with its practically nonexistent plot.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar places its characters in an RPG fantasy land, where instead of these characters being over powered and self aware, they are just beginners, and have no clue how they have ended up in thisworld. They know that they once had a past life, but are clueless on where they are now. I'm a bit iffy on the whole amnesia concept being used in stories, unless there is a good explanation, but this anime decides to never touch on this, leaving us oblivious to the whole point of this story. Is there even a storyline in this anime? The characters just run around killing monsters for the most part, but we are left with just so many questions. Why are these characters here? Why are they fighting monsters? None of these questions and many more are never fully answered- they are touched on here and there but weren't given a real explanation. This anime was really lacking a consistent plot or goal which made the story a complete fail. Instead of focusing on it's setting, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar mainly focuses on it's characters, which sort of makes up for it, but with such a unique setting, I really wish they would have focused on it more. Oh well. I should bring up one more thing though about the story, and that's the pacing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the story moves a very slow pace. Along with the lack of an actually plot, this can make the series pretty boring at times. I didn't have a problem since I watched this series weekly while airing, but I don't know how well I would have done watching this anime on my own time.\\n\\n\r\nBut this story did have a few good sides. Throughout watching the anime, I felt like I could really imagine the world they were in, and connect all of the areas they were in. This may be just something with me but the world just felt like it fit all together. It really felt like a realistic RPG world, and incorporated lots of RPG themes together, such as the characters learning skills over time, and the fighting of monsters. I really liked the way they executed the fight scenes; the characters actually used strategy, and fights were really exciting at times especially when the characters worked as a team.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself to really like the art in this anime, though like anything else, it has it's pros and cons. One of my favorite things about the art style was the backgrounds; I really liked how they looked sketched out, and painted with faint water colors, which gave it a whimsical look. Sometimes though, I found that certain things clashed against it, whether it be furniture or characters, this is more of a nit-pick for me though. Speaking of the characters, I also really liked the designs these characters had. They all felt unique to each other, and weren't similar to anything else I've seen. They felt very RPG like, which fit the theme of this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the most part was pretty good, though it had it's poor parts which made it feel inconsistent. It just had moments where things felt lazy, and you could catch a few mistakes every once in a while. This wasn't THAT often, but the inconsistency really ruined the animation as a whole. Throughout the anime, there were also quite a few montages which were either a hit or a miss most of the time. They summed up less-important scenes that were in the light novel well, and showed progression in time which was good for this slow paced story. But sometimes it just felt lazy- these montages were rarely animated in my memory, and were practically slideshows. This was also the case for the op and ed. Pretty much slide shows. I can understand it with the ed but I would expect more from the op.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this anime can best be described as pleasant, though not very memorable. There were many different tracks that played during montages to make them seem less bland. The opening and ending theme were also good too from what I remember, but I can't really imagine the songs in my head at the moment; as I said, the tracks aren't really that memorable. Besides that though, the music is used at the right time, and for the most part only adds to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I believe the character development is where this anime strives the most, and some-what makes up for the poor story-line. All of the characters get nice development. Some a lot more than others, but there aren't really any boring or flat characters from the main cast I feel. We start off with a group of characters who are inexperienced in this RPG world. I really like this aspect, because in the few RPG based animes I've seen, the main character starts off really overpowered, but here we get to see these characters grow over time. At the beginning, none of them really know their roles well. For example, there is a cleric who is playing aggressively on the front lines, and an archer who rarely uses her bow. (Sorry, I know enough knowledge about RPG classes, but not really that much!) It takes a traumatic experience for them to learn their roles, and really learn how to work as a team. \\n\r\nOne thing that I really liked that this anime did with the characters is how they handled a specific character, Mary. Mary is one of those aloof quiet type characters, which I usually hate, but Mary is an exception. She has a believable back story that explains her personality, unlike some characters that have this trope for no reason. Once she can trust the rest of the group, she does open up to them eventually, not right away, but over the course of a few episodes which is how this character archetype should be handled in my opinion. So job well done, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I did enjoy this anime. It did things right such as how it handled it's characters, but the story was more or less a failure. I can't fully say that though, because this story is based off of a light novel, and these twelve episodes only cover around the first two novels I believe. So maybe the story does go more into depth in the ln. But this is a review for the anime. I don't know what the chances are, but I'd be up for a season two. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar does end off at a nice spot, but also sets itself up well for another season. In a second season, I would like to see more development on the story, rather than the characters, and maybe more advancements on the ships ;) It can't be just me who wants to see Mary x Haruhiro.\\n\r\nOverall my scores averaged out to around an 8. If I could read Japanese I would read the light novels. But I can't. Definitely check out this series if you like character driven stories, and an RPG fantasy setting, but be sure to stay away if you hate slow paced stories.",

            "content": "If I am being honest right now, I loved Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. To me, it was a fresh look into the Fantasy RPG genre, one which is overcrowded with absolutely god awful shows. It is one of the special shows in this genre in part due to its realism in storytelling in its genre and actual well developed characters. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\n\tHai to Gensou no Grimgar tells the story of 7 characters in a world they have magically transported to. Many other characters have also been transported there for no apparent reason. This large group of people forms smaller groups to go and huntmonsters in the surrounding area for loot and to survive. Now you may be wondering to yourself, man this sounds a lot like everything else in this genre, why should I watch it? Well, this is because unlike many of the other shows in this series, Grimgar gives us weak characters that actually develop and grow unlike those Over-powered MCs (I\u2019m looking at you Kirito). The characters have to develop to survive in this world, hone their skills, work on learning new skills, coordinate as a team, and many things you would expect to see in the survival of a group of people. Although the pacing of the story is really slow, it benefits this show helping to develop the characters more thoroughly. The story itself is great but with a generic start, and A-1 pictures being A-1 pictures, the story just fell short in the end not living up to my expectation of how the ending would play out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\n\tNow if there is one thing that A-1 pictures can actually do good, it\u2019s the art work of a series. This is some of the best art I\u2019ve seen in a while from an anime. The background is wonderful. The water colored background really stands out to make it different from many other anime out there. There is little to no drop in quality throughout the series. Animation is smooth, clean, it looks wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sound is great in this series. It really lends itself to certain scenes. The opening and ending songs are all very beautiful and I really enjoyed them. The insert song \u201cseeds\u201d is also one of the best insert songs I\u2019ve heard in a while. It\u2019s wonderful to hear absolutely great to hear such amazing songs from (K)NoW_NAME. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are absolutely one of the best parts of the series. Most of the characters get great development. Almost all the main characters get a good amount of development and the development is actually very interesting. From tragic backstories in some, dealing with loss in all of them, and how they interact with each other all give us a good look into these characters. These characters also aren\u2019t strong, they are weak, and grow as the story progresses. How they look at life, and what they do in the aftermath of some events really helps to give these characters a realistic feeling. Their reactions to everything feel so authentic. It\u2019s not like watching Sword Art Online where character development is absolutely trash; this anime takes time to develop all its characters. This makes the series slow overall but makes it so much more enjoyable when you actually feel attached to the characters from their backstories and what happens to them. It\u2019s an absolute masterpiece in terms of developing its characters to the fullest and has some of the best characters I have seen in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI loved this anime, it was an absolute blast to watch in part to its difference to other anime in this genre. It didn\u2019t go through with many of the clich\u00e9s and did things you would normally not expect in this genre. I really enjoyed that originality aspect of this series. The slow pacing rather than killing the experience for me, heightened it. This was what I though Sword Art Online should have been.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tSo do I recommend watching Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Yes, an absolute yes. You must watch this series if you like the Fantasy/RPG genre. This anime shows how good a fantasy anime can be after years of horrible fantasy anime. It brings out all the good points of what a fantasy anime should be. With absolutely amazing characters, sound and world-class art, this is definitely one anime I will come back to watch again. \\n",

            "content": "Oh, it'll be a hell of a ride. So fasten your seatbelts and enjoy my review. This review may include some mild spoilers; be warned.\r\n1. Concept\r\nThe first thing must be said for Grimgar is it may be the best \"being thrown into a game\" story after good old Jumanji.  Grimgar nails on details no other anime series of the same concept didn't even bother to mention. The best (in my opinion) detail Grimgar is the feel of being in an alien land. Our heroes and heroines have no idea about where they are and what they are supposed to do. They have no clueabout their pasts except some bleak words whom they can't remember their meanings. And after being guided to the start of their adventuring career this feeling of being in an alien land reflects itself as inexperience; they make fails, they have coordination problems when fighting as a party, they struggle to survive, they seriously live the stress of earning enough money to buy food (they even can't buy new pairs of underwear for quite some time and had to wash their underwear every day), and hell; they even hesitate to kill a living being since THEY ARE TEENAGERS WHO HAVE NEVER SWUNG A SWORD, SHOT WITH A BOW AND ABSOLUTELY HAVE NEVER, EVER LIVED IN A HIGH FANTASY MEDIEVAL-ESQUE WORLD!  This amount of detail is so astonishing that with every passing second, you love this series more and more and more.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the story is about a group of teenagers struggling to survive in a \"land of ash and fantasy\".  They know nothing about their past lives except some bleak, distant words they use subconsciously (like \"phone\"), whom they can't comprehend their meaning. So, we know that they are hailing from our world and from our time but their reason to be trapped in Grimgar remains a mystery to be revealed. In the first season, we won't have much clue about it, though. The first season is about their struggle to survive in this world and being adapted to it. And this aspect of the story is handled amazingly well. We see some real struggle while they are trying to be the characters they've intended to be and failing at it, since it's actually really difficult to survive in a world full of monsters and magical things (Tabletop RPG players will understand me and speaking of which, I salute all of you fellow Pen & Paper players!), especially if you are some teenagers from a high-tech world; ours, in particular. This level of authenticity is amazing. On the other hand, I don't know how they will handle about the mystery part of the story but I'm sure that in next seasons (if there will be next seasons, of course) they'll handle it as well as they did in the first season's story.\\n\\n\r\n3. Characters\\n\r\nThe number 1 reason I really like Log Horizon, another \"being trapped in an MMORPG\" anime, is the authenticity of its characters; we have some kids who have hard time to adapt, some adults who lost their sense of sanity because of the event and some other adults who try to stay calm and do something to prevent people from going mad. Grimgar's characters side is also strong at the aspect of authenticity; we have a group of teenagers who have a hard time while trying to adapt to an alien world. The series lets us see clearly what characters think about the situation via dialogues and monologs. We see their doubts, fears, sorrow, sense of being lost and amnesiac. But on the other hand, they are still teenagers; they are exploring themselves like any teenager who hit the puberty. Boys, for example, make dirty jokes, make comments about the hotness of the girls in the party, they even subconsciously take a peek to their breasts.  The only one out of this puberty drama is Moguz\u014d; the oldest guy of the party and he shines like a lighthouse of sense in a band of puberty hit teenagers, just as how it should be!\\n\\n\r\n4. Gameplay Mechanics & Fights\\n\r\nAs I understood; Grimgar is a game closer to tabletop RPGs' style rather than MMOs'. In my opinion, it's a huge upside. I like Tabletop RPGs' handling gameplay elements like spellcasting, fighting, adventuring,  leveling up etc.  I'll mention some things about these. For example; in Grimgar, you need to pray for a spell if you are a priest or read invocations and make ritualistic movements if you are a sorcerer. If you want to make your characters stronger you need to find a trainer and spend some time with training.  You should allocate money to food, survival gear etc. (Also; you should wear your helmet if you have one since arrow shots to the head or head traumas are fatal things. :D ). \"Skills\" used in combat are not some flashy and non-practical moves but tricks and techniques derived from real medieval warfare (mostly, even though not completely).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last thing I've mentioned makes Grimgar's fight scenes awesome. There are no flashy movements, melee fighters are careful about their footing (which is an important element of real life melee sword fighting), they  try to parry or dodge the attacks (since being hurt and in pain are huge disadvantages), ranged fighters and offensive casters tries to make their shots count via having the high ground and reading the battle carefully. And Haruhiro; the ace and the rogue of the party is always moving, seeking the weak points while staying in the shadows and protecting his friends' backs since they are busy with fighting the enemy. Now this is how fighting should be!\\n\\n\r\n4. Art\\n\\n\r\nArt is awesome. There's not much to say; hand-painted backgrounds are awesome, character designs are awesome, almost completely authentic design of weapons and armours are awesome.\\n\\n\r\n5. Final Words\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar is not perfect, I know it but it still has the potential of being the best \"being trapped into an MMORPG\" anime ever. The story is not complete,  there's only one season but I hope the sequels is going to be made. I trust this series' potential with my whole heart. It's a must watch if you like this concept.",

            "content": "I'm honestly not comfortable with reviewing something like Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash because it's one of those shows where every single one of my complaints can be countered with \"well that's what the fans like about the show\". Which is true for a lot of bad anime in general, but Grimgar is one of those shows that's specifically made to draw \"feels\" from the viewer without the structured story that ERASED used aka the main the reason why I cared for ERASED's cliched \"feels drama\" in the first place. So me saying it doesn't have a story as the main reason for not likingit is the equivalent of me going on a rant about how much Uchouten Kazoku sucks because...oh wait, I did do that.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, mood pieces just seem to exist in the same dimension as \"walking simulators\" in that they follow their own set of unique rules that most people would consider good, but I consider to be the equivalent of injecting myself with morphine. Forgive me if I was raised to believe that all stories were supposed to have actual story to them. But whatever, we'll play it your way for now, fans. Anyways, Grimgar is another \"light novel adaptation about a bunch of teenagers being trapped in a video game fantasy world\" and comes with the usual baggage that comes with being based on a light novel. The terrible sexist jokes that add nothing to the product and should have been cut out completely. The large amounts of talking that get in the way of actual plot progression. The fact that certain plot turns are telegraphed from miles away. The fact that this is \"light watching\" in general, and I don't enjoy light watching.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to Phantom World, Grimgar stands out a bit from the usual by-the-numbers dross that gets tossed our way by having an actually talented director onboard and after a bit of a rough start, it takes itself a lot more seriously. However, unlike KyoAni's thing, Grimgar is first and foremost a drama with some (bad) comedic moments, which is probably why it got a much better reception since A-1's heartstring tugging is something that anime fans love to eat up. But more than that, it actually takes its \"trapped in a video game world\" premise as something with actual stakes and underdog charm, right down to the characters being so bad that they can't defeat a simple orc and having people actually die, thus causing them grief for a large amount of time. They don't even explicitly state they're in a video game, although the fantasy world is so RPG-like it doesn't matter either way, and the road to forming bonds is a long but well-deserved one indeed - although the fact that the team members getting killed off are guys and the recruits they replace 'em with are girls didn't exactly miss my eye.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all solid stuff to build a compelling narrative around, but Grimgar has about as much drive to do something with its edge as the seventh Harry Potter film, and is just content to let the stuff be the substance. You guys remember the complaint regarding how Deathly Hallows Part I was just a lot of running around without any real destination? Well that's exactly what Grimgar lacks in regards to all of its elements: a destination. Ignoring the large amounts of time spent on building up its world and characters at the expense of plot, which quite frankly bored me so hard that I went surfing on the net whilst playing the episode in the background, I don't understand what the end goal of this show is aside from being a more-realistic take on this RPG-genre. Bokurano is a more realistic take on the mecha genre, but it also had a destination for said take to work towards: fifteen kids have to destroy fifteen robots that will invade their world and only by defeating them can they prevent said world from becoming erased.\\n\\n\r\nI mean do these kids even want to go back to the real world, assuming they have a real world to go back to? What's the specific requirement to do so? Okay, they get strong to survive, but to what end? I'm not watching a sitcom here. I'm not even watching something where romance is the main focus - and incidentally, the romantic chemistry between any of the characters in this show is about as stale as Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up these days. None of the characterization is particularly strong to begin with as most of the characters' flaws don't really factor into what actually happens in this show, aside from Mary, who is distant from people because her team was wiped out in a tragic incident that wasn't even her fault. Grimgar isn't a character study. It's some sort of drama I can't place, and if I can't find a good way to describe it, it's kind of hard for me to join in on the feels train unless you guys don't mind \"confusion\" on board.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that post I wrote a few days ago, questioning how much good execution is allowed to carry a product on its own? Well Grimgar embodies that question more than ERASED - and to a lesser extent, Gate - ever could. I mean aside from the bad jokes, it has a serviceable if not outstanding attitude towards its premise, but is that really enough to carry it for twelve episodes (and probably more when the sequels inevitably get announced)?. I mean I'm sure there's going to be people who like that upcoming Hardcore Henry film solely for the first-person gimmick, but that's a two-hour movie. Imagine an entire series based solely on that. And I'm more of an action guy than a feels guy to begin with, so me being worried about enjoying that says a lot.\\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people already made their position before they even read this review and thus have already dismissed my points out of hand, but...ah I dunno. Maybe I should just avoid mood pieces if what's supposed to be good about them is completely opposed to my own ideals, but I really don't think belonging to a certain genre means you shouldn't at least try to have some sort of end goal in mind. I mean it's not like this thing was advertised as an atmospheric piece of entertainment - no more so than ERASED at least - and I'm still going to be somewhat positive of ERASED when it did this shit because quite frankly, it did it much better. I would have preferred it to not have put itself in a Catch-22 position in regards to using its plot in order to give the emotional moments weight, but that's all done with now. And quite frankly, I and everyone else are getting tired of bringing that show up.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up this review in a nutshell...if you haven't seen Rakugo, then give it a try right after you close this thing. I'm pretty sure people who like this show's feels will like the ones in that anime several times better.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is a rather unique watch. Shows throughout time have had a tendency to force characters from 0 to a 100 in an unrealistic time frame. This often pertains to the widespread demands of instant gratification. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar challenges these demands by emphasising the natural growth of characters: step by step characters are built through every interaction with the plot. Closely observing this and the plot is paramount as to not miss the abundance of implicit detail dedicated to their development and characterisation. Due to this profound nature of the show, reflection is commonplaceand as such, the watch is recommended for anyone who enjoys reading pensively into things.\\n\\n\r\nAn inherent feature of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its large main cast. There\u2019s a greater emphasis on characterising and developing the group as opposed to the individuals; however, it is decently balanced between the group and the individuals such that neither don\u2019t feel completely neglected; the viewers are briefly enlightened on their individual daily lives (roles, recreation, style of living etc.) and personalities. This opportunity to learn about how each character interacts with the group is one of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar best point. Note this orientates Hai to Gensou no Grimgar more towards those who are interested in group development.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off on a weaker foot but eventually progresses superbly, making it worth the watch if the initial set of annoyances can be endured. Such is also true for the pacing, as it evolves into superbness. Though, it is sometimes deemed \u2018slow\u2019, but slow is not bad. It is only when it is incongruously or meaninglessly slow it can be considered such. In this case, the creators have done a superb job at pacing the show such that the story and characters (development and characterisation) are often progressing and the right mood is established. Also, the isn't show is absolutely slow. Explicitly it might seem so but when explored implicitly, there is profoundness behind most interactions and moments (plot-wise and character-wise). Bluntly put, the show might seem slow or idle if one focuses on the explicit details and misses all the implicit detail, which is possibly consequential of not understanding the purpose of the show (detailed later).\\n\\n\r\nNow regardless of the pacing, it is possible for something to be rushed. To rush something is to reach something without having the necessary details or time for the viewers to follow or agree with the outcome. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is subject to such with the limitation of 12 episodes. This is especially pertinent to an important moment that coalesces some of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar major elements. Whether or not its failure can be pardoned (if it is viewed as such) will ultimately dictate one\u2019s enjoyability of the show. It has been identified and explained it in the spoiler section.\\n\\n\r\nHai to Grimgar's paramount feature is its realism. The characters will have to manage basic needs, such as food and shelter. The characters will have to face the reality of the world. The dialogue, development, and interactions are all seemingly realistic. One example of such realism is the fact almost nothing major happens at the beginning. Though why should anything extraordinary happen? They lead basic lives and hold little significance. It is abnormal for much to happen outside of their daily struggles. Another excellent feature Hai to Gensou no Grimgar employ is not having over-the-top combat abilities. They were mostly just minor extensions of the human ability, which harmonises well with its realism theme.\\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is tailored to fans of slice of life. The combination of realism and narrative focus on character lifestyle and relatively slower progression makes it a natural watch for such people. A conspicuously common issue is approaching this show expecting an action, most likely consequential of the initial action scenes and seemingly shounen setup, and receiving a slice of life instead. It is also important to note that while the premise of the show was to toss the average teenager into a fantasy-themed world, it is not a deconstruction of the fantasy genre\u2014the show lacks the focus on and the necessary intricate details characteristic of a deconstruction to be considered such\u2014and is only one of its enjoyment factors. The watch is instead for those who are interested watching the growth of a group, the bonds they develop, the building of the character etc. It is much more of a character oriented show (60\u201370%) than a plot oriented one (roughly 35%). It is a show where learning about the characters is essentially progression. Understanding this and what a slice of life entails is critical when encountered with such works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory=7.7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter=8.1\\n\\n\r\nArt=9\\n\r\nThe art was dazzling at most times. The beautiful scenery heavily complemented the story by aiding the development of the desired mood. Most noticeably, the watercolour backgrounds evoked a tranquil slice-of-life feel, similar to that of Mushishi. The backgrounds were also unobtrusive allowing a higher focus on the projected characters, which is excellent because Hai to Grimgar is a character-dominated show. However, this conflicted with the action scenes as the projection of the background with 2D art instead of 3D sometimes lacked stimulation, detracting from its thrill. \\n\\n\r\nSound=9\\n\r\nMy praise for the audio component is similar to that for the art. Furthermore, Hai to Grimgar uniquely features many montages. They aided the conveyance of the mood and story and were fairly enjoyable to watch. There were however two misuses. They have been mentioned almost immediately below as to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis section henceforth contains spoilers. This section will offer the main criticism and other comments regarding the show.\\n\\n\r\nIts first use (town settling) was inappropriate. It is only warranted once the characters have truly settled in, which was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe second use (graveyard location) clashed with the mood. The pacing of the song was too fast inhibiting focus on the melancholy scene. The usage of the scene also felt extremely abrupt as Manato\u2019s time with them was seemingly short.\\n\\n\r\nShihoru is a frivolous character. She can be removed from the show with slight amendments and little difference. This was most apparent during episodes 1\u20135. She was, however, vital in combat post-episode 5. They need to rework her such that she serves a purpose (plot-wise) outside of combat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nDue to the limitations of 12 episodes, the development of the bond between Manato and the group is rather lacking. 2 episodes were certainly insufficient for evoking the desired sympathy for the characters grieving Manato\u2019s death. The end of episode 4 is the weakest of the series (somewhat rushed outcome) as it draws heavily on Manato\u2019s bond with the group. Common sense dictates that they were distraught but it is rather limited and superficial. This foundation of knowledge would have also fostered understanding of and sympathy for Haruhiro as he confronted his inner-conflict. \\n\\n\r\nMore application of the characters is desired; while Hai to Gensou no Grimgar does build the character, they lacked the time to further display the final product. This was most evident in episodes 11 and 12 where new details were introduced to the character but without application. This plays into the 12-episode limitation.\\n\\n\r\nIt was exasperating when Haruhiro uttered \u2018It would be nice if you could mend clothes with magic as well.\u2019 and proceeded to blatantly explain it. It seemed as if that line was attributed to him solely to inform the viewers. While it was natural, the interpretation should have been somehow left to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nRanta escaping at the end was illogical. He was surrounded and barely knew the mine\u2019s caving system as opposed to the Kobolds, which know the place inside-out. Haruhiro\u2019s skill is essentially the visualization of that.\\n\\n\r\nExperience from fighting enemies will yield knowledge about their weak points and effective engagement. The streams of light that direct Haruhiro can be interpreted as the visualization of that. However, this \u2018skill\u2019 should have not appeared or appeared so quickly against the Death Spots at the end. As he lacked combat experience specific to Elder Kobalds, it should have been a challenge not something his \u2018skill\u2019 could easily relieve him from. It was an opportunity where the creators could have explicitly and satisfyingly displayed the development Haruhiro\u2019s combat abilities and maturity over the course of the show. However, it was wasted by rushing the fight to a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOther comments:\\n\r\nThey actually fully (and superbly) developed the concept of the main cast being unnatural inhabitants of the world. The main cast were evidently briefly aware of this fact, but overtime the characters neglected it such that it eventually faded. This suggests of their adaption to the world and prioritisation of their survival in the realization of the triviality of pursuing such an oddity as opposed to meeting to the demands of their daily lives; the corroboration follows. At the utter end, Kikkawa (the drunkard) shouted \u2018Australia\u2019 in a carefree manner. They could have chosen any word or omitted it all together, but why did they attribute that specific line to him? They deliberately chose \u2018Australia\u2019 to connect it with the real world and had Kikkawa, the most carefree character, utter it in such a manner to hint their accordance with and acceptance of the new world. Also, when heard in the context of the characters, the statement sounds greatly insignificant, as it was randomly blurted out by a drunkard, suggesting the same of their unnatural inhabitation of the world. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar deserves an 8/10, which accordingly to MAL denotes a \u2018very good\u2019 show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The occasional RPG setting within an anime isn't some new, revolutionary trend. Popularized by the underwhelming Sword Art Online, they seem to be popping up a lot more frequently than before and that isn't something I'm particularly fond of. This is mostly due to the lack of originality that comes with these works. To a novice, this idea may seem spectacular on it's own, but at this point, the same thing has been done over and over again and not once did I consider one of them to be good. \r\nWith that being said, I believe that this is quite close to the epitome ofwhat an anime should not be - from the embarrassingly awful execution to the completely obnoxious and meaningless characters. It honestly baffles me that some people see this title as average, yet alone good. From the legendary A-1 Pictures who've produced such magnificent works of art such as - Sword Art Online, The Asterisk War, The Perfect Insider, Fairy Tail, every single bad light novel adaptation and many more mind-boggling series for our entertainment over the years, comes the awe-inspiring Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story takes place in a videogame setting, a town called Grimgar and it follows our protagonists as they each individually grow as people, go through hardships together and face the cruel reality that 10 of them can't kill 1 retarded goblin. This is not an exaggeration, our protagonists are so weak that it takes them 5 minutes to kill a single goblin. However, I thought this was a very interesting approach, as it obviously differs from the usual Jesus-kun format. Sadly, this doesn't last for long. There was no big transition in between their entire party not being able to kill a single goblin to them doing full-on raids versus an entire castle full of goblins. It just sort of happened overnight, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did think it was a neat change, I see this argument used way too often. \"Grimgar is special because its story is very realistic unlike the other RPG anime!\" I think there is a fine line between realistic and different. A different approach doesn't mean the title is going to be good and this is what people tend to be missing. If it really wanted to be that realistic then it should have cut down a bit on stuff such as discussing a girl's breasts in front of her for 3 minutes straight. Here lies the thesis and basically anything the positive reviews ever say about this show. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually people started calling it a deconstruction of the RPG genre for this sole fact. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Grimgar itself is for the most part very uninteresting and leaves a lot to be desired. It is barely touched upon within the first 2 episodes in some hasty introduction to the basics and the rest of the series is action-driven and focuses more so on the characters. All we know is that there are normal townsfolk and these adventurers who have to fight off goblins in order to survive. We don't know anything about the town, we don't know anything about the goblins, etc. Basically we don't really know much of anything and it would of definitely been better if they tried to implement some sort of interesting lore and went more in detail since it just felt lazy on it's own. Not that I find RPG settings to be particularly interesting anyway but yeah, the worldbuilding was bad.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may tell you that this anime is simply not for you though, due to it's slow pacing which a shonen fanboy such as yourself cannot appreciate. As a fan of shows that take their time in properly developing it's world, themes and characters, I can safely say that Grimgar left me disappointed. It really did not have to be as slow as it was. It just felt like a mere blunder on the production staff's side, rather than a necessity for good development. So even if you do prefer slower paced stuff, I can't really guarantee you'll enjoy Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nSo instead of filling up the weaknesses of the show, they go ahead and introduce irrelevant plotpoints such as: none of the characters having their memories from the real world. I thought this was incredibly useless and stupid, what would knowing anything change? Was this implemented in here just so they could have an easy way out of dealing with character backstories? It is shown early on that none of their items from the real world are transported here to begin with, so why bother? Actually why even bother making the setting a game? Why not just some fantasy world? It's because A-1 knows the demographic it's appealing to far too well.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, gotta give credit where credit is due. The artstyle used in Grimgar is very original and nice, with a watercolor/painterly feel to it. This was definitely a breath of fresh air due to how bland I thought most of the art in these recent seasons looked like so a change of pace was much appreciated. The backgrounds look especially nice, as if you're looking at a painting of some sort. The animation is alright and it clearly excels when the girls' tits bounce. You can just see how much time and effort was put into those jiggles. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art and animation, the sound isn't anything spectacular. Sure, you've got some good songs thrown in there, but for every good song you have the same amount of poor utilization and engrish vocals. This is quite a problem as Grimgar tries rather hard to make you emotionally invested, and when such scenes came along, they mostly felt underwhelming due to the mediocre musical direction. For a series that takes itself seriously, I thought the voice acting was rather lackluster. None of the performances stand out and most are just borderline annoying. The only decent performances were Yume, Mary and Haruhiro (although this is probably my bias due to his role as Shichika in Katanagatari).\\n\\n\r\nAll aboard the cringe train. This is no doubt the worst part about Grimgar, showing further how A-1 has no clue how to make decent or even half-decent characters. This luckily changes as the series progresses but I still felt like touching upon it - every character interaction between members of the opposite sex has sexual themes or implications in it which makes me wonder if the writer is out of his early teens yet. Adding on to this, it is very impressive when in the first scene of the series it is able to portray the females as useless and clumsy damsels in distress, unable to do anything on their own apart from scream and cry until their beta-male white knight companions come to the rescue. This makes for some of the cringiest scenes I have ever seen, like talking about Shihoru's breasts for a good 3-5 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nYou could say that this is just taking the easy route since no matter how bad the actual series in question may be, it's bound to garner some sort of audience. However, I still feel as though it is a very big problem and is ultimately what a lot of modern anime suffer from. While I guess that it just knows what demographic it's appealing to and it's not so bad on it's own, it also means that we have to depend on the male cast to be good or get the proper development. Feel free to take a guess on how it's handled in Grimgar. Yes, not very good...\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people would argue this point because of how well developed they all become upon facing loss! No! The characters can grieve all they want but it won't make them more likable or realistic. Coping with sadness is a great characterization tool if utilized properly and on good characters, but despite these characters being borderline terrible, they barely develop! Most of the characters don't even have a personality that defines them to begin with, apart from Ranta. And, well.. Ranta is just Ranta. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, one of the characters was only memorable for his death, nothing else. They didn't even bother to make us feel anything for the character, he was just a bland teenager who got killed off in order to \"develop\" everyone else. You aren't supposed to remember a character for their death, you're supposed to remember them by their life and their accomplishments BEFORE their death. The drama also felt awfully forced and doesn't work 90% of the time. \" Hey guys, let's go to that place where most of Mary's party got brutally murdered which left her scarred for life :D :D :D Oh Mary why u mad bro?? \"\\n\\n\r\nI giggled a couple of times when the goblins were screeching so I guess some enjoyment was to be had. Sadly it was all just nullified by Ranta and the female cast's cleavage. The pacing also played a key factor in this but it did get noticeably better as the series went along. Despite this, it is not an exaggeration to say that I was forcing myself through most of the show as in the end, Grimgar struck me as incredibly bland and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that had a lot of initial potential and sounded pretty good on paper but A-1 went the wrong way of doing it. Especially if the characters were handled properly, Grimgar could of been the highpoint of the RPG genre, covering stuff like how detrimental loss can be in some cases. Sadly, the script looks like something from an otaku's basement, the pacing and execution are incredibly poor and the characters are very bland, uninteresting and have no defining personality.",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\n--\r\n(If you couldn\u2019t give a tuna glass about this review and just want to know if you should watch this, skip all the way to the \u201cWhat to expect and enjoyment\u201d Either way, read this review if you want an insight of the flaws it had. This is my first review so don\u2019t judge and give me a break lol. My usage of words might come off as wonky so sorry for that)\r\n Grimgar is an anime that doesn\u2019t necessarily bring anything distinctive to the tables. I personally believe that Grimgar was just an anime of progression, where we wouldhave an insight on a group of six and the enhancements to their amnesia and how they develop from it. Even then, an apparent anime like this had its deficiency and I\u2019m astonished to know it does.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\\n\r\nDespite the very slow adaptation, there was no exhilarating tension or motivation to the anime till the very few episodes. Grimgar was a story that was going nowhere till they picked up an objective that wasn\u2019t even enthralled upon at the few last episodes. Very repetitive episodes as only a very few things would happen as it\u2019s a part of the progression within the anime, which it would conventionally be the party just going out to kill some goblins then coming back. \\n\\n\r\nAs the other reviewers stated, it\u2019s very hard to not reference a spoiler so yeah, spoilers up ahead in the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt very disengaging because of the lack of condolence felt for them. The fact that they killed off Manato in just four episodes immediately created a plot hole because of the lack of profundity put into Manato. I didn\u2019t get to know him as a character; we didn\u2019t get in depth of him at all hence why I couldn\u2019t empathise for him. The fact that the characters would consistently drag Manato throughout the plot and weep for him made me feel excluded. It\u2019s as if the plot was trying to renounce me to comprehend them or empathise for them in the slightest.  They were trying to make Manato as pertinent to the story as possible because it\u2019s the only thing they were dependable towards. Also the foreshadowing of Manato\u2019s death was too heavy; which made his death very obvious, and yes, in a bad sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnd of spoilers\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar fails to give any cognizance or impression of the world the group of six are living within by constantly focusing on them and nothing outside of their party. We are not given an perception of how other parties evaluate and evolve in the world they are living within a.k.a the world we are being shown. When the group of six are struggling to kill goblins, how are another party handling this? How did they handle this when they were or are in their position? Sure, this anime is not deliberately trying to focus on other people but just by describing how other parties are doing within the narrative occasionally would have been justifiable. Also there\u2019s no clarification as to why Haruhiro and the rest were chosen to be summoned within the world we are shown. Why is it that they are chosen but no one else?\\n\\n\r\n There were a very few illogical clarifications for the people\u2019s amnesia. How is it that they are well efficient of remembering their names but nothing else? There\u2019s something about that that is very impactful on the characters. Does anything remind them of their name or something? And how is it that they remember the particular words they use but nothing else? Does anything remind them of the words they use? Grimgar fails to justify this. But even then, Grimgar badly brings the significance of that if we\u2019re not going to know about the life the characters had before they came into this world. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the characters came from Earth but Grimgar doesn\u2019t really make that transparent. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service within this show is what I\u2019m truly dissatisfied about. At first, this anime gives you the intuition that it\u2019s one of those soothe animes that seems to have some kind of abhorrence towards ecchi and all that sort, till you watch it, only to find that it adds a lot of unnecessary fan service itself. Oh but the art style of this anime definitely gives you a sense of suspicion. When it comes to wanting to be goofy and thrilling, Grimgar is very dependent with its fan service and jokes about Yume\u2019s flat- chest for that, which it\u2019s very subjective whenever you like it or not (Which I didn\u2019t really) It\u2019s just the fact that Grimgar would execute these at the wrong time, which is where the issue lies. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime felt like complete torture. Grimgar didn\u2019t manage the time of the twelve episodes properly and just tried to slowly progress the anime, most of the time being way too sluggish. Grimgar was way too enthralled on developing the characters that they completely overlooked everything else, which is giving the plot a resolution and getting into depths of the characters perhaps? \\n\\n\r\nThe amnesia concept completely stripped the opportunity to get in depth of the characters to begin with. However, even though the anime had the chance to tell us about the back-story of each character before they came within the world of Grimgar, something is telling me that that will barely bring any significance to the tables. Their amnesia gets in the way of getting in depth of the characters because there\u2019s nothing to say about the characters within the party of six except Mary. The amnesia concept brought a huge plot hole among the characters at the very start. The characters only came off very one dimensional expect Mary, who was the only three dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\nNo character within the show was likable. This is more of a personal preference, keep that in mind. Every character was just pure mediocre. Even their character design was so generic. Each character just had that stereotypical role of their own. With Mary being that cold one but really when you get to know her, her attitude is very justifiable, Yume being the flat chest yet humble, Shihoru being the shy one who always cries, always has the oppais, Manato being the \u201cJustin bieber\u201d a.k.a the perfect, Moguzo being the quiet, peaceful, Ranta being the obnoxious and the Haruhiro being \u201cthe MC\u201d. Heck, even the outside characters had their own stereotypical roles etc, Barbara = Fan service, Renji = the brave, admired. \\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\\n\r\nDespite Mary, Haruhiro was a well executed character regardless of his lack of back-story (Something good about Grimgar?) Haru was nicely done depiction of the current reputation of the group. Haru alternatively came crucial; I\u2019m quite astonished to see how the anime was capable of making Haru essential to the plot and the group. He is what created the perception put into the party. Haruhiro claimed his own hindrance and concerns as much as he represented that of the whole group\u2019s, and he overcame his own as much as the group did as a whole. Some of you may be thinking \u201cWhat about Ranta?\u201d Sure, I will applause Ranta for his mentality and perspective on the group and how he\u2019s just doing his part, however because of how unlikable he is and how this mindset completely changes within episode twelve, Ranta is just as mediocre as a character could get within his type. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar had rather good characterization (Yes, finally, something positive about Grimgar again) Why is it that they have good characterization? Well, because the plot was much focused on this that they received good results. However, don\u2019t get the wrong idea, it\u2019s not really anything bewildering, it\u2019s just that Grimgar was capable of handling this without any issue.  Grimgar was very victorious with what it wanted to do here and it\u2019s very comprehensible with what they were trying to depict, how the struggling, amateurish and primitive managed to develop into a tactful and rational. Very simple and nicely exposed.\\n\\n\r\nThe water colouring a.k.a art of this anime was very heart-warming and made me feel comfortable and pleasant. I could go on describing it. As an artist, it was very admirable and motivates me into doing some water colouring with its warm colours. I adored how the background was done as well. Little to no effort put into doing it but in a respectful way.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the opening and ending song has a very tedious tune to it, it\u2019s very memorable. It\u2019s something I hum from time to time and I think that\u2019s a good thing. Something about the opening and ending was very clingy and addictive to listen to. It\u2019s even more memorable than the Erased opening and I love that opening more than the Grimgar opening. The first half or the series and the ending song has very lazily done visuals and the second half of the series opening has some effort put into it but I still find something indolent about it. I\u2019m not really concerned about the OSTs; it\u2019s okay. \\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect in Grimgar of fantasy and ash and Personal enjoyment - \\n\\n\r\nBut the real question is, is this anime enjoyable? Honestly, this may come off as anticipating but it depends. Yes, this is one of those \u201cIt depends\u201d types of animes. If you enjoy looking at very slow progressive anime, this is the anime for you. However if you want a nicely done anime but it gets to the point and it has an objective, stay away from this anime.  Be bound to expect a very slow anime with very torturing pacing, one dimensional characters expect one, unsympathetic death (not telling who), nicely done MC, nothing happening between the episodes and much more!\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime special is how it\u2019s very considerate with its development so kudos to that! \u201cBut Pramma, did you enjoy this anime?\u201d Honestly, no. It was so boring and it wasn\u2019t really convincing or motivating to make me binge it till the very end. I wasn\u2019t capable of watching episode 11 or 12 because it was that boring but I pushed myself to finish it lol.\\n\\n\r\n Grimgar had bright potential but just didn\u2019t use it to its full extent. A lot like to say how pragmatic this anime is but if you look into it, it\u2019s not really that realistic. If you look through the flaws this anime had, the realism of it just suddenly vanishes. For a very straightforward concept like Grimgar, I\u2019m rather disappointed that it has this much mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives \u2013 \\n\\n\r\n-\tNo exhilarating  tension  or built up -\\n\r\n-\tNo story or point was made till the very end -\\n\r\n-\tDisconnecting characters; lack of sympathy - \\n\r\n-\tRepetitive episodes ;nothing happens in between those episodes - \\n\r\n-\tLack of information about the world of grimgar or their way of life. - \\n\r\n-\tIllogical clarifications for their amnesia -\\n\r\n-\tShows nothing besides group of 6 -\\n\r\n-\tAwfully slow progression and pacing - \\n\r\n-\tUnnecessary fan service -\\n\r\n-\tTrying to make dead character relevant to the story -\\n\r\n-\tToo dependent towards this dead character; killed off too fast -\\n\r\n-\tCharacters amnesia strips the purpose of characters and getting into depth of who the characters are -\\n\r\n-\tUnlikable characters - \\n\r\n-\tDon\u2019t get an insight on every single character \u2013 \\n\r\n-\tNo reasoning for Haruhiro and the rest that were summoned presences. They\u2019re just there.\\n\\n\r\nPositives \u2013 \\n\\n\r\n-\tGood Characterization - \\n\r\n-\tGood art -\\n\r\n-\tMemorable opening and endings - \\n\r\n-\tOkay usage  of OSTs \u2013 \\n\r\n-\tDespite Mary, Haru = nicely done character\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash = Overall 4\\n",

            "content": "The show of it's season that everybody likes despite it's pretty bad. We have a group of teens who gets into a world based on RPG ruleset and shortly after this, they forget their previous life... and that's all. We won't get to know who they are, why did they get there, what is that place anyways, why does it operates like a video game, what should they do there. They just live their everyday life, learning some new skills, killing the low level creatures for the loot which they use to cover their living expenses and equipment.\r\nThere are some conflict, they lose a teammate,hire a new one who lost her team and slowly move on after their loss, but this doesn't start a real character improvement. It's trying, but doesn't goes anywhere. During their fights, because of this is a team, we might expect it'll be shown from a strategic point of view. They build up the tactics of their ambushes, comment how the teammates use their class' special skills to effectively operate as a team, but no. They just show their newly learnt skills without any deeper concept. We could think that after these they focus on giving the world some depth, who are these goblins and kobolds, are there any relation between them, what kind of society do they live in, why must they fight with them, why are they hostile by nature, by the way what kind of society do humanity live in this world. But no, we wont get to know anything about these either. The main issue with this show is NOT the slow pacing. The slow pacing can not be an excuse for the lack of world building and plot improvement. At the end there were some improvement in the representation of characters and the fight choreography, then, SLIGHT SPOILER, it ended with a terrible plot armor execution, END SPOILER.\\n\\n\r\nThe art design is correct. The character design follows the typical A1 Pictures design. One of the main characters looks exactly like a brown haired Kirito. Not quite unique. The environment and backgrounds are a bit better. With this sketchy looking, hand drawn like appearance it's easily distinguishable from the other series of the studio. It's a matter of taste if you like it or not, I found it a bit self-serving, but a creative way to work with low budget, the main issue isn't this. The animation seems really cheap. The fight scenes are dull, there isn't any tension in them at all. It's nowhere near UBW or even SAO. Oh, and SAO, do you all remember the fight against the first boss with Asuna and Kirito? It was a good fight, they were working together, they looked like a team. I'm not an SAO fan, but that scene was alright in concept and visuality. Don't expect anything even remotely like that from Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, when I've seen the first promotional image, I knew I have to have low expectations. And thus fortunately or more like sadly I couldn't get disappointed. Not even pleasantly though. It sticks out downwards from average quality. Maybe the light novel was decent, I didn't read it, but there never were a moment when I felt the anime could be any better than a mediocre fantasy shounen. You won't lose anything if you skip it.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, I had some pretty mixed reactions and feelings with this series. It had its' moments in various episodes where character growth, or the story & plot would standout.. then a few moments later an episode it would do a 360. I don't want to call the show a roller-coaster though because I do not think that is the right term to describe.\r\nMoving on from that though, considering where the Light novel left off and where the anime stopped, I think that A-1 Picture's team did a pretty good job with pacing. They were successfully able to covermaybe 94-97% of the original story which is great. Now the story, It had it's moments. Feels, excitement, comedy etc, all of it was in between \"Great\" and \"Meh\" I honestly felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall feeling that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar gave off to me, felt like it had everything together, however when things unfolded or events would take place it just seemed like things needed a little extra boost. I felt like most of the times the producers made things feel slower rather than fast paced because they were trying to add a little more emotional elements and moments especially when Minato died.\\n\\n\r\nI was really glad that most the characters personalities, were drastically changed. Well, to be honest, I'm glad that they changed Yume's personality because I wanted to strangle her character in the novel. Her speech was so damn annoying \"Yume thinks\" \"Yume likes\" UGGGHh!! I am just so happy that they changed the way she speaks. Now, Haruhiro, I'm glad his profile was changed too because I hated his whiny, lazy, useless ass. Now he's still a bit useless at times in the anime, however to be fair, he is changing, he's finally going through that phase most characters go through.... \"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\"... OR \"CHARACTER GROWTH\" :) Which ever you prefer to call it. Compared to their original designs, I have to give A-1 major kudo's. I love it when I look at the original illustration designs for either Manga's or Light Novels, then look at the anime adaptions because they change so much to (In most cases) Look a lot better. This is one of the many cases where the anime adaption of the characters look far more superior than the original designs and illustrations. Overall in the characters department I actually wasn't that impressed. I felt like even though most of the characters have potential to be greater than what they are, most of Haruhiro's team was \"Non-assertive\" or they just had a hard time serious taking action. Except Ranta.. however he was just a reckless S.O.B.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow with Grimgar, I did think it was worth watching however, I also think it was a title that didn't need to be over-hyped. I felt like I expected too much out of it. In fact, I would say that, that was my biggest issue with the series. I kind of felt like it lacked quality. Now, when I use the word quality I mean that the overall animation, soundtrack, story/plot and character was lacking in various ways.\\n\r\nAnimation felt very lackluster. Background settings and quality didn't stand out at all or too much. I feel like if the animators made things pop out and look more visually appealing then I would not have had an issue. However, I personally think with shows like these, background settings add more of a \"realistic\" type feeling. The terrible painted, water-coloring-ish background settings -practically faded, just didn't work out for me. The ending song, with the water-color-ish animation, that looked great. Very beautiful, plus the song sort of complement the art used.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was overrated , not over-hyped, I take that back. If you're going to watch it, do not expect nothing but great things because the series, like many before and after it, is full of disappointments or faults... I have to give this title an 8/10 because I really liked the story and plot. I am a sucker for adventure and fantasy anime so I love seeing titles like these get noticed and put in the spotlight.. but with Grimgar.. maybe not so much. I hope to see a season 2 later in the future.",

            "content": "Mature version of any \"rpg like shows\" the done right.\r\nI'll keep this short but informaive as I can.\r\nMany misunderstand what the show is really about and what it's trying to be. They complain \"just when will they get over with this and go start adventuring?!\" and claim \"nothing is happening bs!\" what they didn't know is it's not aimed to be that. Grimgar is all about the group of people who have been thrown in a world they don't know, adapting their new environment bit by a bit. So as you can see, action is not the highlight of the show. It's how they adaptthe world and how they do it is what makes the conflict. And that's where the interestingness comes from.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of \"adapting the world\" seems so Log Horizon yet it's far from being exactly the same with Grimgar. the reason why is because Grimgar has a mature theme mixed with. it's realistic, more of portraying the struggle of being in that situation. the struggle of having no money to buy what you need, adjusting to the people you have no relation with and so on. \\n\\n\r\nThough I kind of Implying the series is somewhat of a \"survival of the fittest\", an opposite side existed. It has a slice of life vibe that gives you this country side feeling. The way it's done is just amazing! it doesn't feel like out of the place and I even find it pretty relaxing to watch and with the the calming music that plays along with the heartwarming backgrounds even make it more refreshing. How the characters respond to this SoL part is just amazing as well. You can totally see what they do when they are not in a hunt or that how they do their personal lives. through this, it helps them flesh out their character and make it complex the way that even if you try to remove the conflict of the story the existence of characters won't feel empty they would still have something in them.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, many find them boring. I kind of agree that they don't have any interesting side but what makes up for it is their interaction and development(the strongest points of the series actually) and if I have to defend it more, my reason would be because they are not supposed to have an odd or a special personality. They're designed to be realistic. To make you relate to them. Which explains why their team spends so many time to get stronger. Because no normal teenagers would desparetly want to fight for death. which is what I realy like from the series. you can just clearly see their growth. Of how at first they can't kill a single goblin and becomes just like a murderer, the first time they face the act of killing they get nervous and tremble but the afterwards they loses their sense of guilt. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the character development greatness, it's just really top notch. It's realistic, way more believable than any shows does. It doesn't happen right away making a huge jump, it's carefully taking its time progressing their development to make sure it will look real and it doesn't completely change their character which some shows or books seems to always get wrong. Their development to their friend's death, is just so good! each of them shows different signs of reaction and develops differently according to how close they were to their friend. Which proves the uniqness of their character. It flows perfectly not missing any phases. From denial to mourning to acceptance and to learning and you can really see the changes of their actions, reactions, and interactions little by little as they repeat the same thing over and over(killing goblins). They start adjusting-- trying to adjust themselves more to each other.(Especially after Mary, the best girl, was introduced) their teamwork becomes better, they get stronger and their relationships gets tougher. It would just really surprise you that the boring characters you thought were actually complex. Just try to compare the whole character development of most of the show they always works the opposite always getting things wrong lmao.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, instead of cool fantasy action shit, what you're going to get in Grimgar is what I wrote above. It's aimed for those people who wants to see something different. Just a reminder though, the series is so slow which most has a problem with. But it's because it's inteded to be that. Slow pacing doesnt really mean bad it depends if the show needs it or not. Like here in Grimgar it's slow paced because the anime focuses at depicting the growth of a character which have to have long exploration. So if you're the guy who would choose to fall asleep when traveling by a plane instead of enjoying a beautiful view then this might not be for you but if you're that guy who would like to window watch to see that beautiful view you should probably try this.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Free Review}\r\nStory (8):\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimar tells the story of a group of people who all of the sudden see themselves in a completely strange and fantastic world, with no memories of where they come from, or who they where. The only thing they can do is try to survive by forming parties and hunt down monsters to gain enough money to get through the day. The anime shows the struggles of the group in this world. There is nothing really new to this kind of story, but what stands out is the way the story is told. Compared to the light novelor the manga the director chose to produce a more slow paced anime. This resulted in a lot of slice of life/drama aspects that got to be explored more deeply. And also helped to get to know the characters better, seeing some things that usually are not shown at all in this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nThe production was rushed and some times it gets pretty obvious. But overall the art is beautiful, the landscape looks a lot like paintings making it different and really stunning. The animation at the beginning was great, but as the anime progressed it started to show some flaws, but again, overall it is decent, and hopefully getting fixed in the blue-ray.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nIts enjoyable, I liked the soundtrack, it gets the job done. It is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\r\nIf the slow paced storytelling the director chose to follow helped something it was the character development. It is really great. You get to know the characters really well for a 12 episode anime. Character development is probably one of the strongest in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nI rushed through this anime in about 2 or 3 days. It does not have cliff hangers but for me it made me want to watch the next episode just because it is good. Really enjoyed it. Hopefully looking forward to a second season hehehe\\n\\n",

Even though I'm a fan of well build up characters, and slow pacing shows helps them do this very well, just like FMA Brotherhood.\r\nThe slowpacing in this anime didn't help either in the story nor the character development, even the character interactions were slow? like the conversations between them feel like they took ages, to get through.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't review the Art or the Sound in this anime, since for me they were beyond perfect, and it was something that make me go through this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were kind of realistic, not MC who is OP in every situation, but we got cliched characters like the shy girl who can't pronounce a word, the one who is very energetic and we all love, but we know she is not going to win, and the mysterious girl who starts to opens, so nothing too entertaining and for the male cast we have the bulky guy who is sweet on the inside, and the MC rival who is sometimes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment for this series was good, it had a lot of promise and I might start reading the novel just to see if it was just a bad adaptation as a lot of people say, since they all are saying that we got development in the light novel, even though its not perfect I would like a second season tho, it was good and promising and kind of a different isekai anime, not just your boring isekai anime of every season, but unfortunately the slow pacing killed it, I hope they can improve this feature if they do make season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSo what this, if you are looking for a good animation, amazing ost, ending, op and a kind of premising story, and to see how slow pacing can kill a promising anime",

            "content": "Here I am writing my first review. I am not an expert with writing a review but I will try my best to depict the selling points of this anime. I always give every element a 10 and then take a point off along with any setback I find in each of these aspects.\r\nStory: 9. The story would have been a masterpiece if the first three episodes have been squeezed into one. Nothing much happened. It should have dedicated the second and third episodes to explaining a bit more about the characters' past. However, from episode 4 onward the plot keeps up with the audience'sexpectation - those who still choose to give a chance to this anime up to the 4th episode will definitely finish it to the end. Although one might argue that the plot is very much cliched, it does a great job in bringing all those fun I had in the earlier years when I used to play MMORPG Game, Ragnarok, with my friends. The thrill of the battle from episode 4 onward will keep audience wanting to watch more. However, the anime does so without focusing much on the technicalities of gaming, unlike SAO, which preserves the beauty of the fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10. Beautiful drawings on the background. The strokes and colours really brought up the laid-back fantasy setting to life. Attacks, being physical or magical, were excellently depicted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. Nice soundtracks. Peaceful music fits right into the laid-back setting of the fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9. I took one point off from one of the characters who has been unnecessarily annoying. I did appreciate his presence as it stirs the conflict in the story but I would have appreciated it more if this character is that smart annoying guy. Otherwise, you have the Miss. Shy, Miss. Happy-go-lucky, Miss. Tsundere, Mr. Considerate, Mr. Perfect, Mr. Clueless Protagonist, and Mr. Annoying all in one bowl - just the right mix to keep the interactions among them interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Reminds me of the teamwork and fun playing MMORPG with my friends. which is great. Unlike SAO, the anime brings the memories back without spoiling the beauty of the fantasy world by bringing up all the technicalities of gaming. Excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10. I would strongly recommend this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Getting transported to a game world with fantasy elements. You\u2019ve heard of these type of stories before in recent years. From Log Horizon to the infamous No Game No Life, it\u2019s a recycled idea that has becoming a growing trend. What\u2019s different about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Nothing really at first until you look a bit into the show. Well it\u2019s not vastly different anyways. In essence, this series crafts a refreshing fantasy show with some intruding ideas but also ones that are unbecoming.\r\nAdapted from the light novel of the same name, the series takes place in fantasy world of Grimgar. We don\u2019t getmuch inside scope on how the characters exactly arrived there but just the fact that they are now stuck in this world. Survival is what should be on the first thing on their minds as the party of strangers have to adapt with their newfound life. Consisting of a group of six members (Manato, Haruhiro, Ranta, Yume, Mogzo, and Shihoru), they are also told to be part of the Reserve Army forces and defend the world from monsters. I guess in a simpler way to say this, it\u2019s their way of making a living and try to make the best of it in this new world. \\n\\n\r\nI have to confess a few things though. First of all, the series\u2019 focus on its world fiction is fantastic. By all means, it is rich in resources from the dense forests to the lush landscapes with a decent amount of wildlife. Plus, civilization is exactly what people may picture from a fantasy game. There\u2019s old fashioned towns, rural caves, mountainous regions, and starry skies crafted with high fantasy elements in this imaginary world. Whatever the author was thinking at the time definitely got the general ideas right for the show. Secondly, the story is what I\u2019d describe more as fusion of fantasy, action, adventure, but also feeling that borderlines slice of life. To sum it up clearly, the slice of life part depicts the every day adventures of the party. Of course, this includes forging new weapons, fighting new enemies, and unlocking new skills to survive. It also adapts character interactions which seems to be a pivotal part of the show. It\u2019s easy to see that the party members become close as time passes on. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, they\u2019re complete strangers with little memory about themselves besides their first name. After living in the new world for a few days, we can see the chemistry building between certain characters. Haruhiro\u2019s relationship with Yume and Manato is prominent as they treat each other like close friends. Manato, the leader of the party is also a role model with his charismatic personality and is able to see the positives in people. Even Ranta seems to follow his lead despite being the hotheaded guy of the group, often known for causing troubles especially with Haruhiro and Yume. Speaking of which, Yume is the brave girl. She has confidence and builds a close friendship with Shihoru, a shy mage who struggles to open to others. Then there\u2019s Mogzo, the silent giant who often supports the party in whatever means he can. See the diverse range of character personas here? It\u2019s hard to imagine how they can all get along at first but as time passes, the show is able to capitalize on these characters both individually and collectively as a group. Later on, they even gains new member whom they have a hard time to accept at first but still welcomes her as a valuable member of the team especially upon learning their background story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show is pretty repetitive with a sluggish pacing. It shouldn\u2019t take long for anyone to recognize this especially with the nature of the story. The formulaic structure is basically the group learning new skills, occasionally gaining new equipment, while trying to improve their inner relationships. Sadly, monsters are limited to goblins and kobalds in the show and doesn\u2019t get far in that territory. If you realized this and it\u2019s not the type of feeling up your alley, then turn back now because this show will feel like a snoozefest to you. Otherwise for sheer entertainment value, it\u2019s actually an emotional drive after the first half of the show. The concept of death becomes reality for a certain member of the party while the show exploits interpersonal conflicts. While the series does this well, I feel like it\u2019s spending far too much time investing on certain plot mechanics at the expense of other potentials. Given the way this series is adapted (1 cour) and limited volumes, it\u2019s not really impressive. Furthermore, the show\u2018s relationship dynamics can quickly become a bore once you see how much the show pushes that every episode. Don\u2019t expect any legitimate romance to develop either despite some obvious hints. The show seems to tease that almost every episode especially between Haruhiro and Yume but nothing really comes into fruition. And if you\u2019re not a fan of melancholic songs, then this show could be a nightmare. As a fantasy adventure, Grimgar often feels like a mixed bag; sometimes quite impressive while other times makes you wonder if it\u2019s worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, the show does a fair job at demonstrating how a fantasy series should be about with its mechanics. There\u2019s other adventurer guilds that looks credible, weapons that actually looks like it\u2019s from a fictional world, and also various classes. (thief, mage, priest, etc) While the series isn\u2019t like Sword Art Online with heavy game mechanics, it still knows how to execute some of them. However, the key keyword here is \u2018some\u2019. The mage class is one of the more underwhelming roles in the show with its limited spell set from what\u2019s shown. From an objective point, I think the priest also plays an underwhelming role despite being invaluable for any party. Luckily, the action aspects saves that as it delivers some classic entertainment. It\u2019s pretty fluid once you get used to it with a surprising amount of violence. On the other hand, the comedy is woodenly made. I forget the amount of time when the show makes lewd jokes (mostly because of Ranta). From extended dialogues about boobs to awkward misunderstandings, the show still falls into the formulaic light novel adaptations we see so often.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main highlights of the series is the fantastic artwork. It\u2019s not just elegant but feels excitingly mythical that\u2019s painted by colorful water paint. From mountainous landscapes to old fashioned towns, the show capitalizes every detail to precision. Even character designs looks vividly convincing as the guys and girls wear gear appropriate for their class. If you\u2019re also familiar with shows like Aiura, then it\u2019s recognizable at who worked on these designs. The show\u2019s action is coordinated well with a nice amount of focus on teamwork and body movements. But like almost every light novel adaptations, it\u2019s still vulnerable to some subtle fan service like Shirou. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is one of the stronger dynamics of the series as well. While some say that the show\u2019s tendency to constantly use insert songs can be an annoyance, it\u2019s actually quite important to highlight the emotional values of the story. Character expressions matches in unison with the insert songs to show what they feel. This can be a hit or miss to viewers depending on how you take it by storytelling standards. Furthermore, character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t too impressive in general. The most recognizable would be Yume though with her kansai-like dialect. \\n\\n\r\nRyosuke Nakamura\u2019s return to direct the show brings us this fantasy adventure, one that I can say is a good example of portraying an imaginative world. However, the overall storytelling isn\u2019t too impressive while characterization is lacking t times. Still, I think it\u2019s important to address that Grimgar isn\u2019t about conquering the world. It\u2019s quite simple really \u2013 just a party of members trying to make the best of their newfound life while trying to survive. If that isn\u2019t your cup of tea, then it\u2019ll be hardly enjoyable. In introspect, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a well-made show at what it is but not great.\\n",

            "content": "Lately I've been watching only handful anime shows, to be more precise for the past 3 months I finished only 3 and currently follow 2. Each one had to  met my profound expectations and they are very strict.\r\nWhen I chose to watch first episode, I didn't expect much , mostly because this kind of anime never has real plot and everything expected action and violence is put in second plan. First thing I noticed is how beautiful art is, I haven't had seen such good looking anime for a long time, later came I noticed good animation, voice acting, heck even though main charactersare kids, they lookes unbelievable human as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you would expect from this premise is OP group or group that \"knows it all\" but really that's not what it's about. It's about a struggle for survival, finding place in the unknown world, friendship and loss. Man, there were times when I barely hold my tears and people call me person with stone hearth because I don't express positive or negative emotions deliberately , that's how emotional it can get. Also presentation of anime is done well, there were scenes without voice but carefully crafted scenes with nice ambient music, that left much deeper impression on you, deeper than voice acting ever would.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are lively and likable even stereotypes , each with unique personality and charm. Main plot is not revealed yet but few first episodes give you a hint. It's virtual world but unlike in other similar anime, propagandists don't know how did they end up there or from where, nor do they remember anything before \"awaking\" . \\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me this a true gem and everyone should give it a go.",

            "content": "Sometimes an anime will start very well and continue to be interesting for a while, but it ultimately falls apart when it\u2019s time to wrap things up. In some less-common cases, an anime will start very well but fall on its face within minutes. I don\u2019t know which of these categories are worse, but Grimgar is the latter. Grimgar gets you interested immediately, but things go downhill just within the first episode.\r\nGrimgar starts with a fight scene; fight scenes at the very beginning of anything can often be bad since you don\u2019t know anything and don\u2019t care, but Grimgar\u2019s is actually very good because itsets the tone of the series very well. For one, it\u2019s the first time we get to see the incredible watercolor world of Grimgar, but that\u2019s not the point. We\u2019re introduced to the party as they clumsily fight a pair of goblins, often used in role-playing games as one of the weakest enemies to encounter. Through these clues, it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s going on: Grimgar is some RPG-like world, and the players we\u2019re watching are fucking TERRIBLE. Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash may as well be the antithesis of RPG anime, which often depict their main characters as incredibly overpowered badasses.\\n\\n\r\n(There are also some other things you can point out, like the hinted personalities of each character and the overall decent animation and insert song, but I wanted to point out its drama most of all.)\\n\\n\r\nThe episode continues decently with some quieter scenes that introduce the characters better, and the interesting thing they throw at you is that Grimgar isn\u2019t actually a game to the players, it\u2019s real life. Through the flashback that happens right after, we see how this started: the characters simply appeared here with no recollection of their previous lives, but it\u2019s evident they came from the normal world. Not a bad premise overall, though there\u2019s one weakness to this that I\u2019ll get into later. Anyway, there\u2019s a pretty lengthy scene where the characters and a bunch of other players talk to some flamboyant guy. It\u2019s a decent scene since it provides some info, but I\u2019d like it more if this guy was around for longer than that one scene and if that random player didn\u2019t grab his knife when threatened. WHO THE FUCK GRABS A KNIFE BY THE BLADE WITH THEIR BARE HANDS WHEN THREATENED???? WHAT THE FUCK???? THAT\u2019S LITERALLY THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IN THIS SITUATION???????????????\\n\\n\r\n*ahem*\\n\\n\r\nWhile that scene and the one after are just passable, the rest of the episode hilariously tumbles down its own mountain of potential after only taking a few steps. Haruhiro, the main character, joins a guild like his teammates, deciding to become a thief. He meets Barbara, whose character design is about as subtle as a bomb in a nursery. Holy shit. I mean, being fanservicey is one thing, but this chick looks like someone made a simple thief-looking character, and then a nine-year-old pasted a pair of huge anime tits onto her in Paint. It\u2019s absolutely hilarious! But beyond dumb fanservice, the show practically smacks the viewer in the face by COMPLETELY SKIPPING THE TRAINING. WHAT THE FUCK? This scene builds up what could be a pretty intense training montage, and Haruhiro even laments a little bit, but we never fucking see it. That\u2019s bullshit. Even worse is that no progress seems to have been made afterwards because all six people as a group struggle to kill a single goblin. Noobs.\\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, we\u2019re \u201ctreated\u201d to an utterly horrible scene where a running competitor for Largest Shitlord of 2016 complains about one of the girls in the party for having small tits, and praises the other girl for having oppai. tHIS SCENE GOES ON FOR FIVE MINUTES WHY DOES IT EXIST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ANIME. WHOOPS MY BAD FOR THINKING A-1 PICTURES COULD HAVE TWO GOOD ANIME IN ONE SEASON. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really sad, because while watching that scene, I turned into Shia Labeouf screaming \u201cDO IT!!!!!!\u201d when that archer chick who kinda looks like Whitney from Pokemon SoulSilver takes aim at Ranta. DO IT. JUST DO IT. NO ONE WILL MISS HIM. That would\u2019ve made for such an interesting scenario and add more tension. Like, everyone wants to get through this, right? But no one trusts each other because someone\u2019s crazy enough to kill another just for saying some bad things. ...but instead she decides to just rub her entire body on the oppai character for no reasON IS ANYONE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AT ALL??? GOD I\u2019M PISSED.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I explained the entire episode because it highlights everything that Grimgar does well. The protagonists are extremely weak, making each battle a struggle. The setting and the overall premise has some flaws, but they\u2019re pretty good overall. But then you\u2019ll be treated (read: tortured) by some scenes that just last way too long, contribute way too little to justify their length, and can often be just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also something that really needs to be said about Grimgar and its pacing. There are many, many times throughout the series where it is not moving at a slow pace, it\u2019s moving at NO pace. All of these slower scenes that, at best, give a few minor details about the characters, can be done in half the time at most. Honestly, they could be removed altogether to make room for more important scenes. I mean, do we really need to watch Ranta argue with the other guys for five minutes because he wanted to spy on the girls in the bath? Do we need Haruhiro to walk around town for five minutes just to have a conversation with Mary about where they\u2019re living? \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar will manifest its current mood into a physical form so you can be bashed over the head with repeatedly until you get the point. Honestly, it comes off as pretentious. No, there\u2019s no deeper layer of symbolism that requires a brainstorm to figure out, it just holds on to its \u201cdeep\u201d atmosphere and asks you several times, \u201cAre you absolutely sure you understand what\u2019s going on here? GUYS, LOOK HOW COOL WE ARE!! LOOK AT US, WE HAVE FEELINGS!!! FEEL SOMETHING!! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?! ARE YOU FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS?!?!?!?!?!\u201d Fuck off, Grimgar. I don\u2019t need to watch characters cry for eternity to figure out that something\u2019s wrong. There is slow, and then there\u2019s wasting time.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so it messes around with the themes too much. What else does Grimgar do in terms of story? Well\u2026 nothing. Grimgar manages to slightly outpace a half-melted snail covered in glue, but at the end of twelve episodes there\u2019s still bugger all that they\u2019ve accomplished. They got less shit at killing goblins. Okay. Great. If anything, the party loses their progress somehow (shh, spoilers) and much of the remainder of the season is spent on making that up. They spent twelve episodes going from 0 to 0.5. \u201cBut I thought you liked the fact that everyone sucks!\u201d --possible argument. Yeah, for like two episodes. After a while, it got old, nothing happened, and I\u2019m just sitting here wondering what the point of these twelve episodes were.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert! This happens pretty early but it\u2019s still major, so I recommend skipping this next paragraph if you don\u2019t want any spoilers at all.\\n\\n\r\n- So, what do you think \u201cash\u201d in the title \u2018Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash\u2019 implies? My patience? Good guess. Either way, it\u2019s Manato. Manato dies and they cremate him. Ha ha ha. It\u2019s pretty interesting that such a thing would happen early on, but the death is incredibly obvious. They keep hinting it\u2019ll happen as if to say \u201cHey! You know what would really suck?! If this guy died right now!\u201d Plus if anyone\u2019s gonna die, it\u2019ll obviously be him because he\u2019s the least replaceable, most responsible, and the overall leader. His death would be the only impactful outcome. But him dying so early means that the audience doesn\u2019t get to know him much, so I don\u2019t really feel anything from this. Everyone crying about it until the episode ends doesn\u2019t make it more meaningful, it feels more like a girlfriend crying over the death of her dad she didn\u2019t actually know. Then they keep bringing him up at every waking moment. Shut up! I hardly knew the guy! Leave it alone! - \\n\\n\r\n-end of spoiler-\\n\\n\r\nAnd just a quick word about the action itself before moving onto the characters: the action in this anime is okay. It\u2019s a little more cooperative, with the entire party being involved in a fight and playing different roles, but as you can guess by them fighting goblins most of the time, the fights are very basic and not exactly interesting. I can optimistically believe that Grimgar will evolve with its action as the characters get stronger and learn more interesting abilities, but for this season it isn\u2019t much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nThis probably isn\u2019t a surprise at this point, but I didn\u2019t really care for any of the characters in the show. Mary is the best, I guess, because she had an actual backstory that explained her personality and actions well. But, was she an interesting character? No. She was simply a bitch, and it was obvious that her reasons were gonna be that someone close to her died. Hooray, friends dying! After getting to know the party more, she becomes less of a bitch and just a level-headed character. \\n\\n\r\nRanta is an interesting one. He actually provides some needed internal conflict in the party. He does whatever he wants and doesn\u2019t really care about what the others think, and rejects the party leader\u2019s desires for everyone to be close and more cooperative. Basically \u201cI\u2019m doing my part, fuck off.\u201d Except Ranta\u2019s also the most punchable, arrogant, annoying piece of shit in the world of Grimgar. I understand his character, but he\u2019s annoying and I cannot get myself to like or even connect with him. And that leads me to the next part\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe players in Grimgar have no recollection of their lives before the \u201cgame\u201d. This means that we can\u2019t understand the characters and why they act the way they do. Ranta is an annoying bastard, yes, but WHY? Logically, he has no reason to be at odds with the rest of the party, but I\u2019m sure that his reasons are because of something that happened in his actual life that may or may not be explained eighty light novel volumes (roughly 67,130 anime episodes by the sound of it) from now. How wonderful. Notice how I\u2019m not bringing up the other characters because they\u2019re about as flat as a cat that\u2019s been run over by an 18-wheeler a good ninety-something times. Haruhiro is decent, since he feels conflicted with his role in the party, but his lack of initiative and confidence make him an absolute bore to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThings get real interesting when you look at the art. Without a doubt, Grimgar\u2019s biggest assets beyond Shihoru\u2019s ass-ets are definitely the watercolored backgrounds. They\u2019re stellar. Truly. But, I wish they had more depth. What do I mean? Well, the backgrounds are nice, and it goes beyond environments--even buildings and shops are styled the same way, but what about the monsters? You\u2019ll see more than goblins in the final few episodes, but all monsters just look like they came from any other RPG. I can understand humans looking like regular humans because they probably didn\u2019t actually come from this world, but the monsters should\u2019ve looked more natural to the world. It would\u2019ve at least made up for their incredibly generic designs. At least the humans are a step above totally generic, but not much higher up.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the animation can hold up decently\u2026 some of the time. The fights look okay, but the budget for the softer scenes must\u2019ve been spent on donuts for A-1\u2019s staff meetings. There\u2019s an incredibly hilarious scene where three characters walk down an alley\u2026 scratch that, they don\u2019t walk, they fucking bob around hilariously like someone stuck their cut-outs onto a popsicle stick and moved them around on some watercolored painting. Thank you, A-1. Just, thank you. Many other scenes simply use little-to-no animation, often resorting to still frames. But, hey, have some more watercolors because that\u2019s all we\u2019re good for! Case-in-point, the OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme quite literally has no animation. There\u2019s maybe five seconds of it, and the rest is just panning shots of the characters. Did they seriously think they were making an ED? ...Well, I guess not, because the ED does the same thing as well! Funny enough, the OP actually was decent for a few episodes--not really stunning, honestly, but at least it was fucking animated. The song stayed the same, but they changed the visuals and just didn\u2019t care enough. Maybe they thought no one would actually watch the OP that long because the song isn\u2019t that great.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OP song isn\u2019t that great. Just gonna throw that out there. Generic rock track meets sharp violin and a pretty weak vocalist to bring you a pretty forgettable song. But, interestingly enough, much of the soundtrack is actually very good, including the emotional ending theme. The real keepers are the many insert songs used. Seriously, there\u2019s probably at least one insert song in each episode, and all of them, with the exception of one or two, are pretty great. I\u2019ll totally be looking forward to purchasing it in a very legal manner.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Grimgar. I really did. But it misunderstood itself very hard. When I wanted it to be serious, it tried being goofy. When I wanted things to progress, it insisted on being deep and thoughtful. Should a second season appear someday, I may come back to see if it\u2019s improved, but it will be through a much less patient mindset.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nPlayability - Youlostthegame/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Mary or Merry idk this website and the subs don't agree\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1 because i yelled at it so much\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

It gives us a look into what life would actually be like in an RPG/fantasy world where the characters actually spill blood (their own and other creatures). It isn't exactly action packed and there is no definite end to the story, it's just about a group of people trying to survive in a new world that they were thrown into. My only gripe is that they mention a certain character too much.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n  I honestly like the story. There isn't exactly a goal that they are working towardslike getting home or destroying an ultimate evil but really just surviving this world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n The character models are kind of generic but the way the scenery is drawn just gives life to the whole anime and since the pacing is slow it gives the viewer more time to appreciate it.

What made me enjoy the show the most is getting to know the characters since the anime puts in so much effort into character development hence the slow pacing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8/10\\n\r\n This anime was a nice change in pace to the usual action packed anime that I like. The pacing may be a little slow but the character development makes up for it and the action is great too. I definitely recommend watching this to those who need a change of pace for a while.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is yet another anime to take on the \"fantasy RPG setting.\" I haven't had many good experiences with this genre, looking at you, SAO, but I feel this anime was at least a small step forward for anime in this genre. It did some things right, such as how it handled it characters, but almost completely failed with its practically nonexistent plot.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar places its characters in an RPG fantasy land, where instead of these characters being over powered and self aware, they are just beginners, and have no clue how they have ended up in thisworld. They know that they once had a past life, but are clueless on where they are now. I'm a bit iffy on the whole amnesia concept being used in stories, unless there is a good explanation, but this anime decides to never touch on this, leaving us oblivious to the whole point of this story. Is there even a storyline in this anime? The characters just run around killing monsters for the most part, but we are left with just so many questions. Why are these characters here? Why are they fighting monsters? None of these questions and many more are never fully answered- they are touched on here and there but weren't given a real explanation. This anime was really lacking a consistent plot or goal which made the story a complete fail. Instead of focusing on it's setting, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar mainly focuses on it's characters, which sort of makes up for it, but with such a unique setting, I really wish they would have focused on it more. Oh well. I should bring up one more thing though about the story, and that's the pacing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the story moves a very slow pace. Along with the lack of an actually plot, this can make the series pretty boring at times. I didn't have a problem since I watched this series weekly while airing, but I don't know how well I would have done watching this anime on my own time.\\n\\n\r\nBut this story did have a few good sides. Throughout watching the anime, I felt like I could really imagine the world they were in, and connect all of the areas they were in. This may be just something with me but the world just felt like it fit all together. It really felt like a realistic RPG world, and incorporated lots of RPG themes together, such as the characters learning skills over time, and the fighting of monsters. I really liked the way they executed the fight scenes; the characters actually used strategy, and fights were really exciting at times especially when the characters worked as a team.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself to really like the art in this anime, though like anything else, it has it's pros and cons. One of my favorite things about the art style was the backgrounds; I really liked how they looked sketched out, and painted with faint water colors, which gave it a whimsical look. Sometimes though, I found that certain things clashed against it, whether it be furniture or characters, this is more of a nit-pick for me though. Speaking of the characters, I also really liked the designs these characters had. They all felt unique to each other, and weren't similar to anything else I've seen. They felt very RPG like, which fit the theme of this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the most part was pretty good, though it had it's poor parts which made it feel inconsistent. It just had moments where things felt lazy, and you could catch a few mistakes every once in a while. This wasn't THAT often, but the inconsistency really ruined the animation as a whole. Throughout the anime, there were also quite a few montages which were either a hit or a miss most of the time. They summed up less-important scenes that were in the light novel well, and showed progression in time which was good for this slow paced story. But sometimes it just felt lazy- these montages were rarely animated in my memory, and were practically slideshows. This was also the case for the op and ed. Pretty much slide shows. I can understand it with the ed but I would expect more from the op.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for this anime can best be described as pleasant, though not very memorable. There were many different tracks that played during montages to make them seem less bland. The opening and ending theme were also good too from what I remember, but I can't really imagine the songs in my head at the moment; as I said, the tracks aren't really that memorable. Besides that though, the music is used at the right time, and for the most part only adds to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I believe the character development is where this anime strives the most, and some-what makes up for the poor story-line. All of the characters get nice development. Some a lot more than others, but there aren't really any boring or flat characters from the main cast I feel. We start off with a group of characters who are inexperienced in this RPG world. I really like this aspect, because in the few RPG based animes I've seen, the main character starts off really overpowered, but here we get to see these characters grow over time. At the beginning, none of them really know their roles well. For example, there is a cleric who is playing aggressively on the front lines, and an archer who rarely uses her bow. (Sorry, I know enough knowledge about RPG classes, but not really that much!) It takes a traumatic experience for them to learn their roles, and really learn how to work as a team. \\n\r\nOne thing that I really liked that this anime did with the characters is how they handled a specific character, Mary. Mary is one of those aloof quiet type characters, which I usually hate, but Mary is an exception. She has a believable back story that explains her personality, unlike some characters that have this trope for no reason. Once she can trust the rest of the group, she does open up to them eventually, not right away, but over the course of a few episodes which is how this character archetype should be handled in my opinion. So job well done, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I did enjoy this anime. It did things right such as how it handled it's characters, but the story was more or less a failure. I can't fully say that though, because this story is based off of a light novel, and these twelve episodes only cover around the first two novels I believe. So maybe the story does go more into depth in the ln. But this is a review for the anime. I don't know what the chances are, but I'd be up for a season two. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar does end off at a nice spot, but also sets itself up well for another season. In a second season, I would like to see more development on the story, rather than the characters, and maybe more advancements on the ships ;) It can't be just me who wants to see Mary x Haruhiro.\\n\r\nOverall my scores averaged out to around an 8. If I could read Japanese I would read the light novels. But I can't. Definitely check out this series if you like character driven stories, and an RPG fantasy setting, but be sure to stay away if you hate slow paced stories.",

            "content": "If I am being honest right now, I loved Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. To me, it was a fresh look into the Fantasy RPG genre, one which is overcrowded with absolutely god awful shows. It is one of the special shows in this genre in part due to its realism in storytelling in its genre and actual well developed characters. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\n\tHai to Gensou no Grimgar tells the story of 7 characters in a world they have magically transported to. Many other characters have also been transported there for no apparent reason. This large group of people forms smaller groups to go and huntmonsters in the surrounding area for loot and to survive. Now you may be wondering to yourself, man this sounds a lot like everything else in this genre, why should I watch it? Well, this is because unlike many of the other shows in this series, Grimgar gives us weak characters that actually develop and grow unlike those Over-powered MCs (I\u2019m looking at you Kirito). The characters have to develop to survive in this world, hone their skills, work on learning new skills, coordinate as a team, and many things you would expect to see in the survival of a group of people. Although the pacing of the story is really slow, it benefits this show helping to develop the characters more thoroughly. The story itself is great but with a generic start, and A-1 pictures being A-1 pictures, the story just fell short in the end not living up to my expectation of how the ending would play out. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\n\tNow if there is one thing that A-1 pictures can actually do good, it\u2019s the art work of a series. This is some of the best art I\u2019ve seen in a while from an anime. The background is wonderful. The water colored background really stands out to make it different from many other anime out there. There is little to no drop in quality throughout the series. Animation is smooth, clean, it looks wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sound is great in this series. It really lends itself to certain scenes. The opening and ending songs are all very beautiful and I really enjoyed them. The insert song \u201cseeds\u201d is also one of the best insert songs I\u2019ve heard in a while. It\u2019s wonderful to hear absolutely great to hear such amazing songs from (K)NoW_NAME. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are absolutely one of the best parts of the series. Most of the characters get great development. Almost all the main characters get a good amount of development and the development is actually very interesting. From tragic backstories in some, dealing with loss in all of them, and how they interact with each other all give us a good look into these characters. These characters also aren\u2019t strong, they are weak, and grow as the story progresses. How they look at life, and what they do in the aftermath of some events really helps to give these characters a realistic feeling. Their reactions to everything feel so authentic. It\u2019s not like watching Sword Art Online where character development is absolutely trash; this anime takes time to develop all its characters. This makes the series slow overall but makes it so much more enjoyable when you actually feel attached to the characters from their backstories and what happens to them. It\u2019s an absolute masterpiece in terms of developing its characters to the fullest and has some of the best characters I have seen in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tI loved this anime, it was an absolute blast to watch in part to its difference to other anime in this genre. It didn\u2019t go through with many of the clich\u00e9s and did things you would normally not expect in this genre. I really enjoyed that originality aspect of this series. The slow pacing rather than killing the experience for me, heightened it. This was what I though Sword Art Online should have been.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tSo do I recommend watching Hai to Gensou no Grimgar? Yes, an absolute yes. You must watch this series if you like the Fantasy/RPG genre. This anime shows how good a fantasy anime can be after years of horrible fantasy anime. It brings out all the good points of what a fantasy anime should be. With absolutely amazing characters, sound and world-class art, this is definitely one anime I will come back to watch again. \\n",

            "content": "Oh, it'll be a hell of a ride. So fasten your seatbelts and enjoy my review. This review may include some mild spoilers; be warned.\r\n1. Concept\r\nThe first thing must be said for Grimgar is it may be the best \"being thrown into a game\" story after good old Jumanji.  Grimgar nails on details no other anime series of the same concept didn't even bother to mention. The best (in my opinion) detail Grimgar is the feel of being in an alien land. Our heroes and heroines have no idea about where they are and what they are supposed to do. They have no clueabout their pasts except some bleak words whom they can't remember their meanings. And after being guided to the start of their adventuring career this feeling of being in an alien land reflects itself as inexperience; they make fails, they have coordination problems when fighting as a party, they struggle to survive, they seriously live the stress of earning enough money to buy food (they even can't buy new pairs of underwear for quite some time and had to wash their underwear every day), and hell; they even hesitate to kill a living being since THEY ARE TEENAGERS WHO HAVE NEVER SWUNG A SWORD, SHOT WITH A BOW AND ABSOLUTELY HAVE NEVER, EVER LIVED IN A HIGH FANTASY MEDIEVAL-ESQUE WORLD!  This amount of detail is so astonishing that with every passing second, you love this series more and more and more.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the story is about a group of teenagers struggling to survive in a \"land of ash and fantasy\".  They know nothing about their past lives except some bleak, distant words they use subconsciously (like \"phone\"), whom they can't comprehend their meaning. So, we know that they are hailing from our world and from our time but their reason to be trapped in Grimgar remains a mystery to be revealed. In the first season, we won't have much clue about it, though. The first season is about their struggle to survive in this world and being adapted to it. And this aspect of the story is handled amazingly well. We see some real struggle while they are trying to be the characters they've intended to be and failing at it, since it's actually really difficult to survive in a world full of monsters and magical things (Tabletop RPG players will understand me and speaking of which, I salute all of you fellow Pen & Paper players!), especially if you are some teenagers from a high-tech world; ours, in particular. This level of authenticity is amazing. On the other hand, I don't know how they will handle about the mystery part of the story but I'm sure that in next seasons (if there will be next seasons, of course) they'll handle it as well as they did in the first season's story.\\n\\n\r\n3. Characters\\n\r\nThe number 1 reason I really like Log Horizon, another \"being trapped in an MMORPG\" anime, is the authenticity of its characters; we have some kids who have hard time to adapt, some adults who lost their sense of sanity because of the event and some other adults who try to stay calm and do something to prevent people from going mad. Grimgar's characters side is also strong at the aspect of authenticity; we have a group of teenagers who have a hard time while trying to adapt to an alien world. The series lets us see clearly what characters think about the situation via dialogues and monologs. We see their doubts, fears, sorrow, sense of being lost and amnesiac. But on the other hand, they are still teenagers; they are exploring themselves like any teenager who hit the puberty. Boys, for example, make dirty jokes, make comments about the hotness of the girls in the party, they even subconsciously take a peek to their breasts.  The only one out of this puberty drama is Moguz\u014d; the oldest guy of the party and he shines like a lighthouse of sense in a band of puberty hit teenagers, just as how it should be!\\n\\n\r\n4. Gameplay Mechanics & Fights\\n\r\nAs I understood; Grimgar is a game closer to tabletop RPGs' style rather than MMOs'. In my opinion, it's a huge upside. I like Tabletop RPGs' handling gameplay elements like spellcasting, fighting, adventuring,  leveling up etc.  I'll mention some things about these. For example; in Grimgar, you need to pray for a spell if you are a priest or read invocations and make ritualistic movements if you are a sorcerer. If you want to make your characters stronger you need to find a trainer and spend some time with training.  You should allocate money to food, survival gear etc. (Also; you should wear your helmet if you have one since arrow shots to the head or head traumas are fatal things. :D ). \"Skills\" used in combat are not some flashy and non-practical moves but tricks and techniques derived from real medieval warfare (mostly, even though not completely).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last thing I've mentioned makes Grimgar's fight scenes awesome. There are no flashy movements, melee fighters are careful about their footing (which is an important element of real life melee sword fighting), they  try to parry or dodge the attacks (since being hurt and in pain are huge disadvantages), ranged fighters and offensive casters tries to make their shots count via having the high ground and reading the battle carefully. And Haruhiro; the ace and the rogue of the party is always moving, seeking the weak points while staying in the shadows and protecting his friends' backs since they are busy with fighting the enemy. Now this is how fighting should be!\\n\\n\r\n4. Art\\n\\n\r\nArt is awesome. There's not much to say; hand-painted backgrounds are awesome, character designs are awesome, almost completely authentic design of weapons and armours are awesome.\\n\\n\r\n5. Final Words\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar is not perfect, I know it but it still has the potential of being the best \"being trapped into an MMORPG\" anime ever. The story is not complete,  there's only one season but I hope the sequels is going to be made. I trust this series' potential with my whole heart. It's a must watch if you like this concept.",

            "content": "I'm honestly not comfortable with reviewing something like Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash because it's one of those shows where every single one of my complaints can be countered with \"well that's what the fans like about the show\". Which is true for a lot of bad anime in general, but Grimgar is one of those shows that's specifically made to draw \"feels\" from the viewer without the structured story that ERASED used aka the main the reason why I cared for ERASED's cliched \"feels drama\" in the first place. So me saying it doesn't have a story as the main reason for not likingit is the equivalent of me going on a rant about how much Uchouten Kazoku sucks because...oh wait, I did do that.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, mood pieces just seem to exist in the same dimension as \"walking simulators\" in that they follow their own set of unique rules that most people would consider good, but I consider to be the equivalent of injecting myself with morphine. Forgive me if I was raised to believe that all stories were supposed to have actual story to them. But whatever, we'll play it your way for now, fans. Anyways, Grimgar is another \"light novel adaptation about a bunch of teenagers being trapped in a video game fantasy world\" and comes with the usual baggage that comes with being based on a light novel. The terrible sexist jokes that add nothing to the product and should have been cut out completely. The large amounts of talking that get in the way of actual plot progression. The fact that certain plot turns are telegraphed from miles away. The fact that this is \"light watching\" in general, and I don't enjoy light watching.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to Phantom World, Grimgar stands out a bit from the usual by-the-numbers dross that gets tossed our way by having an actually talented director onboard and after a bit of a rough start, it takes itself a lot more seriously. However, unlike KyoAni's thing, Grimgar is first and foremost a drama with some (bad) comedic moments, which is probably why it got a much better reception since A-1's heartstring tugging is something that anime fans love to eat up. But more than that, it actually takes its \"trapped in a video game world\" premise as something with actual stakes and underdog charm, right down to the characters being so bad that they can't defeat a simple orc and having people actually die, thus causing them grief for a large amount of time. They don't even explicitly state they're in a video game, although the fantasy world is so RPG-like it doesn't matter either way, and the road to forming bonds is a long but well-deserved one indeed - although the fact that the team members getting killed off are guys and the recruits they replace 'em with are girls didn't exactly miss my eye.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all solid stuff to build a compelling narrative around, but Grimgar has about as much drive to do something with its edge as the seventh Harry Potter film, and is just content to let the stuff be the substance. You guys remember the complaint regarding how Deathly Hallows Part I was just a lot of running around without any real destination? Well that's exactly what Grimgar lacks in regards to all of its elements: a destination. Ignoring the large amounts of time spent on building up its world and characters at the expense of plot, which quite frankly bored me so hard that I went surfing on the net whilst playing the episode in the background, I don't understand what the end goal of this show is aside from being a more-realistic take on this RPG-genre. Bokurano is a more realistic take on the mecha genre, but it also had a destination for said take to work towards: fifteen kids have to destroy fifteen robots that will invade their world and only by defeating them can they prevent said world from becoming erased.\\n\\n\r\nI mean do these kids even want to go back to the real world, assuming they have a real world to go back to? What's the specific requirement to do so? Okay, they get strong to survive, but to what end? I'm not watching a sitcom here. I'm not even watching something where romance is the main focus - and incidentally, the romantic chemistry between any of the characters in this show is about as stale as Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up these days. None of the characterization is particularly strong to begin with as most of the characters' flaws don't really factor into what actually happens in this show, aside from Mary, who is distant from people because her team was wiped out in a tragic incident that wasn't even her fault. Grimgar isn't a character study. It's some sort of drama I can't place, and if I can't find a good way to describe it, it's kind of hard for me to join in on the feels train unless you guys don't mind \"confusion\" on board.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that post I wrote a few days ago, questioning how much good execution is allowed to carry a product on its own? Well Grimgar embodies that question more than ERASED - and to a lesser extent, Gate - ever could. I mean aside from the bad jokes, it has a serviceable if not outstanding attitude towards its premise, but is that really enough to carry it for twelve episodes (and probably more when the sequels inevitably get announced)?. I mean I'm sure there's going to be people who like that upcoming Hardcore Henry film solely for the first-person gimmick, but that's a two-hour movie. Imagine an entire series based solely on that. And I'm more of an action guy than a feels guy to begin with, so me being worried about enjoying that says a lot.\\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people already made their position before they even read this review and thus have already dismissed my points out of hand, but...ah I dunno. Maybe I should just avoid mood pieces if what's supposed to be good about them is completely opposed to my own ideals, but I really don't think belonging to a certain genre means you shouldn't at least try to have some sort of end goal in mind. I mean it's not like this thing was advertised as an atmospheric piece of entertainment - no more so than ERASED at least - and I'm still going to be somewhat positive of ERASED when it did this shit because quite frankly, it did it much better. I would have preferred it to not have put itself in a Catch-22 position in regards to using its plot in order to give the emotional moments weight, but that's all done with now. And quite frankly, I and everyone else are getting tired of bringing that show up.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up this review in a nutshell...if you haven't seen Rakugo, then give it a try right after you close this thing. I'm pretty sure people who like this show's feels will like the ones in that anime several times better.",

            "content": "Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy and after reading the summary, what are the things that comes into mind when these genres are mentioned?\r\nOne might think it could be an intensive and thrilling anime, where you might expect the cast of the anime to be constantly exploring new things and exposing themselves to danger. Or you could expect the main protagonist to be some sort of prodigy who develops himself at a rapid pace, becoming the only sole focus of the anime.\r\nWell let me tell you, this anime isn't anything like those I've mentioned above. \r\nBefore I start with my review I will clarify that this animeis NOT for everyone, it is slow-paced and filled with scenes where you will have to think and appreciate the literature instead of just watching it mindlessly. \\n\r\nSo if you're turned-off by this sort of anime, please go look for some other anime, but if one day you're interested in this anime and is willing to sit down, relax and watch it instead of raging at how slow-paced this anime is, please do come back and read what I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10) - Mediocre. The story isn't anything special, it's your typical one day people get transferred to another world and they have to deal with it. So we have a group of people namely, Haruhiro, Yume, Ranta, Moguzo, Shihoru and Manato who decided to form a party together and try to live in this unfamiliar world. \\n\r\nThis is the part where many people are are split between giving this a good review or a bad review. The story absolutely goes no where, except repeating the cycle of the group of characters repeating things like fighting, returning home, sleeping, eating and talking about future plans.\\n\r\nPersonally, I am a fan of Slice-of-life animes, which is mainly the reason why I enjoyed these routines and do not mind the story not advancing.\\n\\n\r\nBut here is the important part.\\n\r\nThe characters and their development and interaction. From a rating of (3/10) to a (9/10) by the second half of the series.\\n\r\nThe characters at the start are your generic anime characters seen all around the industry. However, they change and adapt a different attitude as the series goes on. The relationship between each character also develops from being unfamiliar with one another to showing their true feelings. The events that occurs in the anime are incredibly well-placed, showing how it affects the cast and depicting the characters emotion and what they would be thinking without you even needing to read the dialogue to know.\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, the way the writer portray the Human emotion was spot-on.\\n\\n\r\n*Slight spoiler*\\n\r\nThere was a scene where they had to kill their first goblin, normally in another anime, they'll just kill the monster and not feel anything at all. But, in this anime when they killed their first goblin, they felt both guilty and helpless to what they should really be doing in this kill or to be killed world. However, as the series go on, they stopped feeling that guilt because they were used to it and more importantly, felt that if they kept feeling that sort of emotion, they would be the one to die instead.\\n\r\nMoreover, during their fights, if you watched the anime, the formation of the team and their strategies are completely wrong, further showing to us how these people are novices and not veterans.\\n\r\n*Slight spoiler end*\\n\r\nI would really love to mention another point in this anime where the emotion showed was exactly on point, but I'll avoid it to prevent spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the anime is amazing, I've watched many anime where if the art was consistent I would be satisfied. But no, this anime brought it to another level, the art was drawn with water paint, and it blended in so well with the fantasy-like atmosphere. Honestly, I wouldn't mind printing out a portrait of it and hanging it on my wall. The second part of the opening was drawn amazingly (dem curves), but that's not the point of course... btw just have to point this in here but, Mary is fucking gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Nothing really sounds out of place for me. Personally, I absolutely loved the opening Knew Day, it is a great song and I really enjoyed it. \\n\r\nThe ending was pretty good too, but I preferred the Opening much more. \\n\r\nOST were pretty normal, but the songs played at certain points in the anime were much better than the OST. Some scenes had no OST but that was because these scenes simply does not need them, and if OST were forcefully placed in them, it would only ruin the atmosphere. However, I would've preferred if they had played more acoustic styled music to instigate the audience with a feeling of themselves being in the Grimgar environment, but everything is still good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it comes down to whether you enjoy the anime or didn't enjoy it. I enjoyed it a lot, and I wouldn't complain about it even if I discover flaws, like come on, some little flaws isn't going to stop me from enjoying a show. \\n\r\nI base my rating off how much I enjoyed the anime, so please do not come to me to forcefully point out flaws on how my rating was too high or anything like that. I wouldn't mind a nice discussion on the anime but really, please enjoy it.",

            "content": "I'd like to start by saying: I know everybody has differing opinions on anime. That being said, I do not understand why everybody hates on Grimgar so much. \r\nI enjoyed this series, though I think it was a bit too short and there should have been another season. \r\nNow to the review. If you are a fan of the massively popular \"stuck in a fantasy/game world\" genre that has been making its rounds, then this is a must watch. However, this is much different than the ever-popular Sword Art Online. After watching Sword Art, most people check out Log Horizon (which is another one ofmy favorites). While these shows have a similar setting, they are tonally and stylistically different. Grimgar makes another leap. There aren't any massive real massive battle scenes with a bunch of unrealistic sword fighting. This show takes a more grounded and realistic approach to the fantasy genre. The guy who carries the giant sword actually struggles to swing it, and he's a rather large man. No tiny guys swinging massive swords with ease in this show. And, that might scare some of you away if you were looking for something like that. The fighting in Grimgar is based in real combat, essentially. Of course, there may be some parts that look unrealistic, but hey, its anime. Moving away from the combat aspect, the show manages to fit a good amount of character development into such a small amount of time. It seems rushed at times, but it worked for me. The characters really resonated with me. When waking up in a world they are unfamiliar with, there is a real feeling of fear, sadness, and despair. It takes an approach that shows how hard it is for our group of heroes to get accustomed to living and dying in this new world. Nothing comes easy to the main group in this show and it is evident because they constantly struggle to fight and make ends meat in order to buy food, clothes, etc. \\n\\n\r\nJust as a side note, they did an excellent job with the music in this show, as well. Plus, the animation and artwork is beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to anybody who doesn't mind a more \"slow-burn\" type of anime.",

            "content": "To summarise it simply, Hai to Gensou is basically a story that doesn't know what audience it's trying to target and what genre it's trying to be in.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*Spoilers henceforth*\r\nStory: 2\r\nFirst of all, if it wasn't for all the combat and amount of fanservice I would have thought the story was targetted towards women, given the amount of emotional drama that keeps going on. People keep crying about the guy that died earlier throughout the series, along with all the whining about how incompetent they are, as well as some blame games going on. They don't seem to properly resolve their emotional issues as they justflip in and out of their emotional states like a switch, with us only knowing that they probably overcame their sadness because the guy is eventually mentioned very little.\\n\\n\r\nNext. It's yet again, an RPG theme, not that I particularly mind. However, it doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a fantasy RPG (like Log Horizon) or a real life RPG (like Danmachi). It seems to want to be a fantasy RPG because of stuff like classes and the characters waking up with amnesia. Yet it wants to be a real life RPG as well because of hunger, money management and actually dying. \\n\\n\r\nBut the most striking thing is the lack of exploring the mechanics of the world. Why are there classes? There is a magic system in this world and it comes in the form of chanting, but we're not explained how it works. Can only special people use it? And what does it run on? We don't know, other than \"I can't cast anymore\". If everyone has magic, then why can't you just cross classes and have everyone learn a healing spell? Also, there's nothing really stopping our protagonist, Haruhiro, from learning to use the bow as well to provide support from behind. Another thing is that goblins and kobolds (our introduced creatures) are treated like some sort of thoughtless grind mobs, even though we see a lot of what looks like human qualities. \\n\\n\r\nThe third thing that irks me is the atrocious communication as a team. No one seems to know what their other party members are capable of doing or what their strengths and weaknesses are. They only have a vague idea and pretty much always just rush in and ad hoc it, yet they somehow manage to pull it off. But it's not only just their dialogues which are horrible, it's also their actions. So much of the time it's as though they're waiting for prompts from someone else before doing anything. An example is in Ep11 where Haruhiro just fell off a tower and gets grabbed by Ranta. Then silence... After which Ranta then immediately yells at Haruhiro to start climbing. Yep, you got that right, Haruhiro just starts AFKing or something after he gets caught and needed Ranta to wake him up.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is their illogical decision making. They literally spent the first few eps trying to kill a goblin because everyone has to go in one at a time. The other plot device was basically going to the kobold mines. Now there's a good reason why they shouldn't go to the mines, which everyone already knows why, and what prompted them to need to change hunting grounds was because the original spot became too dangerous. Now, the reasoning for going to the kobold mines was literally \"I don't know where else to go\". \\n\\n\r\nThis had potential to be a decent slice-of-life or maybe even romance story given that those moments weren't actually too bad. What ruined that potential was that the author wanted to write an RPG story but seems to have no basic concepts on how fantasies, let alone, RPGs work, while also wanting to include fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually not too fond of the background art, yet it was pulled off quite nicely. The background art is some sort of watercolour, yet the typically drawn characters don't actually stand out from the background, rather they actually blend in pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI actually like the OP and ED songs and the voice actors did a pretty good job distinguishing themselves as unique characters. Haruhiro has a pretty nice monologue voice and I liked Mary's somewhat mature voice.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\\n\r\nBasically, apart from Mary, everyone is just whiny. Everyone is always either complaining or moaning about something. There's never actually any thought put into their occupation.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that Manato was killed off because the author realised the imbalance of genders as he already wrote it, and needed to kill someone off so Mary would join, thus making it 3 girls 3 guys. \\n\\n\r\nMary and Haruhiro seem to be getting pretty close, while Ranta and Yume might eventually, which leaves Moguzo and Shihoru.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2 \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode was basically me thinking: \"So... are they going to grow a brain now or is the plot armour going to wear off\". \\n\r\nBut then I was surprised and disappointed by the deus ex machina at the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nEverything about this title feels half assed. It's like the author only had nominal ideas in his mind then just wrote down what he learnt in drama school. Teamwork is non-existent, decision making skills are that of a toddler, and worst of all, the ending is deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if I had to make a comparison. This story feels like it wants to be something like AnoHana, but the emotional side gets smudged out by people's consistent whining of the same thing and stagnant fights.",

            "content": "I will start with this, there are people who will say that this anime's pacing is too slow. I simply say they're morons who didn't understand what they are watching.\r\nNow with Hai to Gensou no Ketsu (no Yume) people immediately think action adventure and when they do they think the pacing is horridly slow. \r\nHowever, too those who actually understood what Hai to Gensou no Ketsu is - which is a slice of life in a adventure fantasy setting btw - then this glaring problem is gone. Well in fact it didn't exist in the first place, because again, if you think this is anaction anime you're a moron. Again repeat after me. SLICE. OF. LIFE.\\n\\n\r\nStory is unique: it's the emotional behind the scenes of every RPG you've been through. Shelter, food, sleep, finances, emotional and mental strength, all those things that you have to go through in an adventure but skip to the good action bits: that's the focus of this anime. I think the best line from the anime that best describe's the whole anime is when their Leader, Manato says that \"we and the goblins are fighting a battle... no living thing wants to die\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation it's quite fluid. Fight scenes are fast, and things move accordingly, especially Yume's butt. There have been a lot of bloopers in scenes: people magically wear things and not as the camera cuts to them back and fort. But background and locations are drawn spectacularly as if you're watching a painting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'll be honest most of the time I don't notice the BGM, but then comes the feels train and suddenly you hear great songs... it's like they choose the soundtrack specifically so your face is always in the same look as the feels guy meme. The OP and ED aren't extraordinary but they do keep and reinforce the overall feel of the anime, so kudos to that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are some interesting characters in this anime. However for a Slice of Life anime it has some misses in the growth on some character, lovable as they may be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's an anime you could watch if you want to take a break from all the action animes out there while still being able to take small doses of it[action].",

            "content": "When you hear the words \u201cTrapped in a video game\u201d you automatically think of Sword Art Online or Overlord which are both obviously masterpieces much like the film The Room.  However, Grimgar actually managed to surprise me!  Instead of an action fantasy show, I got a slow burn character drama that just so happens to be in a fantasy setting.  The show\u2019s god tier pacing truly does help, it\u2019s a slow show which lets the audience witness characters genuinely build up emotions and creates this really gentle calming atmosphere to immerse you inside its world.  The pacing also aids in portrayingthe passage of time, much like slice of life shows like Non Non Biyori, which helps slowly unfold the changes within the Za Warudo and its characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThematically, the show is about coping with loss, discovering confidence within oneself, survival of the fittest and teamwork.  To describe the coping with loss theme would enter spoiler territory but most of the show heavily focuses on that aspect which, like the rest of the themes, was handled maturely.  After a pivotal event people started criticizing the anime for being \u201ctoo slow, boring, lacks of a plot\u2026.\u201dNigga wha?  Stop choking on a condom, I think you\u2019re losing brain cells.  This non-progressive section of the story is about the characters gradually coming into terms with the concept of death itself, they\u2019re sad, despondent, split apart from each other and are clueless on how to progress as a group.  They\u2019re acting realistically, and by criticizing the anime for that will make me automatically assume all audience members want are explosions, nonstop action and fanservice.  Based on the audience score for Batman v Superman I assume so.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are rarely any moments where the dramatic scenes are inexcusable, when characters do cry it\u2019s used sparingly for a cause at the right moments so it\u2019s not overly melodramatic whereas a show like Nagi no Asukara has the characters crying more tears than there is water in the damn ocean.  Initially, the show\u2019s dialogue was a bit hit or miss with some occasional terribly misplaced comedy at the end of engaging scenes, but gratefully after a certain point the show quits that poppycock because when the dialogue is juicy, it\u2019s juicer than juicy juice.  Infact, while I adore the dialogue exchanges and how each character interacts differently towards other characters providing more substance to their meaningful individual conversations, I love how the anime is able to adopt the show don\u2019t tell attitude that many pieces of media lack.  Example being our good ol\u2019 Katniss Everdeen of the group, Yume, who mentions she has a desire to improve her abilities which is shown through seeing her climbing a mountain in the background or simply throwing targets in the morning.  She never tells the audience what\u2019s she\u2019s doing, the show allows you think about what\u2019s she\u2019s doing which is respecting the audience as intelligent thinkers.  Speaking of subtle improvement, you constantly see the characters work more and more cohesively as a team by enhancing their abilities, fighting techniques and communication skills.  It\u2019s all about what Manato said \u201cA party is supposed to cover up each other\u2019s weaknesses\u201d and I couldn\u2019t agree more myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe survival of the fittest aspect is a vital component used to demonstrate the harshness of the world.  Since the world is so ruthless and money, much like our world, is a necessity in terms of safely living, what do the characters have to do?  The characters have to kill not because they WANT to, the key word is HAVE, they don\u2019t want to kill but must in order to survive.  Even Ranta says \u201cIt\u2019s kill or be killed, no offense\u201d and the show constantly brings up honoring the fallen enemies as actions the characters always do.  Heck, the first time they kill a goblin, they don\u2019t yell Hip Hip Hooray!  Instead they\u2019re left traumatized, and we see how this affects the characters throughout the whole episode.  I\u2019m tired of so many shows being like\u2026 GASP, I JUST KILLED SOMEONE, I\u2019m going to drink tea and eat cookies now.  It\u2019s those types of details that makes you stand back and say \u201cDamn, that was some good writing on the author\u2019s part, good job!  Have a Peggy Award!\u201d\\n\r\nIn terms of powers and abilities, I appreciate how Grimgar makes damn sure you understand the details of the abilities the characters use.  Anything is better than that one overlord scene where the Overlord himself was spouting 20 spells without us knowing what the fuck was happening.  Explosion in my pantsu magic, Yaoimatsu magic like nigga, what the fuck you even saying.  However, there are conceptual flaws the hurt the show a bit like the whole amnesia thing not being explained as well as how the characters ended up in the world in the first place.  I honestly would\u2019ve preferred if the characters were originally from Grimgar and at a certain age they are forced to venture on their own to seek a class they desire to become which would\u2019ve eliminated the problem.  Thankfully that\u2019s not the main goal of the show so it isn\u2019t a huge complaint, they aren\u2019t trying to leave the world, they\u2019re immersed within it and trying to live their lives normally.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was solid allowing for a satisfying conclusion that allowed all the themes that were portrayed throughout the show to come full circle.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, while the characters aren\u2019t written as deep as let\u2019s say, Evangelion, they feel like human beings portraying real feelings of denial, depression, and reacting differently to situations as they learn and develop as people.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiro is our main protagonist who is a part of thief class.  He\u2019s characterized as the average joe, albeit kinda awkward but eventually due to a turn of events he has to deal with the pressures of becoming a leader.  Throughout the course of the show his lack of confidence is where his development stems from as he learns to believe in himself for the better of the party.  He\u2019s not a person who\u2019s trying to become the strongest, he\u2019s a person who\u2019s trying to help him and his party survive in a harsh world.  He must learn strip away from his dependency from Manato to becoming an independently thinking character.\\n\\n\r\nTo dichotomize the main character we have Ranta, a dark knight.  He acts as the annoying person of the group whose ideals constantly clashes with the rest of the cast as well as Haruhiro\u2019s methods on how to lead the party which often leads to conflict between the two.  However, he\u2019s actually self-aware of his obnoxious actions and remarks which he uses in order to keep the group glued together and have something in common they all dislike.  Regardless of his actions, Ranta only wants what\u2019s best for the party and has moments when he truly shines, develops and learns how to be a team player by slowly accepting Haruhiro as a leader despite them not meeting eye to eye.  He also displays realistic human emotions with an example being him self-reflecting after killing a Goblin for the first time, it\u2019s moments like those that makes this rude party member actually shine and feel genuine. Also, he\u2019s voiced by mah Favaro from Bahamut which is dank as hell!!\\n\\n\r\nMary, a priest, is the true shining star of the show.  If you had Vladmir Putin, Osama Bin Laden, the entirety of ISIS and Obama in one room, and Mary walked in, everyone would instantly stop trying to kill each other to bow down and stare in awe at her.  Initially I would\u2019ve defined her as a simple kuudere, devoid of any sort of personality and is honest, blunt, to the point.  But then, the show throws in a backstory which gives a valid reason as to why Mary\u2019s emotional repressed state of mind makes logical sense while giving a huge middle finger at the audience for thinking she\u2019d be some standard kuudere.  As the anime slowly progresses and she becomes more accustomed to the party members she begins to blossom having a more positive outlook on life and starts expressing her emotions that she kept suppressed for so long.  By also confronting her past and looking towards the future she was able to fully develop as a character who doesn\u2019t allow her negative past to define her as a person and consume her.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the cast doesn\u2019t get the amount of focus the 3 aforementioned characters you can sense a great determination for growth within all of them, making everyone likable.  Manato is the leader of the party who mostly interacts with the main character while also successfully brings the group together as a reliable chief.  Yume is an archer who is characterized as humble and funny yet has difficulty conveying her feelings to others much like the semen demon Shihoru who is an extremely timid mage that lacks communication skills but acts as great support for the team with her magic.  Mogzo, otherwise known as overweight Guts, is a warrior class man who utilizes a huge sword to take on brute type enemies.  He has a kind heart a really loves to cook making him a joy to see onscreen.  These 4 are the weakest characters in terms of development, especially Mogzo, Shihoru and Manato which pretty disappointing because beyond their personalities there was nothing to scrape beneath what\u2019s seen at the superficial level which is sad because they\u2019re onscreen a lot throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar has a unique visual aesthetic that is extremely beautiful and generates more life into its world.  The neat water colored canvas appearance is consistently stunning to the point where mostly every single background can be called a wallpaper.  Screw 5 wallpapers per second, we got Grimgar!!!  The way the colors exceeds the boundaries of the lines of objects amplifies the water color style making the architecture, forests, mines and the town all look gorgeous, lush and pleasing to the eye.  The imperfect line-work is in a way, perfection.  The character designs ooze with creativity and highlights the assets of their own classes with Ranta wearing darker colors to present himself as a dark knight and characters like Yume and Haruhiro wearing light clothing due to their close range, swift and agile style of combat.  Now\u2019s my chance to give props to the animation because it\u2019s pretty nice, the fight scenes had decent choreography with a considerable level of intensity and some characters have added minor quirks instead of them remaining still.  However, the walking animation sometimes looks like the characters are glued onto a popsicle stick and is moving left and right with the background moving but the legs not.  But ooo baby, let\u2019s not let those inconsistencies fool you, this show has some GOAT cinematography to accompany the art style.  There are slick zoom shots to allow the environment to consume you, establishing shots are a beauty to look at and there\u2019s skillful usage of lighting, especially during forest scenes where you can clearly see how the light seeps through the cracks of the leaves in the forest.  Aside from a few inconsistencies I\u2019d go as far to say that the art/animation is sublime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is off the chain, it might sound like I\u2019m trying to dick ride this show, but I\u2019m not, the soundtrack is actually lit as hell.  The calming pieces are soothing to the soul but when characters are ready to rumble, oh man, the anime knocks the roof off the house with some popping rock pieces that get you pumped up!  Yes, even more pumped up than that show about the cute little anime girls exercising, which might I add is just wrong on so many levels but hey the angles are great!  I love how the ost was implemented, with many diverse new tracks during different fights to provide a unique audio/visual experience for each fight.  The opening is fantastic to listen to and is the perfect entrance into the show while the ending song has a melancholic tone to it that leaves you with a sad feeling knowing the episode is about to close.  Voice acting was exceptional and was able to enhance the emotions and personalities of the characters, especially Ranta!  \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict\\n\r\nWhile the show isn\u2019t perfect with some conceptual flaws, earlier episodes not being up to par with the second half, and some undeveloped characters, this show definitely is an underrated gem that got instantly overlooked due to the crap produced within its genre.  With great themes, spectacular art, and a calming slow atmosphere, this is a very good show that I enjoyed tremendously.  Who knows, maybe on a rewatch I might call it greatness!  But man, oh man, we need season 2 right here, right now!\\n",

It is a \"fantasy new world anime\", but do not compare it to SAO, RE:Zero or any other popular anime from this genre. You won't see any power ups or trainings from noob to badass. I would almost compare it to a new world fantasy + Slice of life. A lot of talking between the characters about their feelings. One thing I really didn't like is: Sometimes the story goes too fast and sometimes it goes too slow.\r\nThe biggest strength of the anime would be its art in my opinion. Some ofthe characters lack development, but overall a good anime.",

I don't get the design concept of the cities and the world in general. There is very little exposition outside of the characters themselves, and even so their backstories are completely removed.\r\nThe anime focuses on feelings way too much. I absolutely detestedthe first fight in the anime. When I watched that fight, I thought, okay, \"They're going the realistic route for this anime\" and I could respect that, but after that, the end of season fights seemed too outlandish to believe, considering that the level of the fights increased by 2 dragonball z seasons. These people went from human levels to Krillin levels of power in the span of 5-6 episodes. It just didn't make any sense for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I have given this anime a 6 is because the art is phenomenal. Sometimes I feel they focused too much on the art, but the story is absolutely lack-luster.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Mindless anime to watch when you don't want to use your brain and good art.\\n\\n\r\nCons: Too much talk of feelings to establish the characters as real human beings, but instead leaves everything too sappy to be taken seriously, especially when the MC is defintely on the Autism spectrum when it comes to human interaction.",

The art\r\nThe art, in all but the characters, was closer to water colors rather than traditional animation. This turned out beautifully.\r\nThere were other minor changes as well such as smoothed panning in certain scenes, but these were much less noticeable.\r\n2. The genre (?)\r\nThis series combines a fantasy with slice of life elements. I haven't seen series that has done this well before. Instead of focusing only on action, thisseries spotlighted character development as well. It did a fantastic job balancing these.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nAll had faults and strengths. This made them interesting to watch interact. The interactions were superb as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nCould have been better. This is where the slice of life elements retracted. However, I get the feeling this was only set-up for the main arc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the op and ed every time i watched an episode. I watched the dubs and they weren't bad nor good. The other sounds were clean and added to the series overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, this was something new. Turned out beautifully in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIF YOU READ NOTHING ELSE IN THIS REVIEW, READ BELOW\\n\\n\r\nMOOD: 10\\n\r\nMost reviewers missed the mark. The other parts were fantastic, but the Mood is the real reason you should watch Grimgar.\\n\r\nTHE MOOD WAS PHENOMENAL. \\n\r\nMood such as this is formed when all other elements compliment each other perfectly; it's how you feel when watching a show. For being only twelve episodes, it was better than most long running others who have time to build mood. I can't explain it more, but I'm sure you've felt good mood before.\\n\\n\r\nGive this show a chance. You'll regret not doing so.",

Beutiful girls and boys, great personalities, acting like their age.\r\n5.Enjoyment-10. I started this anime and finish it in just one day. Saw an episode after another. Thisanime maked me wanna see the next episode. Almost everything was perfect. I did enjoyed it to the full.\\n\\n\r\n6.Overall-9.

The character development, how everything wasn't so cliche, nobody was op and the plot itself. Everything made sense, at least it wasn't a guy who magically becomes the strongest guy in the universe and beats everyone. The animation is okay along with the art style. Actually, that kind of art style is an infinite/10 but the animation was kind of sloppyfrom time to time and I heard that it was because of the budget but you get so sucked in by the story that you barely even notice those minor flaws. The anime is a 10/10 and I totally feel like buying the Light Novel set and finish the whole thing.",

I wrote a review of this anime because I felt it gets a lot of undeserving low ratings from those people whom were expecting SAO and got salty when they realized this was something very different.  Myself: I love getting something different, I love being surprised.   Which is partly why I keep reviews short (+Lazy)...\r\nAnyway, For those that want to know more;I will say, the real value in this show is in its character development, not so much the development of solving some overall problem, It is in a fantasy/RPG-world (hence the genre confusion).  In the end it kept me very interested, looking forward to each next episode, did all the things that keep me watching anime.  Moreover it breaks trends and was pulled off well. \\n",

            "content": "While everybody and their mother decided to dispute about Boku dake ga Inai Machi or in english recognized as Erased, and pit themselves on the side of either it was 'da bess show of dis seasin' or 'I am discontent with the latter half of this fraudulent shit show', I despite inexperienced with writing reviews but affluent in being an opinionated douche, decided to tackle the other often regarded '2nd bess show of dis seasin', Hai to Gensou no Grimgar or known in english as Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, in the form of a review.\r\nI'll do my utmost best to provide a review that'sfair (as fair as someone who is writing about something they disliked can be) and spoiler free (that's a + right?). Without further ado, let my explain why I think what I think about Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I initially started Grimgar, I thought to myself, this can either be another Sword Art Online/DanMachi repeat with a fresh coat of paint orrr... an actually entertaining MMO/RPG genre show with likable/relatable characters in a unique setting, intriguing story and great pacing.\\n\r\nBoy, let me tell you I was caught by surprise when it was neither.\\n\\n\r\nTo try to make this as short and to the point as possible:\\n\r\nThis show is boring. So. Very. Boring.\\n\r\nSo boring that I wholeheartedly struggled to move on to each episode and continue through the current episode that I was watching because of how bland the story and the characters were, despite the characters being put in a 'survival of the fittest' setting with no memories and little money or experience as soldiers of the Reserve Army. You'd think some heavy character development is coming in and some crazy drama and dope, action-packed fighting scenes are coming in, when in reality my child, you are getting something that will potentially, bore the hell outta you, sedate you like Bill Cosby at the bar. You won't enjoy it, for the most part atleast.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire show makes you feel like it's based off of Haruhiro's inner monologues that give pointless insight on situations and conversations he's having with another party member, as if to remind the viewer two or three times that the current situation or conversation took place. When a show reminds it's viewers of something that took place prior or of something that made the character feel a certain way to make them have the inner monologue in the first place, it isn't initially a bad thing, because it's used to remind the viewer of why the character is currently feeling the way they are or why those feelings/thoughts may change. It keeps the story fresh so that the viewer may tread along with that in mind. But Grimgar over uses it. Too much. To the extent to where the show will have you thinking, 'I know already, I saw it and heard you talk about it the first 20 times' or 'Will he ever fucking get over it?'. It's things like this people will use as a counter-argument when the topic of character development comes around to show \"character depth\" or \"character growth\" when it in cases, such as this one, the character did absolutely nothing but literally explain what just happened, through thought. Not that the viewer needed to be reminded initially at all.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Grimgar overall is slow paced. Unforgivably slow paced, to the point to where the show feels more like a slice of life anime or as if you're watching a filler episode where nothing relevant to the story happens regarding the plot. I think in story execution, where Grimgar did wrong was that it tried to portray each party member's life outside of the battlefield/missions and when they aren't together and it failed miserably. Almost nothing I can deem noteworthy can be taken from these scenes, as most of the time all they show are the characters shopping or taking in the view somewhere or pondering about something pointless or even worse, when the show decides to turn half of the episode into an AMV with music that doesn't fit the current scene with watercolor still-frames depicting the same 3 or 4 images in different times of the day.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar in appearance is actually quite appealing. The water color sort of background and display, when used in the correct situation, gave it a nice warm and cozy sort of 'at home' feeling, as if nothing life threatening or dangerous is bound to take place anytime soon and boy, does this give the show a sort of double edged sword effect.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the water color works for scenes where the background is being shown off or the characters are having a conversation, it's just plain awful when it gets to a fighting scene. Since this show uses more water color-looking and bright color overlay animation for most of it's scenes, the hand-drawn animations when fighting are dull and not very appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is the epitome of dullness and boredom. Not even the drama or fighting scenes can save it from being overrated drivel adapted from a light novel no one can stop pissing themselves about. So overall:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nNothing new. Overdone concept with a boring, lame execution and pretty colors.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, nice colors sometimes used in the worst of situations but when used correctly, total eye candy for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\\n\r\nMeh. Generic, unmemorable fantasy anime (or fantasy genre anything for that matter) music. It only got bad when the AMV moments came around and you can totally tell they just picked any j-pop ballad from the radio and stuck it in there with nicely drawn still frames as if anyone asked for them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nBland af. I've drank tap water with more taste. All generic and boring. The only character I remember is Shihoru and that's only because she got those big anime tidd- I mean, she got that plot y'know? That goooood plot? ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)  y'know, the good plot the rest of the show seemed to be lacking in? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI didn't have fun. I didn't enjoy it. I don't absolutely hate this show, but god was I bored the whole time. I tend to give shows an 'A' for effort if they make me laugh, looked nice, had a good soundtrack or had a good enough concept or characters to carry it, but this show literally had nothing, literally nothing worth mentioning. At all. I felt like the only thing keeping me interested was Shihoru's...( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) fuck it, not even that was enough fam. Seriously. Maybe. Idk.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI know there are people that are into this whole 'fantasy/mmorpg' type of thing and that are lenient with super slow snail pacing but I honestly wouldn't even use this show as a weapon to torture my worst enemy with, it'd probably put his ass to sleep or something. Poorly thought up jokes aside, this show is pretty bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Though if you would like to give it a try, who am I to go against your wishes? Go for it fam. Might just be the bed time story you need to fall asleep.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash) is significantly different in comparison to other fantasy/action RPG-esque anime. Although at first glance it appears to be your generic \"trapped in a video game\" type premise with an either fresh out of the boat overpowered or limitless potential main character, the show strays away from the archetype and tells a different story based more upon it's characters and how they react and change to certain situations, rather than using the \"action\" aspect as it's focal point. It also has a genuine focus on telling a more \"realistic\" fantasy story by having our main charactersbattle the weakest monsters and still failing as the very first step, which is definitely scarce in the medium and is a welcome change of pace. \\n\\n\r\n(8/10) The plot, while weak in general direction and lack of urgency at the start, is compelling when you grow attached to the characters, and begin to follow their motivations and goals. However, as I say this, it must be noted that this kind of story may not be for everyone. It's rather slow at the beginning and may deter viewers from continuing due to the previously mentioned \"lack of urgency and no clear storyline\". However, the show certainly does pick up later on as the plot attains that \"urgency\" and action it had been previously missing. The pacing of the show is done well and there are no immediate time jumps or episode rushing. \\n\r\nFor those who find shows with rather slow moving episodes unbearable, I'd still give this a shot considering things start to get moving quite quickly. Also, if you absolutely hate the characters and don't give a flying turd about their goals, I'd say avoid this one.\\n\\n\r\n(7/10) Although the anime ventured into relatively creative territory with the fully watercolored backgrounds, the same couldn't be said for the characters themselves. There are animation errors on multiple occasions, the animation itself was jerky and jittery at some points (notably the short action sequences), and it just felt drab and just plain average in general. Although this is an easy oversight, I kept finding myself noticing mistakes and frequent lacks of detail all throughout. The fact that this aspect of the show is lacking in comparison to the rest is certainly not a reason to not still watch and enjoy it though, as many could watch it and not even have noticed that the art was subpar.\\n\\n\r\n(8/10) The sound and music throughout was done very well in my opinion, although there were a few very strange and hilariously out of place music choices later on. However, these choices didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story at all. Sound design was done well and there were no immediate discrepancies to the casual viewer.\\n\\n\r\n(9/10) The characters are where in my opinion the show really shines. There are a total of seven main characters, all refreshingly varied and didn't seem to follow a particular immediately recognizable archetype. \\n\r\n- First, we have our super perfect gary-stu kind of leader character Manato, who, granted, isn't our protagonist. While this might look like a huge red flag, this character isn't just perfect for no reason. His involvement and impact on the story helps develop other characters to a great extent, and becomes an important symbol and inspiration towards the end. He displays constant heroism and bravery as a priest, being selfless and kind to his group members. \\n\r\n- Then we have our actual protagonist, Haruhiro, who at first appears to be the most average of the bunch and has no immediate quirk or interesting personality. However, as the show continues, Haruhiro himself develops largely as a character and soon learns that he has to change in order for himself and the rest of the group to stay together and survive. Although I want to say that I actually liked his character a lot at the beginning even though he was devoid of interesting qualities because of how laid back and cool he seemed. It was and continued to be a very human quality which I found captivating. \\n\r\n- Moguzo seems to follow a general \"gentle giant\" kind of stereotype, which is a reoccurring connection that can be made when looking at his personality as a whole. He's caring, soft spoken or just quiet, good at cooking and wood carving, etc. Just by looking at these few points, it could be said that his character ain't very interesting or have any real contribution to the plot. And I could agree with you, but I find that his character on multiple occasions redeems himself and really starts to improve in the latter half.\\n\r\n- Many could agree that Ranta is the worst character in the show by a landslide. I would beg to differ, simply because the character has a lot more depth than what is shown on the surface. He's essentially a male tsundere, a very persistent one at that. Although he constantly makes fun of his group members, has a massive ego, and is generally a dick to everyone, it becomes increasingly evident that he genuinely cares about his friends but is simply too embarrassed to show it.\\n\r\n- Shihoru is a short, well endowed mage girl that is very shy and even more quiet and soft spoken than Moguzo. She seemed to be a somewhat hopeless and unorganized character at first, which was particularly evident in battle. Like all the other characters, she improves and opens up little by little to the group as the plot continued, which was rewarding to see through. I found her to be uninteresting as a whole but grew to like her much like I did with Moguzo.\\n\r\n- Yume is a great character that's aloof and lovable. She brings a sense of peace and relaxed attitude to the group when they're not in battle, and proves to be a valuable teammate when focused. She cares about her group members, which she makes evident quickly, and bonds with Shihoru as they are the only two female party members at the beginning of the show. \\n\r\n- Mary is a character that's not introduced before later on but quickly joins the main cast as she becomes a necessity. She's cold, distant, and just flat out mean when she joins the party at the start, but inevitably warms up as the plot reaches it's conclusion. I think she's a great character and develops at a realistic pace, which is evident by the lack of clear \"bonding\" situations that other anime use.\\n\r\nWithout having seen the show, it's difficult to imagine the kind of relationship these characters would have, which is why you'd need to watch it in order to understand that there's a real layer of realism and just general human quality that can be appreciated here.\\n\\n\r\n(9/10) The conclusion was done well. It left with a satisfying and relatively conclusive note, while leaving the show very open for a second season. Considering there is a large amount of source material to go through, I'd say that a second season is very much welcomed and wouldn't harm the show at any stretch. As for my overall enjoyment of the anime, I finished it having been thoroughly entertained by each episode, even the slow moving ones because I really loved the characters and their growing bonds and relationships, how they dealt with tragedy and desperation, and eventually how they learned to accept hardships and found ways to overcome them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that you definitely need to check this one out if you're a fantasy/action fan that enjoys a large amount of character building and deviation from the mainstream fantasy RPG style shows. In contrast with other popular fantasy anime, namely KonoSuba which was currently airing at the same time that Grimgar was, it has a much more serious tone that is easily appreciated when you need your fix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was a pleasant surprise. What started off as a generic RPG turned out into something more realistic and beautiful. It tackled on things that most RPG won't even delve into that much or worse, glossed over. And that's why I truly appreciate this anime. \r\nAt first, I seriously thought that it will be just like any other trapped-in-a-game story out there. Well, most cases, it is. But don't let that dissuade you from watching this anime. This is more than that. What makes it different from the others is the way they tackled character death and how it's relevant toeach of their character developments especially the main protagonist. It honestly reminds me of Zetsuen no Tempest regarding this matter. Now, I'll leave it at that since I don't want to give out spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really beautiful. It had a soft watercolor feel to it that made everything feels so serene and captivating. This is honestly the first time I saw such an art style in an anime before. I found myself admiring a lot of scenic views and I just can't get enough of its art style. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some times that the animation looks a bit off but they were just very minor. An example would be is that for a few seconds the characters were just standing there and I'd wonder why did it stop then after a while, the characters would move again. Again, very minor and it didn't affect the overall quality for me. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that most people don't like the OST but I couldn't find the reason why they dislike it. In my opinion, the OST is really good. I do admit that at times it felt totally random like the director spontaneously just decided to add a song in that scene hoping for added effect but overall the music fits the story. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story, it started off painstakingly slow. The pacing was almost similar to Katekyo Hitman Reborn where it took twenty or twenty something episodes before it got interesting. In this anime's case, it took seven episodes before it finally caught my attention. \\n\\n\r\nThe first seven episodes were a bore and I disliked the fanservice too. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot of times and muttering \"weak\" or \"lame\" over and over again as I looked at the characters -- which was a bad sign. I honestly thought of dropping it because it's too ordinary for my taste. Hence why I first rated this anime as 5/10. BUT at the later episodes, and I mean LATER episodes (caps lock for emphasis), the pace finally picked up, only a few fanservice scenes (almost none to be honest since the anime focused more on plot development); and from a small stun grenade, it turned into huge fireworks that it left me wanting for more. It really redeemed itself in the end thus from 5, the rating changed to 9. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, well I'm attached to all of them especially Manato. God knows how much I love that guy. I really enjoyed being in the same party as they are as they explored this new world. I have also already established my ships and when there were subtle sweet moments, it makes me squeal and really happy. The character developments for some characters were just brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a really good anime to watch especially for those who are a fan of the RPG genre. It doesn't seem interesting at first especially during the first half but don't let that discourage you. In the second half, the story finally takes a turn and gets better and better that'll leave you wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "Within the world of fantasy, with its magic and goblins and heroes and lore, is another world -- the world of the people who live in it day by day, who struggle to survive and fight to not only live, but belong. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a story about six people in this world within a world. This group of people is dropped into a life or death situation and as they survive and grow, we get to see how they adjust to killing for a living, work with people who are very different, deal with massive loss, and much more.\r\nI really enjoyedthis anime because the characters were relatable both in their strengths and (painfully) in their weaknesses. It was remarkable how frustrating the situations were in this anime. It reminded me of how frustrating my own life can be. But struggling through the difficulties with the characters really endeared them to me. It also made the happier, lighter moments all the more bright.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hai to Gensou no Grimgar inspires me to overcome my own weaknesses and to work together with others in the journey of life. \\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Good. There were relatively few events in this anime. It's especially slow in the beginning, though I believe this was done purposefully so that the viewer could experience first-hand the characters' frustrations. I'm actually not sure more plot points could have been added without detracting from the character development of the story. Although it could be said that character progress is a kind of plot, I feel like we'd be double-counting in this case.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Great! I love the watercolor feel of the visuals. It's softer, less precise, almost like a dream. A good match for the fantasy/warm-fuzzy feeling of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good. Music definitely enhanced the anime in both the action and calm scenes. The OP and ED was good too. Nothing spectacular, though, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Outstanding! Really. Stands out from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Great! Highly recommended.",

But this managed to keep me interested in the storyline and not wonder about the obvious trivial questions which were unanswered till the end.\r\nI really loved the hint of romance between Mary and Haruhiro,it seemed very subtle and not overly expressed or accelerated. The story develops faster than you would want it to, I personally would have loved for it to be a 25 episode anime, really i wanted to enjoy more but the ending was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nWe always want the animes to end in our own specific ways in which it would be happier or the pairs we wanted would get together , but that would rule out the possibilties, as much as I hate that, I also admire the way in which they leave out for us to complete on our own.\\n\\n\r\nIn the fair sense it does have some drawbacks which I would not rather point out.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole the series presents a refreshing adaptation, and sure to be one you'll enjoy, but as i have found it has not gotten the recognition or attention it clearly deserves, just a clue that not all low rated anime are as bad as they are depicted.",

            "content": "The story is simple and straightforward: a group of people get transferred into an MMO-like world where they spend their time killing monsters. The only way Grimgar stands out from other similar shows is  is that it is darker and more realistic. Every fight is a struggle, and there's a very real possibility of death.\r\nThe problem is, whoever wrote this forgot to provide a compelling reason for the characters to risk their lives every day. At first, they do it to survive, but later on the party keeps grinding mobs just because that's what you normally do in an MMO. \r\nNo one cares aboutreturning to the previous world, or protecting their current one from some great danger. (In fact, we never learn much about the world of Grimgar at all.) It's like the characters have no motivations and just go with the flow. That wouldn't be so bad if this was a comedy, but because Grimgar tries to be serious, it's difficult for me to care about the characters' plight.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed the show; it has good fight scenes and downright gorgeous background art. If it wasn't for the incongruity between its serious tone and blatantly MMO-like mindset, I'd have rated it higher.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, or Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash isn't your typical \"trapped in a game\" anime. Behind the magic, combat and fantasy of Grimgar lies the simple everyday struggle to survive and adapt that other anime of similar genre neglect or skim over. Those who immerse themselves in this slower paced anime and pay attention to minute details will find a complex and thoughtful work of art that is Grimgar.\r\nSTORY\r\nI can write ten pages about this. I'll keep it as short as I can.\r\nWhile other anime of similar genre focus on a main character becoming the best/strongest/smartest player out there (e.g. SAO,Log Horizon), this one takes the other direction, and focuses on the underdogs.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Grimgar's main criticisms is that the plot doesn't move fast enough. It's a valid complaint, and I can see why some people would be put off by it. However, I personally enjoy taking my time and being immersed in the atmosphere of the world of Grimgar, and it's refreshing to be able to do this without having the plot constantly at the forefront of the episode the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few continuity flaws, but the story is largely consistent and believable. In addition, the pace picked up considerably near the end in order to wrap up the season due to its 12 episode length. Whoever made this design decision needs to rethink their priorities, as an anime at such a slow pace coupled a short 1-cour season can never go well together.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe watercolour art is superb, almost to the point where I find myself calling almost each scene in Grimgar a visual masterpiece. There is a lot of detail and foreshadowing behind the art, complementing well with the story and character development.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNot much to say for this one. The soundtrack is amazing, and fits the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nA lot of emphasis is placed on character development in Grimgar. Each character is filled with personality, intrigue, strengths and flaws, and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar make an effort to show this, whether it be their hobbies, recreation, their likes/dislikes, their feelings etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is very closely tied into the story, making Hai to Gensou no Grimgar not unlike the animes in the Slice of Life genre. This is not necessarily a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I did find the characters' personalities hard to believe at times. Ranta, for example, should've been put in his place a lot more often. Shihoru, while not as bad, sometimes lacked reason behind his judgement. This is, of course my personal opinion and other people will probably think otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nDespite some continuity flaws and a couple unrealistic characterisation, I largely enjoyed Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not everyone's anime. If you enjoy instant gratification, action scenes and more traditional shounen anime, you probably won't like this. But if you're willing to take the time to immerse yourself and notice the finer details, this is a gem that you will appreciate.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "With the anime ending today, I couldn't help but want to write a review for this masterpiece. Everything is 10/10.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is an anime adapted from the LN. It's about a number of people awakening into a fantasy type world, not remembering anything but their names. The strange red moon didn't help their uneasiness either. The rest of the synopsis speaks for itself.\r\nHowever, as stated, the leftover team that was formed couldn't even defeat the weakest of monsters. Adapting to the world they were living in was a struggle as well.\r\nBut that's what's so great about this anime. This anime greatly displaysrealistic interactions, the differences of each character, their strengths and weaknesses, etc. They take each character at the beginning and show you what they're like, then throughout the series you gradually see them improve and by the end they're a whole new person.\\n\\n\r\nIt shows that not everyone agrees with each other, has a different view on things, and some may not like others. They're not going to be crazy strong in the beginning. They're not going to go along with everything.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this anime displays is that not everyone survives. I'm not going to go into detail about that since it would be a spoiler, but as I've kept saying so far, the great thing about this gem is that it's so realistic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you don't like slow-paced stories and would suit in for something more like SAO where the MC is overpowered in the beginning for no reason, then this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for everyone that keeps saying that there is no ''point'' in this anime, well of course they're not going to have any sort of goal in the beginning. Their goals are thought of later on as they perserve through the world of Grimgar.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about this anime is the fights. It's not just them fucking people up for no reason. Each fight tells the ups and downs and the characters train of thought on how to deal with it, along with how they feel throughout the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. In episode 11, the music was one of the things that got me so hyped besides what was happening. The music is fitting in this anime and goes along well with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is quite enjoyable if you don't like bullshit reasoning and like slow-paced anime where the characters aren't some OP bad ass, but rather a human being that's trying their best to adapt after being thrown into a world with no memories of where they previously were, and how they deal with it along with what's to come and improve throughout it all.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10. My favorite is Ranta, despite everyone hating his guts. xD But Ranta is one of the greatest characters that has a number of flaws, but well written.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: OUT OF THIS WORLD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Do I really have to state this? This anime is a masterpiece, that's all I'm gonna say.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning when the anime hadn't aired yet, I wasn't expecting much. \\n\r\nIt seemed cool and I decided to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI don't regret my decision at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this anime, it's inspired me to make more realistic characters and unique plots.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is both an inspiration and a masterpiece. I hope others enjoy it as well.",

            "content": "Boring. No other word encompasses the entirety of Grimgar than this word, a show that is incredibly slow, full of dull characters, lacks any interesting world or mechanical exploration, and brings up nothing new in the MMORPG anime genre. It's quite unfortunate as the trailers and first impressions of the anime advertised the opposite.\r\nGrimgar's story is the same as the other \u201ctrapped in an MMO\u201d plotline that follows. A number of people are brought to the world of Grimgar with no memories of their previous lives and they are brought forward to become adventures to survive. The story promptly ends there as Grimgar then focuseson a party of characters, how they interact with one another, and how they cope with their sudden thrust in to hunting monsters to make a living. Unlike other shows that try to focus on a plot, game mechanics, and the world, Grimgar instead chooses to focus on the main characters and how the harshness of being thrown in to something you have no knowledge about.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea is fine. There is no problem with the direction that Grimgar attempts to go. The reason why the focus falls apart is because the characters are excruciatingly plain and boring. The main characters have no defining personalities. They lack any depth to their characters. Even halfway in to the show I can barely explain a character to someone who asks me about main cast. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cHey, can you tell me about that mage girl?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cErr... Well, she's kind of shy. And uhh... Umm... Her name is Shihoru.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cOkay, what about the the large guy with the big sword?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cHe's a warrior. He uhh... doesn't talk much. And I guess he likes to carve wood.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cWell this is lousy. What about the MC? You should be able to tell me something about him right?\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cErr... He... Uhhh... is the MC. Yeah.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are like white paint drying on a wall. Even as tragedies befall them and they cry to show some semblance of emotion, you end up not caring for them nor do you really empathize. When they speak the dialogue that follows is a jumble of generic interactions. Even Ranta, the character that is suppose to be the loud high-energy guy with his perverted jokes and shouts ends up just being another obnoxious character you can't care for. The few words or tropes you can ascribe to them, and the few character development they go through are marked by cliches. I could go to a local coffee shop and listen in on to two people and their conversation would be more interesting than this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe core problem of Grimgar is that it fails in what it tries and forgets about everything else. The story abruptly ends in the first episode, the skill system and game mechanics are only ever briefly mentioned, the characters never go out of the town they reside in and fight goblins for half of the show. The only praise that I can give Grimgar is the first party encounter against a goblin where the fight is executed well and manages to convey the difficulty of trying to kill a living being just to steal its loot. After that the show takes a beeline in to snoozesfill. \\n",

            "content": "Myanimelist won't let me shove this entire show in a couple of sentences, so, i'll be as brief as I can.\r\nThe story is okay, starts off slow and makes you think the show is going to be terrible and then starts rapidly throwing you emotional scenes and dialogue out of nowhere making you interested. Then slows down again and picks back up. This process repeats itself multiple times. If you can't stand that, don't bother with this anime. There's no real end-goal or quest, and kind of wants you to take it as it is. But due to the ending, there's a lot of openquestions and some things aren't wrapped up. Namely the entire beginning premise of the show hasn't been addressed. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is kind of inconsistent. It tries to go with an untraditional art style for the background only to sometimes forget itself. It doesn't come off as overwhelming or nice to look at at times, despite what the producers probably thought when making it. It just leaves an \"Eh,\" impression. Nothing special apart from looking slightly different background wise. And even then, the high-motion scenes are certainly interesting, but don't come off as amazing when compared to even some other shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is debatable, for a couple of reasons. And this ties into story a bit. This show LOVES, montages, and I don't mean just \"love\", I mean it will lick the sound bytes off the floor just to put one together and get its fix. While the songs were pretty nice to listen to, when there's a montage or two EVERY EPISODE when someone or something dies or they have an emotional moment, it gets insanely repetitive and kind of forced. Hell, they even sometimes play for 3-4 minutes of straight montages, that's forever in anime time considering they could be progressing in the story through dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are kind of cut and paste. None of them are noteworthy but three who have gone through a bit of development. Those three went from misunderstood or whiny little kids, into pretty recognizable characters. But its hard to say I will remember any of them after about a year after watching. They just don't stand out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say I enjoyed the show. The show definitely shined in some areas, especially presenting the life of monsters and what they will do to defend themselves. They use it as a way to establish an emotional connection to their actions and the actions are definitely conveyed to the viewer. It definitely helps give some variety and life in the world the show presents. And compared to other anime, it uses the monsters as somewhat of a moral \"wall\" rather than a physical one that the protagonist just has to mow through (looking at you Sword Art Online).\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It makes sense, given that they were pulled into this world for some reason, but it tends to become easily predictable and formulaic.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash), which aired in January of 2016, is different in that it follows the ordinary young men and women that end up trapped in their world, without the skills or anything special goingfor them (in the beginning at least). The grounded setting that follows their daily life as they work to make a living has made it one of my favorite anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nThe foundation of the story is your stock and standard \u201ctrapped-in-another-world\u201d plot that is all too common. However, in this case the time-tested foundation is used to build a rather solid and intriguing story that explores how ordinary people would slowly adapt to their setting by showing us just how glamorous that sort of life is if you only have ten silvers to your name, a week of training under a guild, and no way to return home, in a more cynical setting without getting too grim-dark.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is fairly firmly set in a fantasy world, it\u2019s even in the name of the show. However, unlike most shows of this nature, it does a fantastic job of establishing early on that life is rather hard for those that live in it. The people aren\u2019t exactly friendly and virtually everything costs money, meaning that if you want to live you have to work.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unabashedly human in how they behave. They\u2019re not just archetypes that spout out heroic lines and do things for the sake of justice. They do what they have to in order to live, while sharing different opinions on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid, watercolor backgrounds, the fight scenes are done quite well when they don\u2019t just show a still of the characters performing a technique and giving a lecture on it in the narration, and you can feel just how clumsy they are at first. There are some scenes that could be better, but it\u2019s nothing horrible. And the music carries the tone of the show, a somber tune during the depressing moment and a placid tone during their valued downtime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Grimgar is a Fantasy anime that has many things that I love. It is a story with a rather simple and narrow plot, people who land in a new world and adapt to it over the course of a few months. The wheels that turn the world, overarching debates on morals, and grand battles are left out of the equations to give it a more grounded exploration of these characters and the immediate setting they live in, but doesn\u2019t shy away from the very real, very human consequences of their mistakes and actions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve got a free day, go out and watch it where you can.",

            "content": "This anime is one of those animes where it always motivates you to continue watching. \r\nGrimgar's plot/concept is rather different from other animes where the MC get's transported to a different world. Why? That's because this anime isn't about trying to get out of that world but how the characters adapt and bond with other people. Yes, at first the characters are trying to understand why they are here but later on, they've come to peace with it (but still trying to survive and \"level up). So if you are watching this anime, to truly enjoy it, focus on the action still but also focuson the character relationships and family.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar's art style is by far amazing and unique. It makes you feel calm and relaxed as it has a sort of brush/painting style. The monsters are drawn to give you an evil feel but not too intense which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well thought of too. How they adapt and experience new situations is unique to each character. Although none of the MC's knew each other before they appeared in the magical world, they came together to live as a new family and how they interact with one another is truly amazing. Throughout this anime, the MCs are still weak and only improved a bit in terms of combat but when it comes to spiritual and mentalism, they've certainly come a long way and evolved.\\n\\n\r\nBut no anime is perfect, there are some flaws in this anime. I felt like this anime needed to better show romance. There are many moments where slight romance is present but like many people, once they've seen romance in a story they want to see that romance evolve but in this anime, it stayed the same and it felt as it just got tucked away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to anyone as this anime is truly unique. The characters are well thought of, the story is similar to other animes but still different and the art will blow you away.",

            "content": "\"I pity the fool...\"\r\nThis quote encapsulates everything Grimgar is about. It's a poor attempt at engaging an audience with oversaturated \"emotions.\" Anime as a medium is known to depict emotions that otherwise would be impossible in live action series or tv shows. It's through the artwork and animation that gets through to the viewer, not overly dense scenes. Dense is somewhat of an understatement for this series, as EVERY scene seems to take AGES for it to progress because a group of what I assume to be adults can't move on from a certain scene. It's incredibly cumbersome to have everything revolve around this onescene and doesn't improve the characters or the story. Actually it stagnates the story while keeping the characters as bland as ever. There are some ill advised scenes too, that are so boring to watch that you may finish a game of solitaire before the scene comes back to characters interacting. An incredibly poor attempt at creating a mellow atmosphere and setting. Pity is a strong word for this series, mainly because if the viewer either feels this or doesn't will change everything. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the many problems with Grimgar is it's point of origin. Y'know it's common for MMORPG settings for anime to create a how and why for characters in a brand new world. Here everything is wonky and decides we're here because. Cool? Then it decides to have INCREDIBLY slow pacing. Scenes that are meant to develop the world e.g boring music playing in a slide show do not develop it. Showing different parts of the city doesn't help with knowing what it is sorry to break it to ya A-1. While the story moves on slowly, so do the characters. Grimgar has the slowest first two episodes I've seen to date. Unfortunately, the main cast of characters can't seem to move along the story because every interaction is one looking at another for 20 seconds thinking about what to say, and then \"never mind.\" \\n\\n\r\nAs if the story couldn't be slower, one scene comes through and everything falls apart from there. Characters become awkward and stiff, interactions are at a standstill, story goes nowhere, and all the viewer can do is either pity the characters or shrug it off. Whether you fall into one or the other will determine how you feel about the series in general. The show tries to hard to get the viewer to make you feel some type a way. To center the story around emotions is NOT how you grab and maintain a viewer's attention. To make it worse, the introduction of a character increases the slow pacing, with trying to you guessed it, create a sad backstory that makes us pity the character. There really is no plot so to speak, more like separate character arcs that take time to solve. Time is Grimgar's biggest enemy, and I mean it's allocated time to certain scenes, certain arcs, and the uneven screen time of it's main cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface level, the characters of Grimgar have good characterization and distinct personalities, but the way they mesh together is awful. I mean there is a hole between the male and females that they can't even interact with each other because their some uncomfortable. \"but it's realistic\" may seem like an argument for this, but when the story takes itself seriously with the kill or be killed aspect of the world, having these failing relations is not very feasible in these circumstances. But anime fans are weird, whenever heart wrenching scenes happen, they eat it up and claim that the respective anime is great. These poor character relationships continue until the very end of the show, so expect a lot of arguing, disagreeing and trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Everyone has a chip in their shoulder and everything comes back to \"the scene.\" Ultimately, characters depend far too much on one character and everything is stagnant until the final arc, where the characters take a 180 degree turn in terms of resolve and personality. Essentially, the pacing is the issue which hinder the characters from being good.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, action scenes aren't so abundant but they are nice choreographed and smooth. Transitions are good, settings are vibrant, gore is okay, and they add to the tension whenever there is. More often than not, there was no music playing but when there was it's okay. Nothing good, nothing bad per se but again, there were lackluster scenes with just music playing that tried to create a calm atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar was a boring watch. It didn't have anything going for it besides a few characters and it was a mix bag even then. One could argue half the cast is good, the whole cast is good or bad, but ultimately the stagnant nature of the story and characters creates no attachment to them. Their dependence on one character stopped them from passing the threshold of good. Emotions also doesn't make a show good, it's okay to make the viewers feel bad for the characters, but doing it the point where it stunts the growth of them is a poor way to handle them. Deus Ex Machina doesn't help the show either. It may have been foreshadowed, but it was a weak attempt at it and the conclusion was ultimately a let down. It's just another one of the \"MC is super awesome\" moments where apparently the conflict is solved due to some BS nature of the MC. Overall, I didn't feel any pity towards the characters due to their lackluster interactions and thought process, none towards the \"sad\" story of Grimgar, and none towards whoever likes this.",

            "content": "Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions\r\nGrimgar. Is it good, is it bad, is it just ok? For starters, this is one of those \u2018transported to another world\u2019 shows. This one is quite unique, however. Chances are high that you\u2019re interested, so read on if the idea of a dark fantasy/video game world show doesn\u2019t immediately turn you off. \r\nVISUALS [ 8/10 ]\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever imagined what modern anime would look like in its final form, say hello to Grimgar. The art direction presented here is mostly unspecial, character designs are hit or miss, and the overall style isn\u2019t anything you haven\u2019t seen ten times before. What isunique is how far the animators run with it. Grimgar is a damn good looking show - no criticism whatsoever of the talent that brought this show to life. That said, that talent goes to waste on unimpressive character designs, particularly in the clothing. Armor and weapon designs alike are neglected heavily in this show, and the soft, unimposed designs conflict with the incredible talent of their animators, moreover. The characters themselves, while not particularly standout, work well with the narrative. These are trainee soldiers, not heroes tearing it up on the main battlefield. \\n\r\nHere\u2019s where most of the points come from - the background art. Grimgar has some serious world building, with very much impressive watercolor and pastel artwork backing up every scene. Grimgar is one seriously beautiful place, with moody, vivid colors and soft, organic lines guiding your eyes all around the screen. If you can tolerate the show\u2019s shortcomings, the beautiful still artwork alone is worth your time. \\n\r\nAlso notable are fights, which so often get neglected by critics of the show. Fight scenes are solid, and have a natural, breathing motion about them that less talented animators and directors couldn\u2019t pull off. Every action flows into the next, with very little padding for idle chit chat. While they\u2019re not the best fights I\u2019ve seen, we are certainly presented with competent and well choreographed scenes that action junkies like myself should enjoy without issue.\\n\\n\r\nSETTING [ 9/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nWorld building and atmosphere are the two reasons you\u2019re watching this show, and if they aren\u2019t now, they will be later. By the time its finished, Grimgar feels so fleshed out that it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve actually been there. All of it is communicated visually as well, although the first couple of episodes try to explain a bunch of exposition to you anyways. \\n\r\nRustic scenery dominates most of the screentime, with several other adventuring environments featured over time. You\u2019ll wish this was a video game by the end of show, just so you could soak in all the scenery at your leisure. Characterization of side characters is mostly good, too, which is a nice touch to an already fantastic setting. Dark fantasy fans will have a good time with this show, no doubt. \\n\\n\r\nPLOT [ 7/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThe tale being presented here isn\u2019t bad at all, but nor is it particularly memorable. A lot of the screen time in Grimgar is spent on the background art alone. No complaints here, but that does leave less time for plot progression, and in a 12 episode show, that\u2019s a big hit. With only three story arcs, memorable moments are few and far between. Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions is one of those \u2018It\u2019s about the journey, and not the destination\u2019 shows, so come into it mentally prepared for a slow build up to one of the main events. \\n\r\nWhat we\u2019re presented with here is pretty much a generic rags to riches story, with lots of melodrama to shake things up during the less action-packed moments. For better or worse, this anime is a pretty accurate depiction of a bunch of teenagers running around with very little in the way of reasonable advice. These scenes can be pretty hit or miss, as the quips exchanged between characters, however believable, are frequently annoying. \\n\r\nBroadly speaking the story is surprisingly well written. That said, it\u2019s not for everyone. There are several unexplained plot points, and a couple of minor plot holes at the very beginning. Grimgar is very much a \u2018Go read the novels\u2019 anime. There are the three story arcs and then that\u2019s it - you\u2019re done. Like many shows of its type, there\u2019s no definitive ending this time either. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS [ 8/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface what appears insignificant is sometimes much more when observed under a lens. In the case of Grimgar, the character designs pale in comparison to the beautiful watercolor artwork that takes up most of the screen. To my surprise, not only is the character writing decent, but the designs also turned out to fit into the story pretty well by the end. \\n\r\nFor starters, we have Haruhiro. This sonovagun looks like a harem protagonist who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Moreover, he is actually made fun of for this reason - a nice little touch of self awareness on behalf of the show. Next up is Manato, who comes off as the mature college student of the group. He\u2019s an appreciative and all around nice guy, and ends up taking the leadership role. Ranta is the hothead, who completely lacks any sociability and instead clashes with others as much as humanly possible. I found him particularly annoying, but that\u2019s probably just from personal experience. Last of the bros is Moguzo, the gentle giant and artisan of the group. His characterization is some of the best in the show, although I suppose it had to be, given that he doesn\u2019t get enough screen time. \\n\r\nOn to the ladies. Yume is the warm hearted and lovable idiot of the group. For me she was endearing and sweet, if a little lacking in common sense. Some of you might find a splash of autism in there, though, so be aware of her low mental capacity in advance. Next we have Shihoru, who is the shy, gentle girl that see from time to time in anime. She also has the D cup that comes standard with seemly every anime, and wears form-fitting clothing. This is my biggest complaint regarding the main cast. Her clothing makes no sense, given her extreme modesty. Hopefully your suspension of disbelief isn\u2019t strained like mine was. Other than that, Shihoru honestly comes off as a fairly boring, if admittedly cute, character. You will either be inspired by her determination, or you won\u2019t care at all. Finally we have Marie, who shows up later on. She\u2019s a no-nonsense hardass who seems cold and uncaring at first. Thankfully she warms up over time and isn\u2019t a total bitch forever. She\u2019s also the most important character thematically, as her story is both plot relevant and deeply interesting. \\n\r\nAs good as the writing in this show is, I\u2019m conflicted. I like the show more for its characterization than I do for the actual characters themselves. Everybody has their moments, but I honestly can\u2019t say I really like any one character notably more the others. The most interesting part is watching them all interact, in a character study sort of way. Individually they\u2019re all just people, like any other volunteer soldiers or hunters you might find in the world of Grimgar. When you group them all together, on the other hand, suddenly you have the makings a pretty good cast. \\n\\n\r\nPACING AND PRODUCTION [ 6/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nAs someone very sensitive to pacing, this was by far the worst part of the show. Contained within individual episodes, the pacing is fine. However, the series as a whole is very rough around the edges. The pacing seems to change nearly every episode, as if the production team was trying all sorts of different speeds but never found their stride. \\n\r\nThere are also several moments where the overall production took a noticeable dip. Most of the time you won\u2019t notice these brief budget dips, but in a show like Grimgar, where the artwork is half the appeal, you most certainly notice when the show is suddenly barely animated. \\n\r\nSadly, just like many other shows by A1 Pictures, Grimgar has the same issues. The show as a whole feels like it was cobbled together by many many different hands, rather than by a unified team. Beautiful still art in the OP and ED contrasts poorly with the not nearly as impressive animation. Some scenes are just straight up better than others, and even dialogue has peaks and valleys, with some conversations coming off as deep and meaningful, while others, the super depressing scenes in particular, seem like more of a step back in quality. While nothing you\u2019ll find here strikes a particularly harsh blow to the overall viewing experience, all these minor issues add up and it starts to feel like a lot of opportunities were wasted here that could have been used to make Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions a nine out of ten instead of a seven. \\n\r\nBriefly, the score - I don\u2019t remember it at all, so it was neither bad nor good. At the very least, the music was fitting and didn\u2019t intrude on my viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nEverything Else\\n\r\nPersonal Score [ 8/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThis was definitely a show that pleasantly surprised me. We\u2019ve arrived at the spoiler section of the review, so if you\u2019re still reading after all that, go watch the show. For better or worse it\u2019ll be a good watch for you. \\n\r\nFirst topic that needs addressing: the genre that Grimgar is a part of. This was supposed to be an isekai show. Not sure if I\u2019m spelling that correctly, but that\u2019s weeb for \u2018transported to another world\u2019 show. Yeeeah, about that... Grimgar has almost none of those elements. There\u2019s a mysterious \u201cOh no, we\u2019ve somehow been transported here\u201d subplot throughout the show, but it\u2019s never elaborated on and ends up being a bit of an open ended plothole by the end of the show. I imagine that this all made sense in the novel, and that it just got screwed up in production. And that is but one of Grimgar\u2019s many quirks. Taking into account all the other weird quirks, like the ridiculously good still art, the hyper dramatic \u2018cry porn\u2019 scenes and the unexpectedly good action, and this is one of the most memorable anime I\u2019ve ever seen to date. \\n\r\nHaving seen both dubbed and subbed versions of the show, I can safely say that the FUNimation dub is quite a bit better. This is mainly because the japanese cast gave a pretty mediocre performance. Neither is bad though, so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have access to the dub. \\n\r\nAlso notable are the previously mentioned cry porn scenes. There are several moments in Grimgar that can only be described as soul-crushingly depressing. These are the scenes that play up the drama to eleven, and were emotionally painful even the second time through. To the show\u2019s credit, these weren\u2019t necessarily unrealistic or bad portrayals of tragedy: they were just extremely painful to watch. Be prepared for maximum human drama, but don\u2019t worry - these scenes are few and far between and didn\u2019t break the show for me by any stretch. \\n\r\nThe reason to watch Grimgar is for the intrigue. If you don\u2019t like pretty artwork then this anime might not do it for you, but it\u2019s worth watching because of just how unique it really is. I personally really enjoyed the show for the most part, although it definitely has its flaws, hence the lower score. I\u2019d say this is a great show for new anime fans. Grimgar has a little bit of everything, and gives you something else to look at if you\u2019re not super interested in the plot. Don\u2019t let Grimgar\u2019s black sheep reputation stop you from watching, because you just might find yourself rooting for the underdog. So yeah, pass this one around. That\u2019s about all I\u2019ve got to say, so onwards to the final score. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [ 7/10 ]\\n\r\nTL;DR-\\n\r\n-Impressive visuals and awe-inspiring background art\\n\r\n-Realistic, if a bit annoying, dialogue\\n\r\n-Superb world building\\n\r\n-Interesting cast\\n\r\n-Rough overall pacing\\n\r\n-Occasional budget drops\\n\r\n-Character designs aren\u2019t memorable\\n\r\n-Good action scenes\\n\r\n-Multiple minor plotholes\\n\r\n-No real ending\\n\r\n-Unique experience compared to others of its genre\\n\\n\r\nFor alternate recommendations, any good looking anime will do. Grimgar is similar to most of the great classic anime in that there\u2019s not really anything else like it out there. \\n\r\nIf you liked the show as a whole, try the original 1998 adaptation of Berserk if you haven\u2019t seen it already. Other unique and awesome looking shows include Death Parade, Psycho-Pass (only season 1) and the Break Blade movies, just to name a few. If you don\u2019t mind shows with lots of fanservice, Tenchi Muyo War on Geminar and Highschool of the Dead are both awesome. Finally, if you want to watch a good anime about video game worlds, you\u2019ll find none better than Log Horizon. \\n\r\nGood luck with your anime and consider giving Grimgar a shot, eh?",

However \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" doesn't do this. To be honest at first I felt it was so slow because of the level of excellence they were putting into the story build up. This is definitely a risk competing in the market of quick profitable 'B' grade animes with a lot of fan service. I guess I wasso conformed to this style of anime that I was at first bothered by the slow story line. \\n\\n\r\nAfter SAO Ive been pretty much watching every single RPG type anime. I do like the idea of certain ways of doing things, but by far I found this one the most original. It had the values of a RPG but it is within the setting of real life consequences. For example: typical RPG anime tends to get the main character OP, or they some how posses a ridiculous rare item or weapon of some sort which gives them an advantage. Also they are teamed with probably the strongest or unique individuals in the game. Everything is efficient, such as spoils you win from battle somehow goes straight to your invisible inventory. The beasts/ enemies you fight distribute no real consequences. In \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" you see non of that. Its like living a non-fictional concept in a fictional setting. Such as a single arrow can actually kill someone (which is relatively true in the real world). A sharp weapon is as strong as any cool looking rare legendary swords, meaning they can both kill. I also appreciated how they incorporated the level of reality in a daily persons life in this. For example, they portrayed the reality of providing food for the table takes work and effort. You have to go kill goblins or wild beasts. However the beast dont just die from a slash. They would start running away if they get scared or injured, thus you have the chance of loosing your bounty. Also they carry emotion and they too show the complex personality as any other individual creature and not a simple AI. They show hate, fear, horror, sorrow, joy, excitement and they too don't want to die! These all play into account to stimulate the complexity of life for the audience to contemplate as they are put in the lenses of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really enjoyed was how real relationship was portrayed in this anime. What I mean by this is that \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" really emphasize how hard it is working with real people and building relationships, just like it would be in the real world. Misunderstandings, assumptions, expectations, responsibilities, lack of character, personality types and there clashes, being introverted vs extraverted, being patient, when to speak when not to speak, believing the best for one another regardless the situation, the importance of clear and integral communication, the list goes on. It really showed the realness of hardship and the beauty of working with other people. \\n\\n\r\nA R T: 10/10\\n\r\nI believe Anime in general should be pleasing to the eye. What I mean by this is that anime in general should carry out the form of art that can not be manufactured in any other film hence we turn to Anime to receive this satisfaction. \"Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\" does just this with one of the most unique style of anime art I have seen. Its simply beautiful. Of course by no means I'm saying that it is THE best, because styles of art can differ in categories, such as Hayao Miyazaki works! However the quality of each background, character movements to the natural lightings sets this anime apart from many others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nO V E R A L L: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm giving 9.5 instead of a 10 is because the anime was so short. 12 episode is definitely not enough nor justice to the level of potential this anime carries. There is so much unanswered questions. Its almost just barely the tip of the iceberg. Still so much to unravel about the characters, about their purpose, about the RPG ...gosh I want to see it soon! please come out!",

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a rather interesting show about the struggle to get used to a life in an Isekai world. Contray to most Isekai, in Grimgar the characters send to the world are in no way strong, knowledgeable or have any other advantages given to them by some kind of divine being. They don`t even remember their life before waking up in that strange tower. Completely disorientated some of the new arrivals, are unsure how to deal with the situation and are unable to completely cope with the situation. Others get used to it quite quickly and soon become powerful in theirown right. But Grimgar does not focus on these guys. Grimgar focuses on the \"leftovers\" those, that were deemed weak or useless.\\n\r\n Haruhiro and the others do show from the very beginning very interesting character traits, especially in terms how their different character types influence their fights. As Ranta is rather reckless, he is usually the first to attack, often not coordinating with the other Party members. Shihorus shyness as well makes her fighting style more supportive and you can see how her shyness makes her prone for mistakes. This kind of problem can be seen for every character, may it be Yumes choice to become a Hunter, which does not fit with her actual abilities, or Moguzos problem to be a true frontline fighter in the very beginning. These problems of their character traits, as well as choices have a big influence in the fights, which makes these fights very interesting for me.\\n\r\n The characters itself are also another big reason why this anime became one of my all time favourites. Thought not all characters are completely fleshed out by now, they all have their unique personality and truly outgrow any stereotype they might have been in the beginning. especially Haruhiro is in my opinion an excellent character, whose negative outlook on life and pessimistic view is very believable and I can emphasize with him very much, due to having similiar character traits. He is basically pushed into a role, unfit for him, yet he tries his best to still keep the party together, which is a hard task especially for him. \\n\r\nThe way the characters dealt with grieve was in my opinion done perfectly in the series, as it truly shows to have an impact on them and their behaviour. \\n\r\nThe Art, is amazing, especially the background art perfectly resembles the mood of the situation and together with the sound works quite well to support the story. \\n\r\nAs this is a slow grow story, which has a rather slow pacing and a focus on character development, it completely suited my taste. \\n\r\nI loved the characters, the Art, the Sound and the story about coping with grieve and how everything was mixed perfectly with each other.\\n\r\nOf course, the story wasn`t perfect, the fanservice scenes did annoy me, and some characters stayed a bit blank. Yet for me these were all small factors compared to the overall enjoyment so it cleary is a 10/10 for me, as well as my all-time favourity #3",

They grow stronger gradually, not suddenly\r\n- Fantasy-themed storyline with real life consequence increase the tension of the story\r\n- Each character is weak alone, but together, they complement each other by doing their specific role while anime in general usually have a group of people withoutdistinctive role\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Need more explanation about the world and character's background\\n\r\n- Some people find this kind of anime to be boring\\n\r\n- The main focus of this anime is story. If you don't like an anime with slow-paced storyline and you prefer anime with cool and flashy battle scene, don't watch this anime. It might not suit your taste",

            "content": "I thought this anime was going to be like SAO, Log Horizon, Vanadis or some such. You know, like an RPGish anime with a fantasy setting? With lots of action, some laughs and some interesting background story.\r\nBut what I got instead was a day time soap opera masquerading as anime. \r\nNearly all the episodes in this anime revolves around these characters walking around and talking about their \"feelings\". I'm not kidding. You got one girl who cries all time, 2.5 people playing tsundere (1.5 too many) and a main character who's got a whinny 'woe is me attitude' all day long. \r\nAnother thing is thatthe characters are all pretty stupid. They're stupid in their social interactions (naive, no social skills), they're stupid as hell in battles (outsmarted by goblins, nuff said). They got no goals or plans. They don't even realise they've been press ganged as free border patrol soldiers, and are even willing to pay 40 silver for the privilege.... I could go on but you know what, nevermind! Basically they all suck. \\n\\n\r\nThe people here just don't have any of the qualities or abilities that typical protagonists should. Kirito or Glasses devil they are not. In fact the story can summed up as - a bunch of stupid small fries getting owned by the weakest generic mob - goblins, then spending the majority of the 12 episode anime crying about it. That's it. Does this sound like something you want to watch? No, at least it wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I should mention is the story. Or rather the total lack of it. In the beginning it seems all the characters was transported from the modern world into this fantasy setting world. Right that could be interesting.... But then it's never mentioned again. WTF is that all about huh? You might as well have them be born in the fantasy world to begin with! Then the characters just grind goblins til the end of the anime. Without any explanations or plot or anything. I mean seriously, that is probably the most half-assed story I've ever seen in an anime.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!\r\nWhen I first walked into this anime, I thought it was going to suck. I mean, it had everything to make me skeptical. It was by A-1 Pictures, it was a Light Novel adaptation, and it was a trapped in a video game story with a fantasy setting. We've seen dozens of these before and very few stood out to me as interesting or memorable, but to my surprise, Grimgar turned out to be one of my favorite anime of last year.\r\nStory: 8/10 The story is basic, yet effective. As I said before, this is a trapped in a video game storyinvolving 6 characters who don't even know each other waking up in a fantasy world remembering nothing but their names. Now, they must fight in order to survive in this fantasy setting. I would talk about the story more but it ties in to the other topics as well so this is all I can say for now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 I rarely give a 10 to any anime for any aspect, but I feel that this one truly deserves one when it comes to the art. Grimgar's art and animation is beautiful with great character designs, but the real icing on the cake is the world itself. Everything looks like it came straight out of a watercolor painting adding to the rich detail of the world of Grimgar as well as assisting with immersing you into it making you feel like you are really there with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 The characters are what makes this series truly shine. Each one is different and each one develops in some way, be it in their ways of thinking, overcoming their fears, or simply getting stronger through actual hard work instead of just getting a random power up for the sake of the plot to make them overpowered. Each character also has their own unique class, so each one can do something different in battle, and we actually see them take advantage of this by strategizing and letting each character know what their role will be in a battle. Haruhiro is a theif, Ranta is a knight who wants to do everything on his own, Yume is an archer, Shihoru is a mage, Moguzo is a tank with heavy armor and strength, and Manato is a priest or a healer. When Manato dies he is replaced with a girl named Merry who is more strict when it comes to healing, but has a tragic backstory that I wouldn't dare spoil for you here. What's great about these characters is that as I said before, they grow gradually and still have a heavy risk of danger in fights, even in the latter half of the series. They start out extremely weak, struggling to kill a simple goblin, so they train up and learn new skills, gradually and eventually are strong enough to kill goblins. This type of development goes on throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 From beginning to end, this series had me hooked. From the beautiful world, to the dynamic characters, this show never failed to keep me interested. It's worth noting that the story is very slow paced and some episodes just focus on characters doing their everyday routines while an insert song plays, and while I can see how someone would dislike this aspect of the series, I feel like it gives it a sense of realism. We get to see these characters struggling to fight enemies to collect money for resources to survive and we get to see these characters working hard to get stronger as they go. This also gives the show a great advantage in terms of world building, as we get to see the vast variety of environments that each of these characters explore, and as I said before, the beautiful watercolor art style helps the viewer get immersed into the world and makes you feel like you're right there with the characters. Another thing this series does right is tension. Too often in fantasy anime like this one, I see characters get super powerful to the point where they can beat anyone with ease and the whole appeal of the show is merely the fight choreography, but here, there's always a sense of danger with enemies that are way more powerful than the characters so they always have to enter a fight with caution and make sure they have a plan, otherwise, they could get killed. There are even some instances where the characters decide that they are not ready for a certain enemy type so after a tough battle, they leave, get better, and a few episodes later, come back to fight the same enemies. All in all, this series nails the survival aspect of it and truly feels realistic, rather than giving characters unfair advantages over the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10 Even after all of my praises, Grimgar still has some flaws. It was way too short, having only twelve episodes, and with a series as slow paced as this one, it at least needs 24. The story feels incomplete and I feel like certain characters have the opportunity to develop even more based on the final scene of the anime. Although I'm sure a season 2 can fix that problem. Unfortunately nothing has been confirmed about one. Also, in typical A-1 Pictures (or modern anime in general) fashion, there is some unneeded fan service here and there. Mainly coming from Yume, which kind of breaks the immersion and makes me feel like they just want to pander to the otakus, but other than that, this is one of the finest fantasy stories you'll find with a great sense of adventure, dynamic characters, actual tension, and fantastic world building.",

            "content": "Grimgar is, objectively, a pretty darn good anime to begin with and as it happens it hit all the right notes for me and really resonated with my personal taste, so for me this show was a treat, albeit an all too short one. \r\nArt-\r\nStarting my review with a strong and bold statement, Grimgar is one of the top 5 best looking anime I have ever seen. The art style is remarkable and gorgeous in a way I've not seen any other anime replicate. I wasn't sold on the visual style instantly- in fact, for the first couple of episodes I wasn't sure if Iliked it at all- but there are just too many scenes whether it's an overhead shot of the main city, a view of a forest in the background, the gorgeous and colorful field in which deceased characters are buried or just about any background or landscape shot in the entire show to not be awe struck by the beauty this show presents.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most lush and colorful shows I've ever seen and it was a treat to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good from all members of the main cast with the male lead, Haruhiro, while physically generic and cookie cutter, being a true standout among the voice performers. His English language actor, Ricco Fajardo, who I was admittedly unfamiliar with prior to this show, delivered a seriously excellent performance that I tip my cap to, speaking very clearly, adjusting his tone and emotions appropriately and having a likable, believable voice that fit his character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast, while not at the same absolutely nailed it level as Mr. Fajardo, definitely delivers the goods as well. Another strong performance came from Orion Pitts as Ranta, who is very much the opposite of Haruhiro, and the clearly intended contrast between these characters, coupled with strong voice acting from both, absolutely added a lot to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is above average and never bad but it does not stand out as strongly as the best parts of the show such as the art, the voice acting and the character development. The music as a whole, while independently pleasant, was probably overused. Not that they cycled the same 5 songs over and over again like some anime do but rather that they regularly had 5 ish minute cuts to music mid episode in a show that is on the short side to begin with, so it really eats into the time even though the music itself is perfectly fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nProbably my personal favorite part of the show (don't confuse FAVORITE with BEST- best is probably the art), I really loved the approach they took into the fairly overused and highly competitive trapped in a video game sub-genre in which a few particularly big fish reign supreme. Instead of focusing extremely heavily on combat and flashy action scenes like Sword Art Online or detailing every in-game mechanic, the in-game economy and putting a huge focus on trying to escape the game and go home, like Log Horizon, Grimgar opted to focus on the emotional toll and interpersonal hardships that would come with this situation if it were something that could actually happen. \\n\\n\r\nI was extremely impressed and pleased with seeing the characters having serious hesitations about harming or killing an in-game monster, even if it's necessary for them to do so in order to survive, even taking it to the point of making it clear that these creatures are, in fact, sentient and are afraid to fight and to die just as the humans are. That concept added far more emotional depth than the generic killing of pieces of data would have. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, I loved the pacing of the show, which was slow but in a relaxed way. It was never grueling or boring- it simply wasn't in any rush- and it made a point to take its time to develop its characters, which I also greatly appreciated. The character development in this show is leaps and bounds above what you typically get from a 12 episode anime in which you're lucky if the two or three most important characters are developed to even a passable extent.\\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe with the story is that the ending definitively felt to me more like a stopping point than an actual ending. It felt unfinished and like it was not intended to be finished right then and there. There is still so much more to see and do and so much more you can do with these characters and this world. It all seemed like a clear as day setup for a future Season 2. However, as of this writing, which is in March of 2019 (and keeping in mind that Grimgar came out in early 2016, three full years ago), I'm not aware of any second season on the horizon or even in development. This may, tragically, be all we ever get from this show and that would be hugely disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI loved the pacing, the emotion and character focused approach, the character development and of course the gorgeous visuals, so by and large I really enjoyed my viewing experience. Like I said, the ending felt like a stopping point as opposed to a proper ending, and this anime definitely could have used either more episodes or a second season, and I'm still hoping the latter will one day come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nI think, admittedly, I probably liked this show more than most people will and that's okay. It's visually beautiful, it's heavily character focused and it takes a new approach to a sub-genre that existed well before this show came to be. In my book, Grimgar hit all the right notes and is a short ride well worth taking for any fantasy or trapped in a video game anime fan.\\n\\n\r\n+Lush, gorgeous art style\\n\r\n+Very strong voice acting\\n\r\n+Great character development for a 12 episode show\\n\r\n+Emotional depth\\n\\n\r\n-Unfinished/incomplete\\n\r\n-Overuse of music- specifically lengthy musical scenes mid episode very frequently\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 8-8.5\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9",

            "content": "Knew it, called it! This anime is garbage and most of the time I like the anime I watch. Grimgar tries to copy Mushishi, Angel Beats, and other trapped and fight in some world anime like Sword Art Online, mix them together, and utterly fails. Here are the things.\r\nBoring......the interactions between the characters are horribly boring and unnatural. No introductions, no explanations. And anime is trying to be all Mushishi, exploring and living the wonders of this fantasy world when there is nothing special worth living about this fantasy world, your usual rivers, nature scenery, towns, and their life is on the line? What kindof mood setting is this?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters act like scared idiots when they out to hunt and it's being scared to a stupid level. Again, your life is on the line? I cannot sympathize with it, if you're gonna be that scared don't hunt, and sell all the nice gears and weps you somehow have, better yet sell off the girls for money, why not? hahaha. They couldn't even 7 vs. 1 a single goblin that bothered nobody without looking pathetic. Then when they get injured, like it matters, they have that magic healing spell......oh goody!\\n\\n\r\nTheir hunts ahead came with a certain tragic event that was bound to happen at their rate, but really just came with laughable cringey drama that sets them off to adapt into more drama idiots. The story tries to make us feel emotionally connected to the characters like Angel Beats, but I didn't feel a thing. The characters realize how much they need each other, stays boring and annoying with the added drama, and figures out how to slay some more goblins.\\n\\n\r\nThen it's back to paragraph 2 and repeat.....Rinse and repeat!\\n\\n\r\nUntil finally, they go and take on the wolf bosses. The action wasn't all that exciting and was underwhelming, but at least they break through and didn't break down even through trouble. The characters were weak though they gained a lot of skill, and it seemed they all got really lucky. Don't think the story even explained why they were trapped in that world. Where as Sword Art Online explained for its anime. Good for them they finally find home in Grimgar.....\\n\\n\r\nI was disappointed by Grimgar, the quality of the anime, story, character was pretty bad and failed to improve much. Their insert songs were just bad too. The art was the only thing acceptable as I find the looks of the girls Yume and Merry still acceptable and likeable to me.\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this anime, but what a waste that I couldn't like it. It's a bad anime, but the girls are really the most acceptable part.",

            "content": "I like this series quite a lot, it some things really well although it does have a few significant shortcomings.\r\nFirstly, the art is lovely, the pastel style is nice and really gives the show a fantastical feel. Now, the premise seems to be along the lines of SAO or .Hack/Sign although with some nice twists and for my money is probably the best of the genre (although I do have a soft spot for .hack). The characters are  varied and passably interesting, although there is an annoying one. The MC is surprisingly engaging given the type of show this is and he actually wrestleswith some meaningful personal struggles. Plus it avoids being haremy which just doesn't work for me in these shows. I also rather liked the slower pacing, it worked for the style of the show. My only criticism there is that the big twist in ep3 felt like it came a bit too soon, but it still worked okay.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main thing that annoyed me about this is what annoys me about so many LN adaptations and that is the fact that this isn't a whole story, it's 1/3 of a story. The show asks so many questions that it doesn't even begin to answer (and that would be fine if it was the point of the show, but it isn't). No, the reason everything is unanswered and this isn't a whole story is because it's a promo for the LN and this really irritates me. If you are going to adapt a property, then make the adaptation the best it can be, and give it an ending. I know people often rag on shows for having anime original endings, but I would much rather watch a complete story than a half finished one. I'll forgive it if there is a plan to follow up with a season 2, but here, like in so many cases that doesn't seem to be the plan. Grrrr. Rant over.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this was, apart from the fact that it just stopped, pretty solid. 6.5, rounded up to 7 (and if it had been 24 eps and told a whole story it probably would have scored higher)",

This anime based on novel, so its different than others. I watched it in 2016 after it finished and i gave 7 score. Then now, i just rewatched it 2 years after. It had wonderful story, art, sounds, characters. Then i changed score to 8. If they release 2nd, 3rd... seasons i'd probably give 9 or 10 for them. Ofc, they would finish it amazing story line. \r\nStory is so near to real. Several people come to Grimgar'sfantasy world.(Note: Grimgar is orc's territory in WoW. There's goblins, kobolds, orcs.... and more. They're stronger than human, ofc.)\\n\r\nIn this anime's story: Several people suddenly come fantasy world but they can't remember were they came from and why. After they found they came to where is, they build teams. After that they start adventures. Strong teams live as good. But in this history heroine team is lowest. They're 6 but they barely kill only one goblin. They'll become better but slower than any teams....\\n\\n\r\nToho animation made this anime into wonderful, warm lively. No other comment. You'll see.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty good. It gave me chills. Probably u'd like them.\\n\\n\r\nThere' s7 main characters. They've different sights. Some of them'd irate ur ass but later shows his good side. That cases good. I like them. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed but i want more.\\n\r\nYou better watch it. It is worth for watching.\\n\\n\r\nHope see u again at 2nd season of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, my pleasant surprise of the winter season; nice, thoughtful and... weird. It's hard to not make comparisons when we speak about an anime like this, but Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is, without any doubt, a good example of how SAO should have been: much more leisurely, natural and realistic. The peculiarity of the anime is, above all, the way it shows such a typical theme as adventures in a fantasy world (we have already seen it in lots of books, movies...). This time, it is focused on the process, the bad and good little moments, the progressive adaptation ina new and unknown world, the friendship, born by the need to survive, work together and  go to the dungeon  just because you need to earn some money to eat.\\n\r\nGrimgar is not trying to tell you about the adventures of a knight in epic battles facing legendary beasts; it aims to take you on the role of a group of teenagers: normal people, like us, dragged by force to an unknown world where they are forced to kill to survive, where adventure and fantasy became less important when you realized that, either a goblin or a human, you have to take another life to save yours. It's you or him, natural selection.\\n\r\nThe unpleasant feeling of cutting a bone, murdering asleep enemies in cold blood, the tension of a real battle in which you are aware that it might be the last one. Grimgar wants you to empathize with the characters, to identify yourself with them; it wants you to know how it feels to be in that situation. Its interest in the life and emotions of the main characters is, above adventure and action, what characterizes Grimgar.\\n\r\nI cannot finish without mentioning its artistic section, its drawings, its great animation, the watercolor-painted scenes, its limited but beautiful soundtrack used to present the different places... Grimgar is, above all, a beautiful and artistic anime, which uses its music and designs to create scenes that, sometimes, are just trying to make you think and stay gawking at the screen when there is nothing really happening; maybe that is its main fault and also its great virtue: its slow pace and the daily situations that can make some people get bored and some people get wonder. I am one of the latter.",

            "content": "Just a heads up, there may be some spoilers so read at your own discretion.\r\nHaving finished the series completely, I noticed that there were a lot of unfair treatment to this show. To answer some of the more common complaints; Yes, it was a slow show. Yes, the characters seem a bit generic, and Yes, this show is not as flashy as we'd all hope in this genre. Despite all of these, I knew from the start that this was a show that I could finally appreciate. Very seldom do we see a show that actually takes the point of view of an unwilling personsuddenly thrown into a completely different life style in a blink of an eye. If we compare it to say... Sword Art.. we have the main hero literally cutting through everything and just owning the scene. Here, our main character acted as if anyone one of us would if we were suddenly thrown into a \"fantasy\" world living a game-like life. I like that aspect of this show, taking the steps slowly to understand where they are and let their reality finally sink in (given the first few episodes were repeated grind on goblins). \\n\\n\r\nMany of us if not all, have played a MMO before, and we all know that in these games, there are parts where we have to grind out experience to level up. To finally have a show break down the actual parts of leveling up, I will have to admit, it does remind me of the hours I'd had to put in, in order to gain a skill or level up to access the next part of the world. The pacing in this show is slow, but it's slow because we see more or less the same thing over and over again. What I do appreciate, is the development of our characters as they become more comfortable with actually killing a living creature than what they felt from the start. I know for sure if I were suddenly forced to kill someone to live, I'd be taken aback slightly and would be hesitant. As the show went on, we actually do see the transition of what appears to be a person who has never experienced killing, or partaken in some sort of leadership role, into someone who has become dedicated to improving themselves and taking on tasks they themselves wouldn't normally do. \\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the general story line, I applaud the directors and the author of this anime/manga for taking a route that is generally less taken. Instead of rushing from one end to the other, we are taken on a path that shows the beginning or rather the creation of the \"hero\". We are on a road that shows each step by step development and eventually leading to their own triumphant goal, if only a short one. It did a solid job leading into the next episode making me wonder what'll happen next.\\n\\n\r\nSound? The music was done in a way it should be done; complimenting the scene. Granted the music may not be as memorable as some blockbuster movies or anime may be, it none the less worked out for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the art shown here in this show, was unique in its own aspect and was rather very soothing. To be able to look at a painting and imagine it being played in the background as part of the scenery to create the mood. The drawing of the characters were well done, and worked well with the artistic style of the background. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters felt a bit lacking or boring, however as the show went on, we started to see slowly what is on the mind of these characters. We see transformation of each character going from being clueless to a sense of determination and growth both physically and mentally. None the less, there weren't any characters that flashed out as the perfect poster child, but they did an adequate job fulfilling their role as part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what many may say about this show, I thought it did a great job doing progressing the story well. It's not your typical hack and slash show, nor is it your typical romantic love show, but a rare breed of showing how one must adjust to an abnormal lifestyle previous of their experiences. I would have to say... a beginning of any hero in any story will always have some sort of hard upbringing, and here we see a normal group of people become a party of inseparable friends who depend on each other and look out for each other as anyone would in a violent world. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to give this show a fair 7.5/10 but to round up, it'll have to be an 8 on MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and do check this show out if you haven't yet.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: forgot to mention, that like most anime, it is made to sell the manga. I say it's fair that this show has peeked my interest to want to know what'll happen next by reading the manga aka it did it's job selling the manga to me.\\n",

A show that would focus on the boring math and/or rules part of a D&D game more so than its actual fun, fantasy part.\r\nStory:  The world of Grimgar is wrought with danger.  Upon being summoned to a a new world, a group of newcomers findthemselves in a new world where goblins, dragons, and demons exist.  In order to survive in this world, they need money.  And to get money, they have to kill monsters.  These people are told to become part of the volunteer army to help aid in saving the town from monsters.  It is here where we meet Haruhiro, a young man who with the help of some other otherworlders, begin their quest to try and survive in this unforgiving world.\\n\\n\r\nGreat setup, right?  Outsiders looking in, a story where we can see our main character grow and prosper?  Good stuff right?  Except we don't get that.  Oh no, no we don't.  At its core, grimgar is what I would describe as a story wrapped around style over substance.  While the story does follow the concept of 'becoming an adventurer' like many similar stories of this nature, it has far too many problems with its execution to even make it seem worthwhile to even watch.  \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest culprit to the story is Grimgar's complete and utter lack of proper pacing.  A story involving adventuring usually comes with a balance of reward and defeat.  Moments where the characters succeed and get rewarded for winning, as well as moments of defeat where the loss is so severe that it impacts the characters greatly.  Grimgar does one, but not the other.  The show has a lot of moments where we do get to see the characters fail.  Very often do these characters fail more than they succeed, and that really hammers in the point that they are beginners and are learning to survive in this society.  Personally, I find that to be a more realistic point of view, since generally, it is seen that you lose more than you succeed.  The problem is, we never GET to see them succeed.  Often times, the show uses monologues and montages to show that they're doing well.  In total, this only takes up a small fraction of the runtime in comparison to the gigantic amount of suffering that these characters have to endure.  Because there is a lack of balance in this regard, it's very hard to even sympathize with them because there're no happy moments to relate to whenever things are going bad.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.  They're always in this perpetual traumatic state and it just gets annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nPacing also has an impact on the overall structure of the anime.  Grimgar wastes a lot of time.  And I mean A LOT of time.  There are many cases where the anime runs circles around itself to keep shoving its philosophy and hardship of life down your throat constantly in addition to spending entire half episodes to show nothing but soundless moments where the characters do random shit around town with happy music in the background.  There are a few choice moments in the anime that I think really are great moments, but all of that glory is just wasted potential amidst a slew of the show constantly flitting away its runtime with worthless pieces of scenery.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother smaller, but still present aspect of the story is the supposed romance.  It's a lot of back and forth with this topic and I personally would've preferred if they didn't even try to hint at it altogether.  They showcase 'feelings' from one character to another, and it really just doesn't make any sense.  It's subtle, but it's still present, and I wish it wasn't there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we get to the philosophy.  God, it's annoying.  Post episode four, the show really tries to drive home how important people are and how hard the idea of loss is.  The show wants you to pity these characters, and it's understandable; they've been through a lot.  For the REST OF THE SERIES?!  The ending also doesn't really do the anime many favors because the show just sort of gives up and makes these still would-be beginners, especially the main protagonist, into these plot armor covered characters where apparently, killing off more than one person in this series would be a sin.  In short, the story had a lot of potential, and had many different ways to go with it, as the series clearly had the 'evil mobs' form their own societies, making you question the moral qualities of killing creatures that never hurt you, but no, it's just trying to make you feel pity for these characters and that is just not good writing.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great story potential\\n\r\n-   Too much suffering, not enough reward.  (Even though it was clear that they were doing well, they just choose not to actively show it.)\\n\r\n-   Wasted too much time\\n\r\n-   Unneeded supposed romance aspect\\n\r\n-   Stop shoving your goddamn philosophy down our throats\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Oh boy, where do I start?  The characters in Grimgar are made to never grow up.  From the very start of the series to the end, none of them really show any form of positive growth due to their inherent traits and constant turmoil of pity.\\n\\n\r\nThis time, I'm going to group them all into one big pile.  Because honestly, there's nothing really interesting about any of them.  Haruhiro is our protagonist with basically no qualities to him.  Yume is the ranger who's half-tsun (sort of).  Shihoru is the busty shy girl whose timidness is infuriating to watch.  Ranta is that one asshole you want to beat the shit out of cause he thinks he's better than anyone else.  Mogozu is the big teddy bear tank guy who lives carving wood and cooking.  And really...that's about it.  All of these characters have some irritating trait about themselves that make them unlikable.  What's even more annoying is the fact that the show doesn't even try to break them out of their shell.  While there is still noticeable differences from the beginning to the end, they don't grow out or move on with their lives, or even remotely change as characters.  More or less, they just know and/or tolerate each other more to the extent that they seem different, but they really don't change overall.  \\n\\n\r\nThe people that do have special mention however, are the healers Manato and Mary.  These two are more or less the equivalent of plot devices for the series, as they are the causation for the irritating and constant philosophy and the person that they shove said philosophy onto later in the series.  They are more or less the reason as to why or how the series is the way it is, since the show puts far too much focus on them more than anyone, and as a result, takes away from what the show could've been.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pointless.  There are a very small amount of them, and none of them have any grave significance that makes the show better or worse.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Completely unlikeable cast\\n\r\n-  Healer characters hinder the plot to become what it is\\n\r\n-  Side characters are completely pointless\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Now the art...the art is something I can get behind.  Produced by A-1 Pictures, Grimgar has a much different style of art than most anime.  The characters are simple enough to look aesthetically pleasing but also detail who and what they are.  (I.E.  Who is the mage, the thief, etc.)  The effects and the overall fluidity of the animation is also relatively nice, so much so that I really don't have any complaints to the series in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nBut the one thing that stands out to me about the artstyle are the backgrounds.  The backgrounds are made out to be this beautiful watercolor style that just looks so stunning.  It made any moments where they wasted look SO much more worth to watch in comparison to the series's complete lack of ANYTHING happening at times.  Overall, the art is by far the best part of this anime, just simply because of how unique and how well done it was made.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Simple but well made character designs\\n\r\n+  Watercolor backgrounds\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The sound is also an aesthetic that is worth mentioning.  The OP is a mixture of folk and action that...while sounds good, personally isn't a kind of music or track that I would personally spend my time listening to.  It's good, but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is this slow song that spends more time focusing on the sad, more depressing side of Grimgar (which is everywhere), with a track that focuses more on vocals and sad guitar.  Like its OP, it's a good track, but in retrospect, not a soundtrack that I found to be truly memorable or worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good OST\\n\r\n-   Not really that memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  (Warning: Rant ahead)  Oh boy, Grimgar.  Where do I start with you?  I liked you.  I really...wanted to like you at the beginning.  But ever since Manato died...you have NEVER....STOPPED....TALKING....OR COMPLAINING...ABOUT...HIS GODDAMN...DEATH!  I have never been so annoyed with someone dying that I wanted to kill the characters within the show itself.  It is fine to mourn; I'd be heartless to say that you can't.  But Grimgar spent so much time saying \"What would Manato do?\", \"How would Manato solve this issue?\"  Manato, Manato, MANATO, MANATO, GAH!!!  (Oh yeah, and you can go to hell too, Ranta.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nJust like Manato, any respect I have for this anime is dead.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the story were insufferable.  The art and music...yeah, they're ok.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I would suggest you stay away from this.  The show is slow to an extent that it hurts the show more than it helps.  With the show making us spend its entire runtime feeling pity on the characters, I couldn't help but be annoyed and instead, want them to die rather than to live.  It sounds heartless, but when they're characters that don't exactly know how to move on from an event that happened ages ago, then you've got a problem.",

            "content": "*Please wait*! Before you decide to not watch this anime, I would like to tell you why you should watch this!\r\nI shall start off with the low-down of my review, and if you are interested in the general (hopefully spoiler-free) reasons why I like this, please do so. :)\r\nReview Summary:\r\nI enjoyed this anime because I liked seeing the changes the characters go through.\r\nI enjoyed the ending of the anime. It really had a good ending, and it just warms my heart.\r\nThe action scenes were pretty sweet!\r\nAnd the art is beautiful.\r\nAnd now for the longer, but hopefully quick breakdown of my rating:\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWe find our protagonistsin a strange situation. Unlike some other similar anime, this one has a different take on it. There is a focus on the mental processes of the characters, and also on action scenes. Okay, the story does get sentimental, and you may cry a bit. But please watch through the entire series. It's a bit slow for me, and it's not entirely original, but it's still well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters are well designed, and each has a unique look to them. The watercolours used in the setting are stunning. It's like a watercolour anime. The colours used seem to be of a lighter palette, but there are a lot of darker colours in certain scenes to match the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and ambient music are soothing vocals. I could listen to both the OP and ED for a long time...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nIf you like dynamic characters, there is so much character growth, it's like watching real people grow. Oh. Well hopefully this isn't a spoiler, but there is growth. Growth is good. I also mentioned the character designs are pretty cool. Even the side characters are pretty interesting!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSo at first I would give this anime a low rating, but after watching the whole series, it's definitely a 10. The emotions and action both sweep me off my feet!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nOkay, this anime has to be between 9 and 10 out of ten. Considering I rated 4 out of 5 of the other catagories 10/10... This anime is definitely one of those anime where you either love it or hate it. I love it.",

            "content": "From what I've seen, it's pretty obligatory to say that this is my first review, and with that said, take into account that my review isn't necessarily indicative of how you may feel, and at the end of the day it's all entirely subjective.\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, or Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a tough anime to review, because on one hand it does a lot of great things that you don't see very often in the medium, especially within the fantasy-RPG genre, but on the other hand, it's definitely not something I could recommend to absolutely everyone. So to really kick thingsoff, I want to start with what, in my opinion, are the positives. \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is seemingly yet another fantasy based anime, borrowing elements from well established MMO mechanics such as partying up, completing dungeons, learning skills, and having specific class roles. So in the anime spectrum, this isn't anything new, we've seen this all before from shows such as Sword Art, Log Horizon, and many others, but luckily for the viewer, this is essentially where the similarities end. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is heavily character driven, and I mean heavily, almost to the point where each episode more-or-less focuses entirely on diving into the psyche of our main protagonist Haruhiro, and if you're reading this review, I've come to assume you've already read the synopsis so for the sake of being slightly less tangential I'll spare you the details. Anyway, now this can be viewed as a good or bad thing depending on whether or not you find complex stories and or characters more preferable within what you watch. Now obviously we would prefer to have both, but if we are talking strengths, the fact that this anime not only has a main character that feels human and relatable, but also has a cast of supporting characters that are all memorable and enjoyable at least on some level is one aspect that the anime succeeded in; and trust me, in a world where you've seen hundreds of anime, it's a breathe of fresh air being able to list characters off the top of my head with ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe second aspect that Grimgar succeeds in is showing struggle. This is emphasized heavily within the first couple of episodes. This anime doesn't play by the typical rules of the established shounen genre, there is no over-powered main character, and the motto of this one in-particular could be summed up with \"one mistake could get you or someone else killed.\" This constant fear and struggle that is portrayed gives the viewer a sense of suspense, you're constantly critiquing every mistake that the group makes, often getting frustrated, and even a little worried about the group's survival. Nothing is ever easy for them, and in the brief moments that it seems to be, we are quickly reminded by the harsh reality of this fictional universe, a reality that one mistake will essentially snow ball into another. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that you can visually see the growth that each character goes through, even if it's simply in terms of fighting is just really enjoyable to watch. This is an aspect that makes it so heavily relatable, all of the characters start off absolutely terrible at everything, and I mean terrible. They are uncoordinated, hesitant, often stumbling over each other, and even having quite a few communication issues. As the show goes on though, little by little, these issues disappear, or become at least less obvious. It feels like you're there right with them, following their journey and many failures, and also being there to see the accomplishments that they work so hard to achieve. The anime also focuses on little things, such as mannerisms, body language, and so on to subtly show change without necessarily throwing it in the viewers face, and I'd like to think that many people prefer this method of \"show don't tell.\"\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\nNow with the not-so-positive. With an anime that's dependent on it's characters and their development to keep the viewer interested, it is slightly disappointing to see only half of the cast get any real, personalized development that dives into their personalities and why they are the way they are. What's even more disappointing is that even with half of the cast somewhat developed, we only get to view these characters from a first person narrative perspective, thus limiting the possibilities of really ever fleshing them out as much as they possibly could. Now to give a slightly positive retort to that though, I would say that experiencing things through Haruhiro's thoughts is a great way to develop the protagonist well enough to make the audience like him, and it also gives a great psychological feel to it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is slow. Now I wouldn\u2019t put this in the cons if it were a 24 episode series, but because of the fact that it has really prioritized the concept of gradual growth, the story suffers because of it. It\u2019s absolutely a blast to see the characters change over time and become better, but with only 12 episodes, the story itself becomes less clear because of this. Obviously the main focus is on the characters, and I would even argue to say that this is a slice of life, but because there is no overarching theme otherwise, this could turn a lot of viewers off. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some quirky animation issues. While some of the episodes you won\u2019t really notice them, there are quite a few situations where characters will lose a helmet or something, and then they will magically have it again briefly, only for it to disappear once more like it should have originally. These things aren\u2019t enough to take away from my enjoyment, but little things such as my example really shouldn\u2019t be happening. i get that there are deadlines, people are drawing quickly, and so on, but it\u2019s something that people will be critical of when they see it. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 6\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the fact that there isn\u2019t really a world-building-grand-scheme-point to this story thus far, then it\u2019s reasonably enjoyable. At least from the perspective of just viewing it as a simple coming of age story, but nothing that will blow you away.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis would be rated higher if they were all developed, but because it\u2019s only half the cast, I have to dock points. The main character is great, he\u2019s relatable, and his internal struggle feels very real. Mary and Ranta were also great, but unfortunately the rest of the cast didn\u2019t really get the same treatment. That being said though, because they did the \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d style for the rest of the cast, I\u2019m willing to let some of it slide since we can experience their changes, even though there isn\u2019t quite as much context for them compared to the primary 3 I spoke of.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, The opening and ending were very catchy, the voice acting seemed pretty solid, and I liked the fact that Haruhiro had a more realistic and less typical shounen protagonist voice. Otherwise, there aren\u2019t really any songs or tunes within the show that really stood out to me. \\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe water color backgrounds were all very aesthetically pleasing, making the world deceivingly vibrant and very unique looking. Character designs, while not breaking much of the mold for the norm in terms of style, still looked great and it was nice seeing their gradual change in attire. Plus all of the characters felt very individualistic because of some subtle creative choices. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m personally an avid fan of slow, character driven stories, and even more-so a fan of stories that have a psychological aspect to them. I liked seeing their team dynamic slowly evolve, as well as their personal interactions. The fight scenes were great to watch even with some of the animation flaws, and overall it was one of the few anime this season that I really looked forward to each week. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\\n\r\nEven with the issues I talked about, and others that I may have not listed, I think Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is at least something I feel everyone should give a shot. It\u2019s simple, has a really great focus on realistic human interaction, as well as the fact that it dives into themes such as grief and how people all react differently to such hardships. The story is nothing groundbreaking, and if you can get passed the slow pace, Grimgar offers a very unique experience we don\u2019t get too often with anime, and especially with anime within the fantasy-RPG genre.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much more I could say, but hopefully this does all right for my first review. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying this anime is slow, I'm talking crippled snail kind of slow. So if you can't deal with slow anime, then you're best making a U turn and leaving, this anime is not for you.\r\nNow onto the actual review.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is a fairly standard \"Stranded in a fantasy world, we must survive.\", however there is a lot of time where nothing happens to drive the plot forward, but instead shows the daily lives of the characters. There are of course action sequences, the killing of orcs and goblins and such, much like you've come to expect from any kind of action/fantasyanime. The overall story seems to be mainly driven by the characters, with the overarcing story taking a back seat in order for the characters to take the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal. If you were to completely disregard the story and characters, and you just watched this for the landscape shots I think it'd be worth your time. The backdrops all seems to have been domne in water colour or a similar medium which is very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI had to go back and watch a few episodes to get a feel for the audio since nothing stuck out for me, but going back and purposefully listening out for the sound made me realise that everythingthat needed to be there was there. The audio for armour pieces clinking together was there, the audio for chess pieces being moved and so on, attention to detail was everywhere with audio. The background music was also good and built on the athmosphere of wthe scenes where it was used.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:(This will be split into two parts, Visual character design and character design.)\\n\r\nVisually, the characters are all well designed, each having thier own style and quirks. Most of the gear used by the characters isn't hugely outlandish and unwieldable. A little thing I liked was that they actually carry their gear, for example Moguzo carries a large backpack while the party is out adventuring, it's a small thing but it shows that they're out in the wilds for a few days at least. There are no fairly generic cut'n'paste secondary characters either, even the secondary characters have been drawn well, with them all also having their own styles of gear and clothing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and the design of the personalities for the character is hands down the best part of this series. The characters are very well developed, even down to things that they do in their spare time. All the characters feel rather unique too, while watching I never thought \"Oh look, another Kirito.\" or \"That guy reminds me of Naruto.\", all the characters have very definite edges to their personalities and habits.\\n\r\nYou spend so much time with the main party, just seeing them do the menial everyday tasks people do that you can't help but connect with them, even though you're just seeing Moguzo buy a helmet or seeing Ranta fishing, you start to realise that these people have lives besides going out and killing orcs and dragons and this series does an excellent job of building them in that way.\\n\r\nYou also see how the characters emotionally develop as the series progresses, alongside their abilities as adventurers this really drew me in since with other \"Trapped in a fantasy world.\" anime that I've seen I didn't see a whole lot of development, so this was a nice change. Our protagonist also has a pretty interesting way of looking at things, so his internal monologue has some good moments of sarcasm.\\n\r\nSomething that particularly made me happy with the characters is that a 'small cut' will seriously hurt, and put them out of action, and losing blood is a somethig that can incapacitate them ((Looking at you Bleach)), and that the main party has no idea how to fight when they first enterthis fantasy world, as most of us wouldn't have any idea with how to start with magic or sword play except 'Hit them with the sharp bit'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, if you don't like slow anime then you won't enjoy the story progression, as whole episodes pass by with nothing happening; if however you like slice of life, and you enjoy seeing the characters go about their lives in this new fantasy world they're in, then you will really enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "Ever since SAO there has been many trapped-in-an-MMO spawned as a result in recent years. The main appeal of these type of shows comes in the form of high stakes.  A death in-game is equivalent to dying in real life. \r\nFrom episode one this show sets itself apart from it's spiritual predecessors. The cast of characters are afraid of their environment but are also incompetent in fending for themselves. They fail at killing a low-class goblin multiple times! This works insofar as character deaths are logically believable because the protagonist and his group of friends have no idea what they are doing.\r\nTo be honest,I usually wouldn't watch a show like this of my own volition. I was sold on the series when I heard it was \"gritty\". If I had to describe this series, gritty, is the last word I would use. I will not hold it against the series just because it did not hold true to my expectations. What I can hold against it, is that the conflict of this series is incredibly repetitive. The characters level up, fight stronger monsters, and surprise surprise find themselves in a dangerous situation where they may or may not live.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters... flat anime tropes done a million times before( and probably better). The show tries to flesh out all of these characters, so an A for effort I guess. There is one character worth noting. That character is Ranta, the hotheaded side character who comes across as cynical and confrontational. I wish the series went farther with his character, he is so confrontational it borders on psychopathic and I wanted the show to explore him in detail. Nope! Turns out he is just passionate with a heart of gold... Sigh\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show. It serves as a solid action adventure. The only problem is that it also wants to pack an emotional wallop and has way too much cliche drama. The music sounded similar to Kozue Takada( sadly it was not). Although it was not it still sounded easy on the ears. This anime is fine, but nothing worth remembering.\\n",

As the characters continue to grow, it is definitely refreshing to see an anime in this genre that focuses on character development.  Keep in mind that this show has no comedy value in it.  However, it compensates greatly on the psychological aspect.  Each episode has its own deep meaning and conveys the feeling of each character to the viewer.  The creators remind us that, regardless of the characters\u2019 predicament of being thrown into a new world (without knowing how and why), they are notperfect and cannot easily cope with the rules of this universe.  To have a wonderful time watching, pay attention to every detail and make sure that you understand the role of each character. \\n\r\nAnother notable aspect to this anime is the artwork and soundtracks.  I have read that producers have paid much attention in getting the team that handled the music in this series.  The background music in most scenes was definitely supportive\u2014they amplify the mood of what is being portrayed in each scene.  Also, the artwork was breathtaking.  My words cannot express how hauntingly beautiful the art was. \\n",

This pulls themes of grief and struggle along with growth and perseverance to build a spectacular work of art.\r\nWhile I think the premise of how they got into the world is just put in as a sort of excuse to explore this world, sorta like Log Horizon, it is such a moving anime that I didn't really mind. The first episode when all that was laid out was kinda boring, but the rest was utterly stellar. There isso much emotion and power put behind each of the characters and how they are developed. It is really hard to describe what makes certain animes good, but this brings a harmony between the art, a great OP and ED that fit the story really well, and the characters that just makes it hard not to love. It pulls from characters and ideas that are universal across similar animes but puts a really unique and fresh twist on it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is by no means a stereotypical RPG and as you watch it you'll see that it sheds a different sorta light on that idea. If you like RPGs and deep slice of life and want flow in your viewing experience, I highly recommend Hai to Gensou no Grimgar!!!",

            "content": "Reviews from me are rare, but I felt that this show was greatly underappreciated and thus deserved a positive review from me.\r\nFirst off, I went into this show for reasons beyond the norm.  Usually I choose what to watch in a season based on the seiyuu involved (typically male) and then gravitate to a couple more when a friend of mine says it's good.  Grimgar however I picked up for the simple reason that it was pretty.   I was drawn to the watercolor backdrops and the simplistic character designs that weren't flashy and remained down to earth, especially for a fantasyanime.\\n\r\nSecondly, I'm a fantasy fan, and usually I find most fantasy anime lacking in something.  Yes we all know how much the world loves SAO but to be honest, I wasn't that keen on it.  So when we get dropped into Grimgar, I'm praying that it doesn't turn out to be some sort of parallel world where you die in the game, you die in life. \\n\r\nThird... I actually gave up this anime after episode four because I was... attached.  Those who see the series will understand what I mean without spoiling it... but let's just say I was ticked off and put off by the series.  A few months went by, I cooled off, and I started watching it again.\\n\r\nTo be honest, by the time I had finished the series, I felt refreshed.  This wasn't a show about a group of kids saving the whole entire world (like so many anime are) and this wasn't a show about unraveling a fantasy world's mysteries and how it connects to the real world (like SAO).\\n\r\nThis was a story with very deep themes including how to deal with loss, survival at it's base level, how to communicate and understand those around you, and about growing to find yourself through adversary and tragedy.  Now, maybe some people don't like deep stories... but I did.  By the time you're towards the end of the series, you too have forgotten that these people are from somewhere else and you really no longer care how they got there, much like the characters themselves.  This series was about the small struggles of day to day life set with a backdrop of fantasy and magic.  Tragedy and Triumph go hand in hand with Grimgar and the stark gravity of reality in that we are all destined, one day, to be but ash, resonates to the heart and soul.\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for something thought provoking with a dunk in the deep end of the pool... watch Grimgar.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I wasn't.",

            "content": "I really liked this, but I can definitely see why it's not for everyone. It manages to feel short and very slow-paced at the same time, and combined with the very melancholy tone, it's probably going to leave a lot of people unsatisfied unless they really click with it right out the gate. \r\nHow did getting sucked into a fantasy/game/RPG world become a genre in and of itself? Grimgar definitely belongs in that growing stable alongside the likes of Log Horizon, Overlord, Konosuba, Re:Zero and the much maligned Sword Art Online, but an escapist fantasy it certainly ain't.\r\nCan you imagine actually living on the bottomrung of a stereotypical sword n' sorcery fantasy world? Particularly if it's one with genuine stakes where you're not just going to pop back to life at the nearest church. One where eating and having a place to sleep depends on venturing into the forest and beating a little green guy to death for his meagre possessions? I'm not sure I'd survive the first couple of days, never mind becoming the world conquering hero. \\n\\n\r\nLife in the world of Grimgar is brutal. The combat is actually pretty realistic, even for the Goblins that supposedly act as fodder for the 'level one' protagonists; they struggle to survive as much as anyone would in a fight to the death, and they don't die easily or cleanly. More effective adventurers crop up from time to time as the series progresses, but you get the feeling that it's not high level abilities or items that make them strong, it's just that they're less squeamish and more remorseless killers.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really enjoyed the way that gloomy and desperate atmosphere is reflected in the slow unfolding of the series and the washed out pastel colours of the environments. From a normal fantasy perspective the stakes are really low, but the protagonists are struggling just to survive day-to-day so even the smallest things can be a matter of life or death. I found that celebrating small victories and mourning personal losses with those characters to be much more compelling than a lot of the larger scale stuff happening in other shows.  \\n\\n\r\nI do have a bit of a problem with the setting here in general though, and it's the same one I have with Overlord; the 'transported from another world' thing is VERY incidental. Especially here where the characters don't even have any memory of the previous world, it just seems like a really lazy way to have the modern audience relate to the characters in a medieval world, explain away the somewhat 'gamey' RPG mechanics and provide a convenient out to avoid worrying about backstory. I feel like Grimgar could have been about a group of teenage 'heroes' native to this horrible fantasy universe where adventuring was their only way to a better life, and it would have been much improved for it.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, or Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a good series that is worth its time. The story of it is rather simple, where the characters wake up in a new fantasy world with no memories of their previous lives and must work together to slay monsters in order to make a living and sustain themselves. Other than survival, the characters do not seem to have any real goals. This changes as the series progresses and they set out side goals for themselves but overall their main goal is still simply staying alive and earning their keep, which makesit feel like a more realistic series because there is no real antagonist for them to overcome. Instead, the group attempts to handle each obstacle as it comes and they start off completely useless. But as the series progresses and the team becomes more familiar with each other, they manage to start adapting to Grimgar much better. \\n\r\n  What is cool about the series is that the obstacles the group faces, such as goblins and other monsters, are not really the actual goal. What this anime is really about, is team building. Each character in Grimgar has their own strengths as well as a whole host of weaknesses. The anime is driven mostly by the characters and not an overarching plot/goal, which is a nice concept and it works fairly well here, but a big problem with the series is that the characters themselves are not all that interesting. A massive focus is put on the characters as a group as well, which means certain characters do not step into the limelight very often and feel kind of left out. For instance, while Ranta gets alot of screen time as a heavy source of conflict within the group due to his difficult nature and hotheaded intensity, Mogzo and Shihoru are barely developed at all throughout the series due to being very quiet. This is a shame, because as the group developes throughout the series so should the individuals and that just does not seem to be the case. \\n\r\n  Touching on the presentation on the series, this is an element where Grimgar really shines, literally. The world of Grimgar is beautifully drawn and the backgrounds often look like amazing storybook illustrations that fit the series fantasy genre well. There are points where the characters will slow down for a minute to take a breath and allow both them and the viewer to gaze upon the sights in awe for a few moments. Along with the visuals, the soundtrack is certainly above average. At sad moments the soundtrack and visuals combine to make for an immersive somber experience, while on the opposite end of the spectrum the soundtrack switches gears entirely to hype rock that excites the viewer during action scenes. \\n\r\n  Overall, Grimgar's soundtrack and visuals are great but are not able to carry this series into the realm of true awesomeness due to its plot and characters kind of slouching behind. The series also ends with many unanswered questions, hopefully to be picked up in a season 2, but its doubtful. This series is rather slow paced, but that's not to say it's boring exactly. It is nice to see the group slowly develope as opposed to instantly becoming heroes like in most shows these days. There are points that do unfortuantely drag on though, especially when the main character (who is perhaps the most boring of the cast...) spends minutes on end overanalyzing his own leading capabilities or how to communicate with his team better, namely Ranta. \\n\r\n  Essentially Grimgar is most of what I had hoped SAO would be before it turned into an instant gratification harem with cliche romance. This series will stick to its guns and follow through with being an anime about surviving in a simulation-esque fantasy world. This series delivers some truly cool action moments coupled with some unexpected emotional elements as well. Since it's only 12 episodes long, I would definitely recommend anyone who enjoys fantasy elements to check it out!",

            "content": "Honestly, the first few episodes were a bit hard to get through.  If I stuck with the standard 3 episode test, I might have dropped it and missed out on the rest of this series.  At first I thought it was more of a series for middle-schoolers until I saw a few particular scenes and realized that there is a certain amount of violence and blood.  Ah, things are not as they seem.  Alright, let's continue.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime was pretty good in my opinion.  It was always full of good OSTs.  That's actually why I couldn'tgive it a full 10 out of 10.  One of the early episodes (the 2nd if I remember correctly) featured a long scene of slow panning shots and OST.  It was a long scene.  With no dialog. I was sitting there thinking, \"What am I watching?\"  It seems like they forcefully placed in the OST - substituted music for content.  This happens in a few scenes in the later episodes.  None of them, however, are as long as the scene in the episode I just mentioned, thankfully.  Apart from that, and this is of course from a personal standpoint, I did like a lot of the soundtrack.  I usually skipped the OP and ED, but I do remember certain tracks that I will want to look up later and perhaps add to my personal collection.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe unique art that was used in Hai to Gensou no Grimgar added to the game-like feel of the series.   Pastels are used extensively, a lot of the scenes look as if they've been painted or water-colored. It's definitely not the typical \"nothing special, gets the job done\" art style that you're used to seeing in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few cool effects used as well in respect to fight scenes and spell-casting.  The style in which the characters are drawn though, while not necessarily bad, do contribute that feeling that it's meant for a younger audience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright.  A few of the characters did not impress me that much at all.  Annoying characters, even though they're supposed to be annoying, annoy me a lot.  Ranta - typical rude selfish pervert that exists only to annoy the viewer - and excels at this role.  I know a lot of it exists for comic relief - something that I honestly don't care for.  Only really at a later stage did I see anything that brought any sort of quality to the character - during the \"one-on-one\" talk with Haruhiro.\\n\\n\r\nMozugo - seemed like a typical \"gentle giant\" character.  He tanks for the party, but is usually soft-spoken, quiet and loves to cook (and eat, I suppose).\\n\\n\r\nShihoru - a shy girl who you really don't hear much from throughout the series.  She does seem to have more confidence in the battle scenes as she develops her magic skill.  This is the one area where her prominence comes to the forefront, and at first, it's easy to miss.  Though reserved and quiet, you do see a lot of emotion from her though, with Manato mainly being the subject.  The story does not explicitly point out any relationship between the two, but the viewer gets to decide and fill in the blanks.  Again, due to her personality, you have to wonder what her emotions are based on or what she's thinking about at any given moment.  I did appreciate that about this character interaction.  And that brings us to\\n\\n\r\nManato.  A priest, vanguard and tank.  Hold on here.  That's literally asking for trouble.  Come on. Your healer should not be the one a. taking point or b. taking damage.  It could work that he's the leader, as in many games, the caller or party leader is able to watch everyone's moves from further back in order to maintain the big picture of the situation.\\n\r\nAnyway, about Manato himself.  He seems a bit older, at least more mature than most of the other party members.  In one episode, he mentions that he doesn't think he is the \"kind of person most people like, where he comes from,\"  (Yes, I know that was poorly paraphrased.)  which is a surprise, because everyone in the party looks up to and relies on him.  This adds a bit of complexity to the character that is left undeveloped - due to obvious reasons.  Overall, Manato comes off as a person that has a lot of compassion and responsibility, but tragically ends up taking on a burden too heavy to bear.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiro - Doesn't have main character syndrome!  Thank god.  He's just a normal guy with doubts that is thrust into a position of great responsibility, and ends up not sucking at it.  Okay, that does sound like a main character.  Though not terribly perceptive, he is not completely aloof, nor useless.  (Unfortunately, way too many main protagonists are.)  He's an alright guy.\\n\\n\r\nYume - She definitely has personality.  One of the most notable things about her is that she has a very unique speech pattern, very casual/colloquial.  She doesn't seem to be a highly intelligent character, but she isn't outright stupid.  She can kind of drift off in speech and sometimes is off in the clouds.  If you upset her, she can be fiery and antagonistic.  She has a personality that isn't homogenous.  One of the nighttime scenes between her and Manato halfway through the series was excellent at bringing out her character (No, I'm not talking about an H-scene).  Yume is feminine and seems real, not scripted.  She was one of the characters I liked more.  Often times, I found her to be a soothing prescence.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also did introduce us to a few supporting characters that were either weird, or drew sympathy, but fortunately, none of them seemed too clich\u00e9.  For example, Renji doesn't come off as the typical arrogant jock leading the most successful party around, even though people awe at his prescence.  Merry's former party members pretty much all seemed likeable.  Hayashi's account of past events is a compelling one, more or less.  I actually did not hate many of the characters in the series.  Just Ranta. But then, everyone does.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is one character that could singlehandedly bring up the score - Merry.  I liked her from the first glance.  You can immediately tell that she is the serious, isolated type.  You then see that she is logical.  Unlike Manato, she does not waste effort healing minor wounds in the middle of combat when the threats have not yet been neutralized.  The group has a hard time getting along with her or getting to know her.  And because of all this, you start to inquire about her background.  When it finally is revealed, you are not disappointed.  Most of this is given through Hayashi, her former party member's account.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts about Merry is that while initially (okay, mostly) cold and logical, you see how she has changed because of her experiences.  You will learn that she is completely different from the girl she used to be long ago.  Her past burdens her, and she carries it with her every day and every night.  In one of the more effective scenes, you also see her go from calm and collective to showing outright fear (not to marginalize it, but I would call it severe PTSD).  Towards the end, she softens up quite a bit considering what she's been through.  Merry is a dynamic character that truly reacts to the storyline.  Though many would argue about the predictability, Merry's character development is done brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first, of course, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar comes off as a more light-hearted anime in a game-like world similar to Sword Art: Online.  Of course the visual and sound elements as well as some of the characters' behaviors attribute to this.  Also, the fact that the teams are referred to as \"parties.\"  This anime has a strong MMORPG vibe.  The characters are dumped in this world not knowing where they came from or who they were.  This question has yet to be answered, but other developments take shape.\\n\r\nI know that other viewers may appreciate these and that the series was not designed specifically for my enjoyment, but one of the things that I could have done without is the wide use of comic relief scenes - such as the staple sneaking into the girl's bath scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is based on a few commonly used structures.  A party starts off as an uncoordinated bunch and develops under increasing challenges.  A central party member, one that is respected and loved, is replaced with one that seems very uncooperative.  Let's see how the group adapts to this challenge... etc.  Clich\u00e9 is not necessarily poor in this case.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, while it doesn't always work, what worked well with Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is that they didn't answer all of the questions.  \"How did the characters get to this world?  Why?  Who were they in the world they came from?  Are those two in a relationship?\"  Intentionally or not, the viewer is allowed to fill in the blanks and make speculations about the past, present and future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile again the first few episodes had me wondering if I should continue, I definitely did not struggle to finish this anime.  Much of the plot was based on common challenges, but the story was still decent.  I really enjoyed how some of the characters were portrayed and developed.  The questions left unanswered throughout the series serve to draw in the viewer.  A lot of things are left to speculation.  Perhaps these questions may be addressed in a sequel, which will of course bring up new questions if it is well-written.  This line of thinking is what leads viewers to inquire about a sequel, or a second season.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to give Hai to Gensou no Grimgar a rating of 8 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "This review does not include spoilers.\r\nI don't think video game worlds make good settings for stories.  It's lazy writing, for one thing--using a generic fantasy RPG setting like this requires little thoughtfulness or creativity beyond the initial, already overused idea.  It's also a constant reminder that the world of the story is not real.  And in Grimgar specifically, you're never certain what the real stakes are, since we're never told what happens when somebody dies inside the game world.  For all we know people who die might simply get logged out and go back to their lives.\r\nI also wonder why Grimgarneeded to take place in an RPG world at all.  Sure, the characters use RPG-like rules to fight and progress in an RPG-like way, but it doesn't really add anything to the story.  They could just as easily be getting stronger in a more natural, realistic way, and then the video game setting wouldn't be needed at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut maybe that's enough beating up on Grimgar.  For despite the fundamental vapidity of the setting, it's a pretty compelling show, and I'll watch it over SAO any day.  The reason for that mainly comes down to the characterization.  Each character in the ensemble cast is very distinctive and manages to eschew stereotype in small but meaningful ways.  There's plenty of internal psychological struggle and a lot of emphasis placed on the relationships between different members of the group.  The characters change and grow over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above is able to take place because Grimgar is a show which knows how to take its time.  The leveling up mostly takes place off-screen, and the battles themselves are a small percentage of the runtime.  Most of the show is spent exploring the thoughts, emotions, and relationships of the characters who are trying to survive and grow stronger within a kill-or-die fantasy world.  If that doesn't appeal to you, you might want to look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the few big battle set pieces in the series are brilliantly executed.  There's a real sense of danger and tension.  Attacks have a sense of weight behind them, and the fight choreography is great.  Each character has a distinctive way of fighting and their particular strengths and abilities are clearly depicted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while all that is positive, it must be said that this is a slowly paced, twelve episode series--which means it leaves off with virtually nothing resolved, whether that be character arcs, potential romantic relationships, mysteries, or anything else.  And since that may well be where the show ends, it's painfully dissatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also has quite a bit of fan service.  It's not even close to the most egregious offender in this regard, but I still find it distracting and silly at times.  Others may feel differently and enjoy this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that despite its flaws and its ...to be continued \"conclusion\", Grimgar is worth watching--as long as you are aware of what kind of series you're getting into and don't expect it to be something it's not.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a good \"trapped in fantasy rpg world\" anime without fan service.\r\nBefore I started watching this anime, I was afraid it was kinda clone of SAO or Log Horizon but much worse. But luckily I got so wrong. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is far better than those two, not to mention about others in this genre.\r\nThe main problem of such animes is too much fan service in them, boobs, ecchi stuff, harem, dumb \"comedy\" scenes, etc, which all eventually ruin the story. This happened with both SAO and Log Horizon I mentioned. But not with Hai to Gensou noGrimgar.\\n\\n\r\nIt has practically no fan service.. Ok, there is a one pervert character obsessed with spying on naked girls and call them flat-breasted; Haruhiro's guildmaster and a bit of short scenes here and there, but all is happening  somewhere on a backstage  and does not interfere with the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thanks anime lord, there is no goddam harem, absolutely not, not even \"love triangle\". No \"boobies\" all around during peace or fight scenes. Even \"big-breasted\" Shihoru looks like an ordinary girl, not a cow-girl with giant udder sticking out of her body.\\n\\n\r\nCreators went even further - they didn't include any \"pet\" animal companions (even without ability of speaking), no elves or cat-girls or any kind of \"loli princesses\" obsessed with main character.\\n\\n\r\nNo dumb jokes or other \"embarrassing moments\" are included either. It is not a comedy anime, wrong address.\\n\\n\r\nLack of all abovementiond elements of today's fan service, made possible to concentrate more on story, characters, fight scene, dialogues and the anime world itself. It is not colorful, sleek world with beautiful cities, crowded streets, merchants and magical creatures living happily together. Despite really good looking landscapes with attractive nature and amazing star-filled sky scenes, it's rather gloomy world, filled with desperation and daily bloody violence to survive. No one knows where they are from, what are their goals, why are they fighting. No, there is no place for \"cute\" things.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, advantages are: Well made characters, impressive graphics, realistic fight scenes, right overall atmosphere, no fan service.\\n\r\nDisadvantages: Rather unclear plot - requires a sequel to reveal what is going on, very short duration - 12 episodes were not enough to fully develop the story and also subjectively I wanted more to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 / 10",

            "content": "This anime looks like another RPG theme but there are few things that it attracts attention. I'l write it very shotly with \"Cons and Pros\" since it's not much you can talk about. So here we go\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\n+Art: It is the best thing you can expect from this anime Towns, forest, jungle, ruins are GREAT it's great rarely you will see that kind of quality, Great backgrounds sometimes i even stopped to take a screen shot for my wallpaper and overall it's really good.\r\n+Animation: is good not much i can say about it movement is decent ofc there are expections where it looked like creapbut it stands out in the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\n+Fight scenes: the second best thing, they are very meaning full, it somewhat fits the plot line where a small fight is something huge and you are risking of dying, at this point you start to doubt this is some another RPG theme anime and think about that this is real fight we are looking at.\\n\\n\r\n+Music: Last memorable thing is music, it serves as a good background music forgeting about loneliness, giving new athmosphere and serving as emotions for characters ( what they feel like ) \"example\" acoustic music can be played after battle for relief.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\\n\r\n-Story line: Man i don't know where to begin is there even a story ? No there isn't. There is ofc small plot line, Characters wake up witout they're momory in this new word and thats it. Yes, thats it, characters simply don't care. You will pretty much will be watching for fight scenes and try to look for interesting/Funny moments when chracters are in the middle of the conversation.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: Talking about characters they are bland cliche somewhat. There are expections =at the beggining there are 4 characters that you will be interested in but it fades away.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: because it lacks what it really needs Characters and Plotline this goes in bin of *another boring anime*, if you combine this anime art, animation, sound & Music with some RPG themed anime that has good or decent storyline or plotline *atleast, this will become interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE personall preference:\\n\\n\r\n+/- OP and Ending are not good at hyping it all up or atleast showing interest, i always skipped it.\\n\\n\r\n+/- some episodes are good some are bland. First episodes are really interesting but that interest fades at the last episodes, goes for personall preferences again.\\n\\n\r\n+/- Ending & Continuation: Ending sucks it endend on boring note, absolutelly no interest for future of this anime not interested in manga or what will happen next in it. I don't know maybe 12 episodes isn't that much, to tell the full tale or explain but it but meh, manga readers won again. But i won too, i'm not interested in this crap.",

I liked how killing the goblins wasnt easy that they struggled they kicked they pulled the screamed it almost was like what the characters were doing was worse and they werent just attacking some random animal. I dont know it just seemed different then most shows about fighting monsters etc that it wasnt as easy as other \"heroes\" make it. I also like that they didnt really use scream power moves out or whatever it is that mostanime do. I loved the water colour style backgrounds and the character design was great.

            "content": "It's not the ones who are born good who become great. It's the ones who realize their limits and work hard that achieve greatness.\r\n(Is that a quote? Maybe it should be.)\r\nIf you start playing a video game that you're not very good at, but slowly realize that your survival depends on getting better... well, you're probably playing Sword Art Online (just stay at level 1, Kirito will beat the final boss soon enough). Unlike SAO, Grimgar only makes passing mention of the \"real world\", and instead focuses on the daily lives of a party of \"noobs\".\r\nYou've seen it in every MMORPG under the sun: Athief, a dark knight, a tank, a healer, an archer, and a mage walk into a bar... Well, this gang, for some reason, is still in the starting area, struggling to score their first kills. Unlike MMORPGs, however, there's no experience gain or level up except by learning how to fight the hard way and paying for new abilities with proceeds from loot sales. And if you die, you better be cremated for a stiff fee quick, or you'll become a zombie.\\n\\n\r\nAll games suspend a significant amount of reality, because if a game models real life, it's actually quite dull and boring (that's why The Sims runs much faster than normal life). It's actually a fascinating premise-- what if you are stuck in an MMORPG world, but you need to survive and it really is super hardcore mode?\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much room for humor in this show, as all the non-action and non-drama parts are mainly relaxation (iyashi) to unwind the tension. Perhaps the humor was reserved for the side series.\\n\\n\r\nThe casting and direction are quite good-- the male lead is well portrayed as a hesitant, brooding, yet thoughtful young man, and the dark knight's \"dumbass\" routine is convincing, if nearly identical to an earlier \"dumbass\" character he played in Shirobako. A touch too convincing for my tastes, but he put in a good performance, and like any good character-driven show, he later reveals his good sides. Unfortunately the two initial girls and the tank are relegated to background characters as the main arcs of the story don't involve them as much as they could.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched Ragnarok the Animation, there's a similar character-driven drama there, but not as strong in my opinion as Grimgar. The strengths of Grimgar are the realism (not completely realistic, after all it's anime), some really good animation, the themes of camaraderie and struggle, and the chemistry that develops among the party members.\\n\\n\r\nCompared with my gold standard for fantasy anime, Lodoss War OVA, Grimgar feels shorter (less plot content, perhaps-- I think the episodes were longer in Lodoss) and less epic, but otherwise holds up well.\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember much of the soundtrack, so it must be one that blends into the background. There's a battle song that plays in a pivotal scene that's good, and the opening theme coupled with the animation is just the thing to get the blood pumping.",

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is not your typical \"Action\" and \"Adventure\" anime. This anime is a whole lot more than just \"A person getting transported into a fantasy world\" because it explored realistic themes such as poverty, survival, coping with death and etc. This show will also test your patience and I don't mean that in a good way. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (7.5/10)\r\nA group of people have been unknowingly transported into an unknown world and 6 people from the group formed a party together to survive this world where death is a high possibility and the chances of being broughtback to life is non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nYou know how many times I dropped this show? Two.times. I gave this show 2 chances just so I can finish this show from start to end which is going to be the first show that I managed to finish after giving it 2 chances. Now, how is this relevant to my review, you ask? Here's your answer. The reason why I dropped this show two times is that god-forsaken horrible f*cking pacing for the first 4-5 episodes. It was unbearable and and I was literally forcing myself to stay awake because my eye kept closing every minute. If you take a look at my list, you can see that I have a good track record of watching slow pacing animes and giving them a score of 9 (even Fate UBW) but Grimgar is not one of them. I understand that what Grimgar was trying to do was show how a beginner like them will do against a Goblin and what they'll do to overcome that weakness but they did not do it right. \\n\\n\r\nI can summarize to you what's going to happen in the first 5 episodes. The characters have a conversation, they go out, fight a goblin, they either win or lose and they walk around the village until the episode finishes. The latter was just so badly done because what you're seeing is literally just a slideshow of them walking around the village and an out-of-place insert song playing in the background. I'm not saying the insert song was horrible or anything..In fact, it was a great song but it was so out of place. For a dramatic song like that, I expect them to use it when someone dies but no one died in that scene. Therefor, to me, it was out-of-place. \\n\\n\r\nRanting aside, one of the reasons why I liked about Grimgar is its realism..Even though I didn't like the pacing, what I did like is how the characters don't go all \"super saiyan\" mode and they don't suddenly turn overpowered just for the sake of advancing the plot. Fighting in this world is extremely dangerous and characters can get hurt or die any time, no matter how important they are to the story. We see the characters planning out on how to kill the Goblins and executing said plans to achieve it and just like how life won't always go the way you planned it out, the same thing happens here. Their plans can fail at any time. It's also refreshing to see the characters struggling to kill a single Goblin (one of the most weakest enemies) which is a rarity in the medium. It shows us that killing a living being is not that easy. Also, just because Grimgar has similar resemblance to a RPG world doesn't mean that death can be taken lightly. In Grimgar, death is final. Once they're dead, they stay permanently dead with absolutely no chance of being revived. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said above, Grimgar did a great job exploring realistic themes such as poverty, coping with death and survival. Since I already talked about the latter, I'll only talk about the first two. For the first one, I never expected an anime to explore such theme. I mean, I was very surprised when I saw the characters not only struggling to fight a weak enemy due to their lack of fighting experience but to also struggle just to meet their necessities. At the end though, we see them overcome this issue by working hard, just like real life. You don't just get whatever you want by doing nothing. The 2nd one is coping with death which is the main focus in the 2nd half. When Manato died in the first half, he wasn't just swept out of the show just because he's gone. He still played a huge role in the 2nd half, either by the way he affected the party's performance or by appearing in Haruhiro's imagination. It tells us that he still lives on even though he's gone. The coping with death and many more aspects like the character development (which I'll explain down below) was so well done that the 2nd half made me forgive the flaws that the first half had and bumped my score from 6 to 8. \\n\\n\r\n\"Bring ooonn the fanservice!\" /sarcasm\\n\r\nThere really isn't a lot of fanservice in the show but there's still a few fanservice throughout the show. Half of them used as comedy and half of them focusing on Yume's ass. What is it with A-1 Pictures and ass shots? In SAO II (Another show by A-1 Pictures), Sinon's ass shots dominated the show and in here, Yume's ass shots can be seen in almost every episode. I guess I have a new name for this show.. \"Grimgar of Yume and her Ass\".......No? I'll stop. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe character design may be great and the art style may be unique but this is one of A-1 Picture's inconsistent animation I have ever seen. The action scenes are sometimes a pain to watch because of their use of still shots and there was one scene where the characters' legs weren't animated and the characters looked like a bunch of cardboard cut-out going up and down to make them move. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThere is a lot of out-of-place insert songs in this show which would explain why the animation was so inconsistent and the constant use of still shots in action scenes. They most likely blew all their budget so they could pay that girl ( (K)NoW_NAME ) who sung all of the insert songs, including the OP and ED theme songs. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Knew day by (K)NoW_NAME and the ED theme song is \"Harvest\" by (K)NoW_NAME. The OP theme song, for me, is just average and I don't think I'll ever listen to again. On the other hand, the ED theme song is one of the best dramatic song that I have ever heard. If A-1 Pictures is going to make another anime that will make people cry, they better hire (K)NoW_NAME because she can do a dramatic song that can make people cry. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nGrimgar's character growth can be explained in one word..Amazing! Unlike SAO or any other Action/Adventure Fantasy shows out there, the characters literally start out as a bunch of weak party who can't even defeat one of the weakest monsters ever. As you watch the show from start all the way to the end, you'll notice how much these characters have grown and it's making a guy like me cry for weird and unknown reasons. It's like watching your kid who can't do shit to a person who can take care of himself.  \\n\\n\r\nManato's death also contributed to the party's growth. That is so wrong for me to say but that's what happened in the 2nd half if you watch closely on how this party grew from a bunch of incompetent f*cks who can't even defeat one goblin to a competent party who works together to defeat multiple goblins. That's not to say they've become an overpowered party though. They just learned how to work together and how to get stronger. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Mary joined the party, she turned out to be one of the worst characters I have ever seen.....or so I thought. I guess that's what character development does to you. It explains why Mary was so cold towards her party members and why she's so stubborn when it comes to healing her party members. It was a rather depressing flashback if I say so myself. Mary eventually got along with Haruhiro and his party because the party understood what was going through her mind and they helped her overcome whatever her problem is. She turned out to be one of the best and fleshed out characters I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nSame goes for Haruhiro. He started out as a bland protagonist but when Manato died, it affected him greatly because he was the best leader the party had and this inspired Haruhiro to become a great leader for the party because he knows that only he can do it. He also cares about other characters' feelings and when Mary joined the party, it became even more noticeable that his character has great leadership skills because he cared about Mary's feelings and he did everything he could to help a party member, which in this case, is Mary. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nGrimgar pissed me off in the first 5 episodes because of how poorly the pacing is handled. By the way, this is coming from a guy who watched a lot of slow pacing animes. After 5 episodes though, the show gets a lot better and it turned out to be a good show but not the greatest. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash\" managed to dug itself out of the grave after the 5th episode and turned out to be a good show out at the end. However, if you can manage to ignore the infuriating pacing at the first 5 episodes then this might be one of the best A-1 Pictures anime for you because while the story may be decent, Grimgar has one of the best character developments I have ever seen. There's also Grimgar's realism which is the first ever realistic Action/Adventure Fantasy anime as far as I know. If you're looking for a show that has a similar premise to SAO but done better then this is the show for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Grimgar's realism in so many aspects\\n\r\n+Show explored realistic themes such as poverty, survival, coping with death and etc. \\n\r\n+Unique Art style and Great Character Design\\n\r\n+Amazing Character Development\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Infuriating Pacing at the first 5 episodes\\n\r\n-Out-of-place insert songs in the first half",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a darker take on the popular ''drawn-into-a-video-game' genre. Or rather, it's about a bunch of teenagers suddenly finding themselves in a fantasy world, fighting to survive. It's not really about being in an MMORPG, it's about characters interacting with one another while sort-of advancing a plot and dealing with loss. Let me tell you more about that below.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI'll be honest. Not much actually happens in the twelve episodes that this series offers. It has a leisurely pace, with surprisingly a few parts that almost seem to go by too quickly. That said, I do feel that the pacematches the feel the series is going for, despite being somewhat meandering. It's slow, but I mean that in the best possible way.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I definitely found refreshing about the story is the fact that while in most other series the plot is propelled along by various dramatic, high-impact events to which the main characters cannot help but respond, the opposite is true in Grimgar. Instead of impending doom and overpowered enemies, be it on a personal or global scale, the characters in Grimgar have no such big concerns. It's easy to just throw enemies at the heroes to ''advance the plot'' like many other series do, but that doesn't happen here. \\n\\n\r\nOur cast pursues the dangerous situations out of desperation, a fear of going broke and starving, and for a few because they crave action and adventure. A big part of the plot is actually about character interaction, conversation and pondering about the struggles of daily life, and learning how work better as a team. Without being too dramatic, it deals with the fears and troubles of being thrown into the unknown, and the way this works out in a group of people. Dealing with loss comes back again and again, but not in an overly dramatic or tear-jerk-y manner.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and all story arcs were wrapped up in a satisfying manner at the end, which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nLet me say this up front: I got a ton of nice shots that make for wonderful desktop backgrounds. There's quite a bit of exposition on the various environments, and they are pleasing to the eye. The background artstyle is kinda vague or watercolor-y while the characters stand out more. For me personally, it worked. It added to the feel of ''realism'' they are going for. This also shows in the proper body proportions and subdued visual effects, even when using special skills. Animation isn't anything special, though, although the combat scenes aren't bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to other series, there are many scenes with limited lighting and dark scenery. The use of contrast between light and dark and the shadowing is fantastic. Even darker areas look nice and just just ''generic dark''. I have little else to say, but suffice to say I enjoyed the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nWow. Have you ever taken a moment to listen to the everyday sounds around you? For it is exactly in that area that this series excels. It was good enough that I actually noticed. The pattering of rain, the sound of vegetables being sliced and the knife hitting the cutting board, the murmuring people in the background while sitting in a tavern, the crunching of snow underfoot. It's these sounds that were amazingly crisp, and they definitely added to the feel of the series as a whole, subtle as they may be.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as music goes, there were a few memorable songs, but it was otherwise pretty forgettable. It wasn't bad, but not outstanding either. I did like how important or exciting parts in each episode had their own little song with vocals on the background, which were more obvious than the background music at less important moments. So in summary, there were more vocal songs than I had expected, and they were appropriate as well. I now realize these did leave an impression on me after all. After some research I found out that the OST is by the band (K)NoW_NAME. In fact, after listening to the music outside of the anime, I've come to appreciate it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting really surprised me as well. While the effect wore off as time went on, they all really did sound like a bunch of normal, everyday people. Of course, they are trained voice actors, but they did their best to sound like ordinary people, probably partly thanks to whoever wrote the dialogue scripts. They had a bit more vibration and emotion to their voices, especially the main character. Everyone was much more subdued and less overly outgoing as is a staple in anime. I have to say, that wasn't bad at all, since it's kinda rare to find a series that has this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nIs our cast as generic and clich\u00e9d as in many other series? Pretty much. But it doesn't feel that way. Whoever worked on the dialogue parts did a good job of conveying each and every character in their own distinct way. The way in which the party members talk to one another is pretty casual and everyday as far as anime series go, but it's still exciting and appealing. One again, their conversations match the feel the series is going for.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I rated this part so highly, is because of two reasons. Firstly, everyday conversations are relevant to the group and their struggles. Their problems are brought up and discussed in a way that comes across as natural and realistic, and the party dynamics and each individual personality responds to it in a different way. The drama and sense of loss that occurs at times is conveyed to the viewer without too much ado.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there's banter, there's drama and there's a lot of focus on dealing with other party members. I'd say about half of the series is about dealing with loss, and dealing with other party members and trying to make everything work smoothly. In this case, even cookie-cutter characters can become at least somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Hell, yeah, I did! If there's one thing I'd like to draw attention to here is how damned exciting I found the battles. For example the goblin fight in the second episode was already pretty thrilling. While this feeling does lessen, throughout the series you'll feel a sense of excitement during battles that few other series manage to pull off. And this synergizes neatly with the ''realistic'' feel they were going for. To be honest, the combat is quite plain, but still manages to be more interesting in its plainness than fights with the Big Bad Evil Guy in certain big name action-focused series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8\\n\r\nDespite a slow, meandering plot and lack of worldbuilding this series managed to snag me and drag me in. The art style, sounds and character interactions worked together well to create the setting. There's action, there's drama, there's a sense of loss, and there's a development in characters and teamwork. All in all, I find that it's a unique combination that's hard to find anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like normal, ordinary people struggling a bit before finding their way. And that's refreshing.",

Instead, it tries to explore what people in a fantasy world would really feel and how they would really act.\r\nThe first thing you should know before starting this anime is that it's slow. Very slow. I, personally, enjoyed this leisurely pace. It allows the world and characters to feel more real, as we get to see their daily lives, and not just the most important events.\r\nThe art styleis pretty, different, and odd. The water color backgrounds are beautiful and refreshing. However, it makes characters often feel out of place, which brakes immersion.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite a few significant shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, and would definitely watch another season if one were to be made.",

            "content": "Grimgar feeds off of the RPG-anime trend and tries to give it a serious approach. The result is a very slow paced and boring anime about 6 stereotypical characters grinding money, because life is hard, people die when they are killed and food costs money.\r\nThe setting is a generic RPG world filled with trolls, kobolds and whatnot and the interactions the main characters have are only between them and other monster hunters. The world building in this anime is practically non existent.\r\nThe characters are all stereotypical and flat with most of the script being ridiculously generic (and silly). There's no growth whatsoever either. In factin the novel the writer introduced them and called them by their archetypes, when the characters didn't know each other so their names were unknown to the main protagonist, Haruhiro. When the writer himself thinks it...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot advances at a snail's pace, and that's understandable given the fact that the source material has in 3 volumes a plot that could just as well be the plot for only 5 episodes. In order to fill out most of the spare time you get to see the characters acting according to stereotypes that they are: starting ridiculous quarrels that make no sense, being shy and having your needs guessed for 10 minutes, being cold and having everyone try to be your friend for 15 minutes, etc. Of course all of this comes tightly packed with explanations of what is obvious in the shape of Haruhiro's internal discourse.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's good stuff to this anime, namely the fights and the design. While the animation can have occasional dips, the fights look gorgeous and last quite a bit when they do happen. The design is also particularly appealing, but I urge you to check this yourself. You won't take long to get convinced.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice has its okay moments and its awful moments. Having appealing design for the characters and not extremely provocative fanservice will probably please most of those who accept fanservice. However it's very often that the timing of fanservice is downright awful. For example 2 characters titillating while mourning the death of someone close.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end this anime can deliver if you're a diehard RPG-anime fan thanks to its visuals and the *new* approach of making it hard for the characters to live well and not having them be overpowered from the start. If you're not such a fan, the snail pacing, genericness of the characters and silliness of the script will probably get to you quite fast.",

            "content": "Looking at the winter 2016 season, there are two anime that uses RPG as their settings, KonoSuba and Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. Surprisingly, they complement each other quite well. The reason for that is because they are not similar to SAO, Log Horizon, or most of the RPG-type-of-setting anime; KonoSuba uses comedy as its approach to its story, while on the other hand, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar chronicles the details of the life in an RPG-world as a team of normal (average human) people.\r\nIt starts off with strangers waking up in the middle of nowhere with hazy memories of their previous life (theyremember things like \u201ccell phone\u201d without knowing what it actually is). Then, they met a man who later told them that they should live as a volunteer army. Strong people want to be in a group with the other strong individuals, which leave Haruhiro, Ranta, Manato, Yume, Shihoru, and Mogzo to be in a group of the weak. It\u2019s certainly problematic for them to suddenly live in a setting where life and death are separated with thin fabric, and also when they are not born to be a warrior. \\n\\n\r\nThe story shows a lot about their weaknesses, including on how they can\u2019t deal with the weakest monsters, on how they live with limited resources, and on how they handle their first kill. And like I mentioned before, the story also shows lots of details on many trivial things; it uses a considerable amount of its screen time for trivial problems, which leads into a very slow pacing. But that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and to tell a plot after plot might not be the point of the story at all. All it does is just to show a \u2018life\u2019 in an RPG setting. In the first episode, it\u2019s shown that the people who got awakened have certain memories of their previous life, but there\u2019s no effort showing for the characters to unravel the mystery behind their existence. It\u2019s just there as a plot device to introduce the story. And again, that\u2019s not the point of the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are not the most original characters, especially for this type of anime. There is Haruhiro, the thief and the protagonist of the story (most of the story will be shown in his perspective); Ranta, the obnoxious Dark Knight; Yume, the cheerful ranger; Manato, the priest and also the leader of the group; Shihoru, the shy magician; and also Mogzo, the tank warrior who\u2019s also calm and reserved. The charm of the characters is built up through their development. It\u2019s how they will grow up as a team, which also the main point of the story. They will appear in each episode to answer these questions: How will you move on after something bad happened as a team? And how do you acknowledge every single of your teammates? And finally, how do you keep on going as a team? \\n\\n\r\nIn this anime, the monsters are not totally brainless. They have their own thinking on how they approach their hunters. They have their own characterization which makes it more realistic than any other anime with the same type.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best features about the anime is its art. The background looks like a painting, which improves the mood of the story. The character designs are also good, and most of them are interesting without being over-exaggerated. Every character designs are mostly unique to its own. The animation is rather humble since there are certain errors on the screen, but most of them are tolerable. While A-1 pictures is producing 3 anime at the same time, it may seem that this anime got the lowest budget compared to \u2018Gate or ERASED\u2019. There are many rooms for improvement for the animation part in this anime that turns out to be actually better than the other two.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound feature, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar has a medium quality. It\u2019s not that great and it\u2019s certainly not bad either. The soundtracks are rather forgettable and the concept is mediocre, but there are no soundtrack that is misused or doesn\u2019t fit with the scene. The anime, in my opinion, uses too many insert songs. Most of them are not even necessary. And again, it\u2019s not bad at all. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, it\u2019s really hard to enjoy this anime since there are gaps of time between each episode while the anime is still airing, since the anime has a very slow pacing at the very beginning. There are barely anything happened at all in the first 3 episodes which pulls some of the viewers away. But it will improve later on since the characters are developing slowly and steady. And also the anime is actually enjoyable after giving it some time. The enjoyment in this anime is acquired through the characters\u2019 interaction. And as I mention above about KonoSuba and this anime, they complement each other\u2019s enjoyment due to the nature of KonoSuba being hilarious and Hai to Gensou is slow but steady. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Hai to Gensou to Grimgar is a hidden gem in the winter 2016 season that got overshadowed by the presence of the other anime and its weak start. It\u2019s another stuck-in-RPG type of anime that uses a different approach to its story. The anime is to be enjoyed with time and waiting for the characters to grow up and got developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnd of the review, in the next section I will talk about the main character, Haruhiro. \\n\\n\r\n*************MAJOR********SPOILER******ALERT*****************************\\n\\n\r\nI actually hate Haruhiro as the main character. He\u2019s one of the main characters that I can\u2019t actually stand for some moments in the anime. He\u2019s way too obsessed with the death of his fellow and he\u2019s trying way too hard to be the Manato. \u201cWhat would Manato do?\u201d Every time that phrases come out, I feel so sick in the stomach. He is stuck in the shadow of Manato\u2019s death for way too long. If most people found Ranta to be unbearable, I found Haruhiro to be worse than Ranta at some point of the story. Ranta is natural, he is what he is, unlike Haruhiro who is still trying to be Manato in every decision and every time. He also complained too much about Ranta. Despite all of that, he got developed quite well at the end of the story and it\u2019s becoming another charm for this anime.\\n",

            "content": "2012 was the year things changed for the anime world. A new genre burst onto the scene with the arrival of the extremely popular light novel, sword art online. Since the enormous success of that particular anime almost every major studio has tried to put their own spin on being trapped in an unknown world (or video game) with RPG like elements. Most of these studio's were rewarded handsomely for doing so, and thus every anime season we are now assaulted with an endless slew of MMORPG animes. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is yet another part of this tired genre, yet it contains anoddly fresh prospective that was refreshing, and quite frankly needed. \\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar decided to take the road untraveled in the MMORPG genre. What looks like an action, fantasy anime manifested itself in an unusually realistic and very human way. The action, and the setting are not the main story here, it is the characters, and their daily struggles. The main characters are not demi-gods out to save the world, they are weak, insecure, and are just trying to get by the best they can in a new world that they know little about. The feelings they feel, the tribulations that they face are all too real feeling. These characters felt like real, like somebody you have met, and know in real life. The pain, loss, happiness, joy and conflict that each character faces is all very real, and genuine feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very intimate, it is not an epic -- it is smaller in scale than any other genre of this type of anime that I have ever seen. If you're looking for fast paced action, this is not the anime for you. It is slow, and every little decision or indecision has ripple effects throughout the entire casts lives. This anime manifests itself more as a slice of life anime than anything in my opinion. The way this anime was executed was superb, it was everything .Hack tried to be, but never was able to become.",

It has a slow feel to it, because is not always action paced and focuses on building up the story, characters, etc. Would gladly say is a 10 out of 10, just wish the episodes were not so short. you will start the episdoe that you have been waiting forever for to watch, let teh show build up, and as soon as you get to the climax, it leaves you in a cliffhanger. But it did very well to keep you hooked for the next episode. since season one is now completed i would highly suggestany aniime watchers, strong or first timers to try out Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. It Was very stressful having to wait a whole week on some of the cliffhanger endings but was always worth the wait. The way they can play with your emotions while keeping everything in a semi safe feeling environment is fantastic. \\n\r\nHopefully there will be a season 2, and will come out speedily!",

            "content": "I took a break from anime for a few months (8 to be exact) and coming back i decided to watch Hai to Gensou no Grimgar on a whim. It was a great return for me and one experience ill not likely forget. But enough about me Lets see why i gave this anime a sacred 10 out of 10 without of course spoiling it for you potential watchers.\r\n  The story takes place in a new world. Where our characters find themselves fighting monsters, emotions and just life itself on their journey. You have all the classic rpgclasses within our group. Thief,mage,priest, and warrior etc\\n\r\n. \\n\r\nThe characters playing these roles in the group is our strong point. Honestly one of the best jobs done within Character development and personality's. The presentation of hardship and joys within this anime made me experience all with the characters whether i wanted to or not. Showing the complications of the interactions of humans working to strive towards survival and finding happiness and dealing with sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nSetting these experiences are a great soundtrack solid voice acting and atmosphere. I'm not going to act like i know art or even remotely Understand most of it. But what i do know is that the painting that was the background weather it be a town or field was done with personality and care. The great selection of songs amplifying the emotions the characters are portraying \\n\\n\r\nNow where most people that i have talked to in my life that have watched the show the score drops off here. majority problems being pace is to slow and not enough plot development (yes which is different from character development). While i see the logic in those statements for me this was a perfect balance in all aspects. Having a group of young adults dropped in a new world. Instead of them Being prodigy's in there classes  killing the demon king or whatnot Saving the world. They just strive for survival and taking small steps. Which i can relate to in a very personable way being 23. Not Curing a disease or Even making in impact in my world taking small steps to better myself dealing with loss and hardship. Taking advantage of the joys i have and dealing with friends that i bump heads with.  I could emerge myself within this group. Being a man who if this had happen to would not be the prime choice of a party member in any aspect.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a worthwhile trip (understatement) and one of my favorite anime of all time showing character development in ways that is getting more and more scarce.... \\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR---Serious, non-harem, fantasy that has ~some~ slow or slice of lifey moments that add to a great overall experience.\r\nStory 8, Art 10, Sound 9, Characters 8, Enjoyment 9, Overall 9. \r\n-Story 8/10: The story felt like the embodiment of progression for low level MMO characters. People awake in a fantasy world with no knowledge of why or how, and their sole option for survival is to become a volunteer for the army. Basically-- fighting monsters and the such to make money and survive. This story revolves around a party of the \"leftovers\" that no one else wanted in their party off the start. Summed up,the story is their progression and survival day-to-day in this foreign place. At times it can be slow to the point that the story feels almost slice of lifey, but it's executed so well with some great music and beautiful scenery. \\n\\n\r\n-Art 10/10: Easily the highest point for this show. The art itself isn't super HD beautiful works, but rather they look like water-color hand painted backgrounds; it's very refreshing. It's like they used the really great concept art for the show, and just said, \"hey this is good enough just use this\", and it is!\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10 : Another high point for this show. Almost every tense, exciting, or emotional moment has perfect music to make the moment just that much more enjoyable. The action has rock, the fun even has some rap, and the beautiful and emotional moments have calm and soothing songs.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters 8/10: The characters in this show are very easy to like or even fall in love with. The main party feels simple to relate to, you grow and progress with them. Most of the characters are kind, sweet, and moral- with one an exception, which whom you'll know from the start if you watch. Only downfall is the MC's trainer/master is absurdly over-sexualized. I'm all for ecchi, but it's pulled off in a way that isn't even... sexy... or enjoyable. It's actually distracting and stupid.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall 9/10: I kept my eye on this show to see if its ratings would raise by the end, and they did. I heard the first few episodes were cliche and unwatchable, they werent bad. It starts slow but picks up and was overall one of the best serious fantasy shows i've watched in a long time. Hoping for a season 2!",

In fact the anime just insinuates in one or two episodes that the characters may be from earth but that is almost insignificant as the whole story revolves around the current world and the way the charactersevolve and adjust to their new environment..\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good and its unique giving you a sense of peace as you watch this anime..The character development was really good...not to the sense of immature selfish brat to mature sensible adult...It mainly focuses on how the characters adjust to the fact that they are in an unknown world..\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were about the team's interactions and individual personalities and once you get that part it focuses more on our protagonist Rantaro and his struggle and development as a leader. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching this anime even though I felt like I would drop it in the beginning. This feeling in my heart I have felt only with a few other animes and that's very few.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar certainly stands out from its genre of Action and Fantasy. The story takes on a relaxed pace compared to most fantasies and the viewer witnesses how the casts experiences and grows from the events that happen to them. \r\nThis is certainly not a show you can easily binge, the development of characters is slow and more realistic in a sense. This show is meant to be enjoyed in a more relaxed manner. \r\nThe art of Grimgar and its setting has to be the main selling point of the show. Outside the dungeons is a lovely setting that the main castwill always look out to.  It emphasizes how much the characters want to continue to live and simply take everything life has to offer. Many reviewers will comment on the realism of the show.  That reason lies with the heavy weight of dying. The beautiful atmosphere gives depth into the meaning of being able to live on. The weaker monsters have shown tendencies to want to live, reemphasizing the topic of death.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar presents how the characters develop from grief and fear of death. The viewer can see the distant relationship within the party, especially after the traumatic experience(s) that occurs. Arguments arise from the characters and every member is affected.  Ultimately, we are able to see how the characters are able to adapt to the world they were placed in.\\n\\n\r\nIf it came to overall enjoyment, while this certainly deviates from my love of action in anime, I have to say this show was nice to see watching it through the end. It certainly does place perspective on being normal within a fantasy world. The viewer witnesses character development, a unique art, and a solid soundtrack. Pace yourself as you watch this, and take in each episode.",

            "content": "Theoretically, Grimgar isn't a show that provides many new elements to the table. A group of people get transported to a fantasy world? We've all seen that before, from the famously polarizing Sword Art Online to more recent comedy shows like KonoSuba. Yet the expression of these elements and the way the narrative is constructed provides an experience unique to this series.\r\nThe biggest complaint I've seen with Grimgar is that it is \"too slow\" or \"too boring.\" This certainly might seem true to someone who comes into this show expecting a story-driven narrative, but that is the very problem - the show isn't meant tofocus on a linear story with set goals, it intends to focus on the development of the characters. To this end, I believe it was quite successful.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the interactions between them are indeed what really make the show enjoyable. Many characters are developed well - whether we look at Haruhiro's journey as a leader, Shihoru finding her self-confidence, Ranta discovering his role in the party, or Mary moving on from her past, these are all narratives that are well-explored in the story. Characters like Yume (who is adorable) and Moguzo are more static, but they too have important roles and serve as great catalysts for the development of other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters are used also paves the way for many themes to be explored. How is death handled? What does it take to be a leader? What is the nature of friendship or teamwork? These ideas are all explored through the interactions of the characters, and I found myself exposed to various meaningful viewpoints on these topics.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the characters, I also found the art fairly decent, and the soundtrack used within scenes of episodes was very suitable.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there are a few parts in the show where I felt the narrative, while effective and full of impact, was slightly drawn-out, mainly certain parts regarding Manato and Mary. Haruhiro's voice occasionally came across as too monotone for my liking, and the opening and ending weren't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nWhile these flaws cannot be ignored, however, the impact from the narrative was more than enough to provide a great experience. The way the characters are developed furthered my opinion on this show, and ultimately it was a very enjoyable and valuable ride.",

Its very different from SAO and Log Horizon.\r\nThe world art is awesomely done in watercolor and gives a very nice setting. Its done really well and make the characters stand out but not so much they seam out of place. The story is more one of survival than anything.Almost like a slice of life but with people being sucked into a fantasy world with no memory of where and when they came from. It has the perfect amount of love story in it. Its there but its in the background (Like very back there) and doesn't effect the store much but does effect the character development.",

I won't ruin the rest of the plot for you so let's continue with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on this anime is rather unique. Either you will love it, or you will hate it.

            "content": "This review contains a wee bit of spoiler\r\nStory :\r\nThe main story is about a group of kids trying to survive after waking up and realize they are in another world, but they can't recall any memory on where they come from. Now the concept of \"living in another world\" are becoming more common in recent anime shows, but Grimgar has differentiate itself by portraying one of the most realistic scenario on what would happen if a normal people began their life in a RPG style fantasy world.\r\n'Normal' might be an overstretch, as even from episode one you can already tell the MC and its partyare both weak in skills and lacking in interpersonal skills. Combined with the RPG approach of figuring things by yourselves unlike being given a target of reaching the top level of a certain floating fortress or defeating a demon king, this anime is going to deliver itself in a more of a slice-of-life type pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSo what would the plot of a slice-of-life living in a fantasy world anime be like? You've guessed it! Most of it are character development, both from fighting monsters and the interactions between each party member. Although there are multiple girls within the party, it is not a harem type anime but you could see a bit of romance sub-plot building between some of the party members.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nYour typical A-1 pictures, the art is stunning, the settings have a water-color like pictures, although there are a bit of inconsistencies and a noticable drop in (CG?) quality at the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are nice, there are music that accompanies the fighting scenes that make it more enjoyable and sometimes the pairing between the music and the animation are spot on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAs i have explained a bit previously, the characters are weak and most of them does not have a good interpersonal skills. If you imagine a group of people that represents shyness, stoic, wishy washy, and arrogant, then you have an idea on what most of the party members are like.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not to say that they are not likeable characters as there are many other things to like from them as the story progresses. The main noticable character development on this show is on Haruhiro and Mary, with the remaining party member have a slightly more subtle changes. \\n\\n\r\nYou won't be seeing many side characters in this show, as the main focus of this anime is on the party itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are enjoyable with a decent amount of action, but as the show goes on you are going to realize that they are dragging the show and making you wonder whether if this anime is one of those rushed one cour series. In multiple episodes, they add a lenghty song while showing not much activities from any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who have read the LN, you might go on a rage on why they omit a big event while deciding to show watercolor painting with music that does not do any justice to the LN. Then again, i personally think that this anime is a complement to the LN, and not a substitute so it is still somewhat enjoyable despite the fact that they adapt 8 episodes for the first volume and only leaving 4 episodes for the second volume.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nObjectively speaking, it's a good anime overall but the enjoyment factor is not too high making it difficult to recommend to others.\\n\\n\r\nI can only recommend this anime to people who have read the LN and wanting to see most of the fighting scenes or those who like slice-of-life anime coupled with a different type of setting. If you don't like slice-of-life kind of show then you probably won't like this anime.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free as well as my first so please excuse any mistake I might make :)\r\nI had written this review just before the last episode, so it got removed like other reviews written before a series ends. So I still feel the same way about it and have nothing significant to change :)\r\nOverview:\r\nLet me first say that not everyone will enjoy this anime. Which is perfectly fine. The start of the series is slowly paced, which I believe turned many off. It is somewhat understandable considering in this genre would have you to expect OP main characters, fast pacing, etc. In otherwords your basic seasonal SAO clone. Yet I believe this anime has the best storytelling I have ever come across so far. The art is original and new and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. This anime is more character development focused, so some might find that to be boring. But for me personally, this work is absolutely gorgeous and enjoyable, but you have to stick with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this anime's story. The beginning started slow, and continued to creep along. Then all of sudden, BAM! An unexpected twist that just comes out of the blue. It was like someone slamming the accelerator down in a car, but then just as fast hitting the brakes. The writers skillfully had you relax and watch without expectation. Then proceeded to delivered a sucker punch and I don't think anyone saw it coming. Some people would argue that the character was unimportant and lame etc. But, his....fate helped to develop the other characters substantially. \\n\r\nThe story then takes a slowish/medium pacing whilest a new character is introduced. Again, this anime is very much so focused on character development, which can take time. It continues this pace until the last episodes where they face their biggest fears and obstacles. I, once again, believe that the finale, and build up to it, were executed in a thrilling and exciting way. \\n\r\nThe story can be slow. Some might consider it to drag at points. However I believe it to be enjoyable, always looking forward for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is the center of this anime. That being said, in the beginning they are all weak and somewhat fickle. Many people thought some of the characters were uninteresting, bland, and illogical at the start. However, at the end, the characters had grown strong and dependable. They somehow made you want to root for them. One of the coolest things is how the characters behave in a way that is somehow more human than other anime. They mourn when they should mourn. They're scared when it's appropriate to be scared. They are happy when times are good, but still have that gloominess that is comparable to when you have something you must do but you keep pushing it off. Most anime characters seem to be based off ideals rather than reality. I believe the characters here have a human like quality that many anime lack.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is freaking gorgeous imo. It looks like it was colored with Copic markers and colored pencils. The backgrounds have a sketchy quality to them which gives it a more human feel. You would usually expect perfect straight lines which seem more computer generated than normal. The characters clothes change many times which is unusual for anime or animation in general. I found that once again, gives it that more personal feeling. The great animation is combined with great camera angles during fighting scenes makes it a joy to watch. tl;dr It looks awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack along with the voice is just amazing. The voices are again, more human-like than other anime. No ultra high pitched voices or over masculine sounding ones. They sound just..normal. The music is amazing as well. I like the calm guitar parts during dialog and whatnot which are contrasted by the fast paced rock pieces during the fight scenes. The opening and ending songs are awesome too. I especially enjoy the opening with the cool violin (probably more appropriate to call fiddle in the case) in the intro of the opening. I don't have much more to say than that I can't wait till the OST comes out :3\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI have very much so enjoyed the ride. The story pacing was just right for the job. The characters slowly build themselves into strong ones. The art is amazing and the music is to die for. Some might find the slowness to be annoying and boring. But, you know, if everyone had the same tastes, likes or interests, it be a boring world. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 10 because I enjoyed it so much and it really struck a chord with me and I hope it can do the same for you.",

            "content": "So I was looking at the news and found the story of a 17 years old boy being stabbed to death in the UK. I read the whole story and it indeed sounded quite tragic. However, I did not shed a tear. His death did not affect me on an emotional level. It was merely a statement that I read but caused no reaction from me.\r\nIs this because I am a cold-hearted person ? I would like to think otherwise. Do you cry when you read about murder on the news ? I have asked this question to several people I know and the unanimousanswer was \"no\".\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it that we cry when we lose a loved one but not when we hear of the death of a random stranger ? This is because we have no memories with this person, no relation, no personal connection whatsoever. Thus we cannot bring ourselves to feel sad when we hear of the death of random strangers.\\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is essentially the same. It is a drama story about death set in an MMORPG-like world with amnesic people as the main characters. And while on paper this mixture of elements may have sounded fantastic, it is actually a mess that is highly heterogeneous. I will proceed to explain why.\\n\\n\r\nThis story starts off with a rather unusual setting: a group of people who have amnesia have all been transported from what we can guess from their clothes to be \"our world\" to an MMORPG fantasy world. Up until that point, everything sounds good.\\n\\n\r\nThese people are then told to enrol to the Reserve Army, which is essentially a fancy name for Adventurers, who explore dungeons and monster-filled locations and make a living out of selling the loot they find there. And here again, instead of creating yet another story like \"Log Horizon\", \"Sword Art Online\" or \"Is It Wrong To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?\", the story focuses on the weakest people banding together as a \"party\". And these people will not go through any kind of Deus Ex Machina power up. They are weak and will only progress very, VERY slowly. This is acknowledged from the beginning. There again, this was an interesting concept but this is not what the actual core of the anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the rest of this review without going through a SPOILER ALERT although what I am about to spoil is very heavily foreshadowed from as soon as episode 1. Anyway, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show actually revolves around is the death of one of the party members. It can barely even be called a plot twist since the show was almost screaming at us from episode 1 that a character would die, and the title of the anime is already a huge hint.\\n\r\nBut while this was aimed to be the major selling point of the anime, this is unfortunately where everything starts going wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, you can make an incredible story revolving around the loss of a loved one. An example of this is \"AnoHana\". But making this the core of the anime means that you have to dedicate enough time to each character for us to care about their emotions as they try to cope with the death of their friend. This is where the show contradicts with its original setting. \\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar tries to make its audience care about the death of a character we literally knew nothing about. The characters did, but we did not. Why ? Because their backstory was brushed off as \"amnesia\". Although a bit problematic, this would not have been an issue if the character who died had enough screen time to make us care about him. But this is not the case here. This brings us to another huge problem of this anime: its pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime is... terribly slow. Slow to the point where you can actually say that a maximum of 1 or 2 things happen per episode. By that I mean the characters going to one location, then going back and it's already the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong. I don't mind slow paced anime. If done right, this can lead to some amazing world creation along with great character development. This is actually something that is needed when you introduce us to a world with a different setting, such as this MMORPG-like world here. However, it is important to remember that this anime is only 12 episodes. Take any other anime that has the same pacing such as \"Log Horizon\" or \"Utawarerumono\" and you will see they are 25 episodes long. To sum it up, the pacing does not fit the amount of episodes at all. \\n\\n\r\nCoupled with the slow pace of this anime is the fact that past the death of this one person, the anime becomes incredibly repetitive. If I had to sum up episode 6, 7 and 8 in only a few words, I would probably say the exact same thing: \"they wake up, talk a bit, go hunt for goblins, loot them, talk more and go back in town\". \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this story had some potential to be really interesting but it just tries to do too much at the same time and ends up accomplishing nothing. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters now... is what I'd normally say. But there's almost nothing to say about the characters because the fact that they all have amnesia strips them from the beginning from having any kind of important backstory. The only thing I can use to judge them is the glimpse of personality I can see forming over the duration of the long, long 25 minutes I spend watching these characters do nothing... every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then, I don't want to go into details about their personality because it brings nothing to the show. If anything, I'd like to mention that this show might have been a little less annoying without Ranta. For one, I can't stand his voice actor but his overall attitude just makes me wonder how anyone else in the party can tolerate him being around.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the one question that sticks with me for the entire duration of the show is: \"Why should I care ?\". Why should I care for that person who died ? Why should I care if the characters are sad ? Why should I care about what they're doing ?\" Only after asking this question over and over again do I realise the harsh truth: I don't care about any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow if we are talking about the artwork, I can praise the effort A-1 Pictures made to try to go down an original road and use watercolour backgrounds... And although they do look gorgeous as standalone backgrounds, it is stunning how badly it merges with the characters who are obviously drawn using a very different art-style. This unfortunately also makes the already mediocre animation suffer.\\n\r\nThe artwork of the character... well I can't say I like it. If anything it looks like the typical kind of artwork used in a majority of A-1 Pictures' shows although I still would rate this one amongst their worst ones.\\n\r\nIn fact, I have a hard time accepting the fact that they almost forgot to draw eyebrows on one of the main female characters (Shihoru) and left it that way for the rest of the show. And yes, I checked the original artwork from the light novel and she is supposed to have normal eyebrows, so I don't know what happened there.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is probably the only thing that saves this show from being a 1 or 2 out of 10 for me. It was really beautiful and fitted very well with the sad scenes. I find myself wondering though if it was a good idea to use upbeat music during the fight scenes after the death of that one character instead of carrying on using calm and tragic music for the rest of the show. Maybe that would have made me a bit more sad (in a good way). I found the OP very good too and equally fitting.\\n\\n\r\nI probably don't have to describe my personal enjoyment at this point as I have made it clear from what I already wrote that I was bored during the entire show, during each episode. I don't remember feeling so emotionally detached from the entire cast in a long time. And this is clearly a bad thing when the whole point of the show is to try to have me care about these very characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the very few anime I would recommend you to outright skip, unless you're ready to invest time into characters that are as uninteresting as a brick.",

            "content": "In case you don't want to read the whole review I've put a possible Pro/Con list at the bottom.\r\nSPOILER FREE! 10 out of 10 is my personal rating, you guys will feel differently to me since we're not the same person.\r\nI'll try to keep this review to a level which gives enough information to choose whether you want to watch the anime or not, this anime has alot of reviews from both ends of the spectrum, some saying it was amazing, others saying it was complete crap to them.\r\nSmall starting overview\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar, isn't your typical fantasy anime, it starts off slowly developingand is focussed on a party who seem to have no direction as to what they want to achieve other than surviving after suddenly waking up in Grimgar and being told they will work as mercernaries in order to make money.\\n\\n\r\nUniqueness\\n\r\nSome viewers would complain about the party having no direction and starting off weak, but I think this is what makes the anime start off interesting as not every party or character starts off being able to kill another creature so easily nor does everyone start off being a prodigy in their role.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's party\\n\r\nThe party consists of different contrasting personalities which don't seem to fit their roles very well other than the party leader Manato, but this makes for better development and shows the progress the characters make throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe contrasting personalities clash with each other, showing that not every party works so swimmingly as you see in some animes, it shows how those personalities can hinder compatibility to work together well, as well as small mistakes in this anime can entail dire results for the most part, which I quite like, since it is a world of kill or be killed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter building\\n\r\nYou see the characters grow from being afraid of certain things and tasks to growing accustom to carrying them out, after certain events transpire, you see how it affects the characters, the relationships, their very outlooks on their surroundings and personal capability. Which leads to the characters having to realize how they should fulfill their role in the party or what the role they are meant to fill is in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's physical development\\n\r\nThe character development physically is great, it's not that the characters get some over the top powerful unique skill accustomed only to them giving them the power to trounce all foes in 1 mighty blow, but instead it's moves which can be physically learnt by the more adept role carriers and actually make sense. This also leads to the point of taking damage, one thing I love about this anime is when a character is cut, stabbed or hurt, they feel it and show it, they don't ignore it like it's nothing but they have the more appropriate reactions of actually staring at the wound and looking like they're going to scream in pain or actually do scream in pain.\\n\\n\r\nArt Style\\n\r\nThe art style differs from other animes too, it uses a nice colour pallete blend to get many different tones and shades for different scenes, and when showing the scenes themselves, they look like very nicely painted pieces of art, then adding the characters and the events of the anime gives a refined touch.\\n\\n\r\nDeveloped design of enemies/character\\n\r\nThe enemies so far have been nicely designed and the characters get their goals and priorities about them which feels nice, some characters grow onto you while others seem to do things which you question.\\n\\n\r\nPossible Pros/Cons\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\nAn anime with an unforgiving environment\\n\r\nParty isn't instant masters\\n\r\nCharacters learn skills logically\\n\r\nNicely animated (IMO)\\n\r\nVery noticable character development\\n\r\nCharacter's weaknesses and strengths are well portrayed.\\n\r\nAmazing soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\nSome might not like the art style\\n\r\nThe characters might come across as annoying to some\\n\r\nCharacters won't fulfill all of the viewers expectations at every turn\\n\r\nDevelopment is slowly paced\\n\r\nCharacters don't start off with big goals",

And so it just matters if it's your genre type or not and whether the art style is your thing or not.\r\nWohoo.\r\nSo this isn't SAO or Log Art Horizon but it's similar. It's more based on emotional styles trying to get you to feel for the team as they develop their journey. This is an adventure trapped in a D&D type style game, not necessarily an MMO.So there you go. Little exploration of previous lives but mostly focused on surviving and developing. More drama than action admittedly and I do prefer action, but oh well it's an intro season, maybe a 25 episode season in a year will help it better.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it if you like the sub genre and give it a chance for a few episodes and it really picks up later in the 5th or so I find but that's all up to you. 7/10 of course.\\n\\n\r\n340+ \"helped me\" reviews from the stupidest review at the top, so hopefully people can use this to counter that.",

It was a take on a fantasy world one might find in a game, but shows it from the character's perspective as a real world experience.  Imagine what it would be like to really be in a world with goblins and other gargantuan creatures like in video games with their video game powers?  Imagine that but without the possibility of being revived or being able to restart?  Thats some scary stuff.  To me, thegreatest part of the anime was the ability to capture real life thoughts and feelings in a survival situation and present it in this format.  I felt compelled to finish this anime and there are many I give up on within 4 epsiodes if it develops slowly, but this is one anime of which I do not regret finishing and waiting for the climax.  The art was unique and lovely.  It showed a medival world in a style I can only word as similar to studio ghibli.  If you like a story which captures medieval life and the struggle to be living in a real life game-like fantasy world through great imagery and suspense, then give this one a try.",

At the beginning, it seemed like if would be like Log Horizon, where people are trapped in a video game, and try to find a way out. But in Grimgar, the fact that they were brought into the world of Grimgar is irrelevant, so much so I wonder why the plot point was even established. But once you look past it, and instead focus on the journey that Haruhiro and his group go through, you get a great anime.\r\nFor short anime like this, it's generally better to besimpler. Unless you really know what you're doing, simpler will work much better, and Grimgar shows that. It has a simple premise, and works to flesh it out. It's sort of artsy, but has the style and characters to support it. It's almost a slice of life, in a way. This turned out to be one of the better shows of the season, and I would recommend it.",

            "content": "Grimgar does things only a few of it's anime ilk would dare try. Make it's Characters actually have to work to get stronger. Though it's kind of a double edge sword in certain aspects. The whole Story is just kinda....there. The whole from another world aspect seemed to almost be in after thought for the author. They all could of just been characters that were already part of this world and they grew up together. But to add that is just redundant. How'd they learn the language, do they know each other from there world, how did they even cross over?  I don't knowif they will ever actually do something about that in the manga or possible other seasons but come on. \\n\r\n     I love this art style. Some of the back drops for the fight scenes are fantastic, and the Characters are all drawn wonderfully. I only wish they would do something with the opening and closing. I haven't watched to many shows that have come out recently, but there so plain and uninteresting. \\n\r\n     The Voice acting for the most part was alright though I would of done something different with Mary's character. It's just with every other character whether it be an emotional scene or a fight scene they would actually get be going as well, just not with her.\\n\r\n       The Biggest draw back is the way they developed the Characters. I mean it felt like only Haruhiro had any real development through the main cast. But don't get me wrong here. Each of them has the own endearing moment in the show but when it comes to actually growing as a character it's almost non-existent. Then again when the author decides to make it a thing to where they are forgetting everything about the world they came from doesn't help them in the slightest.\\n\r\n     There is no serious issues with Grimgar just nothing that will make you think back to it. I would be interested in finding out why they came to that world but i don't think the Author is. Binge watch the Show in an afternoon, and forget about it later.\\n",

            "content": "Introduction\r\n- Gimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a unique series in a oversaturated genre. Where other series make their characters into overpowered heroes, or have them completing quests regardless of their competency or the competency of their party, Gimgar it asks the question: \"what if real life people were thrown into a fantasy world and had to use swords, kill semi-intelligent and skilled creatures to survive... they'd probably get killed or hurt\" and that's pretty much how the show goes. The heroes aren't invincible, they feel vulnerable, and afraid they'll actually get killed. That element of danger hangs about them at all times, they NEVERmake you feel like they are safe. Even when they get a hang of their situation it is still never presented as safe work.\\n\\n\r\nThe Premise\\n\r\n- Our heroes wake up in a fantasy world, not exactly able to remember who they were, or why. They find that the world is tough, it requires money to survive, and the best way for them to do so is to go on quests to scrape by. But they find that killing real life creatures isn't easy, and it's dangerous work. When the goblins die they let out screams, they get angry seeing their friends dead, they struggle and push back as our hero stabs him in the chest.\\n\r\n- The world itself is very much a video game. There aren't exactly levels, but each character fits into a class, and they learn abilities that range from complex magic to simple movement abilities. Yet, even for these attributes, equipment your success in combat is very much up to your own skill. The fights are set realistically, rather than most one-on-one shounen fights that might feature breaks in the battle where the characters have internal monologues. These fights are short, sweet, and bloody. And, if a character dies they only have a limited time to bury their bodies in a holy land before they are revived as a zombie.\\n\\n\r\nOften, Dark Souls is thrown around to describe anything that is \"hardcore\", but that might be an appropriate way to describe how this series functions verses Sword Art Online or Konosuba. A single slipup could cost you your life.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: FANTASTIC.\\n\r\n- Easily one of the best \"trapped in a fantasy world / video game\" if you're hungering for a show where you don't have to suspend your disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nStory -- Good\\n\r\n- The story is simple. They're trying to survive. It doesn't try to be flashy, and it doesn't need to be flashy. The focus is on the characters, their motivations, and the dangers they face. The little progression that happens is impactful and meaningful\\n\\n\r\nArt -- Good\\n\r\n- The show tries to have a unique feeling art that really characterizes the show differently than others. It feels appropriate and does an effective job.\\n\\n\r\nSound -- Good\\n\r\n- The voice acting is good, the audio itself is very good with nice sword sounds, nice detailing in the sound environment that makes the show immersive. Very effective, zero complaints, but it's not going down into some \"best of\" list either.\\n\r\n- The music is effective too, it can get you on your feet or rapidly clicking for the next episode on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- Fantastic\\n\r\n- The characters feel far more human and three-dimensional than most anime. The show uses typical anime tropes for them, but the personalities and interactions of each character is far more complex and relatable than the tsundere or moe-blobs of other shows. I can't say that most shows (even with characters I enjoy a lot) give off this human feeling that you can see in Gimgar, most characters in other shows have cooler back stories, or do cooler things, but they're often just a tired trope thrown into a new wrapper. Gimgar takes these tropes and mixes in the human element. I can't stress how great these characters are, they're something you don't often see done this well in most shows.\\n\r\n- Features perhaps one of the best \"defrosting\" of a icy character I've ever seen, as well as making you generally dislike certain people yet by the end have you understanding and rooting for their friendship. It's really amazing how far the show is able to go with the same tropes we've seen time and time again, I really knew these characters as friends in the twelve episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- Fantastic\\n\r\n- I really enjoyed this show. It burned slow, but it burned good. After a tiring watch of dozens of other shows, this smaller scale series with more relatable characters, immersion and realism really stuck with me. I've enjoyed Log Horizon, I've had my checkered history with Sword Art Online, I've enjoyed Konosuba, but this show made me go, \"Wow, if I were in a video game... I'd probably get stabbed to death by the first guy I fought, and that's basically this show in a nutshell, I've never seen anything like this.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall -- Fantastic\\n\r\n- There are plenty of elements of this series that I think are just \"good\", but the parts of this series that are fantastic are far heavier than anything else. I like realistic series, especially after getting tired of superpowered heroes. This hit at the right moment, and did what it set out to do with little flaws. It didn't fail to do something, but still end up good; it did what I wanted it to, and it did what it wanted to do.\\n\\n\r\n[NOTE: My rating system does not use numbers, I prefer words:\\n\r\nmasterpiece; 10\\n\r\nfantastic, best of its 'class'; 9\\n\r\ngood; 8-7\\n\r\nflawed gem; 6-5\\n\r\naverage/forgettable; 4-3\\n\r\nbad; 2\\n\r\ninsulting; 1]",

            "content": "In recent years, fantasy films like sword art online & log horizon have become so popular and effective . Many producers begin to mimic, and borrow this fundamental structure where they begin their plot with characters being \"stuck in a fantasy world\". Konosuba, Grimgar are examples of it. Compared to other series, Grimgar has the potential to achieve the depth that other series cant, and produce a brilliant masterpiece.\r\nStory:\r\n[Please be reminded that this review is based on the current season,]Anyways, the pacing of the show is horrible. The show can take as long as 20 whole seconds where the frame is still. And there aremany repetitions throughout the story. The story is also extremely generic , and i have seen better approaches from different series. However, one thing that is different from many animes is that Grimgar gives closure. It properly finishes off an arc and it addresses all issues very well. Basically, the plot is well cemented and it is impossible to find loopholes. Balancing both pros and cons, i would say that the story is sub-par, if not slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAt first glance, anyone who have seen the trailer etc would know that the art is stunning, and captivating. A-1 Pictures has repeatedly shown us that it is capable of producing high quality Art and animation through films like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Nanatsu no taizai.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening is really good, background music is not something that is worth remembering. Thats all i can say\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacter development is fantastic, unlike many series, this show takes PLENTY of time to properly groom their characters. As this season approaches an end, we can see how the characters differ from their original selves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nSomething i would not mind watching on a weekly basis. But its definitely not something that you would extremely look forward to. Like for e.g ERASED\\n\r\nIts a pretty decent anime if i would put it in words.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7/10. Still, this show has the potential to do well .\\n\r\n Reply       My Messages",

            "content": "Here's my review of Grimgar: Fantasy and Ash (2016)(edited)\r\nGrimgar is a video game Isekai anime. One that many don't know of.\r\nThe plot is quite generic. Some people are sent to this video game world called Grimgar, but all of them have lost most of their memories. All they remember is their names and that they come from a different world.\r\n6 of these young men and women form a team and join the border patrol corps who defend the lands owned by humans from other races. \r\nThe plot is just them trying to get better at being soldiers and trying to earn a living. There's nospecific thing they're trying to do or achieve and that is the thing that keeps this show from getting a 10.\\n\r\nIt, however, has some of the best characters I've seen in anime, ever. They are all relatable and everything about them is realistic. They act like real people. Something you almost never see or expect from an anime. The characters made me feel feels in 4 episodes. Something that took Your Lie in April 24 episodes to achieve.\\n\r\nThe art style is unique. The background is completely watercolored. Something I've never seen in anime before. Also, it's made by A-1 pictures so of course it's fucking beautiful.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special. It's good but not exactly memorable. The sound effects, however, are fantastic. Basically, you can hear everything that happens around the characters. Very Immersive.\\n\r\nOne last thing that makes the show good is the combat. Just like the characters, the combat is ultra realistic. The characters aren't OP from the start like every other Isekai anime out there. If they die, they die. There is no respawn. There is no healing potion that anyone can use. if you want to get healed, you need to have a priest in your party. In the first fight scene, it took our 6 main characters about 10 minutes to take down 1 low-level goblin. Not because they couldn't overpower him if they tried, but because it was the first real fight of their lives and their survival instincts told them to run, get out of there as soon as possible. They were inexperienced, and they had no skill. If it were any other anime, the main character would take down a horde of those goblins without even trying. Cuz \"they're just goblins\". Again, anime combat doesn't get any more realistic than this.\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers.\r\nOne word to describe this anime: SLOW.\r\nProgression is so slow that I struggled to make it to the 4th episode, and even though apparently things were supposed to pick up on the 4th episode - I felt to grievance or empathy to this group of people nor do I actually care if they survive being placed in this world (be it amnesia or not). Nothing. I feel nothing but complete bore. The characters don't give off the emotional vibes that a normal, decent anime would give. I don't know what to expect in the future of this anime. I don't knowwhy they are there doing what they are doing. And I wish I could see other parties do something out there besides Haruhiro and his group of misfits. *sighs* It might take me a while to finish this anime, and I'm not even sure if I COULD finish it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe positives? Probably the art and the water-coloring. Apart from that, it's hard to see any other good in it, sorry to say. \\n\\n\r\nWish it could be better. It was set in such a nice setting and environment and reminds me so much of SAO or something of that genre. However, AGAIN - story progression is too slow, and I'm wondering how one can be stuck killing goblins for so long (because this doesn't even happen in MMORPGs).",

            "content": "I'll keep this short and to the point, as I am not well educated in \"reviewing\" things.\r\nI'll simply start with this; While I would give this an 8, Grimgar is not a show everyone will enjoy there are mixed opinions on it everywhere you look. HOWEVER, Watch this show, at the very least the First episode, as it perfectly frames what to expect out of it. The show is slowly paced, it doesn't have the over the top fights or flashy anything really so if that's what you're looking for it will disappoint. even those looking for a plot-heavy series will find this lacking. Thisis a show about the characters and what it means and takes for them to live in a new environment. and if you can adapt to the slow pacing of the show, there is a real beauty in it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is set in a Rpg game-ish world, it is far from the standard set by other shows like it, and this uniqueness to it is its greatest asset. The show is not Plot oriented, in fact, the plot is almost non-existent and even the setting is incredibly vague, however, that is because this is not a show about adventure or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nat the core of the show, it is actually simple, it's about kids growing up in a sense. Kids who have never had to fight or work are forced to fend for themselves. nothing is given to them. this world does not have a health bar or anything like other shows of this nature, in order to defeat something, you have to kill it, and they don't go down easily, even the extremely low-level creatures desperately fight for their lives as well, after all, they are sentient and trying to survive just like our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nthe show doesn't pull its punches when it comes to realism and that is the shows defining trait. it's simply a show about unexperienced kids coping with their situation and trying to make ends meet. and there is a beauty to that premise. The show is slowly paced, it doesn't have the over the top fights or flashy anything really, its very bare bones and...realistic.\\n\\n",

            "content": "From glancing at a few other reviews, it seems that this anime is not very well liked.\r\nBefore you stop reading this, I'll make some points \r\n-It's really hard to develop a solid story with only 12 episodes\r\n-It's an RPG-like anime, there are specific things in this genre that can't happen very easily (reviews are supposed to be unbiased, right?)\r\n-Not every story needs to be some mind-boggling or complex mystery\r\nStory\r\nYeah, not exactly a sweet spot of the series. It doesn't really exist. There is some sort of a story, but only about as much as 12 episodes can get. It's mostly an anime about how anRPG would work with more realistic elements (behavior, physics, basically all the things that some video game can't take into account).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as a heads up, the anime only covers the first 2 LN's of the series. From what I know, the first 4 episodes make up most of the first LN, which is rather rushed, resulting in a lack of sympathy and emotion for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nA really strong point of Grimgar. For the most part, the characters are drawn like those of SAO or other neatly drawn anime, but from time to time, they get to switch to a watercolor-like style (in which most of the backgrounds and other stationary objects are displayed), which is really unique, and looks like the art of the LN's (and also reminds me of concept art for games). \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing super amazing. The music was definitely different from most anime, and usually added to make the scenes more fluid. At some points, it did get in the way, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nMost of the characters are \"clich\u00e9d\" types of characters, though there is clearly some effort made to defy the clich\u00e9s (I won't spoil anything). For the most part, this worked well with the series. Most people seem to criticize the lack of development, however. 12 episodes people. You can't make some profoundly in-depth character fast enough to tell a story in that amount of time. It definitely met the standards of other anime (excluding anime with very few characters) in terms of development.\\n\\n\r\nThe clich\u00e9s were also part of the story. It goes into a few characters to show that, despite their clich\u00e9d appearance, they do have originality. It was rarely overdone, and compared to sooo many other anime, it definitely had more detailed and interesting characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. Very much. I'm a big fan of RPG's, and the RPG anime genre hasn't disappointed me yet. If you don't like RPG's, then you're bound to have a bone to pick with Grimgar. Nice and simple.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hai To Sensou No Grimgar was very good, as far as 12 episode anime go. Compared to longer, more complex anime, it doesn't hold up so well, but compared to other short anime, it stands out a bit. If you like RPG's, then watch it. If you dislike any elements of RPG's, then this might be one to skip.",

            "content": "On the cover, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar might look like your typical trapped-in-a-fantasy anime, but in reality, it\u2019s more than that. This is another example of not judging anime by its cover. The premise may start off typical, but unlike most anime of the same genre which proceed to the plot, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar stays back behind and focuses on its characters and their character relationships. For something that is very fictional, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar feels very human, and that\u2019s exactly what I want from an anime. With fantastic art and a great score to support it, it feels likea complete package.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar might be something you heard before. It\u2019s about a bunch of people who awake in this alternate world, not knowing how they got here. They don\u2019t even know their pass. Our main characters join up to be a group that will protect this town from nearby monsters, while earning some loot in order to survive. Even though Hai to Gensou no Grimgar sets up a promising plot, it doesn\u2019t go much forward with it because it spends most of its time with its characters. It\u2019s a character-driven anime more than a plot-driven anime. However some plot points in this anime are really good and it focuses on some very key things such as how to cope with the loss of a friend, how to improve your skills in order to survive, and how to be a role model of someone and be a good leader. Also knowing more about certain characters, such as one that get introduce later is really good. Although, due to a very slow pacing, the anime doesn\u2019t do much with its plot in this 12-episode series. Many questions are still left unanswered so it would be great if this anime gets a continuation. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a character-driven anime rather than a plot-driven anime. The pacing in the anime is very, very slow so the plot isn\u2019t fully explored. But with the time given, the anime tries its best to focus on the characters and it succeeds in doing so. The pacing helps in letting you breathe with these characters and see from their perspective of how they feel about the current situation. The atmosphere in this anime is also fantastic. The town feels so beautiful that I feel like I want to stay there, while the more dangerous areas really feel frightening. The way the anime contrasts the locations is very top-notch. The directions given in this anime is fantastic\u2026 for most of the part. One annoying thing about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its inconsistent tone and cringe-worthy moment of in-between. Most of these moments are its fanservice here and there which can be distracting. Also some lewd conversations just make it worse. Other than that the presentation in Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is very consistent. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nEasily the best thing about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its characters. For an anime that is very character-driven, it is very important for the anime to have great characters and this anime succeeds in that. Our group of main characters is a great bunch of characters each having their own specialties. Our main protagonist, Haruhiro, is a very interesting character that changes its traits throughout the story. At first, he was shown to be a very dependent character as he would do what his leader said. Haruhiro really lacked in confidence until he slowly becomes an independent character after certain events, and gains confidence for himself and his party. Manato is a role model for Haruhiro, who is a big reason why the party develops as characters. Ranta\u2019s also a pretty interesting character. At times he might just be there to add some comedy, but his reaction to certain events are very believable. The female characters, such as Yume and Shihoru, felt like they were just there for the fanservice until we get to see how they react to certain plot moments and how they end up important for the story. Mogzo might be the least developed character, primarily because he\u2019s the character that\u2019s in between the situation, observing other characters\u2019 reactions. Mary, who comes later is the story is fantastically developed as her backstory works and the way she changes as a character was really well done. The best thing about the characters is that they feel very human. The way they react and act is very natural and realistic. The bonds they make and the relationships they have with other characters is really good too.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAnother very strong point in Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is its art \u2013 it gorgeous. The art style is very unique and very neat. The backgrounds have this water color feel to it. The landscape look extremely beautiful with the art style. The architectures also benefits from the art style too. The character designs aren\u2019t the most unique, but they are aesthetically pleasing. Some of the females\u2019 attire might be questionable, but it\u2019s nothing too bad. The contrast between the character design (which is standard anime art) and the background design (which is very unique art) is done really well. The contrast helps the characters stand out (which is actually pretty cool since it\u2019s a character-driven anime) while making the backgrounds catch your attention. \\n\r\nArt: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations in Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is also really good. The animations are very smooth and crisp. During action sequences, the animation is consistent and fluid. The anime also likes to rotate or pan its camera view during fights (such as rotating around a character and a monster fighting) and it looks really cool and really stylish. One complaint is that the anime at times uses still shots at times, especially during the more dramatic and emotional moments. Even though this still shots looks pretty fancy and stylish, it\u2019s obviously there to same budget and time, which isn\u2019t a bad thing because it is understandable to do such a thing when they have some really good animations here and there. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is pretty good, but it definitely isn\u2019t the highlight of the series. Hosoya Yoshimasa did a really good job as Haruhiro. As a narrator of the story, his voice is strong when necessary. And during emotional scenes, Hosoya does a good job in showcasing the sadness inside Haruhiro. Shimazaki Nobunaga was alright as Manato, but nothing really stood out. Sam goes for Ochiai Fukushi as Mogzo. Yume and Shihoru\u2019s voice acting, done by Komatsu Mikako and Terui Haruka, do what they have to do, but they don\u2019t do more than what the script asks. Yoshino Hiroyuki did a really good job as Ranta as his voice really stands out. He does both the energetic and pissed of Ranta perfectly fine. Also Anzai Chika does a fine job as Mary, despite being new in the industry. Overall, the voice acting works well in this anime, but more could have been done with their scripts. However, Haruhiro, Mary and Ranta\u2019s seiyuu do a really good job and stand out from the rest. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music is another good thing about Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. The OP, \u201cKnew day\u201d is really catchy and and upbeat. It\u2019s definitely one of the better OP of the season. The vocals are really good in the OP too. The ED, \u201cHarvest\u201d (which is done by the same group that did the OP), is very good. It\u2019s soothing, relaxing and quite emotional. It works better with the emotional episodes. Again, the vocals are top-notch. The background music used in the anime is also pretty good. During fights, the anime doesn\u2019t use very suspenseful music and I believe that was actually a smart choice. The background music is really relaxing. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar has a lot of insert songs, almost one for each episode. Most of them are very good, though some of them don\u2019t always match the mood. \\n\r\nMusic: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI enjoyed Hai to Gensou no Grimgar a lot more than I expected. What first started out to be a very clich\u00e9 anime, turned out to be one of the better ones of its genre. I really liked the slow pace it took as it let me see these characters develop properly. I may have wanted a little more from the plot as you don\u2019t get much from it. But the soothing atmosphere and beautiful art made me feel really relaxed when I watched this. But the thing I got the most from Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was its characters. It\u2019s been I while since I\u2019ve seen realistic characters like these. Some people may not have the patience to watch this anime due to its pacing, but it\u2019s definitely worth a try. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar was both a surprise and not. It lived up to the hype it had so there\u2019s no surprise in there, but it turned out to not be clich\u00e9 as the key visuals made it look like (so that\u2019s a surprise). The characters are fantastic and are the primary reason why this anime is worth checking out. Add some fantastic art and soothing atmosphere, you got one great anime. I did wish that the questions that were made by this anime were answered (such as how they got to this world), but it was expected to end like this due to its pacing and length. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is definitely something that deserves your attention. \\n\\n\r\n+ More character-driven than story-driven and it works well.\\n\r\n+ Fantastic characters and them and their relationships with one another is well developed\\n\r\n+ Slow pacing that lets the characters flesh out and the setting stand out more \\n\r\n+ Art style is fantastic and backgrounds look really beautiful\\n\r\n- Some unnecessary comedic moments and distracting fanservice.\\n\r\n- Even though mainly character-heavy, the plot doesn\u2019t move much and many questions left unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10",

            "content": "Fantasy lovers sure have a glut of choices of late. Grimgar is one of the more serious takes of the genre, focusing on a group of low-level leftovers that are forced to band together for sheer survival. Very few things go well for the group, which starts off so weak as to not even fend off the lowest class of enemy. It's a pretty stark contrast with Konosuba, the slapstick, giant-toad fighting alternative in the genre. Grimgar doesn't have all that many comic moments as its inhabitants are all too often reminded of their fragile existence.\r\nGrimgar is a grind, its characters take time to buildon the viewer and the early episodes aren't particularly good. However, if you do sit through it, it develops into an involved, intriguing world full of opportunities and character relationships. Though still outclassed in atmosphere and story by SAO, Grimgar is an interesting, if slightly dark, take on the genre.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Animation:[/b]\\n\r\nThe show wants to tell you that it's different from other shows, and that comes across immediately in its unique drawing style. The show's backgrounds are drawn with thick brushes to give it a patchy, painted appearance, a sharp departure from the crisp and clear style typical of other current shows. This is combined with nice effects such as lens flares during sunsets to give an immersive feel. Interesting details are put into the show as well, such as specialized tools to deal with the archaic means of cooking. Unlike Konosuba the characters here don't focus on cuteness or ecchi, they're more understated overall. Character styling isn't what I'd consider the show's strong point, and likewise character expressions are only average. You do get a FSN Archer clone as a background character though. Antagonists in the show are mostly unrecognizable fodder mobs with a few more notable creatures later in the show. There are also a few wardrobe malfunctions where clothing magically change color within a scene.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a significant amount of action in this show; that said, we're not watching master swordsmen like in SAO or Rurouni Kenshin. The breed of action in this show is more brute force as our newbies continue to land ineffective blows or outright miss. Expect a significant amount of blood and light gore as early on the show highlights each battle and details every single death. There is a bit of suggestive ecchi in the forms of bouncy body parts and a rather exposed teacher for our protagonist, but relatively insignificant compared to the direct nature found in Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound:[/b]\\n\r\nThe sound package of the show was much more typical than the animation. The show opens with a rock-based piece with a fitting though slightly bland melody. The ED is a slow piece that starts a bit sad but builds to a nice melody. The BGM isn't particularly unique but serves its purpose well enough; some of the calmer pieces are a bit sleep-inducing though. There is a ton of nice insert songs but the animation is mostly just still frames summarizing events.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist hails from former leading roles in 35th Anti-Magic Platoon and Strike the Blood. Though fairly strong, I wasn't convinced that the voice fit the wishy-washy lead character. Mikako Komatsu is by far the strongest voice as the energetic and free-spirited Yume, who also often refers to herself in the third person. The rest of the cast was mixed, ranging from the underwhelming presence of Shihoru to the honestly annoying commentary from Ranta.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Story:[/b]\\n\r\nUnlike other stuck-in-MMO shows that I've watched, the characters here just mysteriously wake up in Grimgar, with only faint memories of their previous lives in references to cell phones and planes. Given only a petty sum of money, they are forced to form teams and complete kill quests to survive.\\n\\n\r\nThough nothing like Konosuba in atmosphere, the show does feel similar in how random the plot is at times; this is more of a character-driven show. The pacing is almost painfully slow early on but eventually starts to pick up pace in the later episodes. The show builds to a pretty intense climax and ends with a fair conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of overall feel, the show is a bit on the dark side with an almost obsessive focus on death and dealing with loss. That said their inhibition towards murdering low-level monsters definitely diminishes through the show. There are a few unanswered questions in the show such as the nature of the Kara no Kyoukai like cutting lines and why there is a need for so many different classes in a party.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the show doesn't feel like it makes a lot of progress and that is unfortunately what sticks out the strongest.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Character:[/b]\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, there are some pretty nice character interactions; not the boy endlessly fondling girls type of interactions but actual conversations and arguments over various topics. However, that's about it for the positives here. The characters grow through the show but not in the ways I would have expected. Yes, everyone gains new abilities and perhaps a tad bit of HP but there is only fleeting moments of character relationships. What's worse, I felt that all the characters besides Merry (a comically ironic name) are essentially flat, static characters. You can take your typical range of character archetypes and add a sprinkling of occasional gloom and you'll land with what's in the show. Perhaps what really did it for me was the lack of relatability, without which the entire imminent death thing was irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Value:[/b]\\n\r\nWhile carrying interesting visuals and a unique, underdog approach to the fantasy genre, Grimgar fails to captivate the viewer. Often lost in a plethora of uninspiring and frankly pessimistic characters, the show greatly lacks energy until the final scenes. If you're looking for an immersive environment and don't mind shallow characters, give this a try. If you're looking for an entertaining fantasy show, Konosuba is the show of the season. If you're looking strong characters and plot, go for SAO.",

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash Review...\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe idea of a show where a character or group of characters are thrust into fantasy setting with life or death consequences is not a new idea in anime, as a matter of fact, you could even say the market is borderline saturated with them these days\u2026 But for good reason. I don\u2019t know why, but we all enjoy the idea of these shows\u2026 But they all seem to have one thing in common, and that\u2019s failure in execution. Whether it\u2019s character design, storytelling, deus ex machina plot twists, or the creator or director of the series just deciding totake a huge dump on the fan base, they never live up to what they could be. That brings me to Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash. Unlike every other show I\u2019ve seen with this narrative, it really seems to get things right. From the characters, to the story, to the exposition, to the setting and background art style\u2026 It\u2019s all just handled beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\r\nAt first glance, the characters really have appear to bring nothing to the table. For the first couple of episodes, they all seem pretty generic and \u201ctrope-y\u201d. Then episode 4 happens. In a plot twist that everyone can see from a mile away (I mean it\u2019s in the OP\u2026), The Party\u2019s leader, Manato dies. Manato is the first character to really receive any development in the show, and it\u2019s repeatedly established how he is the pillar that is holding up the building. From this point on, something great happens. Haruhiro, the main character and his friends start to get some real development. The whole party\u2019s depth and range of emotions are on full display after Manato\u2019s death. Even the hot-headed, annoying as crap Ranta shows that he has a side that can be mournful and empathetic. Yume the hunter and best girl, Moguzo the warrior, and Shihoru the mage sort of get the short end of the stick on the development side, but Ranta\u2019s development over the past few episodes, Mary\u2019s development through the middle, and Haruhiro\u2019s growth throughout are really great to watch. Side characters really aren\u2019t a thing in this show. I\u2019m leaving a lot out, but the characters are great, just take my word on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot \\n\r\nThis is where we get a little separation from the norm in regards to the genre. Our band of characters are introduced to this new world with no memories of their past, but everyone somehow knows that they don\u2019t belong in Grimgar. Throughout the entire series, characters make references to luxuries that don\u2019t exist in Grimgar, sometimes giving clues as to what the characters did before they arrived.  The story can really be divided into 3 arcs. The first arc is the introduction to Grimgar and death of Manato. These episodes ease you into the world, introduce you to the struggles of the characters, and the parallels between them and the goblins they fight. It also heavily expresses how important Manato is to the group. The second arc is Mary\u2019s introduction and the group\u2019s revenge. Needing a new healer after Manato\u2019s death, the group is put in touch with Mary, a healer who apparently wants nothing to do with the group. After fighting a little fighting, arguing, and planning, the crew plans an assault on the group of goblins that killed Manato. This process leads to Mary opening up to the group, learning to trust again, and really opens the door for Haruhiro as the leader of the group. The final arc is the Kobold Dungeon and Mary\u2019s revenge. After their clash with the goblin group that killed Manato, the goblins are on high alert, forcing the group out of their hunting grounds, into the mines where Mary\u2019s party was killed. To make a long story short, Mary lays her friends to rest by freeing their spirits, the group encounters the big Kobold that killed them, and some minor and unfortunate deus ex machina stuff happens\u2026 But it\u2019s minor. Like allowing Ranta to escape after he sacrificed himself by simply flashing forward, never explaining how he escaped. And then when Haruhiro fights the big kobold\u2026 2 really minor things, but they kinda brought the show down a little. \\n\\n\r\nThe Music/Art/Style\\n\r\nI can\u2019t praise this show enough for its art and animation, I want to particularly draw attention to the landscapes in the background. They often look like oil paintings with the crisp, clean animation rolling in the front of them. It\u2019s really quite marvelous. The soundtrack wasn\u2019t notable except for the OP. It was great\\n\\n\r\nTakeaway \\n\r\nThe takeaway here is we have a story that well told and a complete thought. That is rare in anime. There isn\u2019t much in the way of deus ex machina resolutions and pointless comedy. Although most of the times they try to be funny they fail hard. The fan service level is higher than it needed to be, but it\u2019s not in your face all the time\u2026 Only occasionally. The characters are likeable and not too one dimensional and show some genuine depth and development. The plot is clean, complete, well thought out, and not too complicated. I do have one major problem with this anime, but maybe it will be resolved in an upcoming season? Let\u2019s hope. Nothing is ever revealed about the character\u2019s pasts and how they got to Grimgar\u2026 And that\u2019s something that really needs to be dealt with, and soon\u2026at least if there\u2019s another season to come. Bottom line is I would recommend this to anyone interested in the fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the lack of explanation of the backstory and the not so painful deus ex machina fight resolutions in the final episode, I've got to give Grimgar an 8/10. It's good, no it's really good. My enjoyment level is a 10 because it was a blast to watch and never got too stupid or boring.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash\\n\r\nRating : 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf this gets a second season, i'm going to watch it.",

            "content": "The very specific \u201clight-novel based series about teens trapped in a fantasy world\u201d sub-genre is one that the anime industry seems to have gone overboard with ever since the success of Sword Art Online. With these types of shows hitting the airwaves at a frequent rate almost to the point of over-saturation, a show really needs to do something special with the premise in order to stand out. Unfortunately no one informed the creators of Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash of this fact because this series is painfully dull and mediocre. \r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash has the incredibly basic premise of a group ofteens waking up in a fantasy world with no recollection of how they got there. One thing that Grimgar does differently that is a little unique is that none of the characters can recall what their past life was like. They use terms like \u201cvideo game\u201d or \u201cfield trip\u201d that seem to suggest they come from a contemporary modern day setting but this is never confirmed and the characters seem a bit confused whenever one of these terms are used. The series focuses on a party of six that aren\u2019t fighting to take down some sort of big boss or overthrow a tyrant but rather are just trying to survive. The bulk of the series sees our heroes taking down low level goblins in the forest in order to earn enough money just to live through another day. None of them are OP badasses and it takes the combined effort of all of them just to take down a single goblin at the start of the series. This really intrigued me from the outset in that it was in stark contrast to other similar series such as the aforementioned SAO. Another large plus in the series favour was the art design, in particular the backgrounds which had a feel not unlike a painting. There are some stills in this series that are downright gorgeous and the quality of the art is consistent from beginning to end. Unfortunately any goodwill I initially had towards the series quickly faded as I began to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the 12 episode run, nothing of real consequence actually happens. Sure, there are a few roadblocks on our heroes\u2019 quest to survive and something that could be seen as pretty important happens early on that slightly changes the dynamic of the show, but on the whole the plot is very dull. As I mentioned earlier, there is no real driving force for our protagonists\u2019 actions other than staying alive. This would be fine in a character-focused show (which seems like what they were going for) but the characters would need to be interesting in order for this to work. The characters in Grimgar either embody your standard anime tropes (ie, the stubborn asshole, the shy wilting flower, the strong guy with the heart of gold) or are just plain bland. There is an attempt to deepen one character by giving her a tragic backstory, but its very generic and familiar (especially given the setting) and does little to make the character more interesting. Essentially what we have here is a series that fails at a compelling character study and doesn\u2019t even make an attempt at an overarching plot. There is little here to keep an audience invested except for the promise of something more interesting that never comes to fruition. I kept waiting for the actual plot to kick in only to be thoroughly disappointed. The last straw for me personally came when I made it to Episode 9 entitled \u201cHow to Rest\u201d. I just remember thinking to myself, \u201cReally? The series needs to take a break to have a more laidback episode? What are we taking a break from?! The plot hasn\u2019t even started yet and there are only 3 episodes left!\u201d It was at this point that I realized that the first 8 episodes which I had trudged through in the hopes that something interesting might happen was supposed to be the interesting part. It was not a happy realization. Granted the series does pick up a little bit in the final two episodes where there are some real stakes for once, but it was way too little and way too late. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like your entire enjoyment of Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is going to come from how invested you are in the characters\u2019 personal struggles. Unfortunately I really wasn\u2019t so the show came off as an incredibly bland and uninteresting fantasy series with a few neat ideas and some absolutely killer art. The ending actually gave me hope that the show could turn itself around and become good if it was ever given a second season, that maybe these first 12 episodes were an unnecessarily long prologue to a much greater story, but more than likely if Grimgar did receive a second season it would only set me up for the same kind of disappointment all over again. In the end I can really only recommend this series to two kinds of people, the first would be anyone who absolutely loves this type of show and has already watched the much better versions of the same premise or someone who has just finished watching a truly excellent series and needs an inoffensive palette cleanser before the next one. Everyone else need not apply.",

            "content": "Once again we are presented with another anime where the characters a transported into a fantasy rpg world. With most titles taking the wish fulfilment path, of blazing through the game, this anime took the very long dramatic realistic approach. (The Video Review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nGrimgar is the story about six characters who mysteriously wake up in a Fantasy RPG world, with no recollection of their past life. Now the six characters form a party to get by in the world, but the whole group starts off rather incompetent at first, due to the fact that they\u2019renot really adventurers to begin with. So the overall main story is about the group of characters growing as a party together, learning to become stronger with each other. Later in the series the story focuses more on  the characters helping one of their teammates, which leads to great character growth.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one huge trait that is really noticeable in Grimgar. Which is the overall plot pacing of this anime and the pacing in general. It is very purposely slow pace, so there is a lot of slow dialogues and exposition. The slow pacing also hinders the start of the story when you really don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going until later on. Pair that with the fact, the story is quite boring to begin with until, Mary shows up, the story has a focus around her. However, it does feel like most of the mystery of the world is left out, and you wouldn\u2019t really know what is actually going on by watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show originally starts off with six main characters before adding more character to the mix. But before I get to the protagonist, I would rather get the rest of the party off the list first. First off we have Ranta, who is a hot headed jerk at first who gets a bit of development in his character as he learns to work with them more efficiently, but because of his rude attitude at the start, you really tend to hate him, because of him, the story doesn\u2019t progress as much when he refuses to work with others. Yume is the upbeat friendly party member of the group, due to her personality, she usually clashes with Ranta, she kind of plays the big sister role to everyone. Mogzo is the strong, yet quiet tank of the party, how he is more on the soft side when it comes to his personality. Shihoru is the mage of party, however her character is quite boring. She rarely says a word is quite forgettable in the anime, as she probably does the least compared to everyone else. And lastly we have the party leader, Manato who is the most skilled competent member of the party, he is usually calm and compassionate when it comes to his teammates and a knack for bringing them together.\\n\\n\r\nNow we gotten past those characters, it\u2019s time to talk about the more interesting characters of the show. Haruhiro is the main protagonist of the series and the one who gives out all the narrations. I like Haruhiro as a protagonist as he is starts off just like any other member of the party but grows to learn more about himself and his comrades. He probably is the closest to Manato, and therefore his relationship with Manato helps him grow with him as a leader in his own right. But if there is a complaint I have with Haruhiro, is that he talks really slow and drags out his sentences. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that gets quite a bit of development while also being the most interesting character of the series, is Mary. Mary is introduced later in the series as a girl show joins the party and is initially shown as a cool and cold character at first. She has the most experience when compared to the rest of the party, and only does things which she deems necessary. Her character is fleshed out very well, given a full backstory and development to go with it. Mary is the most interesting character in the series, and the show really picked up when she was introduced.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is one of the aspects this anime shines. The anime has a pretty unique look, I especially love the designs of the watercolour backgrounds. It looks gorgeous and it\u2019s something different from most anime, while also making great use for wallpaper material. But because the backgrounds look very beautiful, the character art style is rather standard for A-1 Pictures, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing, but compared to the background, it just feels very different in general. The animation during the action scenes are quite good, they really know how to drag out fast pace action scenes though. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually really good. It becomes really noticeable during the montage scenes and really adds to the overall atmosphere of the action and scenes. There is a quite the variety of tracks in the ost, so they have quite a the library to fill out the whole show. The opening is pretty good, I really enjoyed it and thought the animation for it was pretty good, until they changed it a bit later on. They changed it from animations to stills of the characters which I found kind of odd later on. The ED is a really nice piece to listen to, the vocals is very beautiful and pair that up with the watercolour image that it goes with, it fits very well. However both ED and the OP later on, are just really stills, and you\u2019re only watching it to listen to the music. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard trying to enjoy this anime. Although I do enjoy the overall story and seeing the growth of the party. It is extremely slow. The anime\u2019s pacing can put any casual fans off. There are many times when characters will either just stare at each other for a few seconds, talk very slowly and a lot of dragged out monologues. Not to mention there a montages in there as well, that can take up so much screen time. Despite that, the anime is still enjoyable because of the mystery of world the characters are in and the things they have to face in order to progress. This become more relevant in the second when Mary is introduce and when the attention was on her, it got interesting. The dungeon raid scenes are quite enjoyable to watch. They feel like a fast pace action scene half the time, but before you know it, they drag out the action scenes as well, and I didn\u2019t even realised this until I looked at the time remaining in the episode. If you can get pass the slow pace scenes it can be an enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 7. The story really starts off quite boring the and slow pacing doesn\u2019t really help it either. However after a couple of episodes, the show gets more focused and finds a direction on where the story actually wants to a go.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 8 and 9. The watercolour backgrounds looks gorgeous and it\u2019s stunningly beautiful as well. The action scenes are well animated and look very good. I wish the character designs were a bit more special to compliment the backgrounds. The soundtrack is amazing, it\u2019s really diverse and adds to the scenes very well. The OP and ED are really good with beautiful vocals.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it a 7. Although it\u2019s a really character driven story, the majority of the characters aren\u2019t really all that interesting. It was only really the development of Haruhiro and the introduction of Mary later on that made the show much more interesting. I do like how the story is about the party learning to grow with each other.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7. It was really hard getting pass the slow pacing of this anime, which can throw many people off. It starts of slow and ends really slowly. There is a quite a few scenes that drag on. But seeing the party grow together in this mystery world is actually quite interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, I give it a 7.5/10. If you can look pass the slow pacing of this anime, it is a rather interesting anime, especially when it\u2019s a really character driven story. And it helps with the introduction of Mary. I recommend this show to fans of the rpg and fantasy genre, as it\u2019s quite different to most of the similar genre.\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is an anime with an overall good story, great character development, a very unique and pretty art style, that matches the atmosphere of the world using bright colors and beautifully drawn scenery. \r\n  The story develops very slowly and starts with poorly presented characters, which is one of its major drawbacks. However if you like slower paced anime that is not rushed like many others and presents its characters slowly over the spawn of few episodes you will most likely find this anime really pleasing.\r\n  The anime does not focus on thestory as much as its focuses on the way the characters feel and view the world as well as the bond between them. The characters themselves develop greatly over time.\\n\\n\r\n  One thing that was really well shown was how even thought in games we fight  low level monsters to gain some EXP and kill them easily by just pressing a button on a keyboard, in reality killing is not an easy thing to do. It's hard for the main characters to kill something after seeing how badly it wants to live. Even the weakest enemies are actual living beings that have a will to live and fight back to survive. \\n\\n\r\n  In conclusion Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a good anime for more patient people that like more slowly developing plot that revolves mostly around the characters, or just like watching anime to appreciate the amazing art style in the background. \\n\\n\r\n  Hope you find this review helpful and give this anime a try ^^",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar or simply Grimgar  felt like watching a water color painting come to life.\r\nThis anime is a real art piece that exists within its own little world. \r\nGrimar works and feels like a high art more real version of Sword Art Online. The premise is similar, but it is a whole different animal all together. \r\nWith Grimgar we get no back story, no overall plot that they work towards. There are little references to what is really going on, but nothing more than that. \r\nI think it's clear that Hal is the MC, but his party is just as importantto the run of the show. We grow, rise and fall with the party. We witness them lose, we watch them struggle, we see them win, we see them grow to really appreciate each other, despite all their differences. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime is gentle, with great steps of development taken along the way. There are no great leaps in skill and abilities over the run of the anime. It's all modest and honest, the growth feels real and organic. The party is scrappy, they argue, make mistakes, and we get to see all of that. The triumphs are few and far between but they are nonetheless very satisfying. It's soft with a good amount and good quality of action included. It's a great balance between light and dark. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime, under the mask of an RPG setup while being dressed up with the clean and simple art style, is about family or unity or companionship. It's about how these people despite their differences can come together to help one another succeed and survive in a place that is so rough and tough. Grimgar is a good watch, and even if there is no follow up, you'll appreciate the work that was done here.",

            "content": "This is a \"Read-The-Light-Novel\" anime and a slow one, not rushed like many others.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nA bunch of amnesic teenager arrive at a misterious world remembering only their names. Right out the bag all of them join the Voluntary Army because reasons and there's the background. After that the story follows a party with absolutely no skill at combat and their struggle adapting to this new world. This is amazing: it gives a whole new perspective of the genre, taking a more realistic look on the situation and even the monsters. I really enjoyed the focus of the show.\r\nCharacters 9/10\r\nEach character is unique and rich init's own right. It's a short anime and not all of them may appear enough time at screen but I was pretty satisfied. I loved/hated Ranta since he is a good-hearted prick, enjoyed watching the tender giant Moguzo defend the party, fell in love with the cheerful Yume and shy Shihoru (the weakest character IMO) and of course relate to the sleepy Haruhiro.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are beautiful. The watercolor style is breathtaking... and you will admire them, like, a lot. There are a bunch of stillness in the show, with our main protagonist explaining current events while we watch these paintings and some not-that-well-drawed characters with no movement. With that said I've never saw so much detail in one butt out of the shonen or ecchi genre. Yume's butt was always on my mind during the whole 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere should be more than just opening and ending in an anime right? Well... not this time. Except for that annoying \"waiting lobby\" kind of song... yep, the guitar one... I hate it by this point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar is slow. There, I made a review in three words. It's rather obvious in it's premise and not that amazing when compared to other shows this season. But it's relaxing like most of these kind of \"read the novel\" shows and will leave you with hunger of more if you enjoy the genre. I would recommend it... to a few people",

The story tries to slowdown the pacing to develop the characters and make them feel realistic, but fails at properly developing these characters fully. In particular, the main character Haruhiro is just an extremely annoying character that is always harping on a past friend died and literally spends every moment thinking about what this character would do. The only character that I found to be enjoyable would be Ranta due to the comedic value he brings to theseries and how different he feels compared to the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good but not great with very few things being memorable. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation in certain instances looks great, but then there are moments were it seems like the series just dips in quality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nThe anime was pretty enjoyable for what it was but nothing revolutionary to the genre.

            "content": "I wasn't completely sure of what my expectations were for Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, but this show met and exceeded all of them. Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is the anime adaptation of the novel, which is ongoing at this point in time.\r\nSpoiler level: Very low, most of it is in the synopsis anyways. First episode at most.\r\nFantasy, action, and imagination come together to create a sense of depth and realism that is very uncommon to see in anime and even other platforms. The story takes place shortly after several people teleported into a different dimension, recruited into a militia force, and split upinto two groups: the front liners and the newbies. The entire situation is very similar to that of <every MMO ever>, including the way the initial mysterious event that started the show quickly becomes irrelevant. What's unique about Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is that the story is focused on the latter and not the former, and it is focused around adjusting to life in the world rather than why or how they got there. In short, it is an uncommon take on fantasy and video game\u2013inspired worlds, and the concept is not left without a follow through.\\n\\n\r\nIt took a skilled hand and a brilliant mind to create the fantasy world of Grimgar. At first glance, the art looked messy and strange\u2014very different from most other anime. The world is drawn in the same style as one would think a light novel or manga. There's something unique about the lines and colors that make up the characters and environment; it really drives home the contrasting themes of fantasy and reality. The visuals are pleasing to the eye, and they were created with a keen sense for detail. Some notable details are the parallax effect in certain scenes, the night sky effects(by the gods, look at the sky when you get the chance!), and finally the particle and animation quality. Watch the entire opening at least once to get an idea of how good the animation is; watch it again every now and then, and notice how it changes with how many people are currently in the party. On top of that, the characters are unique and well drawn, and it won't take long before identifying who's who is instinctive.\\n\\n\r\nWhen music and sound are done well, the atmosphere and theme for the entire show can be set just like that\u2014a snap of the fingers. The only thing I need to say is that this is one amazing sounding anime. The soundtrack is great and theme appropriate, with a good variety in music for different scene types. For the opening, there's hope; for the ending, there's serenity. Battles are made many times more enjoyable with the epic music. I could go on, but even if you don't plan to watch the show, at least give the soundtrack a try.\\n\\n\r\nA (literally) colorful cast, each with a personality and role in the party, all told from the perspective of the thief, a withdrawn type who is thrust into the leader position without warning. None of the characters seem static or uninteresting. There is at least some characteristics that change over time, even if they are slight. The aforementioned thief, Haruhiro, tells the story from his point of view; as a result, there is no reading the minds of others, nor can we see things that they cannot. The effect this has on the show is to put all importance on their party, rather than the rest of the seemingly vast world. While the anime could have become something about Grimgar on a global scale, or the power players whose appearances are close to zero, the studio chose to keep it down to earth, and the closest to the ground happen to be this party of six.\\n\\n\r\nIn two words (not counting the conjunction): captivating and suspenseful. Personally, I found Grimgar to be extremely enjoyable. I myself am knowledgable in the field of video games, and I can say that watching this anime was a welcomed step in the other direction of competitive or professional gameplay. Watching these characters grow from the first episode to the twelfth helped strengthen an emotional bond, and although they started out giving me facepalms (come on, use some strategy! it's a goblin, for cryin' out loud!) I eventually came to like their synergy both in battle and out. Also, I loved listening to the music and gawking at the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a worthwhile watch for both gamers and non-gamers. Overall, this show does not disappoint in any field, and I am legitimately glad that it gave me all the reasons to argue that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a masterpiece. Of course, enjoyment and opinion vary from person to person, so by no means am I trying to force my own thoughts upon anyone else. However, I truthfully believe that this was one of the best anime of the season, if not one of the best I've ever watched, and I want to share my reasoning in the hopes that I could convince some other people of the beauty packed in these twelve episodes of twenty-or-so minutes.",

            "content": "Grimgar is the most underrated anime I have ever seen. It has great visuals, great sounds, the story progresses smoothly, the characters are relatable and consistent, and great fight scenes. The show takes place in some sort of Fantasy-RPG-esque world in which every single character seemingly has no memories of the \"real\" world. Our group of heroes is made up of a small clique of rejects failing to make the cut of a number of stronger, more competent groups. Hence the story delves into a shounen-esque setting for our characters to develop.  \r\n  This show is one of the more underratedshows out there. Although I can see why the show might be getting so much hate. \\n\r\n  As of the end of the 12th episode, I believe the ratings are not representative of all 12 episode, and rather representative of the first 3-4 episodes. For one, it is very slow paced(as earlier mentioned, the show is set like a shounen, but it is only 12 episodes long atm). Unlike other fantasy-rpg shows, the characters don't seem to have a primary goal (since for the entirely of the first season, the characters have some sort of retrograde amnesia regarding the \"real\" world), instead the show addresses conflict in 2-3 episode arcs (gintama style) in which the conflict is solved from start to end.",

However the opening is very nice and I really liked it. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is the other fragment that made me want to continue this anime. I think that the characters were developed very well and I enjoyed learning more about them.

            "content": "I'm going to start be saying this is a REALISTIC Fantasy setting. It's not for those who have no patience for slice of life, or for people who expect (awesome) overly flashy shounen action scenes. It's simply not that type of anime. It's the type of anime where it wants you to feel something for these characters, and possibly give you a glimpse of what it would be like if you were suddenly thrown into a fantasy world - you wouldn't be a badass. \r\nLooking at my fellow reviewers I see the general pattern of \"There's no story.\" They're right, there is no story. Inthat sense it really is closer to the slice of life genre rather than fantasy. It's basically giving you a day to day perspective of level 1 adventures with no real meaning past surviving as they slowly make progress. Very slow, like it would be IRL. Not like in a random MMORPG where you could get to level 20 in one day if you know what you're doing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, story isn't what this anime is focusing on at all, so there's no real point in saying it's an issue. It'd be like saying \"This ecchi series has a bad story...\" Yeah...Well, that's true for 99% of any ecchi anime. Ecchi shows focus on ecchi and humor, not story. So that point is moot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this show, you have to view it from the perspective of the characters: they're normal, they've never fought a day in their life, and they have no memories of their lives before they arrived in this world suddenly. Would you be any different? I know sure as hell I wouldn't. \\n\\n\r\nSo again: this is a REALISTIC fantasy anime, and should be viewed as such. If you want flashy action anime and possibly something that'll make you laugh out loud rather than make you giggle here and there, go watch Konosuba - It's hilarious and it's also another fantasy anime that came out this season. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you want an anime you can relate to, and possibly feel something towards, watch this. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "As this is the first review I have ever written for this site, I ask you to bear with me on how I break this down. Depending on what you consider spoilers, there may be some ahead, proceed with caution. \r\nGrimgar is an anime that has a slow pace, no doubt about it. Getting into this for the first few episodes, I was honestly confused with how it could, and would, progress. The answer to that was beautifully. I encourage even those who have read the light novels to give this a watch as the characters are portrayed loyally to the source material. \r\nCharacters: Normally,you start a review with the story, but in this case I feel more compelled to discuss what drives the story the most, the characters. The interactions and emotions displayed in the show are lifelike, and possess a human quality not found in many anime to date. i would discuss the entire group, but that would ruin part of the show, so I'll discuss the three I felt had the most impact on my viewing.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the MC of the group named Haru. Haru  is not your typical leader, but after a series of events, he is forced into the role and must overcome his own insecurities as well as learn to understand others. He isn't a battle genius, nor is he an amazing combatant. Hell, he even takes on the style of thief, which is not a normal class for a leader per say. His character acts as a sort of foil for the next character, Ranta.\\n\\n\r\nRanta is a hard-headed, stubborn, and sarcastic person. He follows orders poorly, and is often screaming more then thinking; however, he isn't obnoxious if you understand his point-of-view. i would say he acts as a foil to Haru as well, but that's also not entirely true as he does try to think of the team, despite how it appears.\\n\\n\r\nManato, is a character that serves as a role model for the rest of the crew. Sort of like that guy in highschool you felt the need to be just like despite not knowing him all that well. He possess the qualities of a leader and acts as one. He does his best to understand others and is quite proficient at doing so. he's loyal, intelligent, and an overall nice guy. \\n\\n\r\nStory: So, the story is covered in the synopsis above; however, it's not done much justice in said paragraph. The story is definitely character-driven, and even centers around the characters in meaningful ways without losing focus on the group as a whole. What does occur in the story can be considered boring for the first part by many. Drawn out and unnecessary, and that's quite honestly, not fair. This is an anime where if you don't like the first episode, you should try at least two more. Preemptive judging is how many people dropped this show without getting to the section that really kicks it up a notch. No, the story doesn't progress faster, but it becomes clear why they did take it so slow and will continue to do so. It's necessary to clearly develop the characters and keep them human. Take it an episode at a time and pay attention to the little details, it'll be worth it, I promise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say here other than, gorgeous. It's well choreographed and wonderfully drawn. The backgrounds are always full and breathing life into the characters and monsters they fight. The faces are expressive and eyes show clear emotion etched into them. At times, you can easily tell what someone will say or do, just based on their facial expression beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The anime adaptation is actually funded by a music company, so you can imagine how the music will sound. Perfect. It plays the right BGM at all times, and even sometimes only plays the music, which sounds bad, but it's executed so well that you don't need dialogue in those segments to understand what's happening. You just know. The Ending is also very fitting for the tone of the anime, and gave me goosebumps every time I listened to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well, if you can't tell by now what my enjoyment was, you probably didn't read the full review. Easily 10/10 and I would recommend this to anyone who can appreciate an anime that's not afraid to take it a bit slow and only speed up when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, if you're considering watching this anime, do it. It's definitely worth your time to get through the first few episodes. Try to enjoy them as well, pay attention to detail and this anime will easily be one of your favorites too.",

            "content": "When I think of the story plot arc, \"trapped in another world\", I ignore the the juvenile power fantasy garbage that has been popping up like weeds and narrow down the selection to two titles, \"Digimon\" and \"Lord of the Flies\" . While Lord of the Flies takes place in the same world, the environment is so alien that the plot line that its well qualified for the genre. What's important is that the story takes  its cast outside the comforting trappings of society and the characters have to adjust and adapt to this new environment. Traits that were once suppressed slowly begin toemerge and characters have to deal with conflicts within their group as well as within themselves.  Somewhere in between the light hearted fantasy and the brutal deconstruction of child innocence lands Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.  A show that tries to carry this spirit of story telling although it fails to meet expectations just as much as it succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar takes 6 teenagers and strands them in a fantasy dimension. They can speak the language of the setting and retain knowledge of the basic functions of human society  but can't remember their lives before traveling to this new world. only that they don't belong in this world. There is no direct goal in Grimgar. These characters are forced into a kill or be killed profession and must deal with problems such as chains of authority, loss, and personal morality as well as fight powerful monsters. It is very much a character driven story and there is nothing wrong with that. One Piece has an overall goal of finding the Gol D. Roger's treasure but its plot line is so loose that 800 chapters in, it still doesn't have a central antagonist and the audience is no closer to understanding what One Piece is. \\n\\n\r\nStories don't need clear goals, but if your story is character based, than the writers better be sure on how to write character interaction that is both engaging and entertaining. I never read the light novel that the anime was based on, but the anime feels so stilted and awkwardly framed that I can't help but think that the writers simply copy pasted the text into their storyboards. For example, the main character, Haruhiro is present for nearly every interaction with the cast. While this works for the light novel given the mediums limitations, it doesn't work in an anime presented as an ensemble piece. I know how Haruhiro feels about every teammate but I know very little about the relationships between other characters, so efforts to emit drama from other characters has less of an impact.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is the montages. An hour long drama might have a montage for about a minute before the episode ends but Grimgar has montages that last 4 or 5 minutes. Why waste this time doing practically nothing when you could be using the time to show more character relationships or flesh out your vaguely detailed fantasy world. It's not that Grimgar has a limited time to tell its story, it just wastes time on stupid gimmicks like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, Grimgar has idea of how to write interesting characters, but it doesn't quite grasp proper execution. Haruhiro is the main character but feels like little more than an audience stand-in until events after the fourth episode.  It seems like the story is trying to define his identity by events that happen in the present, however his bland characterization in the first half of the anime can make the narrative's constant focus on him very tedious. He gets better in the second half, but gains a nonsensical streak of pride that makes him make dumb decisions. In one instance, he refuses free gold in spite of being down a party member, failing to obtain proper compensation for three days, and slowly whittling away their budget through drinks at the tavern. In another situation he refuses to kill sleeping enemies, yet is perfectly fine with ambushing them and ganging up on individuals in fights.\\n\\n\r\nRanta is meant to be the Id character of the anime, acting in ways that generally conflict with the main character. Only problem is Ranta lacks any redeeming features to his character. He's supposed to be the comic relief but his repertoire consists of tired anime tropes and the rest of the time he is a hot-headed dimwit. His form of speaking is so loud and obnoxious, that several times where his life was threatened, I wished he was killed off so I would not have to hear him speak. He improves in the second half but his juvenile personality isn't going to win him any fans \\n\\n\r\nTwo of the female characters, Shihoru and Yume are constantly lumped together, which is annoying when the male characters are written to be distinctive.  This dynamic changes with the introduction of Mary, but they still haven't made much of an impact.\\n\\n\r\nMary's interactions with are probably the most engaging because Mary is more or less the main character's intellectual equal. If more conversations were written as well as Mary's there would be less complaints about the show.\\n\\n\r\nMoguzo is every gentle giant trope rolled into one. Aside from a brief conversation at the beginning of the anime, Moguzo has been more or less shunted to the background. Its weird that he is present for most of Haruhiro's and Ranta's arguments yet offers little in terms of input.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nWordy stuff out of the way (relatively speaking), Grimgar's art feels rather schizophrenic. On one hand most of the characters are drawn in the classic seinen art style that has become popular in the new 10s. On the other, the forests where fights takes place are drawn in watercolor,. This design choice looks awful, making the protagonists look like they are fighting in front of green screen rather than in a mystic forest. Otherwise the art is passable and some of CGI is actually employed really well, limiting it to powerful magic and special abilities which the CGI accentuates, making large scale fight scenes more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLove or hate it, the one thing you won't remember about this anime is its soundtrack. An environment where characters could be killed if something goes wrong and they thought the best music was the J-Pop equivalent  of Amy Winehouse? Seriously, if you are tired and don't want to take sleeping pills just skip to the end of a Grimgar episode and the bland montage music will lull you straight to dreamland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile my review has been highly critical of the shows mistakes, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it.  Compared to so many other anime that focus on the wish fulfillment side of otherworldly plots, Grimgar is a breath of fresh air.  Grimgar is very much a diamond in the rough but for every boring montage or annoying voice over there are episodes that really stand out, either in terms of action or emotion. Given the choice between something that's good some of the time and bad other times or a show that is never bad but retains a quality of mediocrity (Gate) consistently throughout its run, I will choose Grimgar every time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar is an example of why execution is just as important, if not more important than premise. Digimon started as a poorly disguised marketing campaign for Tomogachis that could fight but the staff put a huge amount of effort into the show and it has paid off. Digimon has a huge fanbase, and is even being made it onto the silver screen. Grimgar relies mostly on the writer's script to keep up interest. They don't try to introduce new perspectives or foreshadow events  to come. So much of the show is build up for future events but that isn't a good strategy for marketing future seasons. A second season might pick up on its mistakes but there is no guarantee a second season might come. Grimgar might join the ranks of Machine Doll wa Kizutsukanai and Pandora Hearts as an anime whose story is left unfinished.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Day by day, we live in the today and keep living to meet our future selves.\u201d\r\n\t- Haruhiro\r\n\u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d is a fantasy anime that takes on MMORPG in a realistic way.\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nWhen \u201cHaruhiro\u201d woke up, he was enshrouded with darkness. With no memory to answer all the uncertainty within him, he got no choice but to advance. Along with everyone with the same situation as him, they found out that they\u2019ve been sent into a medieval world akin to a video game. They found themselves in the magicalworld of \u201cGrimgar.\u201d With no means of survival other than to kill monsters, \u201cHaruhiro\u201d starts an adventure that will further make him understand what it means to live.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there were a lot of plot changes in \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d if you compare it to its light novel. Some changes brought disapprovals while some were praise. One example of the changes is that the anime emphasizes the romantic scenes; I even thought that maybe the director\u2019s field of expertise was shoujo animes. As for my opinion on the changes, it\u2019s 50-50. I hate directors who change the plot then hog all the glory. But, I also can\u2019t deny the fact that I like what he did. Truth be told, \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d is my favorite anime airing this winter 2016.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is like a roller coaster ride, it has some ups and downs. Sometimes the movements suck and there were also times when it is superb. Since \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d is a RPG-like fantasy anime, the animation of the skills is a must. The animations on physical attack skills were quite plain while the magical attacks were well-detailed. As for the background, you\u2019ll notice that most were just a repetition of frames if you put much focus on it. Still, the background is done beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were one of the changes made in the anime; it is a lot different from the light novel. Even though it is different, I love what the characters look like in both the anime and light novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe background music and voice quality were both good and appropriate for the scenes. The opening and ending song were nice too. The reason why I gave it a perfect score is due to the addition of insert songs; almost all of the episodes have a nice song inserted in it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like what I have mentioned above, the anime emphasizes the romantic scenes. And because of that change, a war has broken out in the social media. People are arguing on who is the best \u201cwaifu\u201d in \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar.\u201d As for me, \u201cMary\u201d is the best girl! Even if ever the director decided to tone down the sweet moments, the characters were great for me. Since the story is set in a serious predicament, the characters were sure to be noteworthy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSince it is my favorite anime airing this season, it\u2019s a perfect score. I really enjoy animes that has a serious plot with a touch of romance. With my excitement for \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d reaching its peak, I even downloaded an English translated light novel of it. I want to know the character developments as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for \u201cHai to Gensou no Grimgar\u201d is 9, it\u2019s not a masterpiece but it surely gave me a nice time watching it. With how the anime concluded, I feel like it won\u2019t have any sequel. There were some key characters that are not introduced in the anime such as \u201cSouma.\u201d Thus I think that a continuation to the story is impossible. That\u2019s why I decided to read its light novel; I want to see what awaits \u201cHaruhiro\u201d at the end of his journey.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat wraps it! See you on my other reviews!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Grimgar was a show I had hovering between 4 and 5 at the halfway point of the season. It ended up finishing between 6 and 7, but closer to 6. It was a disappointment overall, but it finished much stronger than it started. \r\nI'll start by saying that the show's biggest issue is its pacing. It does a great job with building up to key moments but then the moments it builds up for are just... lame? I don't know how else to say it. The first half is sluggish and boring. The one big plot twist it has wasn't even a twist, and itwas extremely forced at that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing new at all. Kids wake up, they don't know why they're in this weird world, they get jobs as \"volunteer soldiers\", they proceed to kill goblins for money. And then kill more goblins. And then even more. Guess what? Next episode they're killing goblins. The plot-twist in all this is that they're actually having a lot of difficulty killing these goblins. This was refreshing and honestly pretty cool to watch for the first couple fights, but it can become frustrating really quickly. Thankfully, the party finally starts showing some growth after 7 or 8 episodes and the fights become much more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI do really like how the world they are in is legitimately dangerous. This is reinforced in a couple of the episodes. It's nice to see that the characters aren't wearing plot armor and that there is actually lives at stake unlike some other RPG-like anime (I'm looking at you Log Horizon). The problem is just that the characters aren't adapting to this world fast enough, and while it's certainly a newer concept, it's still frustrating to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are the show's weakest point. This is disappointing considering that the characters are supposed to be the strong point of the show. Let's start with Yume. She had promise early on. A cute red-haired archer with a quirky personality. Then the group forms and her character falls apart imo. She is always either bitching at Ranta or crying about something. Then, as if realizing her personality has been ruined, the director said \"Screw it. Let's make her nothing but fan service.\" I'm a big proponent of proper fan service, but when a character who starts off promising end up ONLY being used for ass-shots, that is a prime example of bad writing and bad character development. \\n\r\nRanta is a character that grew on me. His personality is initially cancerous but he gets developed at a fairly solid pace and I was satisfied with his character at the end. \\n\r\nShihoru has a cardboard personality and gets little to no screen time; nothing to see there. \\n\r\nMoguzo is a cardboard big guy. For you. \\n\r\nManato has little to no personality as well. He's your typical \"Carry the weight of the entire party on my shoulders\" type of guy.\\n\r\nMary is definitely my favorite character. They spend A LOT of time developing her but it is overall worth it. She's easily the most fleshed-out character and it helps make up for how bland the aforementioned characters are.\\n\r\nIn regards to Haruhiro, who is essentially the protagonist, I actually really like his character development. He showed noticeable growth with each fight and he started taking charge as group leader after awhile and he fit the role nicely. If only the other characters could catch up. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is difficult to rate. Most all the songs are good but at the same time they play WAY too many insert songs. Catchy OP and ED, and not terrible background music. The part that makes it insufferable is the fact the studio HAS to put a 3-5 minute insert song in (nearly) every episode, with nothing but a slideshow of characters and their environments; a lot of them still-shots no less. The music itself isn't that bad but it is over-used to the point that it works against itself. The music used during fights is the redeeming quality, as it isn't as overused and it adds that level of excitement to each fight. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is overall very nice and clean. It's the best aspect of the show. Animation quality is also smooth, and the character designs are all nice. There are a few derps here and there (like Yume's stockings and Ranta's helmet appearing and disappearing at random in the same scenes- anybody else notice this?) and some pretty bad walking animations (Yume in episode 6 as a fine example). These derps don't really detract from the overall quality, but it is noticeable enough to make me shake my head. The biggest problemwith the animation is the fact that they use so many still shots and use some overall lazy animation at times (final fight in episode 12 for instance). I get that it is to save on the budget, but still. It causes the show to look really good some times at the expense of looking bad at other times. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Grimgar, isn't terrible. It's just not nearly the \"breath of fresh air\" that I've seen some people here on MAL claim it is. It has some newer concepts on the \"trapped in an rpg-world\" setting, but they aren't utilized as well as they could be. The story progresses at a snail's pace initially but does pick up in the latter part. The insert songs get old VERY fast, the characters are largely cardboard with the exception of Haruhiro, Mary and Ranta. The art is good as well as being somewhat unique, despite the animation inconsistencies. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "Riding the wave of virtual world turned reality shows comes Hai no Gensou no Grimgar. It follows the typical tropes seen in these types of shows such as .hack// and SAO, but with a few twists. What differentiates it is it's art style, grounded storytelling, and patient pace. \r\n      The story sits around average. It puts a lot of work into building a unique atmosphere that blends very well with the art style and bringing a distinctly grounded feeling to a fantastical world. The story takes a backseat to the world, it bringingnothing you haven't seen before and predictable twists that leave a minimal emotional impact. The pacing is also slow, almost painfully so at times.\\n\r\n      The writing very hit or miss, it nails most tender moments, but completely fails when it comes to humor. It's one of those shows that mistakes boobs at inappropriate times for humor and is devoid of almost any other type of joke. Which is a shame, because I feel some decent jokes could take this show to the next level.\\n\\n\r\n       Hai to Gensou no Grimgar shines aesthetically, it's gorgeous. I decided to check it out because of this: I was intrigued by the airy, watercolor art direction they went with. The animation is excellent as well. I went into the show not expecting to get past the first few episodes, but found myself rewinding because something caught my eye and I needed to see it happen again. Battle sequences are plenty and full of life, the not as flashy bits also treated with care that screams budget. Sure, the pacing was admittedly slow, but I could deal with it when everything was just so nice to look at. \\n\\n\r\n       The sound was not very memorable, but it fit the atmosphere of the show well. Lots of well produced insert songs are featured, but none of them shouted I need this on my ipod and most were accompanied by montages that drained my excitement more often than not. \\n\\n\r\n     The characters are, to be blunt, a bit shallow. They're very tropey with clear archetypes they rarely deviate from, if at all. They were likable for the most part though. I grew quite attached to a few of them and found others vaguely annoying, but we get to know them. Most of the show is devoted to showcasing the main casts' personal growth and interactions together as a group. \\n\r\nThe characters were all very distinct and complimented each other well. They felt truly alive when they were all bickering together and going about their business. Sadly, I couldn't find myself to care about them individually, especially the protag. The protag is bland as all heck. The characters I did feel a connection to, weren't explored enough outside of group shenanigans and cliche moments. \\n\\n\r\n      Despite it's flaws, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar delivers a unique experience that kept me coming back every week. The world is simply charming and makes even its lesser aspects glow.",

It answers enough questions but leaves enough on the table for the viewer to want more. Hai to Gensou no Grimgar's approach to storytelling is a breath of fresh air to your usual show with unrealistic character growth disproportionate to the rest of the characters. Grimgar focuses on the development of the entire cast and not just the main character. In fact, it almost feels like the party is the main character and the individuals are different emotions of that character. \r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar has adeliberate and natural pacing for the majority of the show. There is extreme care taken to what the characters are actually saying or doing. Their struggles are realistic and relate-able. As a viewer you're shown a side of characters that you normally do not get to see in this genre. The show takes an impressive take on how death effects everyone. It's not your typical fantasy where monsters are expendable. Everyone and everything in this show has a purpose and that builds an extremely deep and elaborate world. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the strongest and weakest part of the story. Some of them are extremely easy to remember while others feel like they served almost no purpose. But even in that aspect you realize that their accomplishments as a group are key to their constant survival. The choices they make for how they develop show their importance to the team and make the viewer wonder how some of their selections could impact them in the future. \\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar doesn't hold your attention with significant cliff hangers. It doesn't build up huge battles. It takes you on a journey with the characters where you feel like your only question is...\"Where to next?\" \\n\\n\r\nHai to Gensou no Grimgar to the average anime fan may seem like just another fantasy show. To those who take the time and really listen to the story being told it's a masterpiece.",

It focuses on the six main characters' emotions and develops them as much as possible. Grimgar is a slow-paced anime which can be a turn off for some people. However, I believe the execution of the anime and it's themes were on point. A-1 really did a nice job on this anime.\r\nGrimgar focuses more on the relationships that each of the characters have for each other and their growth as people, and survivors. This show is less action oriented and has less ofthose stunning fights. It does bring however a more compelling narrative. The environment is also beautifully drawn and fully realised in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter growth often determines if an anime is good or not. This anime has a lot of that. Over the course of the anime, our main characters become stronger both mentally and physically. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: This anime has great story telling and character development; however, this anime takes it's time to tell this story. Grimgar may not be for everyone but I most definitely recommend you at least give it a try. You never know, this anime might be for you! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime gets a solid 8/10",

            "content": "WARNING!\r\nThis review contains major spoilers for Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. If you haven\u2019t finished this anime yet or are planning to watch it, please do so before reading this. Now, on with the review!\r\nI stumbled across Hai to Gensou no Grimgar while scrolling through the \u201cnew anime\u201d list on Kissanime. The cover art looked appealing, the synopsis was very interesting  and I love video games, so I decided to watch it, even though Sword Art Online left a bad taste in my mouth . After watching the first episode, however, I was very disappointed, but I had hope. I had hope that theanime would do a complete 180 and turn into an interesting narrative, with lovable, deep characters; that the anime wouldn\u2019t be a complete mess with loads of unnecessary fanservice and bland, badly written characters. Well, let\u2019s just say that my hope was definitely misplaced as I watched this anime quickly and painfully spiral straight down into anime hell.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know a lot of people are going to compare this anime (story wise) to Sword Art Online, but it isn\u2019t exactly the same. While SAO is a story about being trapped in an MMORPG where the consequence of in-game death is death in real life, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar never establishes it is a video game world, or an MMORPG world, to be exact. Of course, to anyone, it would be obvious it is, with all the classes and skills involved, but it\u2019s never outright said that the world of Grimgar is a video game world. Besides that, this anime focuses more on the characters and less on the overall story. It\u2019s a \u201ccharacter study\u201d. The story is about a group of teenagers, who wake up in an unfamiliar land, called Grimgar, with no memories other than their names. They\u2019re forced to join the local military, the Reserve Army, and split into two groups, the \u201cstrong\u201d and the \u201cweak\u201d. The story follows the \u201cweak\u201d group in their efforts to survive in an unknown land with no previous memories of their past life\u2019s. To sum up my feelings for the story, it was not great. The idea itself of being trapped in an MMORPG was made popular due to SAO, but I try not to judge a book on its cover. However, the anime didn\u2019t do anything that SAO had already done. It\u2019s a high stakes survival game. That\u2019s it. It was just another \u201cstuck in a video game world\u201d anime. It wasn\u2019t \u201cengaging\u201d, \"different\", or anything among those lines. Besides, at this point, the amnesia trope is just lazy writing. There's no reason why the writer implemented this is into the plot. If anything, the writer could've used their desire and desperation to get back home as a motive to want to fight and as a way to crank up the \"angst\" and \"edginess\".\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets A LOT of praise for its slow build-up and realism. I can, sort of, see the slow build-up, considering the characters are very weak for the start and don\u2019t immediately become \u201cJesus-kun 2.0\u201d in a single episode, but killing off a character you know barely anything about is NOT slow build-up. As for realism, I don\u2019t see how the concepts of  \u201cpeople need food\u201d and \u201cpeople who, presumably, haven\u2019t fought their entire life won\u2019t immediately be good at fighting\u201d is seen as a positive, when it should be seen as something mandatory in any story that tries to realistically portray human characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n I\u2019m not even kidding when I say that I can give a quick, easy rundown of all the main characters in this show and it would give you an accurate overview of every single one of them. Haruhiro, the MC. Period. Manato, the nice guy and emotional death fodder. Ranta, the annoying, stubborn brat. Moguzo, who? Yume, the ass and tiddies. Shihoru, the shy ass and tiddies. Mary, the only likable and competently written one. There, done. As you can see, I don\u2019t think very highly of the characters, especially the female ones. The characters are written in a way where you\u2019re expected to like all of them from the start, except Ranta, whose \u201credemption\u201d was as shallow and lousy as can be, but that\u2019s where the whole plot falls apart. If you don\u2019t like Manato as a character by episode four, the entire anime seem extremely melodramatic for the viewer, as it was for me. The constant crying, whining and moping gets annoying right as it starts (and only gets worse as the anime progresses and tries to make this character's death into an actual plot point), because I don\u2019t care even a little bit about the character. I don\u2019t know anything about him, I don't know anything about his personality, I don\u2019t know what he does outside of fighting goblins ,I don\u2019t know why he decided on being the priest, etcetera. People might say that that kind of information (with that, I mean the last two things) is useless and doesn't add anything to the character, but the whole point of giving characters hobbies and other kinds of distinct qualities, is so they stand out and seem more realistic. This lack of depth ties in with the whole amnesia trope, because if we knew what his life was like before he got transported to Grimgar, we would (obviously) know more about the character and he would become easier to sympathize with. The viewer knows nothing about the character because of his amnesia, so why should they care? \\n\\n\r\nThen, the female characters. Oh god, the female characters. They\u2019re basically cardboard cut-outs of your favorite waifus. They have no depth to them, they\u2019re just pandering fanservice characters. Don\u2019t worry though, the anime establishes this in the first episode, as the entire team talks about Shihoru\u2019s boobs, right in front of her. I\u2019m serious, they have a three minute conversation about how Ranta doesn\u2019t trust Shihoru, because she hides her big boobs. Yume then proceeds to straddle Shihoru. Of course, like any girl would. How am I supposed to take this anime seriously, when they have a THREE MINUTE CONVERSATION ABOUT SHIHORU\u2019S TITS? The fanservice was so unbearable and frequent, every time either Yume or Shihoru were on screen, there was a clear shot of their \"underwear\" and \"chest area\". The other characters were just boring and/or not noteworthy. Haruhiro was the least poorly written, next to Mary, but still a typical MC. Moguzo did and said nothing and was obviously just a filler character. \\n\\n\r\nNow, to discuss the one good part about Grimgar, Mary. Her backstory wasn\u2019t groundbreakingly new or different, but it was a beacon of hope in this otherwise terrible anime. She was cold, competent and strong. Not only exactly what the \u201cweak\u201d team needed, but also what the anime needed. She was smarter than all of the others combined (EG, her comment about sending in a priest first, who is a support class) and, most of all, she didn\u2019t take any of Ranta\u2019s shit. She had the biggest character development of everyone and it showed. From being cold and distant, because she watched her previous teammates die and could do nothing about it, to being actual friends with her new team. Her character development didn\u2019t feel rushed, it advanced naturally. The only strange thing about her was that she suddenly started calling Haruhiro, Haru, which seemed a bit out of character to me. Although her whole arc wasn\u2019t perfect, it was definitely better than the episodes before that and it was, to some extent, enjoyable. I would\u2019ve given this anime a one or a two if it wasn\u2019t for Mary, but that's probably the best thing I can say about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s any other good thing to say about Grimgar, it\u2019s the art. The watercolor backgrounds were beautiful, although they sometimes didn\u2019t fit the atmosphere. The character designs are somewhat sleek and nice to look at, but nothing to write home about. All in all, the animation and art style is somewhate unique and looks pretty, but not all the time. One thing that I do have to say is, in the episode where all the main characters try to escape from a group of monsters and Ranta gets left behind, there was an animation inconsistency. One shot showed Ranta\u2019s helmet, hanging on a stick protruding out of the rubble. In the next few shots, it shows Ranta without his helmet, but then he runs away from a monster and it\u2019s suddenly on his head again. This was  very obvious and an incredibly bad mistake, but whatever. Just goes to show how much they \u201ccare\u201d about this anime, I guess. (This may be considered a nitpick, but it completely destroyed even the tiniest sense of immersion I had).\\n\\n\r\nSound Design \\n\\n\r\nTo me, sound design is very important in an anime. The voices need to fit the characters and the back ground music needs to blend in, while still standing out on its own and giving the certain scene where it's used more emotion. The sound in Grimgar is decent and that\u2019s all I can say about it. The voice performances were, for lack of a better word, alright. Nothing was exceptional or outstanding. The OP and ED were \"not my cup of tea\". The songs were incredibly boring to listen to and I skipped both the OP and the ED every single time. Last, but not least, the background music. It was mediocre. There wasn\u2019t any song that stood out to me. They all just seemed standard, uninspired and they added nothing to the scenes they were used in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my feelings for this anime, it\u2019s terribly written, the characters are all unlikable and lack depth, the pacing is kind of slow, yet decent, but shouldn\u2019t be the only counterargument against why this anime isn't bad (besides the animation) and the story is very unoriginal and littered with tropes. Undoubtedly, this anime will have a second season considering how well it was received by most viewers. Will I watch it? Yeah. Will I write a review about it? Definitely. Will I enjoy it? No. at least, not for the right reasons.",

            "content": "Does this anime bring anything new to the \"trapped in a fantasy world\" trope? Yes. Is it well executed? Not really.\r\nThis anime tries to emulate the tabletop RPG style rather than the MMORPG world. This is done very well in the first few episodes where the characters struggle taking down even one goblin. However, as the episodes go on, the show doesn't give us anything to connect with or a drive to know more about these characters or world. Here's what I mean:\r\nIf anyone has actually played a game of DND there is a few things that are needed to create a successful, fun, andchallenging game:\\n\r\n1. Good World-building and Lore\\n\r\n2.  Interesting Characters with backstories, goals, and motivations\\n\r\n3.  A main antagonist that is a threat to the our heroes\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime:\\n\r\n1. The world-building in this anime is terrible. We see where our characters live, a bar, and the main character's guild which has one person in it. We don't get to see characters interacting with townspeople unless it's for bargaining or exposition. It's extremely bland, for an anime that does worldbuilding better, look to an anime like Log Horizon.\\n\r\n2. The characters start with no memory of there past lives, so there goes an interesting backstory. Their only motivation is to live and fight more monsters. We never actually see the party training, all we get are exposition dumps or cuts to the next scene/episode about how they have improved. Instead of watching characters sleeping or fishing or cooking, why don't we have a few scenes of characters training in their respective guilds, or looking at new equipment in the stores, or talking to NPC's to get to know the surrounding lands. \\n\r\n3. While the monsters in this anime are not your typical dumb monster, there is no imminent threat that imposes on our heroes. Let me give you a good example: Konosuba has the Devil King. We never see the devil king and for the majority of the time our characters never seem to even care about him but we as the audience know that their is a threat to our characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime fails to emulate the type of world it's trying to be like. It's slow, boring, and a tough watch.\\n",

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash manages to do nothing with its 12 episode length and provided me with one of the most boring, slow-paced and generic animes I've ever seen. I really couldn't find a whole lot to like about this show, and it makes me wonder why its been given a 7.90 average user rating. I haven't seen as many animes as other people, and I've never really written a review on my own volition before, so I'm probably not the most qualified to say anything, but I thought I'd share my thoughts regardless.\r\nGrimgar of Fantasy and Ash takes place in a medieval, RPG-esqueenvironment filled with magic and monsters. Our story starts off with a handful of teenagers who have been magically transported, from the modern era, to this world with \\n\r\nlittle memories about where they came from. Off the bat the story doesn't do much to explain their amnesia. They cant remember certain words like \"game\" and \"cell-phone\" and their confusion is mentioned briefly in the first few episodes, but seems to completely disappear as the story goes on. I can understand the characters wanting to adapt to their new environment and having their memories of their previous life fade over time but when you NEVER explain who they were before this incident happened, its makes me ask why even do the amnesia thing to begin with and makes me connect with the characters even less.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the kids appear on top of a tower of some sort, none of them really know each other or whats going on and some begin to worry until they are all directed into a tavern where some stripper clown dude tells them they all need to become voluntary soldiers, form a party, join a guild (where they pick what role they will fill within their groups like an RPG and learn skills from a master)  and protect the town from monsters. Naturally, the stronger, bigger, edgier kids group together and leave Yume, Manato, Haruhiro, Mogzo, Shihoru, Ranta and eventually Marry to become the main group the story focuses on. Yume is the humble, friendly and outgoing girl character in which the story finds every way to show off her ass. Manato is kind and very peaceful, who becomes the group's leader and role model and is overall just the perfect human being with no outstanding character flaws. Haruhiro is also pretty kind, although pretty boring and I can really only describe him as \"The MC\" (think of Kirito). Mogzo is a peaceful giant who likes to cook. Shihoru is the quiet, shy and emotional girl with large breasts. Ranta is very loud, obnoxious and a braggart who no one really likes but they put up with his shit anyways (kind of like a younger sibling). Marry is cold and a bit jaded but becomes friendlier at the end of the show. All of these characters pretty much stay the same throughout the show and don't really develop much at all. Grimgar uses a lot montages and time skips to show how the group developed from struggling to kill a single goblin into a fairly competent team, but when you use montages to speed through everything and not actually show most moments of character development, you struggle to connect with any of these character or empathize with their struggles. I think the only two characters that kinda develop were Ratga and Marry. Ranta's personality stays the same but he has conflicts with the group about teamwork early on since no one really likes him (which is understandable since he's very annoying) but he eventually becomes more of a team player by the last episode. Marry is introduced as extremely cold and struggles to fit into the group since she doesn't really seem to want to get to know anyone. It is later revealed that after not being able to save her friends from some wolf monster thing in her previous party that she's traumatized and acts the way she does out of fear for not being able to save anyone else. After bonding with this new group and facing her fear by defeating the wolf thing that killed her friends (or having Haruhiro do it to be more specific), she starts to warm up and finally recognize her group as friends. While Marry is the most developed, for me personally, by this point in the show when she gets introduced I really couldn't be bothered to care.\\n\\n\r\nI think what upset me to most is Monato's death and how the show handles it. Monato barely gets any development apart from having small talk with Haruhiro before going to bed occasionally. We know absolutely nothing about this guy and as far as I can tell his personality only extends as far as being \"the nice guy\", yet everyone looks up to him like some sort of outstanding role model and when he dies, the show spends the rest of its time mourning his loss. It's like they expect me to care and empathize with the everyone's sadness but when I barely know anything about Monato (or really any character for that matter) I really can't. I'm assuming that somewhere in the montages they all bonded with him and being the party's leader and healer will give you a pretty good cause for being so strongly liked but I felt none of it was truly shown and I could connect with any of it at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll together I can't really say this show was good. I thought the animation was nice and the water color painting used for the backgrounds was cool and I guess the sounds were okay (i'm not very big into anime music so this isn't something I really pay attention to but I guess it wasn't terrible) but the story's pacing and characters were garbage. I feel like the show could have been better with more episodes, but with how everything was handled before, I doubt it would have been a huge improvement. There are so many questions i was left with that weren't answered. Will these people ever be able to go back to the modern world? Why were they chosen to come here? What were they like before all of this? How do their role's skills work? The show ends with everyone coming to terms with living in Grimgar and forgetting about their previous lives but, for me personally, I couldn't feel any closure with many of these questions remaining unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nI can really only recommend this to people who just want to waste time by watching anime. Yume's ass was pretty good though.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

This also means that it gets slow at times, and like french movies, if you're not used to the pace, you will not enjoy it fully, and find it pretty boring. \r\nFor me this would be a 10/10 if it didnt had all the unecessary and overall unfit (tothe show in general) ecchi.

Its a short 12 episodes and it is a - Character Study - The premise is not new, its a group of kids somehow transported into an RPG type of world and they give you very very little of that backstory. It doesn't matter though for the events to continue. In fact if they had dipped back into the past it would have had to be carried out another 12 episodes probably for the story to stay coherent and intact. Coming into it knowing that it is a character driven story, mainly from thepoint of view of the main character, you are able to appreciate how the story moves along and how the characters react to being in these different situations. Only at the end do they reference the outside world, and they did it in a way that closes it nicely by being sort of philosophical perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, being kind of soft watercolor type of backgrounds and not only is the color palette striking but the world that they inhabit is beautiful and intriguing, letting you fill in the blanks with your own curiosity and questions, fleshing the world out nicely. You find yourself drawn into the backgrounds so much that it actually gives even more depth to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is pretty decent, but again its only there for characters to have something to overcome and to react to. Its very appropriate and in a character study context I'd say its above average for action and suspense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give this a solid 7",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar\r\nAttempting to write a review after numerous beers last night. Mind sliding the key into the ignition very slowly. Head remember Hai to Gensou no Grimgar good anime. Head turn on anime. Eyes watch episode after episode. Mouth smile.\r\nThis was truly a unique and epic experience in the genre of fantasy gaming in reality. The anime took the normal FAST PACED KILL EVERYTHING kind of adventure and turned it into something of a slow slice of life effort. The characters had the main goal of becoming stronger that kept the anime with a constant flow and purpose, all the while givingthe user a craving for more. It was kind of like, \"We should really kill monsters and loot them because our food will not pay for itself, and we are hungry.. SO LET'S DO THIS!\" \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the monsters kick the ish out of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe party consisted of a thief, warrior, mage, archer, death knight, and priest. Dramatic events entail that require this party to coordinate and help each other out. Without proper teamwork, this party would have never survived. You'll see here the typical hero syndrome putting certain characters into a pronounced flaw. You'll see sentimental group members who sincerely care for their group members. And you'll see a plethora of rambunctious camaraderie! \\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking, \"Oh wow, this anime has it all.\" Wait, no it doesn't. There is a serious flaw in the background of the entire environment setup. Nobody will explain why the characters exist or how long the realm has sustained itself. Are they characters in a game, or born into this world via some Godly creation cycle? Because of that, the character's background are never explained, yet somehow the viewer is able to gain a sense for each characters' personality. I believe the anime excel's at this.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest advantage this anime has over other's from its breed is that it really takes its time. One moment the characters might set out on a hike, and the next they come back with no loot or account of monsters slain, so they talk and express themselves, whether one is arguing or the next giving advice. The viewer has a chance to get comfortable with the characters, which is pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 9 - The story is consistently moving forward and the viewer innately knows that the characters must push on to survive. I believe that there is much more potential to this world, and that the characters are only getting started.\\n\r\nGraphics - 10 - Incredibly ethereal graphics. The in-world artwork laid out the fantasy world very well. The world was similar to an old town city living on the coast, yet much more colourful and vibrant.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 9 - Sexy background music and emphasized music at many points in the anime. In fact, at certain points the anime slows down to let the music fill the moment before getting back to the characters.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 8 - I am a pretty big fan of character backgrounds, and therefore this anime should have received a diminished result here. However, each character is so incredibly distinct from the other that it's FUN to learn about the characters. The characters all have their flaws with the main character having less, unfortunately, yet its possible to take favorites amidst the group. You might even notice that you've met people who act like these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 - Enjoyable and pleasant. It's like a breath of fresh air.\\n\r\nRecommended - For those who like to sit back, relax, and play a role playing RPG once in awhile.",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is ultimately an anime which deals with the issue of bereavement.\r\nStory in a nutshell: A bunch of people regain consciousness in a fantasy world they have no prior of memory of being in. But they are given little time to question things before the realities of life are forced upon them and they are made to form teams of fighters so that they can survive and earn a living in this world full of monsters, towns and hardships etc. \r\nThe anime primarily follows the lives of one of said teams and their trials and tribulations as they survive on aday-to-day basis in this ruthless yet beautiful world. However it is not long before one of them is killed in action. And this friends death casts a shadow over the characters which effects their relationships and actions for the duration of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a depressing anime to watch. Far from it! It is an anime full of high & low moments (from fantastic action scenes to lighthearted comedy moments). But what it seeks to achieve is a level of realism amongst its characters in a world that while a fantasy-like place, is all too real in many ways. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also many unique elements to this anime which mean that although \"trapped in a RPG-like world\" anime's abound, none are quite like Hai to Gensou no Grimgar.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There is a lot of character development in this anime so that while the characters are somewhat generic, they aren't boring or poorly managed throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork: The anime is very pleasant on the eye and has quite a unique style of artwork. The action scenes are fluid and generally speaking the world of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is one of beauty, warmth and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Very good! Even though this anime isn't very long it contains numerous stoy arcs (and all of the episodes are very relevant). The focus of the story line changes as they characters develop (and vice versa) so that although it changes, the story flows harmoniously throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This anime has some lighthearted comedy moments but comedy is certainly not a focal point of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (and is quite thin on the ground in general).\\n\\n\r\nAction: Some of the fight scenes are particularly impressive however there is also something of a gore factor in this anime as it aims to be realistic (not all of the deaths are humane etc). The fights are often very precarious in their nature and you often feel like both the characters and the monsters really are fighting for their very survival.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: This is something you could definitely criticize Hai to Gensou no Grimgar on because it tends to alternate between episodes where very little happens to episodes where so many significant things happen, it is hard to all take in. But for the most part, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar has quite a relaxed pace to it.\\n\\n\r\nFan service: There is a bit of ecchi in this anime but it is not a focal point or running theme of the anime. However none of the fan service made me feel uncomfortable )and nor did it detract from its overall story line_. \\n\\n\r\nMonsters: There are a LOT of goblins in this anime. And while eventually new types of monsters are introduced, if you do watch Hai to Gensou no Grimgar then expect to watch an anime where most of the fights revolve around the characters trying to outwit and kill various types of goblins. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime!\\n\r\nI am not someone who typically enjoys fantasy anime's much. Yet I was really drawn into the world of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar and its characters (and each episode left me wanting more).\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, otherwise known as Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, is a Survival MMORPG anime that released in Winter 2016. \r\nStory (6): The premise of the series sees our protagonists waking up in a fictional world, similar to that of an MMORPG. There are goblins, thieves, black knights, hunters and more. They awaken into this mysterious world, barely remembering their past and recalling vague terms from the real world such as \u201ccell phones\u201d without remembering what the words actually mean. The main protagonists separate from their other counterparts and form a party. The main purpose of the 12 episode series is havingthe protagonists try and achieve their dream of becoming fully fledged members of the Reserve Army, by raising money and defeating enemies. This would be a fine series if it was solely a fantasy anime, but the introduction of characters whose origins come from a realistic world into that of fantasy, arises several questions. \u201cWhy are they here?\u201d \u201cHow did they get here?\u201d In cases such as this, other fantasy based series where the protagonists come from other worlds delves into the question of how and why, with series like Log Horizon going into depth into trying to solve the mystery, with Sword Art Online actually giving a vague answer. This series (at least this season), answers none of the initial questions, and brushes them aside to solely focus on character development. Fans of similar series won\u2019t see anything particularly new, with the entire series\u2019 plot being an extended version of the 3rd episode of Sword Art Online. The pacing of the series dregs along at times, and makes it hard to enjoy with much of the series being chocked full of filler, and not enough meaningful character development or substance. There are some great moments in the series, but as a cohesive hole, the individual pieces stand out better than the entirety of the product. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art style is a breath of fresh air, and offers an appealing stigma to the eyes. While I was not fond initially of the art style, the simplicity of the watercolor backgrounds calls back to other series such as Valkyria Chronicles, which use the distinctness of the art style to their advantage. While the characters and plot may have been generic, the art style used in the background helped alleviate some discomfort while viewing the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6): The music used is serviceable, but the OST was not exciting or memorable enough to be missed or listened to again. While others may have enjoyed the ost or the sound design, I felt that there was no standout or memorable tracks from the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6) When other series attempt meaningful character development, this series tries to make generalized character development. The characters never truly feel fleshed out, with them being archetypes without any pay off from all the random activities we see them engage in. They all show signs of growth at the end of the series, but the sense of growth and development felt contrived and drawn out, and the series could have easily been told in a single episode or a short OVA series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): Grimgar is a decent series that hits the right points at the right time, but fails to muster up enough interest or enjoyment in between the big moments. The series starts off with questions that it never answers, and turns down on a path of general living that fails to ignite enough intrigue. A unique art style and serviceable characters might make the series a draw to others, as well as great action scenes that arise here and there. But nothing truly steps out in a show fumbling with mediocrity. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is a decent series that shares similarities to other series in the fantasy genre, placing more of an emphasis on character development and the lives of non-hero characters. As opposed to other series such as Overlord, Sword Art Online, and Log Horizon, our protagonists are not major players in their universe, and hold basic lives. Instead of answering the big questions of why and how, they try to answer the smaller personal questions in their lives. There was a lot of potential in the series, but it generally fell flat. I'd give the series a pass and worth checking out if you're into the fantasy genre and like watercolor art. Otherwise, you're better off with a different series that does Grimgar better than Grimgar. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nGrimgar is a gem, albeit black. It presents a narrative that is both unique and daring, characters that challenge the norm of story creation and levels of hard work that has never been seen before.\r\nGrimgar feels disconnected. The setting is ill-defined and imperfect which are caused by the lack of focus on it at the start and the structure of its narrative. I disliked the absence of the setting.\r\nGrimgar uses a premise that is lacking. The exposition scene in episode one only informed the viewers of the existence of a war between humans and other races and the role of volunteer soldiers.The viewers do not know anything about the town, its history, the lives of its population or their situation. They did not tell the viewers the laws of the world - whether people keep appearing from the tower, why the creatures are living around the borders of the town, where the merchants get their products, the people's culture and views of life, etc. The world is static and not there.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses a narrative that does not involve anything outside the party of 6. The story follows the struggles and adventures of one party to earn money in a new world. This positioning of the characters makes the community, town and world around them empty and arbitrary. If the narrative was affected by the town's constant changes and situations, if the characters were involved with other parties and people, if they had interactions with large communities that affect them and their adventure and if they ventured through the town to learn about the daily activities of the townspeople, the world would have personality and weight in their adventure through it.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses its world as a stage more than a place where the characters live. World development in an adventure anime is imperative. Without knowing about the world the characters are in, the viewer will not connect with the selling point of the show. A world without life breaks the immersion in the adventure. Try to imagine GATE, Log Horizon, SAO, DanMachi or Accel World but without any knowledge of the inner workings or details of the world and also without any interactions between the characters and the people and communities around them. The worlds will be barren, and the characters will not have much to work with.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the setting that the viewers do not know, the world seems more detached because of a combination of bad directing, music and art choices. I disliked feeling abstracted from the world. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses a beautiful pastel and watercolor art style for the background but the characters are solid, and their outlines are clearly defined. The differing art styles make the characters feel like they are superimposed onto the background and by extension, the world itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe ample amount of idle talk, monologs and most scenes, including the action scenes, are placed over panning still shots of the characters or unrelated still backgrounds. Sometimes, the characters are also tinted with the same watercolor splashes as the background. They also add a little moving lens flare or pulsing light sources to break up the stillness. All of these serve the largest disconnect to the show.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses a mix of drum and guitar instrumental for the action scenes and voiced songs for the montages. The action scenes are usually neither tension heavy nor fast and exciting. This, however, means the instrumental often outpaces the action, and thus the beats of the drums feel soulless. Voiced OSTs used in montages break engagement immediately. Their use for important scenes feels jarring when the scenes do not evoke emotions of the viewer and when the weight of the scene does not last as long as the song.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses shots that do not flow with one another. For example, the opening fight scene of episode one is a confusing shot composition. Rewatch that scene and attempt to visualize where each character is located respect to one another. Now, also, try to draw out the setting. You will realize a few things. Characters change locations or are not in the sides of certain shots even though they should be. They also appear out of nowhere in places where it was framed without them a couple of shots back. These happen because when one character is shown, the viewers lose perspective of where any other character is at. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses weird shot framing, and this causes issues in scenes. Now, if you had tried to draw out the setting in your mind, look at the scene where the goblin climbs the cliff to the mage. You'll realize that when it gets knocked back, you'd think it'd be knocked off the cliff. However, it's framed such that it falls onto level ground as if the ground right in front of the mage was flat in the first place. This is supported by the next shot where the big guy climbs the cliff to pursue the goblin but the three characters from below seem to appear to be on the same level as the goblin, somehow. This is an example of one of the continuity errors that occur in the show. The show has many moments where the viewer can get lost if they try too hard to find the characters' positions. Try to watch the first action scene of episode two with this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar uses fanservice without any shame, at least, a few times each episode. The viewers will get detached from the show when it shamelessly pans over Yume's backside or curvy body, Shihoru's chest or curvy body or Mary's legs or sexy body. Some scenes are also played to have the characters be in interesting positions or situations. It becomes distasteful when they take on the perspective of Haruhiro or Ranta as this speaks about their characters too. These usually underplay the scene and what's happening and are both distracting and irritating. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar feels lazy and uninspired. Besides the disconnecting bits of the anime that was covered, the narrative structure, the characters and the unused interesting ideas the show had, are the other issues of the show. I disliked the characterization and the story presentation it chose to use.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make use of the interesting ideas it had. One of it was the whole amnesia situation. The amnesia bit is not a good idea when we get to the characters, but the parts about not having amnesia are what's interesting. In episode one, Ranta says, \"Even when I was a girl, I was famous for my hidden strength.\" In episode two, the big guy carves an airplane out of wood and lifts it up to make it appear flying towards the sun. In episode three, Yume says, \"You were trying to (peep), and that's a crime! I'll call the police!\" and Ranta replies, \"There ain't any in this town!\". These ideas could have been used as effective character dynamics for every character. Some characters know their past world while others do not. Some characters struggle to believe they are in this world while others struggle to let go of their past. This could have potentially brought strong character arcs with conflicts, story progression and character depth.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make its death and morality theme more impactful. In episodes one and two, the series tells the viewers that the fights are kill or be killed, that the characters are invading the goblins' land and that the goblins don't want to die. However, these did not add weight to the show. Renji's party is a group revered by many even though they started at the same time as the story's characters. Yet, they mean nothing to the show even though they could have very well made up an excellent connecting thread linking the characters to the world that the viewers don't know. Or maybe, the characters could have learned about the world through their experience and guidance. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make narratively interesting characters. Firstly, Grimgar defines its characters through their details as human beings. Writers are advised not to do so. Their description is only skin deep. People forget characters who are defined by fine details of themselves. They won't remember a character because they like cooking or speak in Kansai accent. They won't remember a character just from their role in the party or the abilities they somehow acquire throughout the show. Instead, they remember characters who do interesting things, who have interesting viewpoints or opinions and who have interesting and dynamic character arcs that affect the storyline and narrative. \\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make a good foundation for the characters. Grimgar's principle of amnesia means that the characters do not have distinct goals, motivations, viewpoints or anything dynamic about themselves. What I mean by dynamic is not static. A static trait is one that does not change, does not affect the narrative and is not affected by the narrative. The fact that the characters like drinking or are good at rock climbing are some examples. When characters are defined by their roles in a party, there is a disconnect between the viewer and the character. The viewers do not know their personal goals, why they do things a certain way or what's developing in their characters. These traits serve no plot function and do not collide with the story to make a character arc, and therefore, should not define the characters.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make good use of Mary as a character, despite using two episodes to tell her backstory. An example of a dynamic trait that can be played up in a narrative is her struggle to accept the death of her party members. Firstly, they introduce Mary's current situation caused by the trauma of losing her friends. Then, they get Mary to face that trauma with a hurdle or obstacle. She needs to let go of them. Her having to lay them, the walking dead, to rest, is a good plot point. However, what needs to change is getting the viewer involved with the struggle that she has. The viewers need to see her resolve her fears. The viewer needs to follow a plot point where she does just that.\\n\\n\r\nGet the other characters to be defeated or overwhelmed by her dead party members. All this while, she's traumatized and does not want to face them. Though Bloodied and exhausted, the other characters try their best to keep her safe even though they're almost defeated. She realizes she cannot go against her ideals of never wanting any other member of her party to die and also that laying her previous party members to rest provides closure and a conclusion of her responsibilities towards them. As all the other characters are damaged all over and their equipment rendered useless, she decides not to heal them because she'll need to use all her mana to put her previous party down. The other characters understand this and put up one final burst to give an opening for Mary, risking everything. You see, now the other characters, despite being unrelatable with little to no character arcs, have all developed their relationship with Mary and Mary's character arc is made much more interesting, relatable and actually, dynamic. Because the after effects of that battle will be significant, like equipment replacement and battle scars, it will also define what happens afterward, in the narrative. That's a strong character development of Mary as the viewers get to know about her dynamic trait and its development. Shihoru's shyness could work as a dynamic character arc as well, but they didn't do much with it.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar does not make good narrative choices. Episodes of the show are made up of montages, action scenes and idle talk. The progression of the show is limited to the montages where Haruhiro monologs what has happened to the party. It is also evident that the show attempts to provide a sense of realism to its characters. They use large and long moments of characters talking about things that other narratives avoid. These moments take up half the episode and do not affect the narrative in many ways with them usually looping back and ending up without a clear conclusion or effect to anything in the show.\\n\\n\r\nHere's an example. --(Skip these two paragraphs because they\u2019re boring.)-- \"How long are you going to sleep Haruhiro? The sun's high.\" \"It's morning, aren't you forgetting something?\" \"Hm, what's with the sleepy eyes?\" \"I was born with eyes like this. It doesn't mean I'm sleepy. I've told you before.\" \"Liar, no doubt you're sleepy.\" \"Oh no, I was on breakfast duty.\" \"You don't seem that sorry, Haruhiro.\" \"Aren't you on duty too? You should go.\" \"Well, when I woke up, Moguzo had traded with me.\" \"What? I can't believe you can still harp on me.\" \"It's obvious. If you don't wake up, I won't get my morning grub.\" That's 2 minutes of the show already.\\n\\n\r\nHere's another example. \"That's a little more like a dark knight now.\" \"Whatever. Mind your own business.\" \"What happened to eating bones and all?\" \"Sheesh, you really are a nitpicker, bugging me about every single little thing.\" \"Not about every single thing.\" \"See, what did I just say? Every single thing!\" \"Well, it turned out alright. I got to accumulate my first vice, too.\" \"What can you do if you accumulate a vice.\" \"I can summon a demon.\" \"And, what can that demon do?\" \"It whispers and tells me if an enemy is nearby.\" \"And sometimes it explodes a demon joke.\" \"That's all?\" \"What do you mean 'that's all'?\" \"It'd be a perfect partner for me.\" \"I agree, it'd be just right for Ranta.\" \"Right?\" \"It's kind of ironic that we say it'd be a good fit for you when we don't even know what the demon is good for.\" \"Meow\" \"Wha? Huh? Were you that cat? Do you have a transformation skill like that?\" \"Of course not.\" \"I was just thinking of how pretty the sun looked when it plopped into my head. Apologize.\" \"Of course I knew that. Don't scare me like that.\" \"You seem kind of flustered.\" \"Shut up.\" \"It really is beautiful, the sunset.\" \"I pass here everyday. Maybe I never had the time to notice.\" Those are another two wasted minutes.\\n\\n\r\nOther stories do not focus on the characters saying arbitrary things like this because it does not move the story, it is not interesting, and again, it should not define the characters. The show avoids showing and playing events that matter to the story and have the characters do interesting things that could affect the story, unlike other narratives. For example, the characters' guild training, the characters mapping out the abandoned city, the characters gathering information or the characters' relationship dynamics. The things that end up moving the show are the action scenes where the viewers only see some fights and the montages where Haruhiro monologs over to tell the viewers what is moving along. These conflict with conventional storytelling and makes the narrative weak and the characters who have no arcs for themselves, weak as well. Character development is not felt and is not apparent enough because of the lack of character arcs. I would love to use 'antinarrative' as a term for Grimgar, but it holds a different meaning in writing and literature. \\n\\n\r\nIf they removed the setting of Grimgar from Grimgar, have the characters do normal jobs but still show their daily life activities like cooking, waking up, bathing or shopping and then still use the rest of the time for the characters to have conversations about arbitrary topics, the anime would be a bad Slice of Life. Well, it\u2019s already a bad Slice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show has the first ED in anime which consists of one frame. The camera pans over the different characters in that one picture, and a lens flare effect is used. It disconnects the viewers from the song and is lazy and uninspired. This ED sums up Grimgar. Thanks, Grimgar. \\n\r\n- and sorry for the rough read, really terrible writing at work here from sometime ago.\\n",

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash is another example of the `adventurer in another world' genre. What's unique about this particular anime is its focus on the psychological burden, loss, and inter-personal relationships that accompany fighting for a living.\r\nWe follow a party of novice adventurers in a medieval-based fantasy world. The anime emphasizes realism, character development, and team building. The show relies on our empathy with the protagonists, and has a calm but emotional atmosphere.\r\nOne strength of the anime are scenes that blend realism and fantasy; for instance, when the party struggles with the concept of killing other living creatures. Some of the plot deals withthe mental burdens of being a leader---particularly when the role is thrust upon you---and does so in a believable way. The relationships are convincingly complex. At its best, Grimgar reveals what it might be like to adventure in another world.\\n\\n\r\nMy concerns about this anime deal with its inconsistency. One minute the party is fighting for its life, and the next they're worried about who likes who. The female characters are poorly portrayed. The artwork has ups and downs, and there are song interludes that seem unnecessary. The world is not particularly novel.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to viewers who enjoy adventures in another world, because I do think it adds something to this genre. If you are not a fan of isekai anime, I would look elsewhere.\\n",

The watercolour style art is fascinating, especially the backgrounds although I think they make a bit too much accent on the bodies. So it gets 10\r\nWhat I liked the most in here is the depth in which they develop the characters and the group. The accent here is on the development of the characters as a team and for this, they didn't omit developing individuals, showing their weaknesses and strengths. And this is what made me sympathise with every single character in the group even thou sometimes I hated some of them for being morons.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is missing here to get 10 for overall enjoyment, is a bit poor development of the world. I'd like the characters to show more curiosity about the world they are in or seeing a bit more of what's happening behind their backs. I'm surprised they don't want to get out of there or at least find out how they ended up there. But because the story was captivating, I give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nThe world in which they are thrown into reminds RPG a lot. Although, some fans of RPG and computer games don't like this show for not being completely alike. So, if you're one of them, you might want to look for something else.

            "content": "Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash may not be one of the best series of the Winter 2016 season, but it still turns out to be quite an enjoyable adventure.\r\nWhile there is the plot line about the past that is supposed to be the \"big picture\", the show instead focuses on the present, the \"now\". It's never explained nor is it revealed near the end. That whole thing is not important. The first few episodes may have turned off some viewers, as they were kind of slow-paced, and I was one of them. However, once all of that is out of the way, things get alittle more interesting, which made me enjoy it more than I initially did. Though, I must say, despite the story picking up, there's nothing grand in scale, but that doesn't seem like what the series is looking for.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is the key element in this series. We follow this specific group of people and we see just what type of people they are. At times, they get along and cooperate very nicely, and other times they're at each other's throats. We even see them suffer through harsh circumstances that almost breaks them apart (I cannot explain it because major spoiler). All of this is why I like these characters; they have a bit of depth. Since we mainly focus on them, the support characters, while not having much significance to the story, remained as the support. Might I add that the acting, specifically when it came to normal chit-chat, sounded very natural, which gives you empathy for these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThough the animation is pretty good (with some flaws every once in a while), I'd say the most notable aspect is the background design. It gives off that water color painting effect. Locations, such as towns and the forests, are well detailed and gives off a very relaxing atmosphere. This was the first thing that caught my eye when I watched the trailer for the first time. If there was anything to get out of this series, it would have to be the art style of the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having a slow start, Grimgar quickly becomes quite entertaining with likable characters and gorgeous backgrounds. For a fantasy series, it's quite laid back at times, but there's not an entire focus on the action. I would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of the fantasy genre, as well as anyone else.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers that may ruin your experience watching the show. You can\u2019t review this show very well without them, so please watch the show first before reading this review.\r\nThis show started out painfully slow. The characters received very little development individually, and plot seemed to be far from any form of existence. I was about to drop it and not look back.\r\nA curve ball was thrown that I couldn\u2019t have seen coming from a mile way during episode 4. The show seemed so light-hearted, the chances of a main character dying was not something I foresaw, nor expected. I wasn\u2019t expecting those themesin this show, though maybe just I didn\u2019t look deep enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt was already made evident that the goblins weren\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d monsters. They seemed to fear death; they didn\u2019t want to die. They had enough intelligence to understand and comprehend the world around them, what magic was, and who their enemies were. It made me question the moralities of Ranta mercilessly killing a goblin in the early few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back now after completing the final episode my opinion has slightly changed of the first three episodes. Mostly in the areas of team-building, where a group of unwanted and inexperienced individuals were forced to group up in order to survive in the world. They weren\u2019t very good at it though, they stumbled around and almost died multiple times. They recognised that everyone wasn\u2019t very good either. I feel like the author of the light novel paid a lot of attention to minor details than I first saw.\\n\\n\r\nManato\u2019s death served as a turning point of the series. Some characters in particular received a lot of development. Haru was forced into the limelight as the new group leader, a position he never wanted to be in, a choice he was never able to make. His personality evolved a lot, or at least became more evident as the show went on. As a leader, he was in a position where his caring nature leadership qualities could truly be utilized. Prior to Maru\u2019s death, he strikes me as a person who although still cared about those around him, preferred to watch from the outside, never stepping up to take responsibility.\\n\\n\r\nRanta was an annoying brat whose feelings towards the group seemed to change as the show went on. At the very least, he began to realise how the bluntness of his personality affected the people around him. He showed guilt towards it in the final episode, although it didn\u2019t stop him from being a smart arse one more time. I was happy to see he realised the effects of what he was saying.\\n\\n\r\nMary\u2019s stuck up attitude made it seem she cared very little for those around her. Unfortunately I felt the reason behind her attitude to be very clich\u00e9, I saw it from a mile away when it became obvious she wasn\u2019t happy spending her mana. Manato ran out of mana too, which led to that conclusion rather quickly. In terms of her development though, stuck up bitch to best girl in 4 episodes? What can I say?\\n\\n\r\nManato was also not a character that was ever forgotten either. Very often you\u2019ll see death in anime quickly forgotten about by the characters, never showing any form of personal attachment, possibly ever again past the next episode. They always had him on their mind. They didn\u2019t want to take risks for the sake of being a hero, they didn\u2019t want to go through the suffering of losing another friend again.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t feel the remaining characters got enough development later in the show to comment on further and more episodes would have been needed to accomplish that. I do want to say I\u2019m very happy with the range of character personalities the story has without overusing archtypes. My only qualm would be with Shinhoru, seemingly being the only one that was a true archtype/trope girl. All the others seemed to have their own charms and quirks, like Mogozo very politely saying \u201cthankyou\u201d every time he went to make a big strike.\\n\\n\r\nHaving Mary\u2019s friends return in the mines was definitely a highlight for me. It was revealed earlier in the show when Manato died that the dead rise if they are not turned to ash within a set amount of time. So often, a plot device such as this gets completely looked over later in the show, leaving some major inconsistencies. Honestly it almost bothers me that I have to praise it for this; it should be expected by default. Unfortunately, this is often not the case in many airing shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhere I\u2019m critical about the story is its lack of direction. It\u2019s strange, I\u2019m not sure if I need to be critical about it. There always seemed to be a goal. In the first few episodes it was defeating a goblin efficiently. Later it was finding a new healer. Taking revenge. Helping Mary get over her past. Defeating the kobolds. Even at the very least, they wanted to find out who they were themselves as they had forgotten their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nOne part of me argues that because there was no pre-defined goal there wasn\u2019t much of a story. But there was always a story despite that. There was always a reason behind what they were doing. Nothing they did felt pointless. But we never found out how they got there. Though I can\u2019t blame it for that as the light novels continue far past this season. With all that being said, an over-arching plot of some kind definitely would have helped this show by a considerable margin.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was another highlight for this show for me. Yume\u2019s voice actress stood out to me in particular. I\u2019ve never criticised someone\u2019s voice acting before so I\u2019m finding it hard to find the words to support what I want to say, but her voice acting had a legitimacy about it. She wasn\u2019t trying to be a moe blob at the very least, she seemed like a real person talking. Mogzo and Shihoru\u2019s voice actors also had a legitimacy behind their voices. I always enjoyed hearing the three of them speak. Interestingly enough, all three are very new voice actors/actresses to the scene, with Mogozo in particular starring in his first major role. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing more from them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, one of the highlights was the shows aesthetics. And wow, every scene was like a painting, I can\u2019t recall ever seeing a scene that felt lazy. Character designs were on point too, though I must admit I prefer their light novel designs more, I guess they might have been hard to replicate in an animated form especially with time constraints. I\u2019m glad the studio was able to give justice to how pretty the world was, especially since the characters liked the views.\\n\\n\r\nI think this will be an anime I will remember for a long time, particularly in its standards set with its character development and how it turned itself from a 3 to an 8. Season 2 announcement when?\\n\\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n+ Aesthetics\\n\r\n+ Fitting soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Consistent plot devices\\n\\n\r\n- Slow pacing at times, particularly episodes 1-3.\\n\\n\r\nStrory: 6, Art: 10, Sound: 8, Character: 9, Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (this score is not intended to be an average of the above).",

I'm writting it because this no one updated their reviwes and this show desarve to be watched.\r\nThe story is like a common place in now days: Fantasy world entirely based on RPG. The difference is the dramatic focus. Anyone who played Tibia (yep, Tibia) knows how a start is all about pain and poverty. The start here is the same till they start to know how the world works. A lot of people call it boring, but the pace was well conduct: we get to know and like every character. The character development is, therefore, very good.The character design is beuatiful and the background art is outstanding, maybe, the best in A-1 history, and they know it and they don't get tired form showing it. I have nothing to complain about the sound either. \\n\r\nWhen i watched, i felt relaxed and a sort of warmming.

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, another RPG themed anime, this one however is different. \r\nYou might think that this anime is like Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, or any of the other RPG themed anime but once you watch it you will be able to see the difference. Unlike the other RPG anime that appeal to its audience because of action or excitement, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar appeals through drama, it also has a bit of excitement to it but it is more dramatic that the other known RPG anime.\r\nThe story starts off as a group of people enter an unknown fantasy world withoutany recollection of their past or where did they come from, the only thing that they remember is their name. In order to survive and make a living, they have to join the Reserve Army forces. The group of people then starts creating their own parties and of course the strong grouped together leaving the weak ones. The weak ones/leftovers having no choice, forms a party and tadaa~ the party of the main chars is then formed. They have to earn money by killing monsters but they can't even defeat a goblin. So basically the story is about our main characters fighting in order to survive and get stronger.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime, however there are also some things about it that I find lacking. The anime had some emotional events in the first few episodes but it did not affect me that much, maybe its because they tried to push the emotions right away when the story haven't developed that much yet. Another thing is that the conversations are somewhat dull, I don't really know how to explain this so let me just state an example, during the first episode when the guy explains things about the world to the people who just came to Grimgar he was talking about survival, death and stuff but there wasn't any suspense or excitement at all. These things however does not change the fact that this anime is still worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of the anime is pretty good, the colors and character designs are all well made, the backgrounds are a bit rough but not bad. As for the sound the OST is pretty good however the sound effects for some of the scenes are a bit lacking, maybe it is also the reason why I find the conversation scenes so dull. There was also a part where background music would just play while showing the characters just doing various things, I think it was made to immerse the viewers to the story but it was so long that it felt like just an excuse to kill some time and make the episode long enough. The bgm in fight scenes and dramatic scenes are very well done though. Voice acting is also very nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, some are saying that the characters are somewhat bland but for people who have no memories of their past I think that it was somewhat meant that way, it actually kinda feels realistic, besides their characteristics does develop as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a good anime, the pacing is a bit slow and the mood of the anime is also a bit 'calm' unlike the other RPG anime so some people might not enjoy it. It has also a few flaws that caused many people to dislike it but in my opinion it is definitely still worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched this anime yet I would definitely recommend watching it, just a tip as you watch this anime or any other anime, try not to get your judgement affected by the reviews, always keep an open mind and just enjoy watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It was an amazing watch, seeing the characters grow and interact with each other actually made me grow to love them.\r\nStory 9/10\r\n One thing that is so unique about grimgar is that grimgar's story heavily relies on the main protagonist, haruhiro. As haruhiro  grows and slowly transitions into the unknown world, the story gradually progresses. The story's pacing might either be a hit or a miss for most viewers. For me, it was ahit. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound 10/10\\n\r\nAlso, the art and ost plays a huge role in the anime. The art and ost creates the overall ambience to the anime, it was something unique only to grimgar, i cant find the words to describe the feeling while looking at grimgar's art and hearing the soundtracks. The colors used in grimgar really does a good job in showcasing the tone and feelings of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict 10/10\\n\r\nAll in all grimgar has that really unique feel to it, it's a cool yet pleasant slow-paced anime. If youre searching for an anime with great character development and art, Grimgar is the way to go. Best winter anime 2016.",

But yet good character's.\\n\\n\r\nWell for the enjoyment i gave it 10/10 although the small things this show made me watchthe whole first 6 episodes in one day without getting bored! And i had to wait to every episode release since then.\\n\r\nThey show is very fun to watch there is not alot of small details that u have to remember and over all just fun to watch with light looking art and fun story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i pretty much said that in the enjoyment but over all its a show i recommend 9/10 if u really want a grade, by the way i am not trying to make the grade be like the MAL score i give u my score because no show can be prefect.\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar (\"Grimgar of Ash and Fantasy\", which I'll just call \"Grimgar\" in this review) is one of those series I initially dismissed as another Sword Art Online clone, but after reading a few people's comments about it, I decided to give it a try. To my very pleasant surprise, I did not find a Sword Art Online clone, but instead, a more unique take on a very common idea.\r\nI will preface my review with this: if you're looking for the adrenaline rush of Sword Art Online or the genius chessmaster archetype like in Log Horizon, you'll be disappointed with Grimgar. Thisis definitely not a series for everyone, and if anything, is probably one of the more polarizing series of the Winter 2016 season, for reasons which I will go into in this review.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar's premise is quite similar to many anime already out there: a group of characters are somehow stuck in some sort of roleplaying game and are forced to fight and survive in the game's world with dire consequences should they fail to do so. However, I read a comment on a review somewhere that was along the lines of this: \"These are the people who jumped into a D&D game without reading the manual.\"\\n\\n\r\nInstead of our characters being smart, well-practiced gamers (like in Sword Art Online or Log Horizon), our small group of protagonists are probably the weakest amongst the \"Volunteers\", the players who defend the town against monsters. They are so weak that they struggle to defeat just one goblin - the weakest monster of the game - even with their combined efforts. They know little about class systems, about trading loot for money, and all sorts of other things that are required to survive in the game. It is only through the intelligence-gathering work of Manato, their leader, that they learn these things.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, we watch our protagonists struggle, and this is primarily the reason why this series is so polarizing for anime watchers. It's a slow, agonizing, uphill battle for our characters to achieve anything. Some praise this point as being realistic, since there are bound to be noobs in every game but most series don't give these characters much focus, if at all. Others say that it's frustrating to watch characters struggle this much and that this brings the story's pace to a crawl.\\n\\n\r\nI was definitely in the former camp, and here are my reasons why. First of all, I'm generally not a fan of the all-powerful characters, such as Kirito from Sword Art Online. It creates too many plot conveniences and is also unrealistic. Moreover, the slow pace really allowed us, as viewers, to explore the world on the level of a beginner, someone who is discovering the world of Grimgar at the same time as us. It also allows us to get to know the characters, how they interact - for better or for worse - and how they develop, both on a personal level as well as warriors. Each of the group members start out as strangers, but as the days and struggles go on, they grow closer and work better as a team while honing their own individual skills. Lastly, it's satisfying to see our little group of characters start out as complete n00bs and then gradually learn new skills to become decent warriors.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, unfortunately, downsides to Grimgar's slow pace. First, the world of Grimgar seems to be very well thought out, but because the characters make so little progression in the game, we only see a small sliver of it. Second is that the slow pace seemed to be very intentional, and viewers are treated to relatively long pans of various scenery accompanied by a music track. I've read that this was intentional, as the show's sponsors are in the music industry, so they wanted to promote their music as much as possible. Unfortunately, this series is only 12 episodes long, meaning every episode has to count, so the slow scenery pans are very noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nGrimgar is, at its heart, a character-driven show. As I mentioned earlier, the story is slow, so the characters must shoulder much of each episode's weight. We have Haruhiro, the thief and our main protagonist. He's an observer and a thinker, often taking the form of long monologues, but has a sensible head on his shoulders. Manato is the priest and de facto leader, the big brother type of guy that everyone relies on. Ranta is the hot-headed dark knight, the brash loudmouth who causes the bulk of the friction in the team, but is certainly one of their better fighters. Yume is the spunky, if clumsy, hunter, whose positive and bubbly personality balance out Ranta's negative. Shihoru is the timid dark mage. Rounding out the lot is the gentle giant and knight, Moguzo. Another character is introduced later: Mary/Merry, another priest whose cold demeanour initially causes the group to dislike her, but whose past explains why she is the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters start out as pretty archetypal. However, they still thrive within their assigned roles. For example, after a major event that significantly shakes the team's dynamics, Haruhiro learns to push some of his self-doubt aside, stops being just an observer in the background, and begins to take an active role within the group. Ranta is eventually shown to have much more depth than his foul mouth would lead one to believe. And Shihoru, while remaining relatively timid, grows more of a backbone and becomes a mage to be reckoned with. Still, unlike the story, they don't really break any new ground here, and some characters (like Moguzo) don't get nearly as much attention or development as others, which is unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, I do have to mention one very interesting twist: the monsters of Grimgar are shown to be rather sympathetic in a way. Like humans, we see that goblins have societies - they are shown passing time by playing board games or joking around a camp fire. As Manato says in episode 1, both they and the goblins want to live. It is literally a battle of life and death for both sides, and you can see the desperation of our protagonists reflected in their enemies. Moreover, their enemies are not simply pixels to slice through; they are flesh and bone and blood, which our protagonists feel with every hit.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical side of Grimgar, the art and animation of this series is gorgeous. The background art looks like a series of watercolour paintings, with lush scenery and a brilliant array of colours. The character designs, while not groundbreaking or particularly unique (if anything, they are consistent with the typical RPG classes), are well done and each character feels unique. The animation - when there isn't long pans over still scenes - is generally well done and the fight scenes are smooth and well directed. I did, unfortunately, catch the occasional moment where characters were off-model.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound ranges from average to good. Again, I believe this series was made to promote the music of its sponsor, though none of the insert songs or background tracks really stuck out to me. Some tracks are a bit overused, but nothing too horrible. I also really enjoyed both the OP and the ED. I became particularly fond of the little violin riff in the title card sequence of the OP, and it's rather catchy. The ED is much more pensive in tone, reflective of the characters' expressions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect about Grimgar is that none of the main voice actors are the usual big-hitters, like Tomokazu Sugita or Aya Hirano. All of them are relatively unknown with much less main roles to their names, yet they still manage to deliver. My only complaint is that Haruhiro's voice sounds too deep for someone who looks so young, though it does, in a way, suit his more pensive personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment was, for me, high. I looked forward to each episode of Grimgar every week, wondering how the characters might develop or handle a difficult situation despite their underdog statuses. And the payoff at the end (while maybe being just a bit deus ex machina-like, but not so much that it hurt) was worth it. I do hope for a second season, mostly because 12 episodes is much too short for a slow-paced story and a world as detailed as Grimgar's.\\n\\n\r\nIs Grimgar for everyone? Well, no. Is it perfect? Well, no to that, too. But if you don't mind a slower pace and enjoy a good underdog story with realism, then give Grimgar a shot.",

It is true that this anime is slow and that action isn't exactly what's best, characters are not strong at all and this theme was used a lot of times. However art is absolutely awesome. And even if some people might not agree with me, I think the story has great potential that is being misused. \r\nFirst, this story is very realistic, characters have to face the fact that they are not as strong as they want to be as well as learning to live with people you don't really know, and they have toface the fact that in order to survive they have to kill as well and the creatures can sometimes sound pretty humans. I think those are pretty good points. However, there are some other points that are good but you really don't know a lot about it. It is obvious since the first episode that the characters weren't born where they are and that they forgot their memories of before even if we know they probably came from our era since one of them mentionned a cell phone and then was wondering what exactly was a cellphone. This point was absolutely not developped. Really not. And this is why what could have been a really, really interesting anime was not this interesting at all.\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show without finding it really outstanding however it is not bad. This is why I give it a 7 overall!",

            "content": "After the first four episodes of Hai to Gensou no Grimgar had aired, the top reviews mostly shared the same sentiment: \"nothing happened so far, it's boring.\"\r\nIs that fair? Well, in some ways it is, and in some ways it is not.\r\nI believe that a show should be able to draw you in during the first few episodes, preferably already during the first. Sadly, the first few episodes of Grimgar were sorely lacking. I think it is therefore a valid reason to drop a show if it does not hold your interest. After all, there are hundreds of other things you could be watching instead.The only thing that could carry you through the first four episodes is the premise. It is quite interesting to see how a low-level party tries to make it through the day and has trouble with even the most basic of enemies. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes really hurt the show, because the show's second half (episode 5 and onwards) is significantly better than the first. Yet it does not do enough to really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem is the giant group of main characters the show introduces. A whopping six idiots all fighting for screen time. This leads all of them feeling underdeveloped; everyone gets one personality trait. Shy girl with big boobs, dopey girl with small boobs, giant but kind dude, bland main character guy, kind and intelligent party leader, and of course, the dick.\\n\\n\r\nThe asshole of the group, Ranta, suffers the most. His dialogue should sell us on his friction with the rest of the group, but it just comes off as ham-fisted. An example of this is in episode one, when he criticizes Yume for having small boobs. The writers do anything to make you believe that he does not fit in the group. It is sad that they had to resort to lines like the one above, because in later episodes, we see that his dialogue is not always that bad. I will not spoil these lines, I will just say that some conversations are genuinely interesting. However. this makes the bad lines stand out even more.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is just the problem I have with the show: every upside has a downside. I will list some of them here. You can then judge for yourself if the virtues of the show are enough to offset its problems, or vice versa.\\n\\n\r\n1. Yes, the environment looks gorgeous. Every frame is its own little painting. The characters, however, do not gel well with the aesthetic of the background, which is jarring. Fight scenes are not animated well either, which is point 2.\\n\\n\r\n2. Our inexperienced party starts out without any coordination, and the chaotic fight scenes are possibly meant to convey that. But that does not make them enjoyable to watch, and I can tell you that the fight scenes do not get any better as the party becomes more coordinated.\\n\\n\r\n3. If you got through the first four episodes, the show will focus more on the individuals of the party, and how they struggle with loss, their roles in the party, and clashing personalities. The biggest struggles are seen from the main character's point of view and are genuinely interesting problems. But the show leaves nothing to the imagination: everything has to be blatantly told. Focus on communication between the characters in the party makes bad dialogue lines stand out even more.  \\n\\n\r\n4. The party spends most of their time in the starting area of the world. That means that you will be looking at the same goblins for quite a long time. And after twelve episodes, we have only been introduced to two different monsters, whose designs become stale and boring to look at.\\n\\n\r\n5. The pacing of the whole show is slow, yes, but it is kind of comfortable to watch. It also ensures that it has enough time to develop the whole party. If you do not care for any of the characters, however, it becomes a slog.\\n\\n\r\n6. It is refreshing to see that both the male and female characters look, for the lack of a better term, sexy. The guys are all muscular and have a body that fits their role in the party. The girls' character designs are nice as well, but most of the fan service is still from the male perspective and focused on the female characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show's premise has to carry you through the first four episodes. After that, it will focus on the characters and their struggles. If you made it past ep 4 and you find the characters somewhat interesting, stick around, maybe you'll have a good time. If not, just drop it. You will not miss out on the next masterpiece.",

So let's get started!\r\nThis anime is unbelievably slow paced the first four episodes are hunting goblins like no kidding and it continues after that too. -_- If you've read other reviews then you know something big happens in episode 4. This whole anime is just the producers bitch slapping you like 'hey you thought you knew what was gonna happen didn't you? just kidding we lied.' I had that feeling the whole way through. So 1-4 was like ahhhhhhh *gets smacked in the face* wtf?? 5-8 ahhhh is this the end? itwould totally end well here... 9-10 oh my is there actually action in this anime? 11 go! go! go! go! *gets smacked by producers again* wait- that's the end?!!!! didn't this website tell me there were 12 episodes why tf did it stop here?! That's basically it.\\n\\n\r\nStory- average almost boring until the end\\n\r\nArt- it made the characters pop out and it looked like watercolors. I liked it but sometimes it just looked like they were screwing around cuz they had no money for a real background. \\n\r\nSound- nothing special but it wasn't bad either\\n\r\nOverall- When you see the cover it makes you wanna watch it but actually it's just them fishing you in. I feel like the monsters had more character development than the actual characters, but then again if you like slow anime you'll like it. It's not really that special besides the fact the art is original and the producers are giant trolls. \\n\r\nThat's about it thanks for reading ^~^",

            "content": "There are very minor spoilers in this review!\r\nTime and time again this hackneyed and overused plot line of mysteriously waking up in a RPG-esque world has been horribly developed and elaborated on. One dimensional characters, unrealistically dense MC's, and zero tension or atmosphere. Grimgar however, is able to take this concept and expand on it, utilizing its slow pace to build up a well fleshed out story.\r\nStory - 7\r\nGrimgar gives you your typical high fantasy world with some amnesiacs thrown into the mix. Our main group of \"adventurers\" wake up in an unfamiliar environment where they must slay monsters and provide for themselves, all thewhile dealing with their own various issues. Grimgar does an exceptional job at creating a tense mood that reflects the situation they are in. The slow pace of the story also matches this, allowing the anime to slowly ease you in to the story. The reoccurring theme throughout the series provides a simple example of the volatility of the butterfly effect. Even the tiniest changes can have catastrophic repercussions, such as death or even something worse.\\n\\n\r\nNow here are some parts where Grimgar falls short of an adequate mark. A lot of the time, parts of the story tended to dabble on certain things for too long and melodrama ran amok in certain scenes. This former may be due to Grimgar's sluggish pacing, but that's all of course to personal preference depending on whether or not you are irked by slow anime. However, the latter is simply because of overly exaggerated scenes. While some instances the event is realistically reacted upon, other times it seems unnecessarily magnified.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - 9 respectively\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures has created beautiful and gorgeousl character models as expected of them. They are all equally on par and arguably even better than their past works. The sound track of Grimgar gives off a soothing tone and can be compared to that little cherry on top of your ice cream sundae. I think I should also mention the opening of Grimgar by (K) NoW_NAME. It's absolutely stunning. The first few seconds of it really just resonates with something within you. Kudos to them for putting out this superb song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nI think this is the area that Grimgar excels most in. The way each character has their distinct flaws and strengths gives them a very much \"real\" appearance. There are no Gary Stu's or Marty Stu's and the way the characters change from events does have a huge impact on them as a whole. An example of this is when Haruhiro is put up to the pedestal to lead the party. He struggles to cope with his new role and constantly beats himself up because he thinks of himself as incompetent for the role.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters independently are quite impressive themselves, the relationships between the characters elevate this even further. Even if it seemed the characters couldn't care less about one another at the beginning of Grimgar, over time they developed a care and understanding for each other. They leaped over hurdles together as they embraced the mad world that they have stumbled into.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 7\\n\r\nWhile Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is no masterpiece, it certainly places itself above the mediocre of mediocre. It was pleasant to see each of the characters grow and change as I followed their progression through the anime. Even if the anime grew monotonous at certain points, it redeemed itself through its wonderful cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now now, this is, for me, the best adventure and fantasy anime of the season and perhaps for the year. This is just my opinion, but this anime deserves to be at least in the top 10 best anime of this year in everyone's book.\r\nOur main character, Haruhiro, gets sent from our world to a fantasy world called Grimgar with no memories of his past life. We have seen this premise a lot of times before. \r\nBut in this anime, our MC doesn't start being OP like Jesus Kirito from SAO. We see our MC and his companions struggling to get by everyday. Their personalitiesare realistic. They cry, they feel despair, they feel lust, they get angry, we see realistic responses a group of teenagers would normally have. Even the righteous and seemingly perfect Manato gives in lust when the opportunity to peep on the girls when they are bathing.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like realistic personalities in your main character then this is your anime. Sometimes it gets annoying because our main character is so indecisive but you see him growing up when Haruhiro gets forced to become leader of his party and the previous one dies.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime comes from a Light Novel. The anime follows the light novel story wise, but there are some differences between the relationships between character that honestly, are better than the light novel in some aspects. Like in the light novel it seems the author is shipping MogzoxMary and Haru gets shipped with another girl (I don't know much about her, I don't know japanese and the LN is translated just to a part of vol 3, we haven't seen much about her) but the anime ships HaruxMary (best ship) or HaruxYume (cutest ship), and it does it beautifully. Not your typical anime when you suddenly see two characters getting lovey-dovey. You see how Haruhiro advances in his relationship with our cold goddess priest Mary and our cute hunter Yume.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is SLOW. And it is not something new, but seeing the way how the author likes to keep things realistic I am sure that we will see some dark stuff and more death in the second season of this anime. I mean, don't you hate how in previous animes our hero gets sent to kill the enemy just to see that he can't do it because the enemy turned out to be a hot girl or it is his father/part of his family or best friend?\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great, the opening and ending won't get in the top 10 for this year maybe but it suits the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see your characters growing up, then you will enjoy. But if you are the type that wants to skip character development, then you might not enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nArt, sound, character 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar is a slow paced, light-hearted, fantasy anime which takes its time to delve into world and character building.\r\nIn the first 3 episodes we are introduced to the main cast and can clearly see how they fit into the clich\u00e9 character tropes. However, as the story progresses you can see how they aren't just your run of the mill cast of characters. You watch them grow and become better people (and fighters). I would say the characters are one of the strongest aspects of this anime due to them developing largely over the 12 episodes, (although a couple are pushed tothe sidelines). But when a significant event happens the anime makes sure to delve into how each character personally reacts allowing the viewer to have a deeper emotional connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the anime is very character based its fight scenes and animation are done well. Each character has their own fighting style making it more interesting to watch. I personally think the backgrounds in this anime are beautiful and compliment the foreground very well as they have been done in a simple, pastel toned way. Never the less, the animation is mostly smooth but sometimes the quality lowers in conversation scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave Hai to Gensou no Grimgar a score of 7 because of its characters. I definitely wouldn't say it's a masterpiece but each episode introduces you to the characters more and helps you understand what they are going through, although it is slow paced it is a nice casual watch for any fantasy lovers. \\n\\n\r\nThere's hopefully a season 2 in the horizon because there are many plot holes but, they are most likely covered in the light novels.",

The world appears to be a standard RPG with specific classes, parties, and monsters. The majority of the focus is on character development.\r\nThe art looks like watercolor. Mostly shades of blue and green. Definitely, not what I expected from A-1 Pictures. It bothered me initially, but I got used to it. \r\nSound didn't really stand out to me. Opening and ending are serviceable but not great. None of the subbed voice acting stood out to me as particularly great. \r\nCharactersare the high point of the show. Since they aren't fully aware of the past world or their current game world, the characters have a normal human reaction to situations. A goblin screams in pain. It's a sentient creature that desperately wants to escape, not a thing to attack. How do they find peace within this harsh kill or be killed world? How do they cope with loss? Are there goals to strive for? Normal people would have these issues in a life like game and the show devotes a sizable chunk of time to it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise it falls between Sword Art Online and Log Horizon. It has the perma death of SAO mixed with the living in the game of LH. The action isn't as spectacular as SAO but heavily leans on tactics and planning like LH. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Grimgar carves a nice place for itself alongside the other fantasy game anime.

            "content": "A couple of months ago,  I asked on Reddit, \"What is the Andy Dalton of anime?\".  This anime was one of the answers I received. Since I imagine most members of MAL are not fans of professional American Football, let me explain. The Andy Dalton Line is a hypothetical line for performance in terms of Quarterbacks. If your Quarterback plays better than Andy Dalton, you should keep him. If your Quarterback plays worse than Andy Dalton, you should be searching for a new Quarterback. After watching this 12 episode, I have to agree that this show falls squarely as a Dalton. It ishowever, very taste dependent. Keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories starts off with a bunch of teenagers (?) transported to another world. I say teenagers because anime likes working with teenagers, but the ages aren't actually mentioned. That and I presume they are from Earth from dialogue hints, but all of them have lost their memories of their previous lives. It's a story justification to make them complete novices in a fantasy world. I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of them weren't in their early twenties. We're following the less successful of the two groups, and it shows. Even killing one goblin is a struggle. \\n\\n\r\nA major positive of this show is that nothing is taken for granted. One of the main characters is actually excited about buying underwear. I also really liked the pacing. It's very slow so that might not be liked, but I remember each episode focusing on one important event.  The art is also kinda pretty even if the character designs are bland. \\n\\n\r\nThis show also has its problems. The most obvious one is Ranta. Ranta is that guy that makes fun of a girl's chests. You know the guy that thinks it's a good idea to go peep on the girls in the bath. Yeah, that guy. I was honestly surprised that he remained a part of the group. Between that and his refusal to communicate what he was doing, I would have kicked him out several times over. Would have made a nice change in pace. But maybe that's due to them having to adapt to other changes in party composition. \\n\\n\r\nThe other major problem is a bit more subtle. At one point, the group has to integrate a new archpriest into their group after losing the old one. The archpriest is a healer and usually leads the group. Naturally this makes them the first target of the monsters, especially as it's mentioned that parties need an archpriest to be successful. So my issue here is why the group doesn't get a second archpriest? Redundancies in a parties are possible. We see a party with two Warriors in it at one point. I would think a party with two archpriests would be much more stable. They can even heal other.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, should you watch this anime? Probably. If the premise is up your alley,  I would not be left scratching my head if this show got another Season, which should say enough.",

            "content": "Here is a little bit words that picture grimgar:\r\nGame(?)(not sure since the story doesn't mention it is, but safe to assume it is alike SAO, Overlord, but with no game elements at all)\r\nAdventure, Middle Age, Slice of Life.\r\nAs far as I watch this anime, unfortunately I can't give more than 6. Most of it because of the story, and the reason I keep on watching probably because of the artwork and sheer curiosity of what's going on actually with them, how they got there, and how will it end, that's it.\r\nStory: \r\nOne thing that make Grimgar doesn't really fun in terms of story is howwe doesn't know the beginning (why they're there in Grimgar) and the lack of purpose of what they're doing (unlike SAO, we definitely know what the character have to do, and the story goes along with it) It is really difficult to get a grip of things that going throughout the story. Story goes very slow and almost too slow for a 12 episodes (with this kind of pace it probably suited to at least 150 above anime IMHO). The character did die (unlike Durarara! where no one, not even bad guys dead), but when they die, they don't die at the climax, and that's make me feel \"What, he's dead?\" Nothing so dramatic about it and it is hard to catch that sadness from it, I can say that I don't feel attach with any character in the story (Unlike Kiseijuu's main character)\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nAbove all other parts, this is the one that stand out the most, and probably the reason why I keep on watching this anime. The colouring is very distinct (pastel like colouring) it's so colourful and eye feasting. Character design is mature with muscular accent in man character (something that rarely seen in this cross shounen-shoujo anime). There is reasonable amount of fan-service which is great. The world design is awesome, with huge amount of details served.\\n\\n\r\nThis is somehow have a 50-50 of slice of life and action adventure, but the action adventure and combat doesn't appealing. Unlike HunterXHunter where every detail of combat told, how the character develop through process of training, and how the character evolves from nothing to something, this what Grimgar DOESN'T have at all which is quite regretful considering it is a very good artwork anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who is going to watch this, if you are looking for adventure and combat story, this is NOT for you. But if you like artwork, slice of life with calm and slow pace story with a colossal classic theme, this is something for you.",

            "content": "Grimgar was arguably my favorite anime of the Winter 2016 season. Although many people criticize it for its EXTREMELY slow pacing, I think this show actually pulls it off. This show really isn't focused around action and fight scenes, although they are present. Rather, the shows takes the common theme of \"throw characters into an RPG-esque fantasy world where they can't escape\" and focuses on character development, relationships (almost exclusively platonic), and teamwork. It doesn't shy away from the difficult situations that a team might face in a world where they put their lives on the line, and it portrays well how slow their sortof lifestyle may be. Because the main team is comprised of those newbies who nobody else wanted, none of them are particularly special, but they make up for their lack of skill with determination and strategic teamwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely beautiful with watercolor-like environments contrasting with the anime-look you'd expect from the characters. The character designs themselves are fairly plain, which fits very well with the tone of the show. The soundtrack, OP/ED, and insert songs were decent, but not particularly special. The main appeal of this show is really the characters and how they react to the situations presented to them. While I could call it the \"drama\" between characters, it really isn't overly dramatic, and feels very real.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 10/10 for being thoroughly enjoyable, despite some of its shortcomings (like some less-than-stellar animation at times, its seemingly randomly added insert songs, etc.). But beware aware that the pacing is very slow, and unless you're ready to sit back and just be in the moment, you may get impatient.",
