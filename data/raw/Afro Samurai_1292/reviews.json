And their voices get put through the test as they  use their voices for multiple characters in the series. And the voices they portray are very believable in my opinion. \r\nAs in terms of animation value, one only needs too look at their hair and their tattered clothing flowing in the windjust like in a classic samurai showdown of the old days. Everything is very artistic and not to mention VERY gory (which is a plus for me). \\n\\n\r\nAs expected of a 5 episode series, the story is not very detailed on character backgrounds and side stories except the main character (their website more than explains each character). But, they do throw you in the mix right away. The main character \"afro samurai\" is the second samurai in the world. And he is on a mission to become the number one samurai in the world. And thats where the story starts, his journey to his headquarters. \\n\\n\r\nthe verdict? For those who want a quick pick me up action anime that you can finish in one sitting, by all means pick this up! but if youre looking for a super long anime, youre looking in the wrong place.",

It was recommended several times to me, but when I got round to watching it, I was appalled at the terrible, nonsensical story.\r\nFirst of all, the story as a whole is VERY mediocre: boy loses father, boy gets revenge on fathers killer, etc. It's like something from Daredevil. But the thing that really, REALLY pisses me of is this: he hardly ever fights humans. Seriously. He fights killer robots, humanoids and weird monks (one armed with a bazooka!), and finally a guy with 3 arms.\r\nThat is why this series comes off as poor.\r\nHowever,this is saved by the excellent animation with unique styling and excellent sounds. The artwork is great, and the voice acting by Samuel L Jackson adds the extra bad-assery that the show needs.\\n\\n\r\nThe charaters were pretty bad. You know how I feel about the enemies, but even Afro-Samurai is badly portrayed. He's a 2D character, and the writers thought that if loads of bad stuff happened to someone, I'll automaticly feel sorry for him and be on his side. No, it doesn't work like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not a series worth avoiding, but only because it's so short. There are plently of better anime to watch in the mean time.",

Jackson is here but, that doesn't make the anime good, the story and the characters should, not a big movie star.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is mediocre at best, the story follows a vengeful, full of hatred man named Afro, who saw his father the bearer of the n.1 headband being killed by the bearer of the n.2 headband named Justice just for the sole reason of becoming a god (don't know how a headband will grant you that but...ok) and he tells Afroif he wants revenge he'll be waiting, that's where the 5 eps. anime starts with one problem, nonsensical bulls**t, what happened to the earth? why is technology only used by a group of old guys? why people can only kill the n.2 so they can kill n.1 and not directly? why those headbands are important anyway? or why those thing aren't explained? don't know and i couldn't care less now, it was boring, the only thing they were focused on was the past, in every eps. 15 min. of his past and 3 of action but they forgot the present and the unexplained.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nIt wasn't bad but i didn't like it, it's a combination of western cartoons and anime (like Tokyo Tribe), it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was fine, the sound effects were bad, the voice acting was ok because only Jinno and Ninja Ninja (the one with white afro) had good voice acting and Afro (Samuel L.

And I'll tell you what, they were very successful, one of the best dubbed anime I ever heard.\r\nThey managed to fit everything like the art... I mean look at the details of the characters' drawings, their particular portraits, the dark \"aura\" they managed to bring from this dark world and look at cool gore scenes! A nice fitting music, enjoyable action moments and all in 5 episodes. What about Samuel Jackson's voicecoming from Ninja's mouth? It is just... Awesome!!\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, the story goes around a futuristic feudal Japan where there are two headbands: Headband no.1 and Headband no.2. The fighter who holds the No.1 is considered god-like, the best of the best and can only be challenged by the one who holds the No.2 one. However, everyone, but literally everyone, can challenge the No.2 holder for the headband, meaning lots of trouble for that guy. Afro's father was the No.1 holder and died against a character named \"Justice\". Seeking revenge, Afro got the No.2 headband and is now heading to where \"Justice\" is waiting for him. \\n\\n\r\nHe goes on as some people try to stop and kill him to get the No.2 title and at the same time we learn about Afro's past as he was training to be a great samurai. The fighting scenes are very enjoyable and the story is very simple but it is the typical good samurai revenge story. However, the characters are not that much deeply explored and explained, unlike Afro, but I personally think that it's not necessary in this case.\\n\\n\r\nA nice 5-episode anime to watch in a row. Everything it needs to be an awesome samurai-way entertainment. And the final scene... It just gave me chills! :P\\n\\n\r\n\"It's nothing personal... It's just revenge\" ~ Afro",

The series does manage to succeed with its characters; while they're mostly cliches, they're also humorous and light-hearted enough that one enjoys their presence.\r\nBut ultimately, this series is all about the action.\r\nAnd in that capacity, this anime succeeds; the fights between Afro and his enemies are visually stunning and well-choreographed. The movements are original, the enemies arebizarre and detailed, and motion feels very fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAs with \"Snakes on a Plane\", the title tells you all that you need to know; \"Afro Samurai\" is a fun, entertaining series, which is all it ever strove to be.",

Had Samuel L Jackson not done some extra voices (like the annoying Ninja Ninja character, who is just a tad more tolerable than Jar Jar Binks) he would've had about 5 seconds of dialogue since the 'hero' isn't much of a talker.\r\nThe only savinggrace for this is the quality of the animation, which is nothing short of superb. It would've been so much better if they ditched it as an anime and used it as a music video or something like that.\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna go out ahead and say that most people should watch Afro Samurai at least once, or give the first episode a chance.\r\nStory: The story is pretty flat, but at it's heart it follows the traditional revenge story. Samurai blaxploitation revenge even. Not at all uncommon for anime. However, this anime is genre wise ALLl over the place. The main antagonist Afro seems to be pursuing through the anime is a gunslinger, so you think a bit of a samurai spaghetti western for a moment ( think Sukiyaki Western Django ), but then he's totally fighting cyborgs. Now, you ask yourself what the helljust happened, but that's the thing it does it really well and fits into the Afro Samurai universe by itself that you really pay no mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: For a nation that hasn't exactly been known for it's positive portrayal of people of color ( and use of black face among other things ), I honestly think the creator got Afro right for this. I have no complaints about the animation. It flows beautifully. I don't think I could like the anime nearly as much if the art wasn't as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is very good in Afro Samurai also. The wind blowing scenes do very well, as you can hear their clothes blowing smoothly, not choppy crappy sound effects you get in a lot of anime or recycled sound effects used in some movies. The music is done by RZA, and if the name isn't familiar then you're probably not familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan. The soundtrack is dare I say it...and I think I do, \"dope\". It is amazing, it is a mixture of not only hip hop but some rock for some tunes. Not to mention the voice acting. Samuel L. Jackson is the icing on the cake for the voice. I could listen to this man's lines over and over again. \"DO THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT!?!\"  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Afro is pretty flat. He only has one objective: \"Get the headband.\"\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure what compelled me to like Afro, by all means he's kind of boring minus his awesome blade skills. The other characters aren't really developed upon much, but toward the end of the series we see a lot more into Afro's thoughts through flashbacks. However, Afro himself remains stoic, even though his previous incarnation was quite animated. Due to the events we witness through flashbacks, it's safe to assume when we find Afro now he's sealed himself off. He doesn't grow through out the series visibly, I'd say he's not very round at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. There are good animes ( that win awards ), and there are AWESOME animes. The difference is, awesome animes aren't always good or thought provoking, and good animes are not always awesome ( think A Whisper of the Heart, good anime, but not awesome ). If you're the kind of person who watches movies lots of action movies and frequently says \"There weren't enough explosions.\" chances are you'll like Afro Samurai for it's awesome factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. I give it an 8.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS. \r\nI tend to like going into anime that don't require me to think deeply, or search for symbolism. I mean I like thought provocative stuff but it's just this type of thing appeals to my more lazy nature. \r\nThat being said Afro Samurai definitely doesn't require you to analyse details or think about character motivations, let alone explore their psyche. I went into this show looking for action, maybe some good technical performances (BGM, animation, good fights) as well. Sadly this doesn't make it any good to me. If I were to take aside the brilliant animation and art to explore this showfrom a critic's point of view \u2014 there would be nothing to redeem it. \\n\\n\r\nWhatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off strongly, showing a boy witness the brutal decapitation of his father: an act that justifiably sees him take on a journey of vengeance to eventually murder his father's killer in the future. Now THAT is a statement. Buuuut...even a person who loves this show greatly would agree that...there's pretty much no story. I went into this anime expecting nothing from the story either way. Yeah, there's a ton of flashbacks in between fight scenes to add some superficial layers to Afro or the people he's in contact with \u2014 but that's pretty much filler to the action scenes. Overall very poor in the story department, but that's understandable considering what this anime is trying to be. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I take rip this anime apart, I want to list its positives. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this show is downright gorgeous. I love how smoothly done the fights are: channeling the best of Samurai Champloo in some of its fights together with all these satisfying sound effects when blades make contact with each other, or when tear into flesh. The artists have done a good job nailing the atmosphere as well, I was in love with some of the shots in Afro Samurai. There's really some great cinematography here. Also the dubbing is the best lol. Samuel L. Jackson knocks his role out of the park, with some of the greatest voice work I've ever seen. He brings such life to his character that actually highlight his abilities as an artist himself. Job impeccably done. \\n\\n\r\nSadly that's about it. That's all I can enjoy about this show.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are fans of the soundtrack, but I'm just fully underwhelmed by it. Let's start with the BGM...which feels so cheaply done at some points. Some of the sounds feel like the things you produce when you go to a 90's keyboard and click on the different modes (Latin/Bossa Nova etc) while playing four or five notes again and again. While there are a few scenes where the music complements the mood/action sequences, they are sadly too few and far between. The overwhelming majority of the BGM put me off so bad. There are occasions where important characters are thrust into (what's supposed to be) emotionally draining situations\u2014and you just have an awkward BGM that keeps you stoned in your seat, just not feeling anything.\\n\\n\r\nThat kinda pissed me off. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe some of you may like it, I agree that music is a very subjective experience...but I feel it could have been miles better. It didn't bring anything new to the table and it wasn't faithful to hip hop. But if you're expecting something along what Nujabes contributed to Champloo, please just don't get your hopes up.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned that the animation was pretty sick\u2014but based on what I've watched so far, all of this is style and not substance. I draw parallels from the hand to hand fight scenes in Cowboy Bebop or even Fate: Zero. Every move made sense in the flashy fights you see in those shows, there was a REASON for every punch thrown, an intended effect. Drawing back to even shows such as Samurai Champloo (the easiest comparison here): Afro's swordplay (at its best) is animated as gloriously as Champloo's, but the tactical nature of the latter is missing in the former. Afro Samurai is choreographed to be more of a flashy dance, flying from wall to wall and breaking through stuff; rather than to actually defeat an opponent with style.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don't know, but for a fighting/action anime to lack meaningful choreography...it just made this anime harder to enjoy given that it has little to no plot, exceptionally shallow characters and as I've mentioned, an overall underperforming BGM. On the note of characters here; again...nothing much. It doesn't have an expressive cast, and its MC shows nothing much and isn't relatable in the slightest. Perhaps the only thing worth noting about Afro was how much regret and doubt he harbours in him for most of the show, but that's really all there is to say about him. I can't really go into the other aspect of this show because that would be a spoiler, but rest assured \u2014 it's nothing much. You shouldn't be looking for characterisation in this anime either, won't find a single ounce. Every other character is extremely forgettable, not playing a role at all\u2014unless they're fodder to Afro's blade. \\n\\n\r\nAnd ah yes, the final boss fight. I expected something at least...gripping. But I was met with the same \"gore is god\" mentality after a cheap and insignificant plot twist. Not even a decent fight. No great moves, none of the fun animated fight pieces that the show flaunted in its first 30 mins. \\n\\n\r\nMeh. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed probably the first 30 mins of Afro Samurai but the action got very repetitive after that. It's only strength and selling point was something that lost me as the show went on longer; and given that there aren't strong characters, or anything else of value besides for the action...I found myself just hoping it would end already. And right now as I type this review, I'm just glad I'm done with this. Maybe there's stuff I missed, but I'm just not in the mood to revisit this show anywhere in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Afro Samurai is not a show that EVERYONE can enjoy. I sure as hell disliked the living daylight out of it, but it's something you should consider giving a go nevertheless\u2014if you feel you may like it. As you can see it rubbed me off the wrong way, but several of the points I penalised it for may actually appeal to you, as this kind of experience varies with the individual. \\n",

            "content": "I picked this anime up one night while just walking through the anime section. I had heard it was pretty good so i wanted to check it out. To my surprise I noticed that the series was only five episodes long. They do in fact just through you into the story without a lot of backstory on any of the characters except for Afro Samurai. \r\nStory: The story was short, but it got straight to the point. Their are two rankings of Samurai in the world, The Number One, and The Number Two. The whole series is really about Afro Samurai, being the Number Twosamurai trying to become The Number One and Avenging his father who was killed for the number one spot. I liked the story because as it does follow the traditional style of anime, it is different in it's own right.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I found the animation to be really good, but that's just in my opinion. I thought the detail of everything in the settings was animated very well, and the characters themselves as well. The gore is brought out the best way it could be without being excessive. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: The music for this anime was different being more of a rap song, with a sweet beat. It's not something you would expect in a normal anime, but compliments this show very well, and the music throughout is also very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give Afro Samurai an 8, because it was very good even thought it was only five episodes, it had the copasity to be so much longer, probably even as long as a traditional anime being 25 to 50 episodes. It's a good anime that I myself would recommend to others that are looking for a action filled anime that they can watch in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and this is my first review!! ^_^",

            "content": "Story-4/10\r\nThe story follows a not so \"typical,\" ronin seeking revenge of the death of his father. Taking place in a world where the Strong's passion is to beat the even stronger and tougher; Afro (Who is named that because of his afro hairdo I guess,) is seeking the one who defeated his father in order to retain the title of #1.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that the protagonist only motive for his blood-thirsty actions is to find the guy that killed his father that he could barely remember. Yes, revenge is the only excuse for the plot of Afro Samurai, andit never goes any deeper than that, at the same time leaving no depth for any character personality. All of the character development is comprised of super macho men in stand-offs that ends in a gruesome scene; the premise of this story is fairly shallow and generic. \\n\\n\r\nI always love action that have a lot of gore, but this series just overdid it. With zero investment in the characters, a non-sensual storyline, even the fluid animations seemed boring after a few episodes. You know that the main character is not going to get even much of a scratch on him; every challenger is just going to get his butt-kicked with much to none of a chance to retaliate. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is everybody aiming to beat Afro? Apparently only the one with the title of #2 can challenge the one with the #1 headband; what the series is telling me is that everybody wants to title of #2 so they can be targeted and attacked by murderers like themselves? \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah! Did I mention we got Rpgs and guns vs swords? XD\\n\\n\r\nArt-8.5/10\\n\r\nWeirdly enough, I really enjoyed the animations of this anime. The dark and vivid color palette really fit in with the atmosphere of the anime. The animation is wonderfully detailed and flashy, but hardly realistic at times. You can either find this animation super fake; as Afro blocks arrows and slices bullets with ease, or setting all realism aside and find the animations super cool (like me!) With the deep shadows and amazing effects mixed with a beautiful slash of red, all in a super fluid motion. I do find the character designs weird, as they kind of look abstract some of the times.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7.5/10\\n\r\nWe have Samuel Jackson voicing Afro. Half of the people that watch this show probably came for his voice. But sadly, the rest of the cast's voices just seemed bland and tasteless for me. The Op and Ost are nothing special either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5/10\\n\r\nAfro is a super overpowered and cool character. He rather sets things straight with violence than reason, not giving a fuck to anything else. Afro is the definition of badass; he does what he wants, where he wants, when he wants while holding an imaginary middle-finger to everybody that looks at him the wrong way. All the men in this anime look fairly badass, while women on the other hand are just decorations in this anime for the fan-service factor.\\n\\n\r\nAll villains are giant egomaniacs that engage in fights with opponents that are much more powerful, but are too dumb to realize that they cannot win. In the end, they all just end up as another blood stain on Afro\u2019s sword. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10\\n\r\nAfro samurai was a waste of time, but not a total waste of time. The characters had zero depth, and the plot was terribly bad. It did though; provide an excellent visual presentation and a great action atmosphere and lots of badass moments. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch a unique art style with lots of gore and flashy stunts.\\n\r\nThe anime only contains 5 episodes, so if you have some spare time, you can finish this anime fairly fast.\\n",

            "content": "When I first started watching Afro Samurai, I was blown away by the action scenes early on, as well as how contrived and generic the plot was. My early theory was that the plot was mostly around in order to set up more fights. As I got a few more episodes into the show, I was extremely disappointed to realize that the show creators didn't seem to realize how weak their own plot was, as flashbacks from Afro, and the main plot actually take up a very good chunk of the screen time, and those parts are pretty consistently boring.\r\nAfro's plot is just plain stupidreally. It starts off with the always reliable revenge story, but then it turns into a lot of stupid crap about trying to be #1 in the world. The character motivations to kill the hell out of each other never really make sense, so it's frustrating that so much time is spent on them. \\n\\n\r\nThey try really hard to make Afro the coolest man ever, but well, he ends up not really standing out from any \"badass\" character I've ever seen. Pretty much every other character in the show is basically annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAfro's main redeeming point is the fights, in which there are sadly not enough of them. All the fights in Afro are ridiculously gory, stylish, and satisfying. I might even say jaw-dropping. It's easy to look forward to the fights, but sadly, they don't occur nearly as often as they should. The amount of the fights on the show do start to increase a bit as the show goes on, but for the most part, they don't seem as good as the show goes on. I think that after the initial shock and awe of the blood and gore, the fight scenes kind of lose their effect, but they are still pretty fun.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai's attempts to be stylish and cool really work when it comes to the fights. When it comes to the plot, the attempt to make a classic tale super cool and stylish end up falling completely flat. Afro Samurai was a shot with high potential to be an awesome guilty-pleasure. Instead, I just felt guilty that I devoted an hour and a half of my life to it. I wouldn't reccomend watching this, even if you are a total action freak.",

            "content": "Afro Samurai is an example of blaxploitation in anime working gallantly. We follow a revenge-driven man simply called Afro, learning more about him through flash-backs, as he strives to be the number one swordsman.\r\nThere are several things that sets this apart from typical blaxploitation titles.  Most of it for the better. Firstly, it has high-quality animation that makes it look like it had a far higher budget than most titles in its genre. Its main characters are fleshed out to a greater degree than I had expected. In addition, it barely even touches upon racial stereotypes and ethnic differences. Why I think this allworks, is that now it stands out with amazing stylized art, more relatable main characters, and conflicts that are more personal to them, rather than just racist villains who'd want to fight Afro because he's black and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Afro by all accounts is fleshed out in his backstory, he also suffers from being a silent protagonist. This makes Afro less interesting to watch by himself, but it fixes this problem by making his interactions with the world around him all the more contrasting and entertaining, especially with his ninja counter-part. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do love battle royales and tournament-anime, Afro Samurai is a gauntlet-story, where the journey mainly consists of going through one minor villain after another in order to get to the boss at the top, video-game-logic. It falls into the same trappings as most other stories of its kind, which would be several villains that are just 1-dimensional throw-aways, and a very linear journey with no particular twists. Despite not usually being a fan of the format I think it did the best it could with its plot in how it told it.\\n\\n\r\nA simple plot with good music, visuals, and entertaining characters.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: Have you ever wanted to watch a cartoon version of Samuel L. Jackson kill the population equivalent of the state of New Hampshire while wielding a katana? \r\n\u2026What do you mean, \u2018no\u2019?\r\n\u2026Not even a little?\r\nAfro Samurai is a post-apocalyptic  western scifi samurai tale of vengeance, in which Afro, the titular samurai, seeks to kill the man who killed his father and claim the Number One headband, the symbol of Afro\u2019s father\u2019s former status as the deadliest man alive.  Afro can only challenge the new Number One while wearing the Number Two headband.  The catch is that the position ofNumber Two is perpetually up for grabs, and countless people attempt to kill Afro and take the headband for themselves.  These people tend to fail spectacularly before being sliced open and producing enough blood to fill a kiddie pool, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from trying.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise leads the audience to all sorts of interesting questions.  Where did these headbands originate from?  Do they actually grant any special powers, or are they only significant because of the status they convey?  Who made them?  Why is claiming them more important than attempting to rebuild society in the wake of nuclear holocaust?  How the hell does Afro keep his hair looking  so perfect when all the salons in the world have been wiped out of existence?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to all of these questions is, \u201cLook how badass Afro is!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, watching Afro being a badass is fairly entertaining on its own.  The striking, unique visuals and masterful animation are coupled with a gloriously shameless love of camp.  At one point, Afro slices a rocket propelled grenade in half with a katana, and suffers no ill effects when it explodes directly next to him.  At another, Afro fight an evil robot clone of himself, who, in the fight\u2019s climax, uses rocket boosters to carry itself and Afro into the atmosphere before they both plummet back to Earth.  This is a show that can seamlessly move between beautifully choreographed and animated sword-fights to a cheesy disregard for physics normally reserved for the kind of 80\u2019s science-fiction movies you see at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin.  Afro Samurai has little going for it beyond sheer visual spectacle and style, but these are two areas it undoubtedly excels in.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: Afro Samurai is a series whose presentation is at odds with its own themes.  The central message of the story, perhaps the only thing that might elevate it beyond the level of being highly stylish, violent and sexual fluff, is that a drive for vengeance and unchecked ambition are terrible forces that ultimately lead only to tragedy.  The problem is, it\u2019s hard to take that message seriously when 95% of the series is screaming, \u201cLook how badass our hero is!\u201d while he\u2019s taking vengeance and murdering countless people on his quest to be the single baddest muthafucka on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kill Bill films (the other campy anachronistic samurai story of vengeance Jackson was in) struggled with the same problem, but the protagonist of Kill Bill was capable of running the full gambit of human emotion.  She was capable of sorrow and regret and love, and this helped ground the vengeance story in spite of its gore and camp.  Afro displays no such humanity.  He is a blood-stained power fantasy with all the emotional depth of a can of Axe body-spray.  When, as a child, his quest for vengeance leads to the death of his foster family, he simply writes it off as the cost of avenging his father.  Not only is Afro seemingly incapable of recognizing the consequences of his actions or considering redemption, he never does anything that could make us like him on a level other than, \u201cWhat a badass!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a particularly gross sequences of events in which an enemy spy falls in love with Afro, then sacrifices herself to save him from an ambush.  Why does she fall for a man who rarely says more than three words at a time?  Because Afro is a badass, of course.  He is the most badass badass of all baddasses, so it goes without saying that in addition to being ridiculously good at killing people, he can also make every woman he meets wanna screw him by doing literally nothing.  In fact, he\u2019s too badass to even bother changing facial expressions during their lengthy, gratuitous and utterly unsatisfying sex scene.  You\u2019d think the death of this poor woman would have some degree of emotional fallout, but Afro never expresses guilt over being unable to save her, never considers seriously pursuing a relationship with her instead of continuing his quest for vengeance, and never mentions her name again.  In fact, none of the women in the series accomplish much other than dying to motivate men or shaking their asses at the camera.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a popular theory going around the internet to account for Afro\u2019s seeming lack of depth that is worth addressing here.  The theory posits that Ninja Ninja, Afro\u2019s obnoxious jive-talking companion, is actually a figment of his imagination, or else a personification of his inner thoughts.  The numerous times Ninja Ninja clearly interacts with physical objects contradicts this, but ignoring that, the idea that Afro is so emotionally damaged that he has literally cast out his feelings and conscience as a separate entity is a potentially interesting idea\u2026 an idea that, like the series\u2019 premise and setting, receives zero exploration.  As a series, Afro Samurai lacks the patience to give attention to anything but sex and violence, and once the thrill of the visuals wears off, this leaves it feeling hollow and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Afro Samurai is all flash and no substance.  While its visuals are strong, there are other series with visuals that are just as beautiful and don\u2019t throw character development and pathos under the bus.  If you\u2019re not a diehard Samuel L. Jackson fan, skip this one and watch Samurai Champloo instead.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (not that you should really care)\r\nAfter watching this I want revenge on everyone that recommended this dumpster fire to me.\r\nStory 4/10 \r\nIt's a dime a dozen revenge story. There wasn't anything offensively awful, which lands it a 4. I like the idea of just making the guy a cold-blooded killer. That's about it. Everything else either barely manages to stand or falls flat on its face. I was fine up until the story relied almost exclusively on flashbacks to tell us the story, sometimes interrupting action scenes. Honestly, this would've been better without Afro having connections to that dojo place. Hisconnection to the dojo only serves as a plot device so he holds back against Jinno later. The chick he bangs in episode 2 also came from that dojo. That's it. The monks serve barely any purpose in the story; they just show up and fight Afro for some action. They have the very unclear motive of \"becoming God,\" but fail to answer why they want to do that in the first place. I actually feel like this would've been better as a movie or a short, rather than a 5 episode series of pure boredom.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe single thing that I actually cared about. It's a shame that none of the attacks in this show have any impact since most impacts are not shown on screen, and those that are aren't sword attacks, and given the name of the show you expect some sword on flesh action. The gore in this was enough to make me bear all 5 episodes, but you can bet your ass I won't give it a pass just on that. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nThe music is awful, and also inappropriate for most scenes it's placed in. The impact noises are mostly okay. The voice acting is good from Jackson, but average to piss poor for everyone else. It's hard to hate on Jackson here because he's one of my favorite actors. The voice for Jinno is actually the same guy who did the English voice for Sasuke Uchiha, which was admittedly entertaining, but failed to make his acting any better. Jinno would've been a convincing character despite not being developed if it weren't for his voice actor butchering every emotion Jinno is supposed to feel. The bad guys relied on having low register voices with a bit of a growl to sound evil, and that wasn't enough to convince me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nI liked the guy that followed Afro around, but not enough to care when he died. He was supposed to be comic relief, but rarely ever succeeded in making me laugh. The only reason I liked him was because Jackson got to talk a lot. Everyone else blows. Afro's motivation is boring. Revenge just isn't a compelling motivation when there aren't any layers to it. I wanted to feel bad for Afro over his father's death, but since he got almost all of his friends killed and killed his master over this revenge, I ceased to care. I actually wanted Afro to die in the fight against Jinno. Speaking of Jinno, he sucks. He's barely developed and has an even worse motivation than Afro. Come on, he's getting revenge on the guy he lectured about choosing revenge. The show doesn't even attempt to address it, and I was waiting for Afro to call Jinno out on his hypocrisy, but of course he remains silent and defeats Jinno. The main villain of the series appears very little, only having more than 5 minutes of screen time in the very first scene and the last episode. That makes it difficult to give a shit about him collecting all the headbands. The monks are all boring, despite them each being designed differently to show that they are different. The guy that looks like Jabba the Cyborg Hutt is just some random fucker they put in there to explain why Jinno and that chick Afro banged survived the massacre. The dojo characters are all boring, especially Master, who exists only to give Afro an excuse to get his friends killed, and serve as a half-assed explanation of Afro's skills.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of the fight scenes. Everything else was either boring exposition, a flashback, or comic relief. They forgot about \"show, don't tell\" in this show. Every bit of information you need is told to you. There were parts where they show you something only to immediately explain it afterwards like you even needed an explanation. This show was just boring. They spent time establishing why Afro ordered fucking lemonade at a bar. How about you write a better story so this show isn't just some revenge quest? \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nSkip to the fight scenes. Everything else is boring. Afro Samurai is one of the worst experiences I've had as a viewer of any media.",

            "content": "Want a very stylized, mindless hack-and-slash gorefest of an anime?  Look no further than Spike TV and their 2007 production of Afro Samurai.\r\nThis anime is a mixed bag depending on how you approach it (as can be seen just by briefly looking through the reviews on here).  If you are seeking a deep story and complex characters, this anime is going to disappoint you royally.  However, if you are looking for an action-packed product to get the man juices flowing, Afro Samurai will look like the best piece of animation you have ever witnessed.\r\nAs stated, the story is about as basic asit gets: Boy's father is killed, boy vows revenge, boy trains up, boy kills his way to his father's murderer....you get the drift.  As it is only a five-episode miniseries, you can't expect much in the form of deep subplots or a vast network of strongly developed characters (though that is not to say that this franchise doesn't have its own collection of lore to read into).  The timeline of the story very flatley sees Afro cut down a challenge and proceed to the next opponent (usually stronger and more intimidating in scale than the last) until he ultimately reaches his \"final boss on the top floor\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is where this show really shines.  It is extremely fluid and the darker tones of the anime really come out in its shading and dreary hues.  As it was made for an American audience first and foremost, it is a very \"western\" piece of Japanese animation, causing it to be quite unique in the library.  The piece definitely stands out in comparison to most other family members of the typical action anime genre.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is exclusively in Dub and with its voice cast roster, it is clear why.  It features many dynamic actors who bring their chops to the table in all the right ways.  Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard 3) stars as Afro Samurai and his internal voice Ninja Ninja, Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy) provides the voice of the series' main antagonist Justice, and the likes of Kelly Hu (X2), Terrence C. Carson (God of War), Tara Strong, James Arnold Taylor, Grey DeLisle, and Steve Blum provide various supporting roles throughout the series along the way (large and small).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series, though simple, are pretty solid and serve their purpose well.  Afro Samurai himself is obviously the most developed character and receives the lion's share of the treatment on progression.  Ironically, Afro himself is a fairly silent and stoic character and Jackson ultimately gets to shine through the almost-constant annoying chatter dialogue of his companion Ninja Ninja (Afro's 180\u00b0 degree antithesis) more so than the actual protagonist.  Besides the main character, the side characters do not see a lot of development and can suffer from a lack of depth if one decides to fixate on it (aka. shallow archetypes such as generic love interest character, typical villain posse, best friend, former master/mentor, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of this show will depend on your desire to see blood.....like, a LOT of blood (Arms flying, decapitation, pierced eye sockets....the works).  This anime is all about violence and you won't go over three minutes without seeing a character spill their bowels on the ground in some shape or form.  Besides that, this anime doesn't hold back on cursing and swearing either (definitely more so if you watch the Director's Cut).  The anime also contains a smattering of nudity throughout the first few episodes and a full sex scene in the second (The miniseries has a solid and deserved TV-MA, so you shouldn't be blind if you are considering a watch to begin with.).  All in all, Afro Samurai is a mindlessly fun anime full of stylized gory action.  It's really that simple.  It's \"nothing personal, it's just revenge.\"",

            "content": "Here's the thing about Afro Samurai - it's not a complicated tale, the characters are not really very deep, nor do they really grow very much, the plot is terribly predictable and it is filled with all the tropes. But, seriously, who the hell cares? Because you're not supposed to watch this anime with a desire to see a complex plot, novel storytelling or deep characterisation. \r\nWhat you're supposed to expect when you decide to watch this series, is Samuel Jackson being a bad ass mother f*ck!ng samurai on a 5-episode-long quest for pure, bloody, decapitating revenge against the gloriously awesome Ron Pearlman. And that'sexactly what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is done in quite monotone and muted colour, with the exception of the bright red gushes of blood drenching almost every scene. It makes for a visual treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe presence of modern technology in places throws you for a loop at first, and I didn't quite get used to it, considering the environment the characters are in, but it's all part of what makes this show cool. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's RZA... is there anyone better out there to make a hip-hop soundtrack to a Samurai-bent-on-revenge-themed piece of visual media?

            "content": "The reviews I have done so far have been fairly positive as I like to talk about highly rated anime. Now it is time for me to talk about an anime that I actually did not like: Afro Samurai. It's probably the most disappointing anime I have ever seen yet.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art in this show is pretty bad. It suffers from the fact that it has no artistic value to it and what probably is the worst part is the fact that most of the time it is dark. REALLY REALLY DARK. So dark that you might as well be watching a black screen set todialogue and the only animation being sword slashes and blood. In fact, that is exactly what happened most of the time, every scene is just of blood and flashes of light. Character models were even lazy as all the characters just fell to standard design choices not making any effort to standout above the rest at all. The animation is the worst aspect of the show because honestly the supposed style that this anime wants to convey brings absolutely nothing new to the table and is just a big mess.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNow moving on the best part of the show, but not enough to save it, the sound. If there was one reason to watch this show and the reason that I myself was interested in the first place, then that would have to be the most notable feature: Afro is dubbed by Samuel L. Jackson. What I can say, he's the only thing you are going to remember about this show as everything else is forgettable. If it weren't for the badassery that was Sam Jackson, then I honestly would have left this show alone. Thank god Sam Jackson delivers because the rest of the cast does not. Note to all the casting directors, never ever cast James Arnold Taylor in a serious role again because honestly the voice of Tidus from FFX is the last person I want to see do a serious role. The music is what it is, nothing special but not unlistenable.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is boring. Just like that it is boring. The story doesn't come out across well and most of these characters are completely unmemorable. One could argue that the story isn't great because they were stuck with five episodes and a movie. That's stupid though because most anime fans know that FLCL is only six episodes and managed to actually see a plot in it despite all the random insanity that happens. I will tell you one thing though that I will give Afro Samurai points for. One of the characters. Ninja Ninja (the character where Sam Jackson does what he does best) who follows Afro around, is actually the one aspect of the show that I actually thought was interesting as we don't know whether he is real or Afro's conscious. It's a thing like that can actually make Afro Samurai more interesting to watch, however everything else is just makes the show not entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is a huge dissappointment. From the way it is presented, it would seem like that this would be a cool show especially when you get cinema badass Samuel L. Jackson. However, since the show lacks a lot and is so lazy I can't highly recommend it. If you are a Sam Jackson fan like me, then check it out and give it a try, for the rest of us, spend your time on an anime like Samurai Champloo. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to put the head of a bear costume and get revenge? This anime doesn't give me a good send-off.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI normally write my reviews by dividing them into neat categories and using a scoring rubric, but Afro Samurai is an unconventional anime and I will review it in an unconventional style!\r\nThe story is basically the same sort of revenge tale that was common during the low budget 1970s \"samurai slice em up\" films like Lone Wolf and Cub, which was released in the US as \"Shogun Assassin\", and released elsewhere as \"Baby Cart: You go to HELL!\" These were grindhouse samurai exploitation films that you would see in an old drive-in theater after a screening of \"Blood Sucking Freaks\" or \"Wizard of Gore\". Thesefilms didn't try to be artsy or deep. They simply wanted to spray the audience with blood and give them a good time with lots of stupid fun! By the way, a drive-in theater in case you didn't know is where the audience pulls up in cars and watches from their cars as a projection is cast on a large outdoor screen. Yes, those actually used to exist in the 1950s-1970s! They usually played non-mainstream films, most often violent exploitation films and porn.\\n\\n\r\nOne does not watch Afro Samurai for the amazingly deep characters and philosophy, but for the over the top madness and fun! In addition to absolutely nailing the tone and feel of a 70s Samurai exploitation film, it also mixes that with another 70s staple: the blaxploitation film. Due to the synthesis of samurai style with hip hop music and dialogue, Afro is often compared to Samurai Champloo. The difference is that Afro takes itself far less seriously, but is MUCH more entertaining to watch and actually mixes the 2 cultures in a much more effective manner. The voice acting by Samuel L Jackson is superb, and the soundtrack is actually quite good, unlike Champloo! \\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai may not be an artistic masterpiece, but it is a very fun ride that I would highly recommend. It is an American produced anime, but the Yanks actually did a great job with this one, so don't let that put you off! If you actually sit your ass down and finally watch this underrated anime, you will probably enjoy it.\\n\\n",

But the thing that really, REALLY pisses me of is this: he hardly ever fights humans. Seriously. He fights killer robots, humanoids and weird monks (one armed with a bazooka!), and finally a guy with 3 arms.\r\nThat is why this series comes off as poor.\r\nHowever,this is saved by the excellent animation with unique styling and excellent sounds.

You know how I feel about the enemies, but even Afro-Samurai is badly portrayed. He's a 2D character, and the writers thought that if loads of bad stuff happened to someone, I'll automaticly feel sorry for him and be on his side. No, it doesn't work like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not a series worth avoiding, but only because it's so short. There are plently of better anime to watch in the mean time.",

Jackson is here but, that doesn't make the anime good, the story and the characters should, not a big movie star.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is mediocre at best, the story follows a vengeful, full of hatred man named Afro, who saw his father the bearer of the n.1 headband being killed by the bearer of the n.2 headband named Justice just for the sole reason of becoming a god (don't know how a headband will grant you that but...ok) and he tells Afroif he wants revenge he'll be waiting, that's where the 5 eps. anime starts with one problem, nonsensical bulls**t, what happened to the earth? why is technology only used by a group of old guys? why people can only kill the n.2 so they can kill n.1 and not directly? why those headbands are important anyway? or why those thing aren't explained? don't know and i couldn't care less now, it was boring, the only thing they were focused on was the past, in every eps. 15 min. of his past and 3 of action but they forgot the present and the unexplained.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nIt wasn't bad but i didn't like it, it's a combination of western cartoons and anime (like Tokyo Tribe), it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music was fine, the sound effects were bad, the voice acting was ok because only Jinno and Ninja Ninja (the one with white afro) had good voice acting and Afro (Samuel L. J.) didn't talk much and when he did it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nMediocre characters, not appealing for me, i felt Jinno more than Afro, other than that, the characters were rushed, needed more eps. to be really good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt was boring, i didn't get why this is liked and popular maybe just because of Samuel L. J. and that's it, i was going to watch the movie but only if i liked this so no movie for me, mediocre enjoyment.",

            "content": "When I started watching this anime, I wanted to hear the voices in japanese, thing that I never managed to, because I therefore learned that this anime was an American answer to Japan.... And I'll tell you what, they were very successful, one of the best dubbed anime I ever heard.\r\nThey managed to fit everything like the art... I mean look at the details of the characters' drawings, their particular portraits, the dark \"aura\" they managed to bring from this dark world and look at cool gore scenes! A nice fitting music, enjoyable action moments and all in 5 episodes. What about Samuel Jackson's voicecoming from Ninja's mouth? It is just... Awesome!!\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, the story goes around a futuristic feudal Japan where there are two headbands: Headband no.1 and Headband no.2. The fighter who holds the No.1 is considered god-like, the best of the best and can only be challenged by the one who holds the No.2 one. However, everyone, but literally everyone, can challenge the No.2 holder for the headband, meaning lots of trouble for that guy. Afro's father was the No.1 holder and died against a character named \"Justice\". Seeking revenge, Afro got the No.2 headband and is now heading to where \"Justice\" is waiting for him. \\n\\n\r\nHe goes on as some people try to stop and kill him to get the No.2 title and at the same time we learn about Afro's past as he was training to be a great samurai. The fighting scenes are very enjoyable and the story is very simple but it is the typical good samurai revenge story. However, the characters are not that much deeply explored and explained, unlike Afro, but I personally think that it's not necessary in this case.\\n\\n\r\nA nice 5-episode anime to watch in a row. Everything it needs to be an awesome samurai-way entertainment. And the final scene... It just gave me chills! :P\\n\\n\r\n\"It's nothing personal... It's just revenge\" ~ Afro",

The series does manage to succeed with its characters; while they're mostly cliches, they're also humorous and light-hearted enough that one enjoys their presence.\r\nBut ultimately, this series is all about the action.\r\nAnd in that capacity, this anime succeeds; the fights between Afro and his enemies are visually stunning and well-choreographed. The movements are original, the enemies arebizarre and detailed, and motion feels very fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAs with \"Snakes on a Plane\", the title tells you all that you need to know; \"Afro Samurai\" is a fun, entertaining series, which is all it ever strove to be.",

I had to check it out.\r\nI have to say I was very disappointed. The story is just a clich&eacute;, and there is virtually no character development. Had Samuel L Jackson not done some extra voices (like the annoying Ninja Ninja character, who is just a tad more tolerable than Jar Jar Binks) he would've had about 5 seconds of dialogue since the 'hero' isn't much of a talker.\r\nThe only savinggrace for this is the quality of the animation, which is nothing short of superb. It would've been so much better if they ditched it as an anime and used it as a music video or something like that.\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna go out ahead and say that most people should watch Afro Samurai at least once, or give the first episode a chance.\r\nStory: The story is pretty flat, but at it's heart it follows the traditional revenge story. Samurai blaxploitation revenge even. Not at all uncommon for anime. However, this anime is genre wise ALLl over the place. The main antagonist Afro seems to be pursuing through the anime is a gunslinger, so you think a bit of a samurai spaghetti western for a moment ( think Sukiyaki Western Django ), but then he's totally fighting cyborgs. Now, you ask yourself what the helljust happened, but that's the thing it does it really well and fits into the Afro Samurai universe by itself that you really pay no mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: For a nation that hasn't exactly been known for it's positive portrayal of people of color ( and use of black face among other things ), I honestly think the creator got Afro right for this. I have no complaints about the animation. It flows beautifully. I don't think I could like the anime nearly as much if the art wasn't as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is very good in Afro Samurai also. The wind blowing scenes do very well, as you can hear their clothes blowing smoothly, not choppy crappy sound effects you get in a lot of anime or recycled sound effects used in some movies. The music is done by RZA, and if the name isn't familiar then you're probably not familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan. The soundtrack is dare I say it...and I think I do, \"dope\". It is amazing, it is a mixture of not only hip hop but some rock for some tunes. Not to mention the voice acting. Samuel L. Jackson is the icing on the cake for the voice. I could listen to this man's lines over and over again. \"DO THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN WHAT!?!\"  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Afro is pretty flat. He only has one objective: \"Get the headband.\"\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure what compelled me to like Afro, by all means he's kind of boring minus his awesome blade skills. The other characters aren't really developed upon much, but toward the end of the series we see a lot more into Afro's thoughts through flashbacks. However, Afro himself remains stoic, even though his previous incarnation was quite animated. Due to the events we witness through flashbacks, it's safe to assume when we find Afro now he's sealed himself off. He doesn't grow through out the series visibly, I'd say he's not very round at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. There are good animes ( that win awards ), and there are AWESOME animes. The difference is, awesome animes aren't always good or thought provoking, and good animes are not always awesome ( think A Whisper of the Heart, good anime, but not awesome ). If you're the kind of person who watches movies lots of action movies and frequently says \"There weren't enough explosions.\" chances are you'll like Afro Samurai for it's awesome factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. I give it an 8.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS. \r\nI tend to like going into anime that don't require me to think deeply, or search for symbolism. I mean I like thought provocative stuff but it's just this type of thing appeals to my more lazy nature. \r\nThat being said Afro Samurai definitely doesn't require you to analyse details or think about character motivations, let alone explore their psyche. I went into this show looking for action, maybe some good technical performances (BGM, animation, good fights) as well. Sadly this doesn't make it any good to me. If I were to take aside the brilliant animation and art to explore this showfrom a critic's point of view \u2014 there would be nothing to redeem it. \\n\\n\r\nWhatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off strongly, showing a boy witness the brutal decapitation of his father: an act that justifiably sees him take on a journey of vengeance to eventually murder his father's killer in the future. Now THAT is a statement. Buuuut...even a person who loves this show greatly would agree that...there's pretty much no story. I went into this anime expecting nothing from the story either way. Yeah, there's a ton of flashbacks in between fight scenes to add some superficial layers to Afro or the people he's in contact with \u2014 but that's pretty much filler to the action scenes. Overall very poor in the story department, but that's understandable considering what this anime is trying to be. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I take rip this anime apart, I want to list its positives. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this show is downright gorgeous. I love how smoothly done the fights are: channeling the best of Samurai Champloo in some of its fights together with all these satisfying sound effects when blades make contact with each other, or when tear into flesh. The artists have done a good job nailing the atmosphere as well, I was in love with some of the shots in Afro Samurai. There's really some great cinematography here. Also the dubbing is the best lol. Samuel L. Jackson knocks his role out of the park, with some of the greatest voice work I've ever seen. He brings such life to his character that actually highlight his abilities as an artist himself. Job impeccably done. \\n\\n\r\nSadly that's about it. That's all I can enjoy about this show.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are fans of the soundtrack, but I'm just fully underwhelmed by it. Let's start with the BGM...which feels so cheaply done at some points. Some of the sounds feel like the things you produce when you go to a 90's keyboard and click on the different modes (Latin/Bossa Nova etc) while playing four or five notes again and again. While there are a few scenes where the music complements the mood/action sequences, they are sadly too few and far between. The overwhelming majority of the BGM put me off so bad. There are occasions where important characters are thrust into (what's supposed to be) emotionally draining situations\u2014and you just have an awkward BGM that keeps you stoned in your seat, just not feeling anything.\\n\\n\r\nThat kinda pissed me off. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe some of you may like it, I agree that music is a very subjective experience...but I feel it could have been miles better. It didn't bring anything new to the table and it wasn't faithful to hip hop. But if you're expecting something along what Nujabes contributed to Champloo, please just don't get your hopes up.\\n\\n\r\nI also mentioned that the animation was pretty sick\u2014but based on what I've watched so far, all of this is style and not substance. I draw parallels from the hand to hand fight scenes in Cowboy Bebop or even Fate: Zero. Every move made sense in the flashy fights you see in those shows, there was a REASON for every punch thrown, an intended effect. Drawing back to even shows such as Samurai Champloo (the easiest comparison here): Afro's swordplay (at its best) is animated as gloriously as Champloo's, but the tactical nature of the latter is missing in the former. Afro Samurai is choreographed to be more of a flashy dance, flying from wall to wall and breaking through stuff; rather than to actually defeat an opponent with style.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don't know, but for a fighting/action anime to lack meaningful choreography...it just made this anime harder to enjoy given that it has little to no plot, exceptionally shallow characters and as I've mentioned, an overall underperforming BGM. On the note of characters here; again...nothing much. It doesn't have an expressive cast, and its MC shows nothing much and isn't relatable in the slightest. Perhaps the only thing worth noting about Afro was how much regret and doubt he harbours in him for most of the show, but that's really all there is to say about him. I can't really go into the other aspect of this show because that would be a spoiler, but rest assured \u2014 it's nothing much. You shouldn't be looking for characterisation in this anime either, won't find a single ounce. Every other character is extremely forgettable, not playing a role at all\u2014unless they're fodder to Afro's blade. \\n\\n\r\nAnd ah yes, the final boss fight. I expected something at least...gripping. But I was met with the same \"gore is god\" mentality after a cheap and insignificant plot twist. Not even a decent fight. No great moves, none of the fun animated fight pieces that the show flaunted in its first 30 mins. \\n\\n\r\nMeh. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed probably the first 30 mins of Afro Samurai but the action got very repetitive after that. It's only strength and selling point was something that lost me as the show went on longer; and given that there aren't strong characters, or anything else of value besides for the action...I found myself just hoping it would end already. And right now as I type this review, I'm just glad I'm done with this. Maybe there's stuff I missed, but I'm just not in the mood to revisit this show anywhere in the near future. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Afro Samurai is not a show that EVERYONE can enjoy. I sure as hell disliked the living daylight out of it, but it's something you should consider giving a go nevertheless\u2014if you feel you may like it. As you can see it rubbed me off the wrong way, but several of the points I penalised it for may actually appeal to you, as this kind of experience varies with the individual. \\n",

            "content": "I picked this anime up one night while just walking through the anime section. I had heard it was pretty good so i wanted to check it out. To my surprise I noticed that the series was only five episodes long. They do in fact just through you into the story without a lot of backstory on any of the characters except for Afro Samurai. \r\nStory: The story was short, but it got straight to the point. Their are two rankings of Samurai in the world, The Number One, and The Number Two. The whole series is really about Afro Samurai, being the Number Twosamurai trying to become The Number One and Avenging his father who was killed for the number one spot. I liked the story because as it does follow the traditional style of anime, it is different in it's own right.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I found the animation to be really good, but that's just in my opinion. I thought the detail of everything in the settings was animated very well, and the characters themselves as well. The gore is brought out the best way it could be without being excessive. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: The music for this anime was different being more of a rap song, with a sweet beat. It's not something you would expect in a normal anime, but compliments this show very well, and the music throughout is also very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give Afro Samurai an 8, because it was very good even thought it was only five episodes, it had the copasity to be so much longer, probably even as long as a traditional anime being 25 to 50 episodes. It's a good anime that I myself would recommend to others that are looking for a action filled anime that they can watch in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and this is my first review!! ^_^",

            "content": "Story-4/10\r\nThe story follows a not so \"typical,\" ronin seeking revenge of the death of his father. Taking place in a world where the Strong's passion is to beat the even stronger and tougher; Afro (Who is named that because of his afro hairdo I guess,) is seeking the one who defeated his father in order to retain the title of #1.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that the protagonist only motive for his blood-thirsty actions is to find the guy that killed his father that he could barely remember. Yes, revenge is the only excuse for the plot of Afro Samurai, andit never goes any deeper than that, at the same time leaving no depth for any character personality. All of the character development is comprised of super macho men in stand-offs that ends in a gruesome scene; the premise of this story is fairly shallow and generic. \\n\\n\r\nI always love action that have a lot of gore, but this series just overdid it. With zero investment in the characters, a non-sensual storyline, even the fluid animations seemed boring after a few episodes. You know that the main character is not going to get even much of a scratch on him; every challenger is just going to get his butt-kicked with much to none of a chance to retaliate. \\n\\n\r\nWhy is everybody aiming to beat Afro? Apparently only the one with the title of #2 can challenge the one with the #1 headband; what the series is telling me is that everybody wants to title of #2 so they can be targeted and attacked by murderers like themselves? \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah! Did I mention we got Rpgs and guns vs swords? XD\\n\\n\r\nArt-8.5/10\\n\r\nWeirdly enough, I really enjoyed the animations of this anime. The dark and vivid color palette really fit in with the atmosphere of the anime. The animation is wonderfully detailed and flashy, but hardly realistic at times. You can either find this animation super fake; as Afro blocks arrows and slices bullets with ease, or setting all realism aside and find the animations super cool (like me!) With the deep shadows and amazing effects mixed with a beautiful slash of red, all in a super fluid motion. I do find the character designs weird, as they kind of look abstract some of the times.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7.5/10\\n\r\nWe have Samuel Jackson voicing Afro. Half of the people that watch this show probably came for his voice. But sadly, the rest of the cast's voices just seemed bland and tasteless for me. The Op and Ost are nothing special either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5/10\\n\r\nAfro is a super overpowered and cool character. He rather sets things straight with violence than reason, not giving a fuck to anything else. Afro is the definition of badass; he does what he wants, where he wants, when he wants while holding an imaginary middle-finger to everybody that looks at him the wrong way. All the men in this anime look fairly badass, while women on the other hand are just decorations in this anime for the fan-service factor.\\n\\n\r\nAll villains are giant egomaniacs that engage in fights with opponents that are much more powerful, but are too dumb to realize that they cannot win. In the end, they all just end up as another blood stain on Afro\u2019s sword. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10\\n\r\nAfro samurai was a waste of time, but not a total waste of time. The characters had zero depth, and the plot was terribly bad. It did though; provide an excellent visual presentation and a great action atmosphere and lots of badass moments. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch a unique art style with lots of gore and flashy stunts.\\n\r\nThe anime only contains 5 episodes, so if you have some spare time, you can finish this anime fairly fast.\\n",

            "content": "When I first started watching Afro Samurai, I was blown away by the action scenes early on, as well as how contrived and generic the plot was. My early theory was that the plot was mostly around in order to set up more fights. As I got a few more episodes into the show, I was extremely disappointed to realize that the show creators didn't seem to realize how weak their own plot was, as flashbacks from Afro, and the main plot actually take up a very good chunk of the screen time, and those parts are pretty consistently boring.\r\nAfro's plot is just plain stupidreally. It starts off with the always reliable revenge story, but then it turns into a lot of stupid crap about trying to be #1 in the world. The character motivations to kill the hell out of each other never really make sense, so it's frustrating that so much time is spent on them. \\n\\n\r\nThey try really hard to make Afro the coolest man ever, but well, he ends up not really standing out from any \"badass\" character I've ever seen. Pretty much every other character in the show is basically annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAfro's main redeeming point is the fights, in which there are sadly not enough of them. All the fights in Afro are ridiculously gory, stylish, and satisfying. I might even say jaw-dropping. It's easy to look forward to the fights, but sadly, they don't occur nearly as often as they should. The amount of the fights on the show do start to increase a bit as the show goes on, but for the most part, they don't seem as good as the show goes on. I think that after the initial shock and awe of the blood and gore, the fight scenes kind of lose their effect, but they are still pretty fun.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai's attempts to be stylish and cool really work when it comes to the fights. When it comes to the plot, the attempt to make a classic tale super cool and stylish end up falling completely flat. Afro Samurai was a shot with high potential to be an awesome guilty-pleasure. Instead, I just felt guilty that I devoted an hour and a half of my life to it. I wouldn't reccomend watching this, even if you are a total action freak.",

            "content": "Afro Samurai is an example of blaxploitation in anime working gallantly. We follow a revenge-driven man simply called Afro, learning more about him through flash-backs, as he strives to be the number one swordsman.\r\nThere are several things that sets this apart from typical blaxploitation titles.  Most of it for the better. Firstly, it has high-quality animation that makes it look like it had a far higher budget than most titles in its genre. Its main characters are fleshed out to a greater degree than I had expected. In addition, it barely even touches upon racial stereotypes and ethnic differences. Why I think this allworks, is that now it stands out with amazing stylized art, more relatable main characters, and conflicts that are more personal to them, rather than just racist villains who'd want to fight Afro because he's black and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Afro by all accounts is fleshed out in his backstory, he also suffers from being a silent protagonist. This makes Afro less interesting to watch by himself, but it fixes this problem by making his interactions with the world around him all the more contrasting and entertaining, especially with his ninja counter-part. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do love battle royales and tournament-anime, Afro Samurai is a gauntlet-story, where the journey mainly consists of going through one minor villain after another in order to get to the boss at the top, video-game-logic. It falls into the same trappings as most other stories of its kind, which would be several villains that are just 1-dimensional throw-aways, and a very linear journey with no particular twists. Despite not usually being a fan of the format I think it did the best it could with its plot in how it told it.\\n\\n\r\nA simple plot with good music, visuals, and entertaining characters.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: Have you ever wanted to watch a cartoon version of Samuel L. Jackson kill the population equivalent of the state of New Hampshire while wielding a katana? \r\n\u2026What do you mean, \u2018no\u2019?\r\n\u2026Not even a little?\r\nAfro Samurai is a post-apocalyptic  western scifi samurai tale of vengeance, in which Afro, the titular samurai, seeks to kill the man who killed his father and claim the Number One headband, the symbol of Afro\u2019s father\u2019s former status as the deadliest man alive.  Afro can only challenge the new Number One while wearing the Number Two headband.  The catch is that the position ofNumber Two is perpetually up for grabs, and countless people attempt to kill Afro and take the headband for themselves.  These people tend to fail spectacularly before being sliced open and producing enough blood to fill a kiddie pool, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from trying.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise leads the audience to all sorts of interesting questions.  Where did these headbands originate from?  Do they actually grant any special powers, or are they only significant because of the status they convey?  Who made them?  Why is claiming them more important than attempting to rebuild society in the wake of nuclear holocaust?  How the hell does Afro keep his hair looking  so perfect when all the salons in the world have been wiped out of existence?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to all of these questions is, \u201cLook how badass Afro is!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, watching Afro being a badass is fairly entertaining on its own.  The striking, unique visuals and masterful animation are coupled with a gloriously shameless love of camp.  At one point, Afro slices a rocket propelled grenade in half with a katana, and suffers no ill effects when it explodes directly next to him.  At another, Afro fight an evil robot clone of himself, who, in the fight\u2019s climax, uses rocket boosters to carry itself and Afro into the atmosphere before they both plummet back to Earth.  This is a show that can seamlessly move between beautifully choreographed and animated sword-fights to a cheesy disregard for physics normally reserved for the kind of 80\u2019s science-fiction movies you see at the bottom of a Walmart bargain bin.  Afro Samurai has little going for it beyond sheer visual spectacle and style, but these are two areas it undoubtedly excels in.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: Afro Samurai is a series whose presentation is at odds with its own themes.  The central message of the story, perhaps the only thing that might elevate it beyond the level of being highly stylish, violent and sexual fluff, is that a drive for vengeance and unchecked ambition are terrible forces that ultimately lead only to tragedy.  The problem is, it\u2019s hard to take that message seriously when 95% of the series is screaming, \u201cLook how badass our hero is!\u201d while he\u2019s taking vengeance and murdering countless people on his quest to be the single baddest muthafucka on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kill Bill films (the other campy anachronistic samurai story of vengeance Jackson was in) struggled with the same problem, but the protagonist of Kill Bill was capable of running the full gambit of human emotion.  She was capable of sorrow and regret and love, and this helped ground the vengeance story in spite of its gore and camp.  Afro displays no such humanity.  He is a blood-stained power fantasy with all the emotional depth of a can of Axe body-spray.  When, as a child, his quest for vengeance leads to the death of his foster family, he simply writes it off as the cost of avenging his father.  Not only is Afro seemingly incapable of recognizing the consequences of his actions or considering redemption, he never does anything that could make us like him on a level other than, \u201cWhat a badass!\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a particularly gross sequences of events in which an enemy spy falls in love with Afro, then sacrifices herself to save him from an ambush.  Why does she fall for a man who rarely says more than three words at a time?  Because Afro is a badass, of course.  He is the most badass badass of all baddasses, so it goes without saying that in addition to being ridiculously good at killing people, he can also make every woman he meets wanna screw him by doing literally nothing.  In fact, he\u2019s too badass to even bother changing facial expressions during their lengthy, gratuitous and utterly unsatisfying sex scene.  You\u2019d think the death of this poor woman would have some degree of emotional fallout, but Afro never expresses guilt over being unable to save her, never considers seriously pursuing a relationship with her instead of continuing his quest for vengeance, and never mentions her name again.  In fact, none of the women in the series accomplish much other than dying to motivate men or shaking their asses at the camera.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a popular theory going around the internet to account for Afro\u2019s seeming lack of depth that is worth addressing here.  The theory posits that Ninja Ninja, Afro\u2019s obnoxious jive-talking companion, is actually a figment of his imagination, or else a personification of his inner thoughts.  The numerous times Ninja Ninja clearly interacts with physical objects contradicts this, but ignoring that, the idea that Afro is so emotionally damaged that he has literally cast out his feelings and conscience as a separate entity is a potentially interesting idea\u2026 an idea that, like the series\u2019 premise and setting, receives zero exploration.  As a series, Afro Samurai lacks the patience to give attention to anything but sex and violence, and once the thrill of the visuals wears off, this leaves it feeling hollow and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Afro Samurai is all flash and no substance.  While its visuals are strong, there are other series with visuals that are just as beautiful and don\u2019t throw character development and pathos under the bus.  If you\u2019re not a diehard Samuel L. Jackson fan, skip this one and watch Samurai Champloo instead.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (not that you should really care)\r\nAfter watching this I want revenge on everyone that recommended this dumpster fire to me.\r\nStory 4/10 \r\nIt's a dime a dozen revenge story. There wasn't anything offensively awful, which lands it a 4. I like the idea of just making the guy a cold-blooded killer. That's about it. Everything else either barely manages to stand or falls flat on its face. I was fine up until the story relied almost exclusively on flashbacks to tell us the story, sometimes interrupting action scenes. Honestly, this would've been better without Afro having connections to that dojo place. Hisconnection to the dojo only serves as a plot device so he holds back against Jinno later. The chick he bangs in episode 2 also came from that dojo. That's it. The monks serve barely any purpose in the story; they just show up and fight Afro for some action. They have the very unclear motive of \"becoming God,\" but fail to answer why they want to do that in the first place. I actually feel like this would've been better as a movie or a short, rather than a 5 episode series of pure boredom.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThe single thing that I actually cared about. It's a shame that none of the attacks in this show have any impact since most impacts are not shown on screen, and those that are aren't sword attacks, and given the name of the show you expect some sword on flesh action. The gore in this was enough to make me bear all 5 episodes, but you can bet your ass I won't give it a pass just on that. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nThe music is awful, and also inappropriate for most scenes it's placed in. The impact noises are mostly okay. The voice acting is good from Jackson, but average to piss poor for everyone else. It's hard to hate on Jackson here because he's one of my favorite actors. The voice for Jinno is actually the same guy who did the English voice for Sasuke Uchiha, which was admittedly entertaining, but failed to make his acting any better. Jinno would've been a convincing character despite not being developed if it weren't for his voice actor butchering every emotion Jinno is supposed to feel. The bad guys relied on having low register voices with a bit of a growl to sound evil, and that wasn't enough to convince me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nI liked the guy that followed Afro around, but not enough to care when he died. He was supposed to be comic relief, but rarely ever succeeded in making me laugh. The only reason I liked him was because Jackson got to talk a lot. Everyone else blows. Afro's motivation is boring. Revenge just isn't a compelling motivation when there aren't any layers to it. I wanted to feel bad for Afro over his father's death, but since he got almost all of his friends killed and killed his master over this revenge, I ceased to care. I actually wanted Afro to die in the fight against Jinno. Speaking of Jinno, he sucks. He's barely developed and has an even worse motivation than Afro. Come on, he's getting revenge on the guy he lectured about choosing revenge. The show doesn't even attempt to address it, and I was waiting for Afro to call Jinno out on his hypocrisy, but of course he remains silent and defeats Jinno. The main villain of the series appears very little, only having more than 5 minutes of screen time in the very first scene and the last episode. That makes it difficult to give a shit about him collecting all the headbands. The monks are all boring, despite them each being designed differently to show that they are different. The guy that looks like Jabba the Cyborg Hutt is just some random fucker they put in there to explain why Jinno and that chick Afro banged survived the massacre. The dojo characters are all boring, especially Master, who exists only to give Afro an excuse to get his friends killed, and serve as a half-assed explanation of Afro's skills.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of the fight scenes. Everything else was either boring exposition, a flashback, or comic relief. They forgot about \"show, don't tell\" in this show. Every bit of information you need is told to you. There were parts where they show you something only to immediately explain it afterwards like you even needed an explanation. This show was just boring. They spent time establishing why Afro ordered fucking lemonade at a bar. How about you write a better story so this show isn't just some revenge quest? \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nSkip to the fight scenes. Everything else is boring. Afro Samurai is one of the worst experiences I've had as a viewer of any media.",

            "content": "Want a very stylized, mindless hack-and-slash gorefest of an anime?  Look no further than Spike TV and their 2007 production of Afro Samurai.\r\nThis anime is a mixed bag depending on how you approach it (as can be seen just by briefly looking through the reviews on here).  If you are seeking a deep story and complex characters, this anime is going to disappoint you royally.  However, if you are looking for an action-packed product to get the man juices flowing, Afro Samurai will look like the best piece of animation you have ever witnessed.\r\nAs stated, the story is about as basic asit gets: Boy's father is killed, boy vows revenge, boy trains up, boy kills his way to his father's murderer....you get the drift.  As it is only a five-episode miniseries, you can't expect much in the form of deep subplots or a vast network of strongly developed characters (though that is not to say that this franchise doesn't have its own collection of lore to read into).  The timeline of the story very flatley sees Afro cut down a challenge and proceed to the next opponent (usually stronger and more intimidating in scale than the last) until he ultimately reaches his \"final boss on the top floor\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is where this show really shines.  It is extremely fluid and the darker tones of the anime really come out in its shading and dreary hues.  As it was made for an American audience first and foremost, it is a very \"western\" piece of Japanese animation, causing it to be quite unique in the library.  The piece definitely stands out in comparison to most other family members of the typical action anime genre.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is exclusively in Dub and with its voice cast roster, it is clear why.  It features many dynamic actors who bring their chops to the table in all the right ways.  Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard 3) stars as Afro Samurai and his internal voice Ninja Ninja, Ron Perlman (Hellboy, Sons of Anarchy) provides the voice of the series' main antagonist Justice, and the likes of Kelly Hu (X2), Terrence C. Carson (God of War), Tara Strong, James Arnold Taylor, Grey DeLisle, and Steve Blum provide various supporting roles throughout the series along the way (large and small).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series, though simple, are pretty solid and serve their purpose well.  Afro Samurai himself is obviously the most developed character and receives the lion's share of the treatment on progression.  Ironically, Afro himself is a fairly silent and stoic character and Jackson ultimately gets to shine through the almost-constant annoying chatter dialogue of his companion Ninja Ninja (Afro's 180\u00b0 degree antithesis) more so than the actual protagonist.  Besides the main character, the side characters do not see a lot of development and can suffer from a lack of depth if one decides to fixate on it (aka. shallow archetypes such as generic love interest character, typical villain posse, best friend, former master/mentor, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of this show will depend on your desire to see blood.....like, a LOT of blood (Arms flying, decapitation, pierced eye sockets....the works).  This anime is all about violence and you won't go over three minutes without seeing a character spill their bowels on the ground in some shape or form.  Besides that, this anime doesn't hold back on cursing and swearing either (definitely more so if you watch the Director's Cut).  The anime also contains a smattering of nudity throughout the first few episodes and a full sex scene in the second (The miniseries has a solid and deserved TV-MA, so you shouldn't be blind if you are considering a watch to begin with.).  All in all, Afro Samurai is a mindlessly fun anime full of stylized gory action.  It's really that simple.  It's \"nothing personal, it's just revenge.\"",

But, seriously, who the hell cares? Because you're not supposed to watch this anime with a desire to see a complex plot, novel storytelling or deep characterisation. \r\nWhat you're supposed to expect when you decide to watch this series, is Samuel Jackson being a bad ass mother f*ck!ng samurai on a 5-episode-long quest for pure, bloody, decapitating revenge against the gloriously awesome Ron Pearlman. And that'sexactly what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is done in quite monotone and muted colour, with the exception of the bright red gushes of blood drenching almost every scene. It makes for a visual treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe presence of modern technology in places throws you for a loop at first, and I didn't quite get used to it, considering the environment the characters are in, but it's all part of what makes this show cool. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's RZA... is there anyone better out there to make a hip-hop soundtrack to a Samurai-bent-on-revenge-themed piece of visual media? I didn't think so.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is an excellent piece of bad-assery and entertainment. Don't go looking for more than Samuel Jackson just being his cool self and you'll be completely satisfied, you dig?",

            "content": "The reviews I have done so far have been fairly positive as I like to talk about highly rated anime. Now it is time for me to talk about an anime that I actually did not like: Afro Samurai. It's probably the most disappointing anime I have ever seen yet.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art in this show is pretty bad. It suffers from the fact that it has no artistic value to it and what probably is the worst part is the fact that most of the time it is dark. REALLY REALLY DARK. So dark that you might as well be watching a black screen set todialogue and the only animation being sword slashes and blood. In fact, that is exactly what happened most of the time, every scene is just of blood and flashes of light. Character models were even lazy as all the characters just fell to standard design choices not making any effort to standout above the rest at all. The animation is the worst aspect of the show because honestly the supposed style that this anime wants to convey brings absolutely nothing new to the table and is just a big mess.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNow moving on the best part of the show, but not enough to save it, the sound. If there was one reason to watch this show and the reason that I myself was interested in the first place, then that would have to be the most notable feature: Afro is dubbed by Samuel L. Jackson. What I can say, he's the only thing you are going to remember about this show as everything else is forgettable. If it weren't for the badassery that was Sam Jackson, then I honestly would have left this show alone. Thank god Sam Jackson delivers because the rest of the cast does not. Note to all the casting directors, never ever cast James Arnold Taylor in a serious role again because honestly the voice of Tidus from FFX is the last person I want to see do a serious role. The music is what it is, nothing special but not unlistenable.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is boring. Just like that it is boring. The story doesn't come out across well and most of these characters are completely unmemorable. One could argue that the story isn't great because they were stuck with five episodes and a movie. That's stupid though because most anime fans know that FLCL is only six episodes and managed to actually see a plot in it despite all the random insanity that happens. I will tell you one thing though that I will give Afro Samurai points for. One of the characters. Ninja Ninja (the character where Sam Jackson does what he does best) who follows Afro around, is actually the one aspect of the show that I actually thought was interesting as we don't know whether he is real or Afro's conscious. It's a thing like that can actually make Afro Samurai more interesting to watch, however everything else is just makes the show not entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is a huge dissappointment. From the way it is presented, it would seem like that this would be a cool show especially when you get cinema badass Samuel L. Jackson. However, since the show lacks a lot and is so lazy I can't highly recommend it. If you are a Sam Jackson fan like me, then check it out and give it a try, for the rest of us, spend your time on an anime like Samurai Champloo. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to put the head of a bear costume and get revenge? This anime doesn't give me a good send-off.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI normally write my reviews by dividing them into neat categories and using a scoring rubric, but Afro Samurai is an unconventional anime and I will review it in an unconventional style!\r\nThe story is basically the same sort of revenge tale that was common during the low budget 1970s \"samurai slice em up\" films like Lone Wolf and Cub, which was released in the US as \"Shogun Assassin\", and released elsewhere as \"Baby Cart: You go to HELL!\" These were grindhouse samurai exploitation films that you would see in an old drive-in theater after a screening of \"Blood Sucking Freaks\" or \"Wizard of Gore\". Thesefilms didn't try to be artsy or deep. They simply wanted to spray the audience with blood and give them a good time with lots of stupid fun! By the way, a drive-in theater in case you didn't know is where the audience pulls up in cars and watches from their cars as a projection is cast on a large outdoor screen. Yes, those actually used to exist in the 1950s-1970s! They usually played non-mainstream films, most often violent exploitation films and porn.\\n\\n\r\nOne does not watch Afro Samurai for the amazingly deep characters and philosophy, but for the over the top madness and fun! In addition to absolutely nailing the tone and feel of a 70s Samurai exploitation film, it also mixes that with another 70s staple: the blaxploitation film. Due to the synthesis of samurai style with hip hop music and dialogue, Afro is often compared to Samurai Champloo. The difference is that Afro takes itself far less seriously, but is MUCH more entertaining to watch and actually mixes the 2 cultures in a much more effective manner. The voice acting by Samuel L Jackson is superb, and the soundtrack is actually quite good, unlike Champloo! \\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai may not be an artistic masterpiece, but it is a very fun ride that I would highly recommend. It is an American produced anime, but the Yanks actually did a great job with this one, so don't let that put you off! If you actually sit your ass down and finally watch this underrated anime, you will probably enjoy it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spectacular action, but it has no depth because of an an unlikeable, overpowered main character.\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\r\nThere\u2019s another action anime flick that Afro Samurai probably took some inspiration from, Ninja Scroll. I was a teenager when I saw Ninja Scroll. It gave what I wanted: fast paced action with lots of violence and tits. It wasn\u2019t until years later when I re-watched Ninja Scroll that I realized no matter how good looking the action is, it\u2019s shallow without the weight of good characters and story.\r\nAfro Samurai has the same issue. I loved it on my first viewing. Now years later, I re-watched it to see if itstill lives up, but the same lesson still holds. Action without meaningful characters and story is boring. Action isn\u2019t actually about what\u2019s happening on screen. It isn\u2019t about the bullets flying, the cars exploding, the swords swinging; it\u2019s the conflict between the characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nThere will be - SPOILERS - but Afro Samurai has very thin story and characters anyway so you aren\u2019t missing out. It\u2019s worth analyzing why it could\u2019ve been better because the material is already there for a great story, but it doesn\u2019t execute well.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that Afro, the main character, seeks revenge for the death of his father. He lives in a medieval Japanese fantasy setting mixed with some modern technology. His father\u2019s killer wears the #1 headband, a symbol of power. Whether the power is real or not isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s that you need the #2 headband to challenge the #1. Afro sacrifices his friends and master for revenge. But the story isn\u2019t about him obtaining the #2 headband. He already has it. It\u2019s just one long walk to see #1; fighting along the way with flashbacks about his childhood.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of Afro Samurai is what will you sacrifice for revenge? Afro kills his master and lets his friends get butchered. He chose revenge over everything. The problem then is that Afro himself isn\u2019t an interesting character. Afro is the strong, silent type. But he\u2019s written so one-dimensionally that he ends up un-likeable. It\u2019s hard to care about his quest for revenge. He speaks a few lines and has little personality.\\n\\n\r\nFor us to care about someone who was willing to let his friends die so he could have his revenge, you NEED that character to be likeable. The show takes place after he\u2019s already \u201ccast aside his feelings\u201d for revenge when it should\u2019ve been about the process of it. We should\u2019ve been seeing him give up his humanity for revenge. His childhood flashbacks don't help because they never paint Afro as anyone interesting. He's just as boring as a kid as he is now.\\n\\n\r\nSo because he\u2019s such a boring character, everything else about him is boring. He\u2019s so overpowered that it makes the fights dull. We should\u2019ve had a character that was strong, but still struggled along the way. They try to keep things engaging by giving him a sidekick, but it should\u2019ve been him that was the engaging character.\\n\\n\r\nAdd that with the fantasy physics then everything becomes a Saturday morning cartoon. They even try to make Afro look cool by having him smoke a cigarette after every fight, but it came off as lame.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good character is Jinno, his best friend. He was one of the survivors from Afro\u2019s childhood friends so he has plenty of good reason to seek revenge. It\u2019s ironic the person that\u2019s most deserving of revenge and you end up rooting for wants revenge against the main character. If Afro himself was interesting then their fight could've been 100x more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show isn\u2019t too amazing either. All the colors are muted and gray so it becomes tiresome to look at. The villains don\u2019t ever pose a threat and aren\u2019t interesting themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI liked that they kept the power of the headbands ambiguous. Did they really grant the power of a God? It added a level of mystery and didn\u2019t take away from the theme of revenge. The action itself is great. You're given a buffet's worth. Overall, Afro Samurai is good watch the first time. Second time, not so much. You\u2019ll be bored because the action has no depth.",

It acts like a b-movie at times despite its top notch animation and art direction. This could appeal to some people I'm sure, but could be a huge distraction for others. With something like Samurai Champloo - even though the action is over the top - one can still see all the physics going on in combat and make sense of what they're looking at. But Afro Samurai just throws out alllogic at times for visual gimmicks. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, some may think this is a good thing about the show, but I think it's something that people should be aware of going in to it. But being only 5 episodes long, you won't feel like you wasted too much time if you dislike it. \\n\\n\r\nFun show, but there's other anime who have done this same thing better I feel.",

Although if it's action you're looking for, this maybe for you.\r\nArt - Gritty animation gave Afro Samurai it's own style, highlight of the series.\r\nSound - Samuel Jackson's performance as Ninja Ninja, the apparent comical side-kick didn't work for me. His chit-chatter of Afro Samurai's foreseeable demise is a common irritation throughout. \r\nWhile the voice acting was mediocre, RZA can be commended for his polished musical score for the series.\r\nCharacter - Being 5 episodes long, there was no chanceof any character development whatsoever, you either loved the protagonist from the start or loathed him, which would explain why sympathy was used as the initial attention puller. For me, it failed, I've seen this too many times, done better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - No story=snore. There is a stiffy moment in there for you H fans, though. *raises hand*\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The series caused more sparks than lighting anything imaginative. Was AS a big disappointment?

            "content": "If I never had a reason to accuse an anime of being all beauty and no brain. Then I would definitely have one now, because Afro Samurai fits the term \"style over substance\" like no other. It makes sure to cater only to a specific audience, which are the action and eye candy crowd. Studio Gonzo has been known to deliver when it comes down to visuals. Series such as Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo and Basilisk more than back up this claim. Afro Samurai continues to carry their legacy.\r\nThe artwork and animation are top notch without a doubt. The battle scenes are fastpaced, very fluid, and detailed. It is amazing watching bullets chopped in mid flight only to scatter and kill people by the dozens. Plus the animation is completely free of stills with very little reused cels. The choreography is among the best I have seen in a samurai related anime with fights even surpassing that of Ninja Scroll, while completely crushing the completely horrid Samurai Deeper Kyo. Anyone whom says the animation in Afro Samurai is lacking either didn't see it, or they're searching for reasons to hate it; which really is uncalled for because it has more than enough dragging it down. The artwork is splendid with some great character designs and very nice settings with a very well use of color and schemes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good as well. East Coast hip hop artist RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan is behind the soundtrack. The beats are everything you would expect from him, and they capture the gritty feel plus the rhythm of the series. When I first saw Afro Samurai and Samurai Champloo, I didn't care for hip hop in a samurai setting. I guess it had a lot to do with the traditionalist in me; but I'll admit that it does work here. Even though I'm still not completely a fan of it. In fact I'm not a fan of it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice work is done by Samuel L. Jackson(Afro Samurai, Ninja Ninja), Ron Perlman(Justice), and Kelly Hu(Okiku). The voice work is average, but a majority of the time you will hear from the ultra irritating comic relief Ninja Ninja, and he never ever shuts up. The other two voice actors are barely heard from due to their short roles.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai also has an interesting world simply because the imagination definitely ran wild. These aren't exactly your traditional samurai and monks. The characters are equipped with a vast arsenal of weaponry and cybernetics that combines genres old and new, such as a monk using a cell phone along with ronin packing a crossbow/grenade launcher.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad features of the series, this is the part that is completely a matter of taste. The writers focused so much on the eye candy and blood lust audience, that they completely forsake the character and plot driven crowd. All of the characters are incredibly bland, and almost no one is really likeable. Afro is not really developed, his sidekick Ninja Ninja is the opposite of Afro's quiet personality, in which he's very out spoken, loud, and upbeat. It is said, that he's actually Afro's character development. I just don't see that because Afro simply doesn't change for better or worse. He is one of the most static characters I can think of. This doesn't necessarily make him a bad character, just not a very interesting one and easily forgettable. The rest of the characters are merely meant to push the thin plot and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is a very violent series with lots of blood, death, and severed limbs. Followed with lots of profanity that Samuel L. Jackson has been known for. There is also a bit of fan service and an almost non graphic sex scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not for everyone and I haven't re-watched it in years. Those whom love lots of bloody and gory action shades of Ninja Scroll will more than likely be entertained. Fans of Sam Jackson and RZA's production should give it a shot as well. The DVD set also comes with a second disk containing commentary, interviews with the voice actors, producers, and behind the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nHighs: Very high production values, good blend of different genres\\n\\n\r\nLows: Paper thin plot, bland characters, weak ending",

            "content": "The instant I heard the title \"Afro Samurai\" I knew I had to see this series, and the fact that Samuel L. Jackson plays the main character only raised my expectations. My expectations were met.\r\n  To start (extremely) positive the animation is pristene and the direction of battle is executed exceptionally well with the animation style. Granted it the cliche blood physics are kept, but it is used to great effect during both battle and character development.\r\n  My one criticism of the story is the not so original main character motivation of revenge and the reason for it. However, the character, or rathercharacters, formed from this origin is far from predictable. As well as the underlying plot is not very imaginitive but what is seen on the surface is pure gold.\\n\r\n  The main character(s) is pretty much unbeatable: silent type, vengance driven, efficient killing machine samurai played by Samuel L. Jackson with an afro (black), and a loud mouth, weed smoking, counterpart also played by Samuel L.Jackson with an opposite afro (white). The villains are very unique and give new meanings to: never-ending supply, creepy, robotic ninjas, gunslayer, and insane teddy bears. Their motivation is not unique i.e revenge or power but still the story behind the explained is rather moving.\\n\r\n  One more, and final criticism I make, is sound during battle. I don't know why but I prefer to be able to tell which sound goes to what action to the extents that I think I'm supposed to. Yet, with this the awesome sound track as well as fast paced cool fighting sequences threw me off a bit.\\n\r\n  It's fair to say I really enjoy watching this series, because I do and I watch each action and blood filled episode with a feeling of great anticipation.",

            "content": "This is an out of the ordinary Samurai anime with an interesting twist to it. Not only is the main Samurai character black in race but we are presented with a twisted alternate universe of Japan.\r\nAs far as story line goes there isn't much, partly because of the series only lasting 5 episodes but also that it wasn't developed that much either. The plot line of why things are the way they are in this twisted universe is not explained, we're given a VERY brief reason to why and it doesn't make much sense aside from 'everyone wants to kill everyone'. Sadly to say thestory can be summed up in one line and that is &quot;All warriors want to be Number One&quot;. With all its flaws and open holes in the story, it still remains interesting because there has been nothing else quite like it. Seriously, when is the next time you'll see a animation about a Black Samurai with a rippin' Afro kicking some serious butt? Probably not for a looooong time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style can well referenced to being very similar -if not the same as- to the art used in Todd McFarlane's &quot;Spawn&quot; the TV series. It can be described as a very flowing but detailed art style with often a dark tone to it. The attention put into the finer details in the art form to make the action really come to life and defining the scene, it gives a surreal feel to the series. I particularly like this art style for its detail alone but the dark overtones really sets off really dark series like this one very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are movie motion perfect for an action series and fit greatly into their roles but something is lacking. We learn very little to nothing about the characters in the series and what we are given we have to use our own imagination to fill in, which isn't too bad I guess (again, if it was more than 5 episodes I'm sure there would have been more). Artistically the characters are well formed but they lack strong vocal characterization. What I mean to say is that most of the characters and dialogs sound as if a poor designed robot is try to articulate emotions it knows nothing about. More work could have been put in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? This is a series that should be watched just for being what it is, a super-awesome-bad-ass-black-samurai-adventure. Not the greatest animation out there but like I said before, when else are you going to run into something this different.",

            "content": "Now Afro Samurai was on my to watch list not really because I actually wanted to watch it, but for the fact that it was pretty popular in United States when it came out. It was to be one of those titles that I had to watch just to say that I actually watched it; and I really had no intention of watching it anytime soon.\r\nThat was, until my friend (who is still new and fresh to the world of anime) was flabberghasted that I had watched so many different series and have not watched Afro Samurai. All my attempts to explain to him thatI had a set list that I wanted to complete first fell on deaf ears, and I was promptly plopped in front of his computer and watched the first episode. My first thought was \u2018oh God\u2026.*sigh*\u2019 and it didn\u2019t quite leave me even as I watched the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was said that the original Afro Samurai manga was severely lacking as Takashi Okazaki didn\u2019t really have a talent for storytelling. And from what I\u2019ve seen from the animated adaptation of it, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward -- we\u2019re set in a world that\u2019s mixed with a modern day inner city feeling with sci-fi elements in a feudal Japan theme. And in this world there are two headbands that symbolize the greatest fighters in the world; Number 1 is considered a God, and untouchable. While Number 2 is the only one who can challenge Number 1, but cursed to fight everyone seeking their headband.\\n\\n\r\nWe start out as 1 and 2 are about to fight. 1\u2019s son watches as 2 kills his father and takes the headband and title of Number 1 for himself. He challenges the young boy, telling him that he\u2019ll be waiting for him at the mountain of the Gods when he feels like he\u2019s ready to fight him. And so the young boy grows and fights as the new Number 2, vowing to seek revenge against 1 for killing his father and becoming the legendary and feared Afro Samurai.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s what we see him do through the entire 5 episodes, making his way to the mountain to fight Number 1. Each episode appears to be separate from one another as a new enemy comes to try and kill him, with a little bit of his life as a youth as Number 2 is revealed in every episode. We soon realize that his past is not only tied in to the present, but it serves as a key component near the end.\\n\\n\r\nBut other than that, it\u2019s just a story about death, and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nNow the art is where Mr. Okazaki shined. Apparently in his youth he liked to draw African Americans and was inspired by hip hop. We see a style that is mixed with the Boondocks and Samurai Champloo. It\u2019s all exaggerated and stylized, which I found to be fitting for the show. None of the men are good looking, they either look plain or look like thugs which adds a certain realistic feel to the art despite the stylization (that being said the women are beautiful, which is always a staple in these sorts of adult themed shows apparently). The animation is also stylized and exaggerated, which again works with the art that makes it look good rather than makes it an eyesore.\\n\\n\r\nAs odd as it is to say, I didn\u2019t really notice the background that much. I was too busy paying attention to the characters and their dialogue. The purpose of the background isn\u2019t meant to take over the entire scene, but to help set the mood of the scene as well as give the characters room to interact with it and with each other. In this sense the background served its purpose well.\\n\\n\r\nThe color scheme is also similar to the Boondocks and is somewhat opaque and dark. It\u2019s also due to the time in which it came out, as the early 2000\u2019s produced a lot of anime with a dark and dreary color scheme. You won\u2019t really find a vibrant color in the show, save for the sunset orange.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I would like to mention. There is a TON of blood in it. However, this is to be expected since the story just has Afro killing a bunch of people.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry to everyone who likes hip hop and rap in their anime! The music score was composed by none other than RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which is sort of a big deal considering how popular they are. You will find him rapping throughout the anime as well as through the Opening and Ending theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd who else to play a better Afro Samurai and his alter ego Ninja Ninja than the man Samuel L. Jackson? Right from the moment you hear Afro speak (or perhaps if you haven\u2019t heard his voice that often, you\u2019ll better recognize him when Ninja Ninja speaks) you know who the voice actor behind the animated character is. At first you might think that this is impressive, but then you realize that Samuel L. Jackson doesn\u2019t say no to anything\u2026..and you still might think that this is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t really care for such flare or stardom incorporated into the show. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the music fit the theme and Mr. Jackson\u2019s acting was fine - it\u2019s just not my cup of tea. But at least you can tell that this show was definitely made in America!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are about as straightforward as the storyline is. We really only see Afro\u2019s background getting the focus of the story, which shows how he grew in strength and resolve. Personality wise we see him stay as stoic and revenge driven as ever. The other characters aren\u2019t touched on at all, and the bulk of who Afro interacts with wants to kill him for his Number 2 headband. This serves its purpose to the story, but if you\u2019re wanting deep character growth then I suggest you check out another anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I\u2019d like to mention -- even though the characters are pretty two dimensional they act as though they are \u2018gangster thugs\u2019. Well, they are -- but what I mean is they act like modern day, inner city thugs. This makes the show a little more comical, I will admit. Also, there is A LOT of cursing in this show. So keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nSorry everyone! I just couldn\u2019t get into the show, but at least I can say that I watched it. This is a very adult show, so I don\u2019t suggest watching this with children nearby. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend young teens watching it since there is seriously a huge amount of cursing and killing and blood. On the other hand, if you just want to kick back and have something to watch where it will entertain you without heavy thinking or story involvement, then I would suggest Afro Samurai because it\u2019s only 5 episodes of death and bad assery.",

            "content": "ATTENTION: I watched Afro Samurai a few years ago and just now re-watched it. My opinion changed a bit as between my first trip to the crazy world in which the story takes place and this not-so-long ago as I watched a hundred or more other series and frankly said got used to the toposes found in the world of M&A.\r\nNevertheless, AS (as I will from now on abbreviate the title) is unique even after those few years. I'll cover the 6 criterions, which are Story (S), Art (A), Sound (S), Character (C), Enjoyment (E) and Overall (O) as I go through the series. BeforeI start, however, I have to admit that this is my first entry here, so \u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f\u306d.\\n\\n\r\nS: 6\\n\r\nI have to say that however typical the story is, it has some original flavour to it as a story of revenge. I liked the fact that AF follows his goal all the way through without changing his mind like many characters do. After watching the movie that follows the story I was even more satisfied with the state that we find him in the moment 'Ressurrection' begins. The mediocre side of the series got the best of it: there was a lot of situations when AF had no chance of surviving, barely survived and the next day looked as if he never got into any fight. The motif with him being targeted was interesting, but his skill made it all look not-so-fine. Also, gore moments were cool when I was a teenager, but now they just drag on and on throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA:7\\n\r\nI have to admit the art of the series is quite unique as the style differs from other series. It kicked off as a doujinshi and that's the proper reason behind this, I have to rate it as a GOOD (if the series wasn't 7 years old but for example was produced in 2010, it would drop as the standard went a lot higher each year).\\n\\n\r\nS:7\\n\r\nThe rap music is not really my field of interest, but I have to admire the good quality of the soundtrack and how it tunes well with the fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nC:5\\n\r\nI have to admit: there was no depth to any of the characters. That's probably because the creators focused too much on the action, but nothing interesting other than the revenge motif came out during these five episodes.\\n\\n\r\nE:8\\n\r\nI enjoyed it few years ago and even now it's fun to watch. Nothing deep or intriguing, only pure action and blood everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nO:6\\n\r\nThe series was original when it came out and it even went viral in my coutry. Nevertheless, probably I won't watch it ever again as it has nothing other than action. If there is somebody that'll read this review, I have to alert you: if you seek something more than action and guts, look somewhere else. I assure you: there are hundreds of more interesting series out there and you'll find many good ones soon enough.",

Afro Samurai is the resulting mess you receive when you let americans take over production of your anime, It's like taking a joyride on your Dad's favourite lamborghini, a short-lived enjoyable thrill, but there'll be hell to pay when you're home.\r\nThe so-called underdog story this time is that there's a samurai, who happens to be African, in Japan - And he's not happy with being number 2! No, he can't just let it go, he has to decapitate/sever/dismember/BBQ his way through thousands for a number 1 headband (collector's edition (tm). It's astory, but only by definition - they needed a reason to fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe high point of this anime is the art, FUNimation did a spectacular and gruesome job of making this show flow smoothly, every fight scene is a sick pleasure to watch, with guts and blood covering no less than 1/4 of the screen at all times - Quentin Tarantino would be proud.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no such thing as an english Dub this time, since it's the original language. Samuel Jackson performed his part spectacularly well, as Ninja Ninja that is. Afro himself is an emotionally devoid zombie that speaks 5-6 times with breath-taking one liners such as &quot;..shut..up&quot;. Oh, and Kelly Hu - why is she here? Couldn't you find any woman off the street with a bearable voice? Regardless, based on Jackson's performance alone i'm giving this some decency.\\n\\n\r\nA character is an artificial entity that doesn't exist, but with his own personality, experience and charm - can make us try to understand him as a real human being. That's something to be worked on by the way. EVERY character in this series is absolutely forgettable, EVERY character is 2-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\n To be quite truthful, i think Afro is a bastard, and despite being the protagonist, he's far more twisted and sick than all the villains. To contrast that think of Yagami Light from death note, misguided and corrupt, he's a teddy bear compared to this maniac.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the intro, you'll enjoy the ride. If you don't like anime and know little or nothing about anime when you first watch this, you'll believe that this is some sort of anime nirvana, a real masterpiece. I believed that 2-3 months ago.\\n\r\n But if you've been around for a while and watch more thought provoking pieces than Naruto, you'll notice problems, cliches, left and right - that'll make it somewhat harder to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score (calc'ed): 5.8 out of 10. Not good, not bad - average.",

            "content": "Considering this anime is only 5 episodes long I can't really complain too much about wasting my time with this appalling series when there's much bigger and longer fish to fry. However there aren't many anime titles that I can say I actually hate as typically I'm indifferent to anime shows that I don't like. However in this case just about everything in this series is just a mess and I'm surprised it did well enough to get a movie adaptation of itself and a movie sequel (which is equally shit but I'm not here to talk about that). Anyway we're here to constructively criticise,not ramble like a moron.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (2) - A 2? Are you serious? Surely the story can't be that bad right? Believe me it is. No originality in any way shape or form, no plausibility in both the overall plot or the chapters it has to get there, the pacing is far too fast for you to care about anything as there are too few episodes and a god awful ending that comes out of nowhere. But I will go into great lengths to explain just how shitty this story is.\\n\\n\r\nThe start of the first episode sets up the premise, Afro Samurai (yeah that's his real name apparently) is a man with a revenge motive because back when he was a child some bloke with a hat called Justice killed his father whom until that point was the strongest man in the world because his headband that says \"# 1\" on it says so. After Justice kills Afro's dad Justice gives Afro his old headband that says \"#2\" on it but he later loses it to some punks. From then on we realise we're following two stories. One revolving around Afro as a child trying to get the #2 headband back by tracking down whoever might have it because for some reason he needs it in order to challenge Justice to a duel to get his revenge and another when we see the present day Afro with the #2 headband travelling to where Justice is and get challenged by people from his past and a church who are essentially villains for the sake of having villains.\\n\\n\r\nIs it just me or does this set up not make much sense? Afro, a small child with no fighting experience lost the #2 headband to a bunch of random guys he met and then they lost the headband to someone else who lost it to someone else. How does this prove who the second strongest fighter is? All that just happened is weaklings lost to stronger weaklings. Even if I was to accept that after so many years a #2 would be established by every named fighter in the world losing to them, the guy who turns out to be #2 kept it a big secret so such an argument can't be made!\\n\\n\r\nFor that matter why would people be so concerned about going after the #2 headband to begin with? especially Afro. Everybody knows where Justice lives anyway so why would they dilly dally around challenging the second best instead of just challenging the best straight away? It's a fight to the death after all so what's Justice going to do about it if you show up without the headband? Try and kill you for breaking the rules? There's no change in the circumstances whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nIn the present time storyline at some point or another per episode Afro gets attacked by the church of mecha (I call them that because they somehow have the technology to build extremely talented fighting robots in a time where everybody else uses swords) The action scenes are quite entertaining at the time you see them but you'll very quickly forget everything about them. Such as who the bad guy was, what their weapon was, what kind of techniques they used and even how Afro defeated them. For the most part its very mindless too. The biggest example I can think of is when Afro had to beat the villain by doing something \"spontaneous and unexpected\" but he doesn't do anything creative and just does an epic slash that's really confusing what actually went on. Aside from this nothing very interesting happens except for one part that involved Afro having sex which was the only enjoyable part that wasn't a fight scene. The only thing that prevents the story from getting a 1 is a plot twist with the guy who follows Afro around everywhere. It's one of those cool twists where you don't see it coming but when you think about everything leading up to it, you could have figured it out and you kick yourself a bit for not being able to, so that much is appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the past time story goes we are simply waiting for the inevitable moment where Afro will kill the guy who you could figure out is going to turn out to be the #2 headband guy straight away. This leads to another character called Jinno who was sort of like family to both Afro and the #2 guy wanting revenge on Afro which is really irritating because he should have understood what the fight actually meant to both people fighting but instead he becomes yet another villain who's just there for the sake of being a villain.\\n\\n\r\nIt couldn't even succeed in having at least an atmosphere to this story. It could have been a really dark, edgy, bloody, cool, serious samurai era world, but sadly it fails to deliver on that too as there's far too much comic relief (unfunny comic relief) given to us by Afro's obnoxious tag along buddy and the church who never say anything interesting and technological inconsistencies that remind you that you're just watching a cartoon. We live in a fudel era where people fight with swords, a future setting with robots and lasers and also we are in a dragon ball world where people can fall from ridiculous heights and land without breaking so much as a single bone.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a let down and it comes completely out of nowhere. It involves a plot to bring all the headbands in the world together because it will grant the #1 headband guy godlike powers and let him transform into a monster that looks like it would fit well into a hentai. This whole idea just comes across as a plot convenience because they couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation for why there needed to be both a #1 and #2 headband in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (3) - There isn't a single character in this series that stands out as memorable, at least in a positive way. The fact it's 5 episodes long is no excuse. Anime Movies have overall less runtime and many have excellent levels of character development by comparison to this garbage.\\n\\n\r\nAfro is a tiny little bit bad ass since he wins loads of fights and can cut bullets in half for some reason but he's extremely boring too. He rarely ever says anything and when he does it's always to tell the guy following him around to shut up. Silent or near silent characters have been done well. Brandon Heat from Gungrave didn't talk very much but you still understood his personality and his conflicting emotions, Afro on the other hand has no depth at all and it's next to impossible to describe his character without saying \"he was kind of cool and was good at fighting with a sword.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe guy following Afro around is intolerable, just a typical comic relief character to lighten the mood. I hate that shit in anime. D-Gray Man could have benefited greatly from taking itself more seriously instead of throwing in a bunch of lame jokes and this series suffers for the same reason. The plot twist with him is the only thing that makes him kind of interesting but aside from that he's thoroughly unlike-able in personality.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the two characters from Afro's past who he kind of became family with who end up wanting him dead for no good reason. As I mentioned earlier they should have understood what the fight between Afro and the #2 headband guy meant and why it was important to Afro but instead they decide that they want revenge on him. The girl nearly kills Afro while having sex with him but fails when Afro's massive cock gives her the orgasm of her life and decides she wants to help him all of a sudden and the guy (Jinno) ends up becoming one of the most laughable side villains in anime history. Not to mention Afro spends more time fighting Jinno than he does fighting Justice, the guy who he's supposed to take revenge on. To be fair the fight with Jinno and Afro is one of the best animated fights I've ever seen but because I hated both Jinno and Afro so much, I just didn't care about any of it. That's really bad. Then in the rematch between Justice and Afro we pretty much get a one hit KO situation. Well that sucks!\\n\\n\r\nThe church villains are all stock. Just bad guys for the sake of bad guys. The church never say or do anything that makes them interesting, they just have a bunch of numbered fighters challenge Afro because...someone has to I guess. They are all conveniently numbered in order from strongest to weakest in the same vein as the Espada from Bleach to make them seem like they have more character and personality than they actually do but sadly you'll forget the personalities of every single one of these guys. At least Bleach had Ulquiorra, Nnoitra and Grimmjow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATION (8) - As much as I hate to admit it the artwork and animation was very good. The character designs are pretty unique, the attention to detail is great, the weapons look awesome and the backgrounds are beautiful. However a lot of the time I kept thinking I was watching Sin City. It was black and white almost all the time and like in Sin City you'd only catch certain colours here and there like green eyes, red because of the blood splashes and the occasional piss yellow when Afro had a lemonade on the go (one of the \"running gags\"). There are a few daytime scenes which is when the colour comes out and during such times the colour work is great too. \\n\r\nOverall, not much to complain about in art design.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes you'd be disappointed if it was anything less than exceptional when the show is only 5 episodes long and as such Afro Samurai demonstrates some great animation. Of course like with any anime you get the slow framed parts every now and again and sometimes you get obviously repeated clips but when Afro Samurai tries to be well animated it fully succeeds. As you might expect, the action scenes are best at demonstrating this. Although there are even little things like when Afro smokes a cigarette, it burns away so fluidly it's like the real deal! Looks way better than the cigarettes in Trigun. Oh and Afro's afro moves too. Badass!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6) - I watched this anime dubbed and to be honest it was dubbed very well. Samuel L Jackson despite hardly having any lines with Afro still put in a good performance and his voice acting for the guy tagging along with Afro (yeah he plays him too) was good too but sadly the writing was so bad for both these characters that he couldn't save them. The rest of the cast was voiced well enough for dub haters not to be able to complain too much about but I wouldn't be ranking this up there with Baccano or Black Lagoon either.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as music and sound effects go, to be honest I have nothing to say. It was just fine. The soundtrack fitted okay enough for me not to be able to complain but it didn't really stand out either like say Rurouni Kenshin or Samurai Champloo's which tackle this kind of fudel era (much better I should add).\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment section I'm going to tie it in with the overall since I have pretty much the same things to say about both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT (4) - You know what? Since when was decent worse than mediocre? That's what this scoring system seems to think. I always thought decent fell between average and good. To me 4 means BAD!\\n\\n\r\nIf you worked out the mean average score of the 4 categories you'd notice it actually averages out to 5. However the characters and the story are the most important aspects to a show so if both characters and story are both lower than art and sound I deduct an extra point since it would more accurately represent my feelings. This is a bad series, not an average one. However if the characters and story were higher than art and sound I would have given an extra point overall, so it's not like I'm being unfair in that regard. Anyway now for the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of fun to look and the action scenes are fairly entertaining because of the really good animation but the story and characters are really what screw this anime up. The revenge story was boring and the concepts were just ridiculous with no good characters to prop it up even a little bit. They just written to be used for action scenes or to attempt to give shock value. If you want a really good show that deals with people from this kind of era I'd recommend Rurouni Kenshin as it has a plausible set up, the characters are much better and the story is highly enjoyable. Sure the action scenes aren't as well animated but you'll like them a lot more for the simple reason you actually care about the people fighting and why. Afro Samurai however is a massive crock of shit and I do not advise watching it at all unless the only thing you care about is mindless action and nothing else. If you want a good revenge story then I would recommend either reading Berserk or watching Hunter X Hunter for Kurapika's storyline (plus it's a great anime all around anyway).",

            "content": "Afro Samurai is a gory revenge story with elements of blaxploitation mixed in and Samuel L. Jackson voicing the lead. Sounds amazing, right? However...\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAfro Samurai has a really generic revenge plot- boy's father is murdered in front of him, killer encourages boy to seek revenge, boy grows up and seeks revenge. It's not the worst premise I've ever seen. However, as the story progresses, the premise gains absolutely no depth. There's a hamfisted attempt at pushing a \"break the cycle\" moral, but it never seems to have any bearing on the plot or the characters whatsoever. The main plot is honestly boring, which isa major negative when considering how much screentime is devoted to it.\\n\r\nThe episodic plots are even worse somehow. They don't really have any relation to the plot besides \"#2 headband\" and they leave a lot of loose ends dangling and plot holes. I found myself constantly confused about where these subplots came from. My guess is that they're mostly excuses for a gore-fest or a really uncomfortable sex scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is very stylized and certainly hard to get used to, but the longer I watched it the more I grew to like it. The use of grayscale is intentional and gives the (copious amounts of) blood a stark contrast. One could also say that it's symbolic of Afro's mindset, and given how artsy it feels I wouldn't argue.\\n\r\nThe animation itself is also good. Nothing about it feels clunky or cheap. The blood spurts are definitely Kill Bill-esque, but I believe that's intentional.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is where Afro Samurai really shines. The Wu-Tang Clan breathed life into this thing, giving it a hip-hop feel that isn't there without it. This is one of those cases where the soundtrack actually enhances the series instead of just acting as background noise.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was generally very good. SLJ's characters in particular had excellent voice acting. A few side characters sounded awkward, but I've honestly never seen a dub this good. My only complaint is with how godawful the few Japanese words sound when spoken by the English cast, something I've never encountered before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThis is the main problem with the series: none of the characters are likeable. At all. Ninja Ninja is annoying, Afro himself is a forgettable silent badass with no redeeming qualities, and all of the side characters and villains managed to grate on my nerves somehow.\\n\r\nTo make it worse, none of the characters really experience any kind of development. Sure, there's a limit to what you can do in 5 episodes, but the main character at the end should be different from the main character at the beginning. The only \"character development\" we get is in Afro's flashbacks, and they really only show him as a kid fostering his hatred and anger. There's also a huge gap in character between child Afro and adult Afro with nothing to bridge it, to the point that I can barely even recognize that they're supposed to be the same person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI may have enjoyed looking at the art and listening to the soundtrack, but I was bored pretty much the whole way through and I couldn't wait for it to be over. If you're looking for senseless violence and sex, you may enjoy it more than I did.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I'd only recommend this anime if you aren't interested in plot and don't care about characters. If you just want mind-numbing blood and swords and stuff, this would be a great way to waste a couple of hours. Otherwise, I'd give this a pass.",

The ghetto voices and the seedy vibe of the setting worked well with Samuel L Jackson's vocals.\r\nI found afro to be a very unrelatable character though I do suspect that was the intention. Comic relief is provided throughout by his verbal sidekick. Action lovers need not fear watching this however as epic sword fights occur frequently. The artwork is not brilliant by any means, the story is not extremely coherent and it is maybe too short but it is nevertheless an entertaining and action-packed anime.",

            "content": "So I picked this up from my local Wal Mart pretty much just because it looked interesting. When I was younger, I have heard of Afro Samurai, but I never knew exactly WHAT it was, like a video game, TV show, or just some character. But let's get down to business...\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nA revenge story... this shit again? Well, revenge stories are somewhat fun to watch if you like characters getting owned by the MC, but if you don't have much patience for that kind of stuff, then roll out. Afro Samurai is about, well, Afro Samurai, who's father was killed by Justice in a duelfor the #1 headband, which is said to give the wearer god-like powers. As a fully-developed grown man, Afro finally journeys out to challenge Justice to a duel for the headband, but must first face off against other warriors who want the #2 headband that Afro wears. And... that's pretty much it. A simplistic plot doesn't work very well for me, but what I did enjoy was Afro's backstory.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs many people would probably think, Afro (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) seems like a pretty lifeless character besides his almost-flawless combat skill, but his backstory really makes up for it, showing how Afro became the heartless man he is and it was rather enjoyable to watch. Ninja Ninja (also voice by Jackson), is the major comic relief character, which is very necessary for an anime as dark as this one. Ninja Ninja was funny. Some may think he isn't, some may think he is, but with Samuel's excellent voice acting, he really brought the character to life. Although, Ninja Ninja doesn't play a very major role in the show, other than making the audience laugh. He's mostly ignored by Afro and other characters, no matter how loud or witty he is. Even though characters don't develop, I wouldn't have expected them to considering that this show is only 5 episodes long. You shouldn't expect any character development simply because the anime is just way too short to cram it in, so this character score is not going to affect too much of my final score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n1 word: hardcore. To the animators for Afro Samurai, hats off to all of you because this show probably had the cleanest animation I've seen in an anime. The detail in the fights are so dynamic that I kept replaying pretty much every single fight, especially the fight between Afro and AfroDroid which still ranks in my top 10 best anime fights. Colors are incredibly bold and dark, which played a huge role in the animation, making everything around Afro look deceiving and violent. Oh, and by the way, this show is very bloody. It's not the most violent anime I've seen; like it doesn't go as far as internal organs spewing out, but it showcases a lot of unique video game-ish ways to slice up humans with a large katana.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI like all kinds of music; hip-hop, rap, jazz, rock, film orchestra, and almost anything else that's not head-banging heavy metal. I grew up listening to hip-hop and rap, so I'm pretty much a sucker for TV shows and films that showcase some of that type of music. The music of this show is far from  anything as good as something like Samurai Champloo, but the show still showcases some tracks that caught my interest, most notably the end credits Outro theme simply because it sounds like the closest thing to an actual SC track. Caught Up by Black Knights was an excellent choice for the AfroDroid fight. If you have a good ear for music, the song basically gave the fight scene a sort of \"hype\" feeling to it, even though it's on a low tempo. The soundtrack is a good pick-up for people who are into that kind of music. I don't really care much for the theme song, though, simply because the rhymes are a little too sketchy even though I like the rhythm, but other than that, the music for Afro Samurai is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, you may enjoy the hell out of watching Afro Samurai simply because of its kick-ass action and animation...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBut once you take some time to think about it, the show is not top-tier. I could've given this anime a 6 due to its simplistic plot (but rather interesting backstory), but the animation, insane fights, and good music makes up for most of it, so it will enjoy a permanent stay in my anime collection.",

            "content": "This review is going to be very biased. I have a hard-on for the modern day samurai thing so I couldn't help but give this anime a 9/10. Also, Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite actors of all time. I am going to write this very biased review anyway because I fucking loved this show.\r\nStory-\r\nThe story follows a young black man, I think he's 30 at the most, and his quest for vengeance against the man who killed his father. In this world, there are two headbands that \"rank\" a warrior's strength. The number one headband and the number two. Only the personwith the number 2 headband can challenge the number one, so many people are after this thing. The black man, Afro, had a father who was number one, but he was killed by a gunslinger named Justice. So, from there on, Afro trains himself to be the world's strongest warrior. Very generic, I know, but the whole father-son thing touched me quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThis series had a very high budget. The animation was amazing and the art style reminded me of some old samurai anime. Afro was portrayed very well and I thought he had the coolest hair and outfit ever. Nothing much to say really. Alot of money was spent on this series, so you get what you pay for. Oh yeah, and the fight scenes were cool as shit. I have never once seen a guy cut a bullet into tiny pieces and kill the guys surrounding him with the shrapnel.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nNice hip-hop beats and some jazz mixed in there. The RZA did really well with the soundtrack. It reminded me of the BGM from Samurai Champloo, but alot edgier and more \"oomf\" to it. If you are a fan of hiphop/rap, you will not be dissapointed with the soundtrack. Oh, and Samuel L Jackon's voice was sexy. He got like 20 lines, but each line was cool as shit. And Justice had a pretty nice voice as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nAfro, Justice, and the Ninja are the only characters I really liked in this anime. I really didn't give a crap about Afro's childhood peers, so I disliked all of them. Afro is a very chill dude. He smokes his joints and keeps to himself. The typical \"lone wolf\" but more badass. Justice had some very good quotes in my opinion. He was a man who had gotten drunk with power and it really reflected in his mannerisms and such. Ninja was funny as hell and he kept Afro's sanity in check.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nThis anime was just cool as hell dude. I know it might be just me, but modern Samurais are the coolest thing ever. Whats cooler than a joint smoking samurai who fights with a style of breakdance and disciplined swordmanship? Anyway, if you like samurai stuff and/or hiphop, definitely check it out. It's very different from your conventional anime, but that's because it's Western. I fucking loved this series, but I can't guarantee the same for you.",

I frankly don't have much problem with the anime as a whole (because it was well constructed), except a bit with the story.\r\nIt kept you clinging, but it would have been nice if it had a little more air time. The back story of our protagonist really was handled well, and we understood the emotions and his overall perspective fluently. The characters makes it hard for me to let the story goat this point, truthfully speaking - with such a kick ass villain as there was (speaking here of the English Dub, in which in my opinion, Samuel L. Jackson kicks ass, but Ron Periman is just a shade better).\\n\\n\r\nThis is a worthwhile watch. I've seen it three times, and it still never ceases to amaze me. A definitive addition to one's list.",

            "content": "For the longest time, I've been meaning to watch this after seeing AD's for it on Spike TV. Well, lucky for me I recently found it and watched all 5 episodes in one sitting and I must say... I was very impressed with it.\r\nThe story is rather simple. Afro Samurai is out for revenge for his fathers death, and he'll f*** anyone who stands in his way. \r\nWith each episode we learn just a little bit more about Afro and his haunted and blood filled history, and this all builds up to the final showdown. The plot overall, is rather simple and straight forward, butin the latter episodes things do become more heart and story driven. Not exactly the deepest story you'll find, but it still delivers the goods.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is fantastic, that simple. Each movement is carefully animated creating a very smooth and often times beautiful animation. The action scenes are incredible to watch and should make any action junkie very happy. I'd even say the action scenes here rival Hellsing Ultimate. And that's saying something. So yeah, the animes budget is clearly seen here.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, one of the best I've seen in an anime, with Samuel L. Jackson and Ron Perlman being the highlights. The soundtrack was also very good and fitting to the series, and even though I'm not much of a fan of rap, the slow rap intro was great to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves were pretty interesting. While I thought the main protagonist Afro, was a walking badass, he was very cold... maybe even to cold. It was a tad hard to feel any sympathy for him, especially during a certain fight in episodes 4 and 5 (in which I had a tough time figuring out who I was routing for). Ninja Ninja, Afro's sidekick was pretty damn annoying, though it was interesting seeing the true role he played later on.\\n\r\nThe antagonists weren't really that interesting in my opinion, save for 2 (one's a twist and the other being Justice the main antagonist) the others were just meh. The main bad group of characters 'Empty Seven Clan' are made up of identical monks and a big dude... yep, nothing very interesting there.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I say this is one hell of an anime and something which I wish had lasted a bit longer. An entertaining story, beautiful animations, superb voice acting, a badass protagonist, you really can't go wrong here.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, this get's my stamp of awesomeness :D \\n\\n",

The story is very low. However given that this is a 5 episode series, and its a revenge series. So I mean not much you can deviate from that. Also enough story is given to make you actually care about the characters. I also kind of wish they explored the world a little bit more. It is a very interesting mix of modern world meets ancient samurai world. However thereis a movie that came out after this series so I may just get that wish in that. The art work is phenomenal. It has such good fighting animation in it. It is so fluid with how the characters move around. Also one other plus is the facial animations. It is much better then most anime. The opening is also pretty good to. Like Samurai Champloo in a way. Definitely adding it to my workout playlist. The voice acting is also superb as well. Joe Dimaggio, Samuel L Jackson, and Phil LaMarr. All great obviously, but the side voice actors are also fantastic. You can truly believe what they are saying. So to say the least. This series is a great anime that I would totally recommend. It is a good story about revenge, fighting, and feels like a bloody Bruce Lee movie.",

            "content": "Story 8: The story as expressed in Afro Samurai follows a semi-episodic formula, across its 5 episode arch, as each episode has a somewhat independent plot to it. However, Afro has taken note from some of the better episodic series of its predecessor, and instead of forcing an over all plot to be formed, the writers used this formula to make each episode in some way relate to our protagonist's past or over all development as a person. Each episode has a pretty long run time, being roughly an hour, but they pace it out so that you are glued every second, which is surprisingwhen looking back at it, as each episode is filled with long periods of inactivity, which instead of becoming dull were, for me at least, the best part of the show, as it was used for characterization, proper set up of a climax, and the building of tension. The only complaint I can give is that the series, due to its own formula doesnt exactly end, instead leaving it on a cliff hanger, and while it is a satisfying one, its still a cliff hanger.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: The art of Afro Samurai can only be described as excellently bizarre, being a cross between western and eastern styles which just makes every image ooze style. It almost looks like a cross between a dark horse comic and a studio trigger production. I have absolutely no complaints for the animation, the fight choreography is spot on and never fails to impress, the sets are well designed and interesting, the character's designs are both disturbing and well fitted to the world they inhabit creating an excellent dichotomy of insane surrealism that just permeates every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: The sound design is surprisingly subtle (besides the pretty good op), as the sound design is at its best when its in mid combat, each clang of the blade, each step the character's take, each breath of the wind, its made to be feel so natural that when they kick the music, or the explosives go off the impact hits you all the harder, and i love it. The only complaint I have is that it can be a bit too bombastic at times, but otherwise its excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: The character's of Afro are featured in a villain of the week formula, and as such dont really have much development beyond their relation to our protag, and that is a bit of a shame as some of them have huge potential to be quite interesting on their own. However, Afro himself is a pretty good character, but that has to do less with his actual personality or personal traits, but more to do with how they express his character and lead his growth in the series. The way they write each scene allows us to feel for this man in a way that most anime (or artistic mediums in general) fail to do, because he grows in proportion to the escalation of the series, and in turn this growth feels human and natural. Its quite an achievement on the writer's part that they were able to give this, would be angry plank of wood, a well rounded and interesting personality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: Afro is just a very good time over all. From the solid action, excellent animation to its unique uses of both western and eastern tropes, this series is excellent for both anime and western film fans. The gore is vsceral, yet not over bearing, the characters are interesting yet not clamoring for screen time, and the plot is easily accessible, yet doesnt feel shallow, its a series that is just built from every angle to be an enjoyable ride. However...looking for deeper meaning is probably not a good idea, beyond our protagonist's growth and journey of self reflection there isnt much to dwell on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: Let this be my only warning, if you are younger than 16, you should not watch this. The series features sex, extreme violence, themes of suicide and depression, and is clearly made for adults. That said, for the rest of you, if you arent bothered by any of the previously listed aspects, then prepare for a thrill fest the likes you probably wont find elsewhere....Oh, one last....thing, Samuel Jackson is a voice actor for this series, and yes, his voice is like sunshine syrup on a pancake dream.",

            "content": "Afro Samurai is in my opinion a perfect series for newcomers to the anime community.\r\nHere are the reasons why:\r\nAfro Samurai is a short series with only five episodes, so it almost feels more like a movie than a series, but split up into a serial format. The story is very simple and not the greatest story ever told, but it suffices for this series.\r\nThe art style is gorgeous to look at and the fights are all very smooth and highly entertaining. \r\nThe music is great as well.However, I never really critique music unless it really sticks out. The series doesn't really have an opening, sothere is no point in talking about it.\\n\r\n The voice acting is good as well, although there is the twist that there is only an English version. This is another reason why I think that this series is great for newcomers that might not want to watch everything subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good too, although Afro and his friend don't have a real personality outside of \"being cool\" and \"being quirky\".\\n\\n\r\nEverything considered, this is an awesome show both for newcomers and long-time anime lovers and I highly recommend it.",

The characters, which seems like it should've been the main focus of the story in an anime that catologues the heroes' journey, aren't well designed. The episodes typically consist of the main character, Afro, fighting some foe that he takes out because he's a samurai. And apparently that makes him cool.\r\nThe creators seemed to have expected us to root for him and think that he was the ultimate badass because of his voice actor, Samuel L. Jackson, his afro, his sword, his afro, his stoic and reserved aura, andhis afro. There isn't much room for character development or even story telling when your main character only says two sentences per episode that attempt to highlight how badass he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, one where Afro must face off against the man who killed his father, isn't well crafted either, as the entire thing can be summed up by the first and last five minutes of the series, meaning that in a five episode series, four and half episodes are unneccessary.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I still found myself mildly entertained most of the time, and would recommend it to certain people, especially considering how short it is.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Afro Samurai I was happy and I expected good things from it, its not every day that an anime has an African American as the main character. Alas, I was severely disappointed with this. This a a pretty bad anime, probably the worse Samurai based anime I have ever seen.  Afro samurai has little to no story at all.  A young Afro accompanies his father too a fight, his father loses,  I need revenge, then ensue the massacre of petty much everyone on screen. This is just a simple revenge story, there is absolutely nothing else inthe big picture, he feels no remorse for slaughtering any and everyone that crosses his path. Some of you may be thinking, wow that guys a pretty cool bad ass right? Wrong. Hes not a bad ass. Hes just a guy that walks around with a sword killing people and smoking a cigarette. He mumbles about 10 words throughout each episode, most of the time it being 'shut up'.\\n\\n\r\nStory:Don't watch this if you're looking for a story, you will be severely disappointed when you try to scape up whats considered the story of this anime. At around the middle part of the second episode I figured out that this anime had no intention of having a compelling story, its just a hack and slash show.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Besides the sound the art is probably the only thing thats good about this show. It properly shows everything its supposed to show from the great detail of each characters face to chopped limbs, blood, and weaponry. Due to the artwork you can properly understand each scene and experience fights the way they were meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound: RZA did a great job with the sound on this one. Everything sounds like it should and the music fits. Like I said before, the sound and art are the only good things about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: ....How can I explain the characters without expressing too much hate? I really can't but I'll give it a try anyway, Afro, the main character of this anime is a merciless swordsmen that kills everything in his path only stopping to drink lemonade and smoke a cigarette on his path to get revenge, pretty straight forward. The problem is thats exactly all he does. There were numerous scenes where someone was talking to him and he just simply didn't say anything at all. Theres pretty much no dialog at all between him and anyone besides Ninja,Ninja another character. At one point I thought he was mute until he mumbled his trademark 'shut up'. Why is this trademark you ask?  its trademark because he muttered it more than once, unlike any other word or phrase that he never said even once.\\n\\n\r\nNinja, ninja is a character that follows Afro around to annoy him I assume. Every other line from him is proclaiming Afros death in the upcoming battle. Hes a pretty straightforward character also. There is nothing more to him. Hes basically a thorn in Afros side that has the magic ability to get Afro to talk. You might spend time wondering what exactly he is though. I thought he was a ghost but he picks up stuff so i don't know what exactly is going on with that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I would enjoy this anime if I was a little younger back when I loved watching hack and slash. The fights themselves are enjoyable because of the bizarre enemies he has to face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A pretty lame forgettable anime.\\n",

I've heard that this anime was supposed to be the USA's attempt at an anime to compete with Japan or something. Well whatever reason it was made for it was pretty well done. Even though it is really short and has a simple plot its quite entertaining. Sam L. Jackson does a great job in his roles as always. The show has really good action sequences. The music track is produced by the RZA so of course it has that Wu-Tang hip-hop feel to it whichI really enjoyed. Some of the character designs are somewhat unconventional compared to typical anime but that didn't bother me at all. Overall I thought that art/animation was quite good. It has blood and gore but unless you are really turned off by anime blood then I would recommend this anime. Great show for a short thrill if you are in the mood for an action anime.",

That's the motto.\r\nAction 8/10: The action is flipping thrilling. People get sliced to bits. Its brutal. Its really brutal. Heads flying, limbs falling. Its rough stuff but good stuff. Action is mostly fast paced and enticing with quick and fast movement however there's times where there's intellect and emotion displayed which really seduces you into the anime.\r\nStory 6/10: This is as basic as you get but as a anime action lover I don't mind. The story is logical, clear and makessense so its decent. It's mostly about revenge as Afro samurai tries to avenge his father and claim the number 1 headband. During the story the emotion levels are high. It's truly a sad anime as Afro samurai past is shown through parts of the anime. You feel sorry for the main character. His life was a struggle and he continues that bloody struggle as he watches his friends die amongst him as he slices his way to the number 1 headband.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: This anime is unique. Another anime infused with hip hop. The music is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. It really does match with the scenes. What I would do to get a OST collection for Afro samurai! The soundtracks are totally amazing and the instrumentals really do bang. Wicked anime! You will not be disappointed by this. The conclusion is decent. I've watched this many times. You won't be disappointed by this anime",

            "content": "Throughout time, many legends have been told about the mighty samurai... Warriors of honor, loyally serving their masters, as well as lone ronin, serving only to uphold the values they hold true, whether they be religious or personal. Around these parts, you\u2019ll hear tales of one such ronin, a bad ass motherfucker who\u2019s as silent as the grave and twice as terrifying. This man knows no love, no empathy, and no tears. He invites no trouble, and will offer no mercy to those stupid enough to give it to him. He knows few pleasures, save for the warmth of a woman\u2019s body, the refreshing tangof a cool glass of lemonade, and the sweet, sweet flavor of revenge. Rumor has it he doesn\u2019t even need to eat... That the blood of his enemies, which constantly bathes the blade of his sword, provides him all the nourishment he could ever need. I myself have no idea which rumors are true and which ones are just the product of fear, but I\u2019ve got no intention of finding out, and neither should you.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ll know this young samurai when you see him, as he sports an afro... A rare hair style indeed, and one that will surely become his sigul long after he\u2019s departed our world, if he ever does. But don\u2019t worry, traveler, there\u2019s no need to fear this man... Well, unless you have what he wants. Otherwise, he\u2019ll be perfectly willing to live and let live. See, you\u2019ve probably heard tell about the headbands... Trophies only the mightiest of samurai are able to carry, and the only way to obtain one is to spill the blood of it\u2019s previous owner. Well, this Afro Samurai is carrying the #2 headband, which... If you can\u2019t guess... Is the second most prestigious headband in the known world, and the only one that grants it\u2019s user the right to challenge the greatest samurai currently living, the holder of the #1 headband. And you didn\u2019t hear this from me, dear traveler, but the Afro Samurai\u2019s drive to challenge this man isn\u2019t based on mere ambition, but something much more personal. He fights not for glory, or for honor... But for revenge.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, Afro Samurai was the product of an international collaboration. Studio Gonzo was interested in adapting the deeply personal work of Takashi Okazaki, a manga artist who had been influenced by his love of both samurai classics and African American culture, particularly in regard to rap and R&B. He was shy at first, and probably wouldn\u2019t have signed over the rights if not for the encouragement and participation of American actor Samuel L Jackson, who had gotten his hands on a rare action figure based on Okazaki\u2019s illustrations, and had become obsessed with seeing the project through. Jackson and Okazaki apparently connected instantly, language barriers be damned, and the project went ahead, albeit with what I\u2019m told was a 1 million dollar budget.\\n\\n\r\nFor an American cartoon, that sort of budget for a five episode series is abysmal, but it\u2019s not that generous for an anime, either, despite the fact that anime is universally cheaper than it\u2019s western counterparts. For Afro Samurai, this meant that each episode could only cost less than twenty thousand dollars, and that meant they had to cut a lot of corners... Which they did, brilliantly I might add, by turning the cheapness they\u2019d been cursed with into a highly appealing visual style that incorporates the absolute best out of all the budget saving tactics you\u2019ve seen before. It never quite falls back on the time old talking heads, at least not to the point that you\u2019d ever notice it, but when movement is limited, the beautifully detailed artwork is more than sufficient to keep your eyes glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an anime... Well, any animation, really... Get this much mileage out of such a limited color palette. There are occasional splashes of color throughout the series, especially when it comes to the buckets full of red blood and the golden glow of our hero\u2019s precious lemonade, but for about 90 percent of the series, the colors on screen are almost monochromatic, playing with numerous shades of white, black and gray, as well as the occasional tan of the ground. At night, the cloudy, overcast sky is a captivating sight, and during the day, the lighting effects are beyond gorgeous. Other visual effects such as rain and fog filters are integrated smoothly with the cell-drawn animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe real triumph here are the action scenes, which are fast, fluid and dynamic, even when the animators have to break a character\u2019s anatomical frame in order to keep the pace up. It only takes one real glance to see this kind of animation style in motion, as Afro\u2019s namesake blows in the wind like the reflection of the moon in a puddle, and the animators are not shy about letting an occasional arm or leg move with exactly the same level of consistency. It winds up working out better than you\u2019d think not only because of sharp, fast editing, but because the sound design of every single sword movement is completely on point. I love all of the action scenes in this series, but a few easy highlights are an early fight where Afro splits a bullet with his sword, a huge bloodbath of a brawl from when he was a teenager that almost feels like Saving Private Ryan in the way it\u2019s brutality is show to effect him, and of course, there\u2019s also a fight towards the end where he takes on a robot who\u2019s been designed to look and fight like he does, but has no problem taking Afro to the sky with it when those tactics don\u2019t pan out.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed from Okazaki and Jackson\u2019s connection that I mentioned earlier, the music in Afro Samurai is made up mostly of hip-hop, full of vocal tracks whose head-banging beats fit the pace of the action in a way that\u2019s easily similar to The Boondocks. The vocal work was performed by RZA, a former member of the Wu-Tang clan, a band that was, in it\u2019s own right, influenced by Eastern culture. He also produced much of the music, as he did for his former band. The instrumental tracks feature slightly more traditional orchestration, but they fit more to the background, humbly doing their job without standing out too much. Besides, why bother making the instrumentals stand out when you have tracks featuring The Game, Too Short, Snoop Dogg and more, which are guaranteed to leave an impression all by themselves? The soundtrack, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have it, features a small handful of tracks that weren\u2019t from the show but inspired by it, and I don\u2019t mean \u2018inspired by\u2019 like all the bullshit tracks on the Pokemon Movie soundtrack... These are songs that actually fit the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is a very unique entity, as it\u2019s comprised almost entirely of actors who work in traditional animation. or \u201cPre-lay.\u201d This is a term referring to the practice of recording a voice actor first and then animating a character around them afterwards, as opposed to ADR voice acting, which does the opposite. Thankfully, they translate very well over to the more prevalent Anime recording style, although there are minor lip-flapping hiccups from time to time. The only anime regular who appears in this dub is Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Afro\u2019s childhood friend, Ginno, who was an idealistic young boy in Afro\u2019s past, but is even more compelling in the present day scenes, due to certain spoiler reasons. He does an outstanding job, probably the best performance in the dub, but because of a certain other big name, he was never the one I was going to get excited over.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how much hype went into the American airing of the series... And yes, the hype was palpable... The truth was, regardless of the show\u2019s success, I was going to watch it either way because of one of the names attached to it. He\u2019s one of the most underrated actors of our time, in my opinion, and as much as I enjoy his live action work, I practically chomp at the bit when I get a chance to hear him in a cartoon, or even in the rare video game, and I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to hear him in an anime. He\u2019s not only my favorite black actor, or my favorite voice actor, no, he\u2019s my favorite ACTOR, period. I\u2019ve been following him since BEFORE what many would consider his most memorable role in Pulp Fiction, and his inclusion made this dub for me. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about Phil Lamarr, the original voice actor for Samurai Jack, who once again returned to the genre as the young version of Afro, as well as one of the Brothers, a league of elderly assassins including such prolific actors as Jeff Bennet and John Dimaggio!\\n\\n\r\nOh, you thought I was talking about Samuel L Jackson? He did a fine job. I wish I could say more, but as a main character, he had relatively little to do or say throughout the series. The titular character Afro is a very soft-spoken character, choosing only to speak when necessary, letting his actions do the speaking for him unless he has no other choice. It\u2019s not really Jackson\u2019s fault, as it\u2019s not really an acting-heavy role, but he still does an admirable job with it. Thankfully he has dual roles, as he gets a lot more lines as the mysterious Ninja Ninja, a loud-mouthed tag-a-long who appears to Afro the minute he earns the #2 headband properly. The true identity of Ninja ninja is never openly revealed, nor is it stated until the final episode whether or not he exists at all. While his endless jabbering is welcome most of the time, breaking up long periods of silence and questioning Afro\u2019s motives, he can become annoying with his knack for stating the obvious. Think of him like... D\u2019s hand from Vampire Hunter D.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two high-billed names are Kelly Hu and Ron Perlman, though neither one really appears enough to justify having featured names. Outside of flashbacks, Kelly Hu only appears in one episode as a shrine maiden who takes Afro in when he\u2019s near death, and nurses him back to health... Using both medical AND sexual healing to see him through. Kelly exaggerates her accent with this character, which I guess is fitting, because she\u2019s one of the only definitely-asian characters in the cast. Ron Perlman is unrecognizable as the main villain, Justice, who only appears in the first and last episodes, but that\u2019s mostly because he hisses his lines like a snake, playing up how misanthropic and morally bankrupt this #1 samurai has allowed his time in the top to make him, as well as highlighting his delusional, god-like ambitions. If there\u2019s a problem with this dub, it\u2019s probably in the fact that some of the Brothers, played by veteran voice actors though they may be, are performed as though they were southern evangelical priests, a bafflingly poor fit for the tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t be unjustified in saying that Afro Samurai had a very weak story. Despite all that happens in it\u2019s five episode run, little to none of it seems to matter in the long run. Afro gets into fights that are resolved as easily as possible, and then moves on afterward, as if nothing had happened at all. This is because, at it\u2019s core, Afro Samurai is the very simple story about a surprisingly simple man. While we do get generous doses of flashbacks to explain who he is and why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, you really wouldn\u2019t lose anything important to the plot if you just told his backstory, and then cut directly to Afro standing at the gates of his final enemy. Even at five episodes, this anime could have been reduced to one, or two at the most, with nothing you would need to know lost in the process. The story does not see actual progress very often, and neither does Afro\u2019s journey, as he himself sees little to no development, at least if you don\u2019t count his childhood and teenage years in the flashbacks. This has become a major criticism of the series, and it\u2019s one I feel I should address.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite movies of 2013 was 2 Guns, a more-or-less by the numbers action film that featured both Denzel Washington and Mark Walberg as undercover agents from two separate factions pretending to be friends to investigate each other, constantly fighting together and backstabbing each other as the story progresses. I say that, but the story for the most part was an incoherent mess. There were so many betrayals and plot twists that I\u2019m not sure even the writers knew what was going on, so why did I love it so much? The answer lies in the execution, and what the movie brought to the table that worked. The insane story was made palatable by the sharp, clever dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads, and it ended in such a way that it was able to embrace it\u2019s insanity... Where else am I ever going to see a shoot-out between the Navy, the CIA and a drug cartel that takes place in the middle of an honest to God cattle stampede?\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why I like Afro Samurai so much. There are plenty of samurai stories with depth and complexity to them... Samurai Jack, Seven Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin... But in how many of them do we get to see the main character ride a robot version of themselves into the stratosphere, and then fight it all the way down? The only theme that Afro Samurai really tackles is the cost of revenge, as you do get to feel the bodies of Afro\u2019s friends and enemies pile up over time, which forces you to wonder whether or not vengeance for his father\u2019s death is really worth it in the first place, and his past does come back to haunt him at numerous occasions, as will often happen with the hunt for vengeance. Aside from this, there are a lot of things that just kind of happen, but the saving grace... And what makes the execution here so good... Is that it\u2019s all done with so much sincerity that none of it ever feels forced or pointless. Every single fight is memorable, no matter how easily they\u2019re resolved, and even no matter how forgettable or how generic the attackers themselves may be.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this excuse the obvious problems with the series? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, while this series does make for good popcorn material, it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of a rewatch, and much like your typical Superman story, it\u2019s kind of difficult to get invested in the story of an unstoppable man. There\u2019s also quite a bit that doesn\u2019t make any sense... The rules behind the headbands in particular are a head scratcher, and I\u2019m not just talking about how easy it would be to fake a #2 headband, but... What happens when #2 kills #1? Do they choose who gets the #2? Apparently they do, because Justice just hands it over to little Afro so that some bandits can pick it up. And why can\u2019t someone just break the rules and kill the #1 with a sniper rifle? Guns exist! And while I had no problem with most of Afro\u2019s enemies, the writers never portended that they were supposed to be important... Except for the Empty Seven, who prove to be completely wasted by the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the series keeps a consistent tone that makes it really easy to get lost in. Shallow as the story may be, one dimensional as adult Afro may be, underdeveloped as several concepts may be, it\u2019s a dark, gritty story that\u2019s taken completely seriously and steeped in the love of two very adult genres. It\u2019s definitely style over substance, but with both a style and substance that feel more like a collaboration between Kanye West and Quentin Tarrantino than a collaboration between Sam Jackson and a Mangaka, it\u2019s worth at least a second look. That\u2019s not to say the series is as much as the sum of it\u2019s parts, but there\u2019s something to be said for how much fun it is to watch a passion project that\u2019s creatively unhinged, and held back only by budgetary limits. It\u2019s not trying to be art, it\u2019s trying to be grindhouse, and to that end, it does a pretty solid job.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is available from Funimation in an impressive fold-out DVD case, as well as your standard thin blu-ray release. A follow-up movie, Afro Samurai Resurrection, is also available from the same company, and while you can buy them separately, you can also get them as a bundle in a set called The Complete Murder Sessions. The original manga consists of only two volumes, and it IS available stateside from Seven Seas Entertainment. A video game for the Playstation 3 and X-Box 360 is unfortunately out of print, but it\u2019s not that difficult to find a copy online.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai isn\u2019t for everyone. In fact, I\u2019m done making excuses for it. There\u2019s a good reason I can only watch this series about once a year, tops. It has a definite cool factor, but so did the first seasons of RWBY and Hellsing, and I hated both of those. Granted, Afro Samurai has quite a bit more to offer than those two did(as much as it fails compared to their future incarnations), mostly in regard to it\u2019s great production values, addictive music and engrossing adult tone, but I have to admit that if it were even one episode longer, I\u2019d probably hate it. I love Afro Samurai, but like so many other guilty pleasures out there, I have to be brutally honest about it... This series works really well, but only in small doses spaced out over time. I give Afro Samurai a 5/10",

            "content": "Man, this anime shouldn't be as underwhelming as it turned out to be. You got medieval japan with sci-fi elements like robots, cyborgs, guns, cell phones and other technology and then you got a cool ass no-nonsense samurai at the center of the story just marching forward to slice people up until he can reach demonic looking cowboy and kill him. It sounds cool and many people probably think it is but I was bored thanks to how badly it all fits together.\r\nOne thing to note before getting into the story is that it's extremely simple. It's a straightforward revenge plot with common revenge plotthemes and elements that goes through average action movie progression of fighting stronger and stronger foes until reaching target at the very end. It's also about 2 hours long so you'd expect that story being as simple as it is would be given less of a focus to give way for the real attraction - action. However it's not so, the pacing of the show is quite horrible so a lot of the time is spent on contemplative walks that don't add anything, drawn out backstory or long scenes of villains talking about their plans to bring down Afro. Then you get a short fight and the whole thing repeats.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are while generally well animated are a mixed bag when it comes to choreography, hardly any of them aside from maybe Justice fights are really memorable with only a few truly impressive moments sprinkled throughout. On top of that it's all brought down by the show's lacking visuals. To put it simply I think the original doujin/manga artist, Takashi Okazaki, designed some very unique, interesting and good looking designs but the way they transitioned to anime leaves a lot to be desired. Show's a gray, bland, muddy mess without anything impressive in terms of directing so it just undermines the whole art style. I feel like the show would be a lot better if went with the crisp, high contrast aesthetic a lot of Takeshi Koike works have.\\n\\n\r\nLastly sound which also unfortunately was a disappointment. RZA is credited for music which at first got me excited, I don't know much about his solo work but I've listened to WTC before and liked. Don't expect anything out of that however since the hip-hop beats are not only scarce most of them are far too basic and don't even fit what's happening on screen half the time. If you want a samurai anime with hip-hop aesthetic turn to Samurai Champloo instead cause score from Nujabes and Fat Jon are infinitely better.\\n\r\nSound effects on the other hand were pretty good I thought. The sound of Afro cutting through people, sword clangs, the weird distorted voices of the ninja robots, footsteps, and other sounds were largely satisfying or interesting. In particular I thought the sound work for the robo-afro was good enough to make him seem more than just a generic robot.\\n\r\nAlso english dub is about as bad as I think most would expect out of anime but Samuel L Jackson did a surprisingly decent work, especially with Ninja Ninja, out of entire cast his scripts and delivery felt natural.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it. If you want a good, stylish action movie you're better off with anything Koike made. If you want Samurais, Champloo and Sword of the Stranger seems like a better choice. Afro Samurai itself it rather average and easily forgettable.",

            "content": "Afro Samurai is a peculiar anime. An enjoyable, wild ride if there ever was one. At only 5 episodes it is does a lot with very little. \r\nThe story is that of a typical revenge story. There's also the subplot of the fight for the headbands to be the best of the world. They aren't too complex and are simply vehicles for the rest of the ridiculous and non sensical elements that follow the rest of the anime. \r\nThe show is full of action, every episode, from start to finish. The fight scenes are pretty nice, clean and crisp. They are a bit over thetop but it adds to the rest of the anime. It's all a little strange and some of the fighters and their weapons just come out of nowhere. Also, sometimes some of the fighters, such as Afro and some of the bosses he faces, are ridiculously OP. I mean, we have samurais, cowboys, Android bears, rocket launchers, the list goes on and on. \\n\\n\r\nWe get a bit of a backstory which is decent, but not entirely necessary for some of the anime. It is ridiculous enough to just accept the characters and the actions they take as they come. \\n\\n\r\nI forgot to mention Afro's conscious that lingers around as well. He's one of the high points. A nice comedic foil, considering the anime is quite serious, dark, mature, and outright gory. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are able to watch Afro for what it is, forgoing a deep coherent story and instead enjoying the ridiculous, action packed, gut busting side of it. It's sheer entertainment through and through. \\n\r\nIt's also one of the best dubbed anime out there. The voice acting is pretty nice and it all fits and doesn't feel out of place or cringe-worthy like most other dubs.",

But other than that, the idea was terribly cliche and i've seen it done better elsewhere.\r\nThe art style was utterly phenomenal. There are few anime that truly impressed me with the level of artistry. It was fluid, it was unique, and it captivated me. They way that the characters looked was gorgeous.\r\nThe soundtrack while not normally what i listen to (SeriousMetalhead here) It fit the overall feel of the piece. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty damn interesting for the most part. The main character was a bit stereotypical of the Samurai Vengence Super Swordsman type, but everyone else was pretty damn neat to me. Especially the Teddy Bear samurai and Justice. Oooh Justice was cool.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that I really enjoyed about this anime, something was off. I never could place my finger on it, but something failed to click with me in any cohesive way. It felt...rushed I suppose one could say. Something was missing. Maybe it could have stod to be a little longer, I dunno. It didn't feel right after all was said and done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a five simply because that feeling of incompleteness was so profound to me that it seemed to almost mar everything else about the series to me.

I watched it again at a later date and was very happy that I did. Afro Samurai is a new take on an old style, it shares many of the same qualities as Cowboy Bebop and Rurouni Kenshin. The art is spectacular and the colors while very dark are rich in quality, there is a small use of heavy 3D rendering towards the end of the show but it is well done and does not detract from the rest ofthe setting. The story line of Afro Samurai is mostly about build up, yet the conclusion is short and sweet (in a manner of speaking). It is well rounded in the end and leaves one with a bittersweet feeling of social angst and a touch of pride for the character.",

I kinda liked Afro Samurai because the whole 20 minutes of the anime they stayed on the story other than fillers and other stuffs. The story wasn't the best ever but for a small anime it was great. I gotta say that the action are off the hook. Through out the story all you see is is fights and lots of blood. The violence in this anime is off the chart, every second you will see someones head chopped off and blood spurting. I like when they have violence such as like Afro Samurai in animes. The music was also awesome, it had a hip pop kinda theme that went great with the anime. Every song was kinda fast and it would have been great if they could have put some melodies here and there.\\n\\n\r\nWell i think everybody should spare a few hours of there time to see the short 5 episodes. Its an awesome anime but watch out children it has a lots of violence and sexual content. I dont seriously recommend it but, I liked it and maybe you will too\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever since I first heard about this show I already knew there was a slim possibility of me liking it. Eventually I proved myself correct as I only got through three episodes before deciding it was not worth finishing. Don't get me wrong the animation of it is beautiful, but a show can't run on animation alone. As I watched the episodes I couldn't stop thinking it was a rip off wannabe of Samurai Champloo without the humor and great soundtrack. Samuel L Jackson will forever remain one of my favorite actors, and I do believe he did a good job voicing his characters, Ijust thought the storyline for this show could have been more then what it was. Endless blood, and killing people, and then some sex, thrown in with more killing people. All I can say is poor choices was made with this show. They could have done more and they dropped the ball.",

            "content": "Take a mental trip back in the day, well back in the day in the year 2001. Where were you and what were you doing that year? A lot of us were in high school, and knowing a lot of the inhabitants of this website middle school. I only bring that year up because that was the last time I watched any anime dubbed. Ever since Sakura Taisen dubbed, I've never let my ear be poisoned by horrible English voice acting. But Afro Samurai gives you no choice... oh and it has SAMUEL L JACKSON! \r\nAfro Samurai starts with a young Afro and his fatheratop a mountain. A mysterious stranger appears to challenge his father to a duel to the death. His reason? To obtain the #1 headband that Afro's father possesses. After a short duel, Afro sees his father decapitated in front of his eyes and the stranger take the headband. This sight puts only one thought into his mind... revenge. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire point of Afro Samurai is our main hero Afro heading back to that mountain to regain that headband and revenge for his father. Afro wears the #2 headband which allows him to be the only one that can challenge the #1, but the #2 is fair game to anyone who wants a shot. So Afro while trying to get to #1 must fight all comers as they try to take it over and give themselves a shot at being the best fighter in the world. What this means is lots of fighting and lots of blood. \\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai can be comparable to a Ninja Scroll for this generation of anime fans. It's got lots of action and lots of mindless violence to give you that pure feeling of bloodlust. It has the same kind of crazy cast of characters, the same inclusion of sex (just not AS graphic) and that main character that can only be described as a &quot;bad ass&quot;. Problem is... it's just kinda boring. The entire show consists of a fight between Afro and some kind of villanous character followed by a flashback showing Afro's upbringing, rinse and repeat. He eventually reaches the summit, wins his battle and that's game over. \\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai proves to be a love it or hate it show in the animation department. This is Gonzo Digimation so you can expect a high attention to detail and an overall great look. It has a certain feeling to it but it can prove to be distracting when the action gets hot and heavy as characters just become almost a bit too loose in their movements. Character designs on the whole are quite good but again remind me entirely too much of Ninja Scroll, just prettier. Afro's character exudes that pure sense of awesome in his dark complexion and smooth walk... well that and his gravity and weather defying hair. He can be inside a building where there is clearly no draft of any kind, and yet his headband will wave and wave. I know, it's anime that happens all the time, but still. \\n\\n\r\nReally the animation is hard to describe, judge for yourself.\\n\r\nAs I said before, SAMUEL L JACKSON! I'll be the first to admit that seeing that name on the front cover of anything makes me want to watch it. Snakes on a Plane anyone? Anyway Sam Jackson delivers all the types of lines you'd want to hear from him... such classics as &quot;What!? You got a mother f*%kin RPG in your backpack!?&quot; Or &quot;You's a crazy mother f*%ker&quot;. Problem is he never seems to shut up. Sam plays the part of Afro and his friend Ninja Ninja. Afro rarely says much but Ninja squared never stops blabbing throughout the entire show. He's always advising Afro to not fight and talking about &quot;hitting that&quot; and other various one liners. At first it's funny and overall kinda cool. \\n\\n\r\nMusic on the other hand are the best. No composer by the Nobuo or Yuki here, instead you get The Rza (WU-TANG FOREVER - THE BEST HIP-HOP Group). The Rza &quot;lays down his phat beats&quot;  for Afro Samurai and adds a nice feel to show. \\n\\n\r\nThis shows how much effort has been put into anime. EXCELLENT, the ultimate THE  BEST. 10/10",

            "content": "You know, knowing about this anime when I first discover it, I wasn\u2019t that exactly knowledgeable of much anime as this was the time I was pretty much limited to TV via Cartoon Network on Toonami and Adult Swim when it came to anime but once seeing a preview of it, knowing that it\u2019s going to air on SPIKE TV, who was\u2026\u2026.um\u2026\u2026.well, some shows. (Yeah, I don\u2019t watch that network that much anymore) but that was the time when I was still much a teenager and now that I\u2019m in my early 20s, I wonder if this show still holds up to today.\r\nBut are allthe origins of the show and where it\u2019s from?\\n\\n\r\nIt is originally a seinen dojinshi manga series by Takashi Okazaki, in which the artist has a love for soul and hip hop music, which like many people said about anime is that while American artists do have some inspiration from anime, sometimes the Japanese does have a bit of our influences in their material and for this time around, it\u2019s hip hop and I love hip hop and I love the usage of it being more creative in a style like this rather than a gimmick to sell to audiences as this is an anime directly hand-made for the American audience.\\n\\n\r\nOn the dark path of swordsmanship in a \"futuristic\" yet feudal Japan, it is said that the one who becomes the No. 1 warrior will rule the world with powers akin to a god. Only the No. 2 warrior is allowed to challenge the No. 1, but anyone can challenge the No. 2. The current No. 2, the Afro Samurai, travels the road looking for revenge on Justice, the man who murdered his father (who was then the No. 1) in front of him when he was just a boy, a skilled gunman who became the current No. 1 after defeating Afro's father.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the plot outline out of the way, you know that I love a good revenge storyline and that\u2019s the overall theme for the character of Afro. The reason why Afro hunts for these headbands\u2026..he didn\u2019t care about the power or the fear of others or the respect of it. He was haunted by his father\u2019s death at the hands of Justice and that was his only motive to hunt down Justice,  even though he managed to break some friendships he made in his past and judging by the way it went, I\u2019m not surprised that one of his former buddies want to end him and I completely understand it.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it mean I like Afro any less of a character?\\n\\n\r\nNo, not really? Yes, Afro is a character with some fucked-up tendencies about him but you can\u2019t argue the fact that Afro can kick some ass and I love seeing him in action, kicking some ninja/samurai ass all around but thankfully, he isn\u2019t some god-like fighter as he even struggles with some fights, thus making them more exciting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nPlus, this is one of the few leads in an anime where the lead character is African-American and I like that they portrayed him well and not in an embarrassing, coonish way that make you want to facepalm. Also, he is a silent-type stealth character \u2013 another trait that I like in a character because it means their actions are far more important and meaningful than just talking your ass out about something that can be pointed out in less than a second.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s Ninja Ninja and no, I\u2019m not annoyed by the presence of him because he actually provides some good humor into the show and it does balance out the tragic aspects and the action scenes, so it doesn\u2019t feel too awkward and out of place. I don\u2019t get how people are annoyed by him considering he is about as important to the character of Afro.\\n\r\nJinno (or as he called Kuma), I really do feel for this character\u2019s motivation for wanting to take down Afro. He might sound a bit clich\u00e9 with the whole \u201cyou killed my master\u201d shtick but when that and your whole class died (with one of whom isn\u2019t entirely dead) from being cutted down, you wouldn\u2019t take that lightly. Otsuru (or Okiku) is one character that does have some focus on her having a crush on Afro but I feel that she was shafted early on in the start of the series, although I could see if the opposite of that would\u2019ve happened, it could have made some more major problems than what we got.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, the Empty 7 Clan are just some secondary villains to Justice, the main antagonist prize and while he only shows up in the beginning and the end of the show, he is still more of a threat than them as the Empty 7 Clan just wanted the #2 headband for themselves. They want that for power and yet they were so full of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the animation. Yes, GONZO was in charge of the animation here and knowing its reputation and what people say about their style and as for how they\u2019re done in the show, it is actually fitting and very appropriate from the dark atmosphere, the harsh surroundings and the desolate dystopian and futuristic setting. Also, the action and fight scenes were just downright amazing in my eyes and if you happen to be squeamish, you might want to think twice before watching because there is a lot of blood and gore. Possibly my favorite fight scene of the series is the final showdown between Afro and the Afro Droid. Maybe it may not look fancy or shiny but it\u2019s definitely something worth noticing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music\u2026\u2026(yeah, this is the part where I show my fanboyism)\u2026.If you don\u2019t know much about me, I am a big fan of the Wu-Tang Clan but more specifically, the producer behind it, Robert Diggs aka The RZA and I\u2019ll say that the score and soundtrack is fucking excellent but not because it just uses hip-hop in a show and it\u2019s done right but he does take on more musical genre influences such as spaghetti-western style music to the funk fight-showdown style music to some traditional samurai/martial arts music. The point is, the music does explore a few genres fitting into the series and I appreciate that fact. The opening theme is just 30 seconds long and while it\u2019s good, I wish I had more to listen to but the rest of the soundtrack got tracks I really got love for, mostly the song \u201cFury in My Eyes/Revenge\u201d with the RZA and Thea van seijen, whom often is a go-to singer/vocalist for anything RZA or Wu-Tang related but yeah, this is that song that goes with the tone of who Afro is as a character and the choices that he made throughout his life.\\n\\n\r\nOh, the English dub\u2026\u2026actually, no, it\u2019s the only version because there is no Japanese voice-acting on this and this is a dub-only title (and this is actually very rare considering there is a lot of sub-only anime on the market so this is quite fair) and not only that, this is quite the star-studded cast of either well-known actors and voice actors, even ones that don\u2019t be in a lot of anime productions, but then again, this is a Studiopolis production and FUNimation is the one distributing it, instead of using their own people. Let\u2019s start with but who else but SAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKSON!!!! Yes, for doing dual roles as both Afro and Ninja Ninja, I say that he delivers a great performance from both, especially for characters with different traits; Afro being the silent one and Ninja Ninja being the talkative one. Ron Perlman was great as Justice, Kelly Hu did a decent job with her being Okiku although Tara Strong as Otsuru was actually a better effort. Yuri Lowenthal as Jinno did put a great performance as well and others such as Phil Lamarr, T.C. Carson, John DiMaggio and even small appearances by Grey DeLisle, Steve Blum, Liam O\u2019 Brien & Greg Eagles was also well-acted.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This anime, to me, feels like it\u2019s made for a person like me, wanting to cross two genres that may seem a weird fit but in the end, it does work well.  When people say this is Samurai Champloo mixed with The Boondocks, it does draw much of an interest in me. It feeds within the anime fan of me, the action fan in me, the samurai/martial arts fan in me, and also the hip hop side of me as well. I can\u2019t say for others if they\u2019ll like it but the thing is, the show isn\u2019t some perfect work of art but it\u2019s downright over-the-top and enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "(Reviewing the dub because I cannot imagine watching this subbed)\r\nAfro Samurai is one of those shows where the concept and production is so good that you want to love it, but the execution just doesn't live up to its promises.\r\nIt's still enjoyable for what it is. The sound track is amazing, the art work is gorgeous, the animation references classics like Ninja Scroll while still being fresh and fluid, but don't expect any deep character development or innovations in storytelling. Our protagonist is the strong silent type taken to the absolute extreme (like everything else) and all emotions and human elements come in the formof flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai s basically a blacksploitation film, but without the social sensibilities of Spike Lee or Gordon Parks. It's what would happen if you gave Shaft a tragic revenge story, took away all his lines, and dropped him in distopian Meiji era-future Japan.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked: \\n\\n\r\nIt was awesome to see black characters staring in anime, and I loved that it was pointed out they they were different than all the Japanese characters around them. With Samual L. Jackson playing Samurai and his loud companion Ninja Ninja, the blackspoitation angle worked without being racist. I could not imagine watching this subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe world was really cool. It was like Seven Samurai and Rurouni Kenshin met Cowboy Bebop. The mix of Old Japan and cyber punk worked and there were definite rules to the technology.\\n\\n\r\nA few really interesting villains. One even had a teddy bear head!\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was all around great. I've already mention Jackson, but the leader of an evil syndicate sounded like and evangelist preacher and it was PERFECT. And OH MY GOD RON PEARLMAN IS AN EVIL VAMPIRE GUNSLINGER.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were good. There were  A LOT of them though and after a while it felt more like a video game than TV show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't work: \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many references (Kurosawa films, classic anime, 70's cinema, the Terminator) that it some times got in the way of what was actually happening on screen. There are only five episodes, not enough time for all that.\\n\\n\r\nThe lone named female character was woefully cliche and died right after sex in another terrible cliche. Not exactly a feminist show.\\n\\n\r\nThere are almost too many fights (and I love fight scenes). \\n\\n\r\nUltimately: \\n\\n\r\nThe show could have benefited from a few more episodes to help the pacing, but I'm not sure Samurai's character could have carried any more.\\n\\n\r\nYou should give it a watch if you like things like both Samurai Champloo and Pulp Fiction. Sit back, brace yourself for the blood and enjoy the ride. Just don't think too much about it.",

            "content": "Well, first review. Just for fun. Just finished afro samurai. Here we go.\r\nThe STORY is about a guy named afro who seeks revenge for his father and never doubts to clean away every obstacle that comes in his way. So, It seems like a  pretty basic samuraianime but for me It\u00b4s a weird mix of disturbing voice acting, colorful characters and bloody fighting scenes. And I love It!\r\n... Well, I dont love the VOICE ACTING but I gotta say It was todely fine even though I mostly cant stand english voices for an anime. It was disturbing in this case too apart from thestars samuel l jackson and ron perlman that were just splendid.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime only has 5 EPISODES and that becomes important when were coming to the CHARACTERS. I cant avoid to think that the work characters is something that Takashi Okazaki had a really good start with but never was allowed to make complete because of the few episodes. But on the bright side of life its really impressive how effective they are building up the characters with FLASHBACKS and stuff. I would actually bet on that its more flashbacks then its ''present''. The flashbacks are not cheesy and boring... They are .. kind of cheesy and actually makes a point in the anime. A bigger point than just to fill some holes in the story.\\n\r\nBut this applies mostly to the ''good guys''. When It comes to the ''VILLAINS''  you will dind lots of unnecessary characters that just exist and doesnt even have a story... Ye, I know, its too short to make storys to all the people but why do you have to include these guys then. They are just ruining everything. Another thing that you could skip is all the freaky machines n' stuff the bad guys are using.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is skipped is the crap. And this is at least one advantage with a short anime. For example in Samurai Champloo (26 episodes) you will have lots of episodes that doesnt take you anywhere in the story (no offense... at all!). In Afro Samurai you will see it pointing right towards the goal, which is Afros revenge. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai Champloo is actually a good comparison. They both have smart and not too messy FIGHTING scenes with good angles. Afro Samurai definetely has a lot of more blood and exaggerated sword slices though.\\n\r\nThey both have the HIPHOP-MUSIC. The music in Afro (by the RZA) may not be as original as champloos but It's really, really great anyways.\\n\r\nIf youre looking for HUMOUR, champloo is a better choice. Afro is actually kind of heavy even if they have some characters that can give you a fellgood-vibe for a second or two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 of 10. But maybe I cant understand the true nature of the anime without having an awsomely large AFRO. You decide!",

Its story is sub-par but really the only reason you watch it is to follow this bad-ass dude, \"Afro\" and watch him slice people into bits. Its very entertaining and a good use of wasting a couple hours; its visually nice nothing spectacular but the voices are amazing, can't forget Samuel L. Jackson. This has to be watched Dubbed. Overall this Anime is pretty good I give it an 8 and a recommendation to anyone into gore.",

            "content": "Hello and Welcome to TheMediaHoundsShow, I'm Andrew and today we are going to finally start the first Anime Review of the channel!!\r\nAlthough first things are first, this video will contain Spoilers. If you don't want this show to be spoiled on you, leave the video... Also I want to point out that this Anime is rated 18+ as there is a gore and some adult themes within the Anime, so anyone under 18 you have been warned.\r\nThe Anime that we will be reviewing today is none other than \"Afro Samurai!\". A heavily Action, based Anime with a lot of sword fighting and violence.\r\nThe Manga Artistbehind the D\u014djinshi \"Afro Samurai!\" series was Takashi Okazaki!\\n\\n\r\nThe Company that made the Anime are Studio Gonzo. Studio Gonzo is a Japanese animation Studio that was owned by its corporate parent the GDH Group. Studio Gonzo are also well known for releasing other Anime's such as \"Rosario & Vampire!\" and \"Gantz!\"\\n\\n\r\nAs well as many Anime's, they also released many Video Games such as \"Street Fighter VI!\", \"BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger!\" and \"BlazBlue: Continuum Shift!\"\\n\r\nIn the late of 2008 - 2009, the Studio Gonzo eventually got overcome by financial problems and stated its deficit was estimated over 30 million dollars. That's Quite a lot!!\\n\\n\r\nOnly having 5 episodes in the Anime series Studio Gonzo tells the Story of a Samurai with an Afro played by Samuel L Jackson. \\n\r\nOn the dark path of swordsmanship in a \"Futuristic\" yet Feudal Japan, it is said that the one who becomes No.1 will rule the world. But the only rule in this world is that only the No. 2 is allowed to fight the No. 1. The No. 2, the Afro Samurai, travels the road looking for revenge on the man who murdered his father in front of him when he was just a boy, a three-armed gunman who is the lord of the dark swordsman's road and the current No. 1.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai was a Self-funded D\u014djinshi, brought out 1999, releasing 10 chapters within 2 volumes. The Anime follows the Manga series somewhat but ends before the Manga. The Manga's story continues on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Main characters to this Anime are \"Afro The Afro Samurai\" and \"Ninja-Ninja!\" Played by none other than the legend that is Samuel L Jackson. \\n\r\nOther Characters in the series are \"Kuma/Jinno!\" his sister \"Sio!\" who only appeared in \"Afro Samurai: Resurrection!\" & \"Rokutaro!\" The father of Afro!\\n\r\nThe antagonists in this series are \"Brother 1, Brother 2, Brother 3, Brother 4, Brother 5 & Brother 6!\" and The main antagonist \"Justice!\"\\n\\n\r\nMy Favorite Characters to this Anime series was Afro and Ninja-Ninja both played by Samuel L Jackson. I loved how different these two characters were from each other and yet they worked well together. Ninja-Ninja had his sadistic moments, with his clever unique jokes whereas Afro was calm, cool, cruel and collective letting things pass by without phasing him.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this Anime is very unique; The album was produced by RZA of the Wu Tang Clan, and features big names such as Big Daddy Kane, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, and GZA.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the Anime was excellent, it had a great story and the action really draws you in and engrosses you in it. There is plenty of Action, Blood, Comedy, Fighting & Violence in the Anime from people being cut up til Ninja-Ninja and his hilarious endeavours.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problems that I found with the Anime, was that there wasn't enough episodes to really get into it, it tried really hard to convey so many hidden messages throughout the series such as \"violence only creates more violence\", but then maybe I am being to critical as this message is easily overlooked.\\n\r\nThere was also a Video Game brought out based on the Afro Samurai Anime, with a slight retelling brought out on the Xbox 360 and PS3. It was developed by Namco Bandai Games.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime had a good OST but the Video Game OST was by far better and stranger...\\n\\n\r\nI rate this Anime 4/5, it was a great Anime, had an amazing dark twisted story, amazing soundtrack, the main characters are awesome, good voice acting and what I felt let it down slightly was because it was so short, if they had of made it maybe 12 episodes rather than 5 they might of been able to build up the characters better. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this Anime to anyone who is interested in dark stories, Samurai's and action filled Anime's! Overall though, I enjoyed the show, and recommend it for any fans of action flicks.\\n\r\nWell guys, that's it for this Anime Review, hope you liked it.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a Comment, like the video or Subscribe to our channel, this has been Andrew from TheMediaHoundsShow Stay Tuned\\n\r\nDon't forget to check us out on our Facebook page, Twitter Account, Google+ and Deviant Art.

            "content": "I was actually really looking forward to watching this series because it's very atypical most of the other animes i've seen and im not entirely sure what i was expecting but im not sure if i felt satisfied with the series\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nthere actually is no plot. the main character, afro samurai (known as just afro) is on a quest to become the number 1 samurai and avenge his father's death and kill the main antagonist, Jutsice (who's number 1). thats it really. they do include afro's backstory which actually IS really interesting and very dynamic and dense. it was interesting to see how this kidbecame a harden killer.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nthe animation actually is very very well done. everything was pretty fluid and the fight scenes were entertaining and beautiful to watch. im not so scary about the art style as much but it wasn't ugly. the color palate chosen really intensified the barren landscape and the overall feeling of emptiness \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nthe music kinda reminded me of samurai champloo with those hip hop vibes. i actually really enjoyed the intro song. helps form the tone of the anime right from the start. Samuel L. Jackson is a great voice actor, he did an amazing job doing ninja ninja and afro. i cant really say the same for all of the other characters. it sounded like they were just straight up reading the script with no life behind their voices.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7\\n\r\nthe anime is short so there really isnt much time for character development per say, however the back story really helped the audience see how far the characters have come. Geno was one of my favorite characters because of the changes made from the past to present. he was such a complex character for not really being shown in the present for too long. afro is also a very deep character, whose story is portrayed beautifully with the help of the back story, the producers did a good job. the villains on the other hand, weren't so great. they were very superficial, dry and stereotypical. they were just a bundle of pure evil with no real rhyme or reason. a little disappointing\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\r\ntheres something missing to this series and its frustrating because i cant really put my finger on whats missing exactly. i didnt hate the series i just wasnt wowed by any one aspect of it as much as i thought i was going to. i suppose the series just wasnt for me. it was entertaining dont get me wrong but i just felt like it was just lacking in something. it might have been the voice acting that really put a damper on the dramatic parts of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n-plot is very basic. a common revenge plot, nothing new\\n\r\n-animation was amazing. not crazy about the style.  the color palate really help make for a feeling of emptiness, sadness and fastness  \\n\r\n-music was on point\\n\r\n-geno and afro were awesome characters with great development. ninja ninja was annoying but necessary for comic relief. villains had no depth to them.\\n\r\n-voice acting overall could have used some more direction and energy. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great though\\n\r\n-not for those of the weak of heart. a lot of blood, gore, fighting. theres a sex scene there as well\\n\r\n-a good anime if youre in between stuff because it's short",

            "content": "The show is Quentin Tarantino gone Anime. Afro Samurai is a show that doesn't boast a great story or character but gets by simply on its excellent animation and soundtrack.\r\nThe theme of the show in a word is \"Revenge\" you combine that with a Ronin element and basically you have the ingredients for a time-tested winning formula. The story never gets complicated (doesn't need to) or boring (with all the blood n guts how could it?) and that is because of the crisp animation style and fast-paced action sequences.\r\nThe voice acting is also top notch, with Samuel L Jackson doing a good job as thebrooding Afro and a spectacular job as his eccentric conscience. The villains in the show really make watching it worthwhile because while the hero is straight out of every western revenge flick ever made, the villains are original and their characteristics are entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a fun ride for the 5 episodes.",

I really have no complaints with it since it's the right anime to watch when looking for a good bloodfest. \r\nAlthough you may see some reviews \"praising\" its story, don't be fooled. Afro Samurai pretty much follows a pretty simple story and plot; Revenge. don't believe any reviews you may see that say that\"Afro Samurai is the beautifully tragic story of a little boy who after witnessing a tragedy, must find the strength to blah blah blah in this heart-moving  show about blah yadda blah\" or something along those lines. All it really is is ashow about one guy, one sword, and his ambitious journey for blood, all in 5 episodes. This anime, under no circumstances must be watched for it's \"beautiful story\", because quite frankly, there is none. This anime is meant to be watched on a slow, relaxing day, with a bud or two, and watch a bunch of samurais kick ass or be killed in some of the most fascinating ways a person can be slayed  down with a sword.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you do decide to watch, just remember; This show is pretty much Kill Bill, just take out the story, any real character development, change the gender, and all outside color from the main character and you got yourself AFRO SAMURAI \\n\r\nEnjoy kiddies,\\n\r\n~~~Dan, a.k.a Cozzix",

            "content": "The story is quite simple, poor, with not-so-deep characters and a predictable course of events. But that's not the point here.\r\n The overall premise of this anime is to amaze you with amazing fights, with a badass style and great soundtracks, not with a great storyline and deep quotes.\r\nAfro Samurai is a 5 episode anime, produced by Studio Gonzo, with the collaboration of Samuel L. Jackson and OSTs by Wu-Tang Clan.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI gave the story this score because it's really a poorly made story. It deals with a boy (Afro) who watched his father die. His father possessed the \"Number One\" headband, that it wassaid it could grant godlike powers. The only way to obtain the \"Number One\" headband, is to defeat the wearer in a battle. However, the only one who can fight the Number 1 and claim his headband is the Number 2. Everyone can fight the Number 2, and after growing up, Afro is the current wearer of that headband. His only will is to defeat the one who killed his father. He's acting for revenge.\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple, but as I said, you shouldnt watch this anime for his story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf with \"Art\" you mean also the animations, then my score should be 10/10. Drawings really are amazing, starting from the main character's style and ending with every single enemy.\\n\r\nAnimations are next level, never seen such beautiful fighting scenes, the beauty behind every single hit is overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNot only the osts fit perfectly with the anime style and fighting scenes, but also the sound fx were truly accurate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's personalities aren't really original, i gave them 7 out of 10 because their desing were unique enough to let me love one of two of them (Jinno <3 )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story wasn't nothing great and character's personalities weren't nothing special, this anime managed to enjoy me a lot. The amazing combat scenes, the gory yet beautiful art style, the perfect OSTs, all of those features managed to let me love this 5 episodes anime, and give it an overall score of 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you wanna see amazing and well-done fights, and you can get over the plot, then you should definitely give this anime a try.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, English isn't my native language so sorry if you found any error.",

It's just a very enjoyable show to watch and I've admittedly rewatched it twice. I honestly found the story very intriguing and I loved all the characters that came and went along the way. Ninja Ninja was undoubtedly the favorite, though. He's such a great comic relief for all the blood, gore, and dark stuff to come. He really does tie the show together and make it so rewatchable. I feel sorry for the people thatdidn't enjoy the show, because my personal experience with it was a really fun time. 10/10 would watch again again again.",

The hero, in turn, seeks righteous revenge against the antagonist. It\u2019s a time tested tale, and has been recycled over and over again in countless martial arts films, novels old and new, and a few notable 80\u2019s anime. The series\u2019 creator Takashi Okazaki uses this trustworthy archetype as thebones that he fleshes the rest of the series around. The world of Afro Samurai is actually a collision of worlds and cultures- the core of it is hip-hop and samurai, and there\u2018s a dash of the post-apocalyptic here, a lot of mad and fantastic machinery is running loose, and only a blind man would miss the Akira homage planted square on the noggin of one character- but it is the revenge story that acts as the simple, accessible crux that keeps the whole potpourri together.\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai has a lot going for it: Samuel L. Jackson, samurai, Samuel L. Jackson, slickly animated fights, Samuel L. Jackson, a seamless blend of post-apocalyptic sci-fi with hip-hop aesthetics, and a kickin\u2019 soundtrack by the RZA. Oh, and did I mention it has Samuel L. Jackson? I\u2019ll admit it: I was stoked at the idea of one of my favorite live-action actors being a voice actor in an anime. Though, I was sorely disappointed because Jackson, as the voice behind the title character, didn\u2019t get any more than twenty words in the whole series. It seemed cheap and gimmicky, since Jackson was the Big Name that attracted a lot of attention to this series, hyping Afro Samurai above every other action release this year before it even premiered on Spike. Regardless, the entire vocal cast of Afro Samurai is superb, even without Mr. Jackson\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the show, and recommend it for any fans of action flicks. You can watch the whole series where I watched it, at [www.watchafrosamurai.com].\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9/10. Great show. \\n",

I'm not a fan of dubbed things, but I do love Samurai stories, plus, it's short so I thought it would be worth a short to just try it. I'm really glad I did. \r\nStory-6: The plot is fairly (very) straight-forward. If you're into revenge-based plots with a lot of gore, you'll enjoy this storyline. If you're looking for anything deeper, you should probably look elsewhere. \r\nArt-9: The art is gorgeous, very muted, stylistic, reminiscent of Boondocks and perfect for the show. \r\nSound-7: I thought the dubbing was actually great, and the background music appropriate.There wasn't much special about the soundtrack though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7: They were fairly flat, but I really enjoy backstories and this is chock-full of backstory. Also the guy that follows Afro around is pretty funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8: I'm picky about anime and I get bored often, but this one gripped me. I think it's because it's so short I didn't feel there was any filler that made the story drag, and I really appreciated that.",

            "content": "This is easily my favorite anime of all time. It's a perfect storm of all the things I like about anime, westerns, and action movies, without any of the things I don't like. It's basically what would happen if Quentin Tarantino made an anime, complete with the obligatory Samuel L. Jackson. \r\nI'd say the only weak point is the story, which honestly is not that much of a weak point. Overall it's pretty damn generic. It's the same plot from every western/samurai movie ever made, but it's done really well. Tone and atmosphere are two things that I don't think are discussed nearly enough whentalking about anime, but they're probably the most important factors for me in deciding between a good show and a great show. The tone of this show is exactly what I'm looking for in an action anime, dark and somber without trying too hard and just being edgy. The art, sound, and pacing create a very enveloping, atmospheric, world to get lost in. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is phenomenal. It's expressive and it flows. All of the character designs are unique and interesting and they have their own personalities. The colors are dark and muted which creates a bleak and depressing world to match the somber tone of the show. Even at points when the story is bogged down by just hitting the necessary story beats of a western/samurai movie, the animation and choreography keep the show engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely one of the better ones out there. Even for someone who is not the biggest fan of hip-hop. It all fits with the show incredibly well and effectively sets the tone and mood for each scene. It's engaging and enjoyable enough that you never just tune it out and forget it's there, but it never distracts from what's going on in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show pretty much all fit snuggly into an archetype of the western/samurai movie/hero's journey but, just like the story, they're exceptionally executed. Each character is given exactly the amount of backstory or development needed to make them effective at they're role. They each have depth and and internally consistent logic driving them. Nothing they do ever feels unmotivated or out of character. You can really grasp what drives them and why, without being told.\\n\\n\r\nAll this would still count for nothing if it were a boring show though. Ultimately, it's all going to come down to personal taste, and as I said in the beginning Afro Samurai has everything I like and nothing I don't. There's a reason this is the only anime I own physically, and It's because I have no problem watching it over and over again (also because it's one of the few anime I don't have to be embarrassed about owning). This has all of the over the top action and gore I crave from an action show without trying too hard and just being edgy. The action scenes are exciting and engaging. I never get tired of the fountains of blood or severed limbs. The dialog is great, and has the absolute best dub of all time. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of action movies, or westerns, or samurai movies, or all of the above at the same time, Afro Samurai will probably be one of the best rides of your life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 severed heads out of 10.",

This anime may have been short, but the beginning told me in my gut that this is JACKPOT!!!! And the voice acting was off the chain with Samuel L. Jackson in the front lines. I would consider him as one of the best actors of his generation. With him on that roster, its not gonna getbetter than this.\\n\\n\r\nShould I recommend you getting this?

There is little character development and the assumed pay-off of this short adventure feels less epic and exciting than the writers intended I believe. \r\nAs I finished the show, I felt that 5 episodes was too consice to fulfill the potential the series had.

            "content": "The collision of Eastern and Western styles in an anime is one that has been often tried, yet rarely has it succeeded. Can this five-part anime series prove to be a success? \r\nSTORY\r\nThe story centers around a man named Afro (full points for originality there). The basic premise for the series is that, at a young age, Afro witnessed his father being killed (rather brutally) in front of him for a headband. This wasn't simply some stylish headband that people would (literally) kill for, it had a meaning. That meaning was that, whoever possessed the number 1 headband would, officially, be the number 1 assassinin, urm, Japan I assume. Though this is set in a post apocalyptic world there is very little if any back story as to why the world is in such a bad state. \\n\r\n    After his father is killed the headband is taken by another man, Justice, who then tells Afro that, when he grows up, he can challenge him for it if he feels up to it. Suffice to say Afro trains for years and the series deals with his journey as he is finally ready and skilled enough to avenge his father. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nPut simply it's stunning. There is, however, one warning: If you don't like gore this is definitely not the anime for you. One thing this anime can pride itself on is it's in-depth portrayal of blood and gore. The series in general is very stylized, it's all rather dark and the characters are all drawn in an odd-ish way, that lends to the show's character rather than making the people look weird. All in all it looks amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is very much Western, having a heavy emphasis on hip-hop that the creator himself said he had a large interest in. The music for the series is all made and mixed by The RZA, former member of the Wuu Tang Klan, and it definitely brings some character into it. This doesn't mean, though, that the music is entirely Western. It also includes traditional Japanese music with instruments such as the shamisen and others making an appearance in the music, which is deftly made as a mixture of Western and Eastern.\\n\r\n    The voice acting is superb. There is, contrary to many people's belief, no actual Japanese track. This was originally made in the English language, as such many claims of it being \"a great dub\" are moot, as if there is, somewhere, a Japanese track then that would be the dub. The creator of the series said that he was a large fan of Samuel L. Jackson, and as such wanted him to voice Afro and his companion, Ninja Ninja. Though, despite such a stellar voice actor, Afro himself says very little. This is partly due to his mysterious character. Though this is all countered for by Ninja Ninja, his somewhat hyperactive companion, who essentially acts as Afro's inner thoughts spoken aloud. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe show has a very unique character. It brings with it a sense of the collision between East and West, with monks, shrine and traditional Japanese houses set to hip-hop, with many people wearing modern, Western clothing and the monks featured even speak like Christian preachers from the Deep South. All in all it's a character that hasn't been truly seen before in anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAs stated above, if violence and gore isn't your thing stay away from this anime. However, if it is you'll truly get a kick out of how gruesome it can be, especially at certain times. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nOverall if you're looking for a chilled-out, peaceful, happy anime then go elsewhere. If you're looking for a well-made world with genuinely interesting characters, even if it's all slightly depressing, and some non-stop action and a rather interesting story then Afro Samurai is a must. Plus, in total, it'll take you about 2 hours to watch, so even if you're not sure, watch at least one episode and see how you feel. Personally speaking I give it a 10/10.",

The music was fantastic; fit the mood perfectly and was just a pleasure to listen to. With 5 episodes, you'd think the characters would either have little to no personality or have an incredibly rushed back story. Nope. The animation is some of the bestI've seen period. It just had this flow to it that I have never seen anywhere else. The style was quite different from the usual anime as well. All in all, this is perfection; a must see.",

It's just revenge.\"\r\nThe brainchild of mangaka Takashi Okazaki, Afro Samurai follows the adventures of the aptly named Afro, a samurai who devotes his life to avenging his father's murder.\r\nThe series is a High Concept anime that reflects Mr. Okazaki's love of hip-hop and American culture. And what could represent American culture more than Samuel L. Jackson? Well, a lot of things, actually, but I won't complain. Mr. Jackson actually does pretty well in this series, voicing both the protagonist Afro and his jive-talking sidekick, Ninja Ninja. [spoiler]This is a bitof Fridge Brilliance when you realize that Ninja is a manifestation of Afro's desire to end his bloody campaign against Justice.[/spoiler] And Jackson manages to make two distinct voices for both characters (although Ninja Ninja is very obviously Jackson's normal speaking voice). The rest of the voice acting is decent. There is some excellent work by the great Ron FUCKING Perlman, as always. Although Tara Strong tries too hard to have a Japanese accent. The dialogue is stylistically similar to The Boondocks, and before anyone claims that most of the cast's jive-talk is racist, let me tell you that people (even white ones) do indeed talk like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is an interesting Anachronism Stew where swords and bows are still in use, but modern inventions such as cell phones and RPGs (the weapon kind) are also evident. The plot is very straight-forward. The Big Bad kills Afro's father, then Afro learns to swordfight so he can get revenge. It seems heavily reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino flick, and is about just as emotionally engaging. However, there are some subtleties to it, such as Ninja Ninja's character and Jinno's double standards. But all of this is put on the backburner for the fights. The fights are ultra-violent and stylized, but have this odd, surreal aspect where you simultaneously know and don't know what's going on. The fights are criminally short, however, with a few exceptions (such as the fight with the Afrobot), which largely takes away from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the show's number one flaw: the pacing. It is WAY too fast. This is undoubtedly due to its five-episode length, but still. FLCL managed to get an unrushed narrative out in six, and even one more episode would have done a world of good for \"Samurai\". For god's sake, the last episode features a fight with Afro's Rival Turned Evil (although the \"evil\" aspect is YMMV), the Big Bad's A God Am I speech, and the Climactic Battle between said Big Bad. In 20 minutes. It's too much to ask, and it makes the show seem somewhat schizophrenic. \\n\\n\r\nSummary - With stylish, violent fight scenes and an enjoyable, if simple storyline, Afro Samurai is a decent, if flawed, series. You could spend five episode's time much worse.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nPlot/Writing: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 8/10",

            "content": "Going into this show, I thought it was going to be much like Samurai Champloo with rap and hip hop during the Edo period of time. I was definitely mistaken by that idea as this seems to be set in a post apocalyptic world where both technology and samurai values are intermixed. This follows a black samurai as he seeks revenge for his father\u2019s murder. Sadly, there is a lot of stereotypical depictions of black people as almost all of them have Afros and and the ninja that follows him talks in a rather gangster style. \r\nI feel rather odd watching this seeing as howit should be feudal Japan in look and feel, yet not at the same time. It throws me off when just as I get comfortable in my surroundings, I see a large robot or something off in the background, people have flip phones(why they have flip phones is another question I would love to be answered), and even one character fights with a RPG for crying out loud! I guess it would explain why there are so many different people with different styles of fighting, some with guns and others with swords, but here is the small problem. They talk about how the legendary headband is supposed to be worn by a great warrior, but what honor of a warrior do you have when your shooting RPGs at someone with just a katana? Answer; there really is no honor I think. People want to become the \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018number one\u2019 by any means necessary and for some reason, which means that they will do anything at all to get number two. Why not just go after number one if they are going to do cheater moves like that?\\n\\n\r\nShall we talk about the Characters now? There are not very many to talk about as there are really only 2 main characters and a lot of side characters to go through. We will start with Afro, the silent strong type. Alright, so this isn\u2019t a dating sim but he really is very quite. When we get some backstory on Afro, it shows that he was a very silent child as well; he only spoke when he actually wanted to. There really is not much about him except he is a skilled samurai and he is a very silent and caring person when he gets a chance to relax which is not many times. \\n\\n\r\nNow talking about him, I also have to talk about Ninja (they really don\u2019t give him an actual name). There are many things you can debate about this character. Some may call him a different character, following Afro around and watching from the sidelines in order to see where his story will play out. I like the later idea that he is sort of the Hyde to Afro\u2019s Jekyll. He is overly loud and talks with a lot of slang, not really what you would expect of a ninja. The only thing that links him as a ninja is how extremely agile he is and how other people never seem to end up seeing him or acknowledging he exists. The reason I think that he is actually in his mind is because even when he is loud, no one acknowledge him. He is never in any danger while hanging around Afro like everyone else. Ninja seems to be the one that pretty much says anything that Afro will not say himself, whatever he actually thinks or doubts. Of course, Afro doesn\u2019t really listen to him, telling him to shut up sometimes like what some people would do if the little voice in their head is trying to tell them something that they don\u2019t like. I also think in a way, he may be the only one keeping Afro sane to a point where he keeps going on no matter the cost. Ninja also seems to be the comedy that brakes up what would be a very dull or boring anime sometimes during the standby phases.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other characters that seem to be a main staple of this show are the odd monks who keep calling each other brother. They are monks but each one has a different virtue to them like one would always be shown with headphones, the leader would have women with him all the time and so on. They talk like a stereotypical black priest with a lot of soul in their voice but in actuality, they are pretty much very white with strange heads. I guess you could call them whites who want to be black in a way\u2026 not that I have any problem with that. That\u2019s just the stereotype that I see here.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really high detailed and can be very beautiful in this sort of abstract way. Gonzo was the studio that drew it and it shows as many of the tropes that they are known for show in this. Sometimes there is awesome artwork that is high detailed and fluid, and then there are a couple movements that I would consider the runny egg design. The later is not enough that it would harm the show. The movement of the characters is so fast that you can\u2019t really tell if the characters are keeping proportions but I do notice that there are some times Afro\u2019s Afro and some of the fabric that trails off in the wind changes size. It is also very dark, making it sometimes hard to see what is going on; a lot of it is thrown into shadows near dusk or at night.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the voice actors are pretty good in the English dub (Couldn\u2019t find the Japanese dub) and then some of them feel very out of place. It\u2019s hard to say anything about Afro since he doesn\u2019t talk very often, although when he does speak, it\u2019s to the point and rather good. I actually liked the idea of Samuel L. Jackson (yes, The Samuel L. Jackson) playing him even if his voice seems a tad to deep once in a while. On the other side, Ninja is a rather interesting voice, also done by Samuel as well which adds to the point I made before about him being the Hyde to Afro\u2019s Jekyll. It surprises me that Samuel was able to play both characters rather well even if they have different personalities. The monks caught me off a bit when they first started talking and even after they just didn\u2019t feel like they fit in all the way. The background characters are really forgettable in voice and in character personality. The music is actually pretty good with a little bit of hip hop feel in the opening and closing song. The rest of the music though is always in the background and don\u2019t really stand out. Lots of times, you can barely hear it over the sound of the wind and fights.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn\u2019t really into this show, it does have some interesting aspects to the ideas and concept. It was alright though not something I am really into.",

It was refreshing to once again see a fusion of the east and west, old and new, after Samurai Champloo leaving much fond memories for me (watched SC twice). But by episode 2 the anticipation and excitement had dropped to 50% due to one-dimensional characters with absolutely zero character development throughout the whole season 1; especially the main character, and an appalling storyline. The only character who seemed semi interesting was his alter ego who quickly became annoying and repetitive, and played absolutely no role in developing the story at all. \r\nI don'twant to say too much as it would spoil the story. In short, if you want cool sword fights (and guns and RPGs and robots) with awesome artwork, watch it. But if you are like me who focuses more on stories more than anything else, then definitely skip it. Compared to Samurai Champloo, this is mediocre at best.",

Not it is time to take a tumble into this review. \r\nI have been wanting to watch Afro Samurai for some time now and I finally got around to it. I was expecting over the top action but I was surprised with how wonderfully stylistic it all was. The largest issue that pulls this show down dramatically is its piss poor sound design. Characters more in a dramatic fashion and you hear nothing, footfalls are inconsistent, andthe clashing of blades effect is rescued time and again. That said the visuals are truly a sight to behold, especially in the later three episodes Afro Samurai makes gushing blood feel impactful by displaying grotesque scenes of bone and viscera with powerful jetting blood that never feels like blood pinatas seen in other anime. The narrative is simple but effective and could have been more so if it wasn\u2019t obvious that the Japanese animators were having a hard time animating lip flaps for an entirely English speaking cast. Which is a shame because the voice work is truly stand out, especially in the case of Samuel L. Jackson and Ron Perlman. If you get the chance I recommend you watch this bombastically brutal display. \\n",

However the Story itself is pretty Cliche, And as the story develop its pretty simple and obvious what the outcome will be. I will admit the anime has a very high rewatch value since its short (5 episodes) and its a pretty good action Series.\r\nThe Main Character is quiet I guess trying to be the cool calm collective type but honestly throughout the series he never came off as \"Badass\" to me hejust seemed...... There.... Then there is his sidekick WHO NEVER SHUTS UP!!!!! I assume they did this to add flavor so the fights arent boring or to add SOME flavor to the quiet atmosphere, however he comes off as just loud and annoying. Whether or not the series would have been better off without him is a mystery but I thought his character needed some reworking.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are Shaky on watching this or wanna know if they should watch this now.....I believe if you are reading this (or any review on this) you should watch it. You wont be bored watching actually its quite the opposite you will enjoy it. However if you are watching this with high hopes of something deep and very plot written......you will be disappointed....This Anime wont give you a bad experience it just wont be the best.",

            "content": "I watched Afro Samurai on a whim (meaning, my friends convinced me to marathon it in one night with them) and I didn't know what to expect. Undeniably, it sounds like an interesting project, but one that I didn't really trust. An anime with Samuel Jackson in the starring lead role, a soundtrack produced by the RZA, a legendary hip hop producer, and the villain is voiced by Hellboy himself, Ron freaking Perlman? I hate to gush, but it sounds like it should be the greatest experiment in anime history on paper. Unfortunately, and sadly, not to my surprise, it's nothing special. It also suffersfrom an extremely fatal flaw of attempting many things that Samurai Champloo does, but comes nowhere close to it's quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAfro (that's the main character's name, I'm not kidding) was the son of the number one ranked killer in the world. We know this because his father wears a headband with number 1 on it in the opening prologue of the show. If you're thinking it gets more complex than headbands, it does, but not by much. See, number one can only be challenged by the one with the number two headband, but the number two headband can be challenged by anyone. As a boy, Afro saw his father die at the hands of Justice, a deliciously evil villain that I wish had more time during the course of the show's petit five episode run. Afro decides to take the number two headband and go on a crash course to grow up and exact revenge on Justice, who sees himself as the god of this world. The plot is as basic as it gets, with one interesting twist that develops during the last two episodes. Even though you will get some backstory on Afro and a few other characters, it never seems to greatly enhance him as a lead or make the journey much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is a very good looker. The style of character design isn't one I'm personally fond of but it would be a lie to say that the level of detail doesn't capture facial expressions very well. The opening moments of the show put things like clothes blowing in the wind or smoke billowing out of nostrils on full display and it looks very well done. There is fluid animation all over, with grand fight scenes that occur in alarming number per episode. The only thing I can knock the animation for is colors, which tend to be very dry and muted too often. Very often, it feels like the anime is in black and white.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRZA's hip hop soundtrack makes an astounding marriage to the samurai culture here. There's a large variety of beats and the arrangement never tries to reuse anything. This is very reminiscent to RZA's work on Tarantino's Kill Bill, but not quite on that level of quality. Voice acting is decent, but many of the voices do seem over the top and exaggerated with weird accents.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAfro is your generic silent badass, his sidekick (also voiced by Jackson) serves as the main mouthpiece and humor during the show. Though, this is the kind of street lingo humor that isn't going to appeal to everyone and will come off annoying to some. The rest of the cast is pretty basic, only serving as foes standing in Afro's way. There was a female character by the name of Okiku that posed as a possible love interest for Afro, but the show pretty much dismisses this possibility as soon as it presents it. The bottom line here is that your main character is a dull lead, ditching words in favor of looking cool. In that respect it works, but it also shows that the lack of depth is not limited to story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAfro Samurai is so short that it's kind of worth checking out if what you're looking for is visceral action and over the top violence. There are epic fights all over the series and while it's simple and predictable, it clearly succeeds at being an action anime that does the action like few others.",

            "content": "Man o man, when i heard that Samuel L. Jackson, one of the greatest black actors ive ever known, was going to dub a black samurai on a quest for revenge i was kinda iffy. I watched the first episode on Spike and i was actually impressed.\r\nIts a standard revenge setting. A boy loses his father and abandons all morale and morale (to an extent) to get back at the killer known as Justice. Its set in a feudal Japan type period but with the additions of modern day devices like cell phones and rpgs. Interesting twist. O and another note: this show is bloody!if you've seen other violent works such as berserk and elfen lied, then u should have some sort of idea of how things work. Not for the faint of heart\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is fantastic. Jackson, Kelly Hu, Yuri Lowenthal, Ron Perlman (just to name a few) give some awesome performances as the characters of this blood-soaked revenge story. Best of all IMO is Jackson's portrayal of Ninja Ninja. Kind of a throwback to his old Pulp Fiction roots only with a heavier dose of comedy and sarcasm. Another note: there are copious amounts of profanity in this show; most of them courtesy of Ninja Ninja lol so for those of you easily offended, steer clear\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is all well and good, my only real nitpick is that there was a certain lack of character development. Its all stuffed into 5 episodes and when u run that short, u sacrifice either story/characters or quality animation. In this case, its the former. If it only had a few more  episodes, this would truly be an epic story. I know theres a movie for it and theres most likely another series or movie but still it couldve been better. It probably had something to do with each episode being like over 1,000,000 dollars to produce lol\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Afro Samurai is a rich, deep show with lots of action, great music (courtesy of RZA), and much potential perfect for action/gore enthusiats. However if youre looking for character driven stories with little to no continuity issues, then u might wanna look elsewhere. Not to say it doesnt entertain but like i said before it has potential for so much more so lets just hope that takashi okazaki can produce more to add to this epic tale to make it even better\\n\\n\r\n\"nothing personal. its just revenge\" - Afro\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain minor spoilers. That said I've kept them vague so read at your own risk.\r\nSo why did I give Afro Samurai a 10 out of 10? Well because it's cool, and the point of the show was to be cool, and with that in mind it very much succeeds in doing what it had set out to do. That isn't the end of it of course, the animation is some of the best I have ever seen and undoubtedly the best Gonzo had ever done as a studio. The fights are amazing, the main character is bad-ass, the villains are all cooland move in cool ways, and the visuals flow nicely in ways that all other modern anime still can't flow to this day; the story is a mute point. Heck, the story isn't even half bad: a revenge plot to kill his fathers killer? Sounds cool. But what makes the story actually pretty good is what happens in-between: the search for a headband that allows you to challenge the strongest man in the world, an awesome main character that can cut down armies of men, a sad backstory that ends with murder, a slew of villains that act tough but get cut down in the end, and a comic relief character that may only exist in the main's mind.\\n\r\nThe whole point of Afro Samurai is being cool, and I think that it does so with flying colors. It's not even that difficult to watch with only five episodes, so if you don't like it you've only wasted a couple hours of your life as opposed to much worse anime that waste several days. You can even watch it with a good English dub, which is a good thing since that's the only way to watch it.\\n\r\nSure, call me a sucker for cool animation and cool fights, but when it's grouped with a slew of anime that do neither of those things well, is that really a bad thing?",

I own it in Blu-ray so watching this in HD you really see all the details that went into making this show. I love how it is only 5 episodes long. Plus it is only season one so there is more Afro to come.  I find that most places I look people are saying this is a really well dubbed Anime. Ranivuseven stated that it is one of the best dubbed version of a show he has seen. The show was done in English first. I have no idea if they have made a Japanese version of the show yet though. Most of the animation for the characters mouths were done in America because while speaking english you move your mouth  more and make way different gestures than when speaking Japanese.\\n",

            "content": "First of all let me just say this right now, this is not some kind of deep meaning kind of show. This is more like turn off your brain and enjoy the extremely good visuals and fight scenes. \r\nWhen i first heard about Afro Samurai i thought it was a joke, a show made to mock. But when i found some clips and i saw how funny it could be, and how gorgeous the visuals were i was sold. \r\nStory: 5. This is easily the weak point of the show. Afro Samurai ( the main character) Wants the #1 headband to avenge the death ofhis father who had the #1 headband when Afro was a kid. At the start of the show he has the #2 headband. \\n\\n\r\nIts said that the #1 gives you immense power and so on. Nothing really too interesting, just a revenge story. The conclusion isn't satisfying either. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10. This is easily the best point of the show. It looks absolutely amazing and the animation is outstanding. Creative and beautiful designs on the characters and the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. Having Samuel L. Jackson as the voice actor for the main character couldn't been a better choice. It fits him so well, the serious Samuel ( think Pulp Fiction etc) and the not so serious Samuel is present in Afro and Ninja Ninja. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly rap music, but it fits the situations and the flow. Even though i'm not a fan of rap it works so well with the world and the environment it doesn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6. Other then Afro, Ninja Ninja and the bad guy, there's not many characters that you will care about. And i find it hard to even care about them, they fulfill their roles just fine. But that is about it, there is close to no character development. Ninja Ninja is easily the best character in my opinion though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 9 and 8. It is really enjoyable as long as you don't want it to be deep or have some kind of meaning. It is basically just one bad ass samurai killing a lot of people. With some good jokes and stuff from Ninja Ninja. If you have a night off where you just want to see really well animated awesomeness this is highly recommended. Just don't expect it to make you think or have a good story.",

Welcome to Afro Samurai.\r\nAfro Samurai is like one of those movies you watch with crazy CGI and flashy effects, yet when you leave the theater you sense a feeling of emptiness. \r\nIn other words the story kind of sucks. With a seemingly cliche plot of a kid who looses his father and has to get revenge. It does what it needs to though, mildly entertain its audience for 5 episodes. Never at one point did I relate to any of the characters while watching this show or deeply care about them.\r\nThe artwork is pretty well done in this show andis extremely flashy. There is lots of blood, gore, and action, something I enjoy watching in my anime shows. Of course, something with a little more substance, such as Gantz and Elfen Lied are better.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character doesn't really talk, if not at all from what I remember, and is accompanied by the comic relief, Samuel Jackson, who did a pretty good job here.\\n\\n\r\nDon't go into Afro Samurai expecting a masterpiece, instead watch it as mild entertainment.",

            "content": "i really enjoyed watching Afro Samurai because of the cool grity animation style and the sounds combined with it. Like many i decided to watch it because it was recommended to me by a friend (also b/c a 5 episode anime wont take much out of my day). So imma just breakdown what i liked and did not\r\nStory and Characters:  when i read what this anime was about i assumed that i would get a very cliched story line with cliched characters and i did. Most of the characters are 2D characters except for Afro Samurai and his childhood friend Geno. Many would disputethis fact but, \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT*\\n\\n\r\nwhen we saw afro kill the black ninja that followed him around (his imaginary friend) that helped him deal with his lifestyle of constant fighting and no friends we realize that he has emotions and that he a simple revenge killer. Although the Afro Samurai has some depth to him the storyline never changes its mostly Afro fighting and Afro's flashbacks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:  Amazing the art and sound is what really keeps you watching this anime. Because of this unique art style the fights look absolutely fantastic if anything pick up this anime for the visual enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: go watch this anime i am sure that you will enjoy watching it and come out of the experience saying this is the best anime i have ever seen till you look back and think about the storyline and everything like i had to. SO basically this anime has a summer blockbuster action movie effect - alot of good fights, enjoyable with a high rewatch value so go see it \\n\\n\r\nHope you liked my first review",

Well for the first part, it is set in an alternate world, were hip hop, rock, and samurai all meld together into a unique far east asian world. \r\nThe story centres on Afro, a black ninja samurai who is trying to avenge his dead father who was the previous number one, before he was beheaded by the current number one who was the previous number 2.\r\nThe story revolves around Afro's Past and the number 2 head band.\r\nThere is alotof well fought out action scenes, and some of the ideas fit well withthe anime. the art isn't bad or poor, considering the detail they tried to include all I can say was there was some areas where the animation didn't seem fluid. but the action parts were well done, with lots of blood and limbs, and even sex.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it but I didn't expect alot, and I wasn't certain it required samuel L Jackson to voice act the ninja, but i guess the artists wanted his sassiness.\\n\\n\r\nbut it was disappointly short, being only 5 episodes. it wasn't anything special but there were some great episodes and some great action, overall the action helped to pass the time.",

            "content": "Hello everyone, thanks for reading my review, I hope you will find this somewhat helpful. \r\nFirst, I'm not a fan of dub, I usually watch sub, but this one; I just can't imagine this characters to speak Japanese, because English fits them perfectly. There is only one reason why this statement is true; because characters are black. (Not sure if this is racism) Well yeah, how can you imagine black characters to talk Japanese? Black characters should have black voice actors as well, the end. I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson, so this anime was the anime I looked most forward to. I'malso big fan of black people's accent (seriously..) so I also found this show pretty enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nLet's get back on the story, so this anime is all about revenge. Afro's goal was not to become a number 1, but to revenge the death of his father. What makes him more epic is the amount of words he has spoken during this show, man, I could count them with the fingers of my right hand. And then, there is this Ninja Ninja who can't keep his mouth shut, this guy makes this whole show so amusing to watch. Ask me why I like Samuel L. Jackson so much! Simply, because he gave voice to both Ninja Ninja and Samurai Afro.\\n\\n\r\nArt is a bit confusing, I can say. Because this anime is kinda dark. On some parts I was just like:\" What, where is he now? What's happening?\". This anime lacks just a bit of light, but what can you expect from this kind of animes where most of the plot is about: revenge, death, killing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, intro is a hip hop music, not sure if this fits, but I have no objection about it since I'm a big fan of rap and hip-hop.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, but I can't say I enjoyed this anime so much I could rate it 10, first: anime is a bit too short so it doesn't leave so many memories, second: action moments are happening too fast, in one moment there is Afro surrounded by 20 guys trying to kill him and in second moment there are a bunch of decapitated, killed, butchered guys lying on the groud with Afro stading alive and well on the top of them. I can't lie, I didn't really get who was that little bald guy. I just understood that Afro revenged his father and that's what makes this anime so epic.",

            "content": "Afro samurai is an interesting anime. But really its only for those who want loads of mindless blood spilling with no comedy, no story, and no character development. The Main protagonists says 2 words per episode!!! \r\nThe sound and the Art were outstanding... if i was to grade an anime based on those two, Afro samurai would be a 9, but the truth is Afro samurai failed in every other category as American programs usually tend to do.\r\nMost of the time fights will occur randomly for no reason. There are many random moments in the anime that make no sense... for example one moment ourafro hero is cuttin down some foe, the next moment hes in the hospital with no reason given for why hes in there...Compared to shows like Samurai champloo or the lone swordsman, Afro samurai is fail. \\n\\n\r\nI kinda liked how the creators wanted to mix Hip hop with sword fighting but it just didn't feel right, nor does it help you get into the story. The Music sucked, the characters voices were retarded and its hard to take the show serious because of the wacky villians and stupid side kick that fallows afro samurai around.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also is a bit gloomy, dark, and disgusting. The creators probably wanted the viewers to feel like crap after watching the series. The worst part is our Hero is actually a jerk, hes actually more evil then most the villians hes up against. Usually i like cool charachters that have mixed morals such as Yagami light from Death note, or Mugen from samurai champloo. But this guy is a plain blood thirsty idiot ogre who says 2 words per episode!!! Its hard to get attached to people like that. \\n\\n\r\nSamurai champloo does a better job in mixing \"hip hop\" with its style, then does Afro samurai i would recommend samurai champloo to anyone who likes that style of story telling.\\n\\n\r\nI give the series a 5, i really want to give it a 2, but thats just me. In conclusion you should watch this show if you want to see some awesome animation, and stay away if you wish to keep your sanity.\\n",

            "content": "The last time I wrote this I was an idiot. I still love the series, but I went too fan boy to be any good.\r\nThe bad. Whereas the character Afro and his childhood friends were excellently developed in this series, I felt that characters such as Ninja Ninja and the seven old guys on the mountain were just kind of there for no reason. They didn't really explain this in the franchise as a whole, which they could have done, they would have had to make a few more episodes but it would have been worth it. I understand the Ninja Ninja was meant tobe Afro's imaginary friend, but they never state when or why Afro created him. We also really didn't need that sex scene. Where as I do think that some series would be better with sex (cough school days cough) this didn't really benefit the series as a whole and could have been cut out completely. Maybe we could have gotten a back story for Ninja Ninja instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe good. I loved the animation this, and how they use the same animation through out the whole series. From the fight scenes to the calm scenes, and even that sex scene I was talking about, this series is beautifully animated. The next thing I loved was the amount of development we got for our silent protagonist. The next is the soundtrack that we got, even though I'm not much for RZA and the Woo Tang Clan, I seem to love it when they work with anime. They also seem to be the only North American group the Japanese seem to like. But the soundtrack was very well written and you could even just listen to the soundtrack and get pretty much the whole story. The last thing I want to talk about is the casting chooses. Jason Marsden and Samuel L. Jackson as Rival, this was beyond perfect. I mean I don't know a fan that watches the Japanese version if there is one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nThis is 5 hours out of your life that you will immensely enjoy if you like Samuel L. Jackson, the Woo Tang Clan, or sword fighting anime. I would definitely suggest a watch.\\n\\n\r\n8.4/10",

It has some great characters and a good but weird story, but most of the enjoyment you get from the show is the \u201cvibe\u201d. The show feels as if you went to visit your cool cousin who is all about the good kush in the sketchy part of town. If you want an authentic samurai show look elsewhere cause this is some crazy sh#t yo! My only few gripes is that the dub, which is actually good, is sometimes difficult to hear due to mumbling.Which is a shame cause the dub, again, is quite good featuring Samuel L Jackson. My other complain is that it is so short but then again if you want more there is a movie the takes place directly after. All in all, I do believe it is one of the best anime out there.",
