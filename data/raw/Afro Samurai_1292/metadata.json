After taking the life of Afro's father, Justice cast aside his Number Two headband and took the Number One to claim its godly powers as his own. Years later, having obtained the Number Two headband which grants him the right to challenge the Number One, Afro moves forward in his hunt for revenge on the man who murdered his father. There is just one thing that stands in his way\u2014everyone else in the world! Though the Number One can only be challenged by the Number Two, the Number Two can be challenged by anyone.
