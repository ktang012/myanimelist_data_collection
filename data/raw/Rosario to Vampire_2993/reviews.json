            "content": "Rosario + Vampire the anime is the adaptation of a manga of the same name, or at least, thats what it was supposed to be.\r\nStory: I'm trying to best not to rip this show apart but bear with me, Tsukune is your unfortunate high-school male who has just been enrolled in a school he doesnt even know when his parents found an admission pass on the ground by accident. Little does he know is that the school is for monsters than hate humans and would prob kill any on sight. It is when he meets Moka, a beautiful girl who in reality is a powerfulvampire. What I just wrote was basically what you would get introduced with on the first episode, everything was cool then. As the &quot;story&quot; moved on, I slowly started to get irritated at the EXCESSIVE amount of panty shots this anime had. Now I enjoy fanservice every now and then like any other guy but in this show the fanservice was given to you in large and unnecessary quantities, a girl could be standing doing nothing WITHOUT EVEN WIND BLOWING, but they would still show you her panties for no real reason. I thought this was just another one of those fanservice shows so I didnt really wanted to hate this show for that reason. Around ep 5 I decided to pick up the manga as well since I heard good things about it, it was then when I realized what a mess this anime had become. They turned a good manga with interesting plot and good action, into a fanservice driven anime that had tunned down the action and REALLY changed the storyline just to turn it into an ecchi comedy. Also EVERY episode follows the same old formula, If I could describe a R+V episode it would be as follows:\\n\r\nTsukune meets Moka\\n\r\nTsukune meets an antagonist\\n\r\nTsukune gets in trouble\\n\r\nMoka tries to help\\n\r\nTsukune accidentally removes Moka's rosary\\n\r\nVampire Moka beats everyone up\\n\r\nEverything is happy again\\n\r\nThis same formula is applies for every episode of this show with exception of the last 2 episodes, which were good on its own right but still managed to butcher the goodness of the manga. If you watch animes to get a good story you wont find it here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As terrible as the story is, this anime's best feature was its animation. The colours were all great and the animation was fluent everytime. I failed to notice any sign of quality drop throughout the show. I will give this show props for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasnt bad, nothing really out of the ordinary. The ED song was really good though....IMO the best part of every episode was the end credits XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters of this anime are likeable, well Tsukune is the typicial guy who tries to help but ends up being helped instead because of its uselessness. Moka's normal form is a contrast to her vampire form as one is sweet and friendly and the other is rough and swift to act. To be honest my only motivation to finish this show was Shirayuki Mizore aka Ice Girl. Voiced by Kugimiya Rie it was nice to see her use a non loli voice and well the character itself IMO is awesome. She could've been the main character :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'll keep this simple, I didnt like this anime. It was hard to finish some episodes and then try my best not to drop it right after. Its safe to say I will not be watching the second season if they havent learned their lesson on this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rosario + Vampire was a rather disappointing show considering how Gonzo had a really good source to work with but decided to ruin it in order to bring ecchi comedy and pointless plot. If you are the type of person who likes this kind of ecchi comedy and mindless fanservice then R+V will be a good show for you to watch and I recommend it for you (also rejoice as a season 2 will be coming). For someone who likes a good story, dont bother, this anime is not worth it.",

            "content": "\"Side tracked from its original story and ended up being a half-baked series.\"\r\nBefore we begin, let me drill this into your mind. Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service! That's the theme for this anime so don't start having high hopes for an amazing story or what not (at least nothing in comparison to the manga original). Rosario + Vampire, like many manga-to-anime adaptation series, made fans screamed with joy at first, but only to have their hopes and dreams shattered bit by bit as the anime progresses. It is true that the anime's story plot deviates from its origin, but itis also true that the artwork is astounding (the animation version of the characters look more attractive to me). So let us get into a deeper analysis of Rosario + Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe anime is considered pretty episodic (ie. standalone episodes) with a few exceptions near the end of the series. This goes parallel with its manga originals so it is nothing new to the readers. However, what is new is the extremely formulaic sequence in all episodes with an introduction to the &quot;monster of the episode&quot; (these monsters tend to get defeated and then become friends with the protagonists). Not only that, but the actual story coverage is also very minimal in the anime (only covered up to chapter 10 of the manga out of 40 chapters). But that is not to say it is all bad. In fact, certain portions of the story that were remade into anime were better planned (events flow smoother/made more logical sense) than the manga version. Overall, the story serve its purpose as an introduction to the Rosario + Vampire series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nConsistent animation quality throughout, beautifully animated characters, plus smooth transition from scene to scene, what more can you ask for? Gonzo, while not exactly known for extremely high quality animation (at least not at the level of KyotoAnimation), does indeed proved itself a worthy opponent to other studios in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP and ED are both very enjoyable for me (I didn't skip them like I did for a lot of other anime). It should not be an annoyance to you either (I hope). As for seiyu, there are many talented and well known professionals to voice for our pretty girls (and boys). For instance, there is the cute Rie Kugimiya voicing for the &quot;icy cold&quot; Mizore, and Saeko Chiba voicing for the &quot;very funny&quot; Ruby. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to bring the attention to Nana Mizuki who is the CV for our super hot/cute/pretty/gorgeous Moka and also the singer for the OP and ED of the series (and the singer for Capu2 as well). Nana is not only famous in the seiyu community, but is admired by all. She has an amazing ability to sing (even rivals those so-called &quot;professional&quot; singers) thanks to her powerful singing voice despite being a pretty tiny girl. She was also the winner of the &ldquo;Best Musical Performance&rdquo; award in the first Seiyu Awards. For those who have not yet experienced her excellent character voicing ability (and as a singer), I strongly suggest you give this series a try. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAside from the fact that most character's hidden abilities were not included in the anime, the show did a pretty good job with the characters. Plenty of character developments and showing their inner feelings toward each other (especially near the end when certain secrets were discovered). In addition, the interaction between the many different types of monsters can be quite refreshing from the traditional harem-oriented anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Final Thought:\\n\r\nJudging Rosario + Vampire solely as an anime, it has plenty of ups and downs. Judging it as an adaptation from a manga, it was pretty disappointing except for the animation and sound department. I recommend this to all people who have not yet read the manga (got some nice fan service), but for those who know the story already, you might want to skip this and move on.",

            "content": "Rosario Vampire is a typical male targeted anime filled with comedy, ecchi, and action. Typical school comedy with typical jokes associated with high school comedies. The \"special\" twist for this show would be that this school happens to be a school for monsters. To twist it even further, a human is accidentally accepted to the university and if he's found out he will literally be killed. Reading from the other reviews it appears that the manga had a \"real story and plot.\" ...lets think about it for a second. How can someone take a story so serious about a boy trying to survive a monsterschool? Regardless, this review will be biased based on the anime and not being tied to any book. \\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying, this show is about a human boy accidentally being accepted at a monster school. But on his way there the literally gets hit by a beautiful girl on a bike. Long story short, he finds out she's a vampire (hence the title), they hook up and the adventure begins. The episode structure is typically built the same for every episode: Story + new character + problem + fight = one Rosario vampire episode. Some shows don't pull that formula off very well (Jigoku Shoujo Season 1) but R+V does it pretty good. Each episode is very different from the last all thanks to being a high school full of monsters. Being a Japanese anime, it would be easy for them to follow the normal Japanese way and make their own random monsters. Thankfully, they pulled MOST of their monsters out of typical folklores and old wives tales like vampires, succubus, witches, etc ...with their own anime twist of course. At least they use east and and west references instead of making their own which is very refreshing. But the story line isn't the shows strong point....\\n\\n\r\nThis is an ecchi comedy and you will figure that out within the first 15 seconds of watching the show, that it's more ecchi than comedy. And the only way to be a successful ecchi show is if the art and animation is top of the line, this is where the show shines the most. All the backgrounds are hand painted with care. They even designed the school to resemble a Gothic style building with excellent accuracy. All the main and background characters are drawn with such perfection only an ecchi fan can understand. Every girl is drawn beautifully and have their own style. It even looks like they borrowed a few things from the book of Tenjo Tenge: Hairstyles, miniskirts, fighting, and even Moka acts alot like Aya Natusme But then again, they do pull off a few subtle spoofs and parodies. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters they're all very ...addicting. As an ecchi comedy they covered all bases of moe. You'll most likely get addicted to one or more of the main characters or villains. And to top it off, their voices are so mind numbingly addicting, you'll practically melt. (Kappuchuuu~). Apparently it's a requirement now that if you have fan service characters, their seiyu's have to have their own music cd. Each girl does have one and they even have some songs posted in the show. Be sure to look out for Kimiko Koyama (I'm listening while writing this ^_^) As for the op and ed songs, they fit perfectly for what you would expect from an anime titled Rosario Vampire. Other than the great music and great seiyu cast, the sound effects are pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nSure theres alot of fanservice in this show...it is an ecchi comedy after all. I don't understand why people are so surprised. This is the 21st century, movie/tv adaptations NEVER follow the book/manga. So haters should get over it or they will be constantly let down for the rest of their lives. Take this show for what it is... a fun ecchi comedy with great characters, fun fight scenes, and hilarious fanservice. I sure hope this show will last a few seasons.",

            "content": "R+V is an ecchi anime that has been received surprisingly good in my eyes. I mean, the only thing that makes it different are the elements of action which have found their way into each episode. It starts out with Tsukune Aono, the typical ecchi wimp main. He is starting high school, and due to some strange circumstances he ends up getting admitted into a youkai academy. On his way there he bumps into gets bumped into by a beauty, who's actually a vampire. She's supposedly one of the beauties in school, so you know what's coming... yeah, she ends up befriending the wimp, andhangs out with him all the time. But of course, she isn't the only one; soon there comes a girl who wants to steal him away, and on top of that, a tiny brat, tags along with the group, and there you have it! Standard ecchi setting deluxe!\\n\\n\r\nThe story fails to impress in any way aside the inital setting as well. Each episode brings about a new (mis)adventure for the group, which basically goes like this: Tsukune gets into bad company -> Hangs out with the girls -> The bad company comes to them -> The three girls kick ass + Moka transforms -> Tsukune whines -> Everyone gets happy after kicking ass -> End. And that's about it. The only refreshing thing is that it's actual action here, and that there's new youkai taking the role of bad guys every episode. But aside those, nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just about what you'd expect: The moe girl, her rival, a small girl (loli?), and the wimp they all stalk to death. Unoriginal, boring and non-developing, that's pretty much what there's to say about the characters. Both the recurring side characters and the ones who get renewed each episode brings out nothing specuial; they're just standard filler for their position, be it teacher or bad guy of the day. The only slightly refreshing thing was that Tsukune seemed like he wanted to actually help out in the fights, instead of being a wimp and passively receiving whatever assaults of love the girls threw at him. Props to him for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art department was okay, but nothing bragworthy. The backgrounds were nice, yet a little artsy, and the character designs, whuile generic, were pleasing enough. The action scenes were animated nicely, and no slumping in the special effects department either. There was too much fanservice, however.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty okay, and fit the series, but it was by no means anything special, and none of the tunes really captured me or made the scenes better. The OP and ED themes were good enough, fitting the series' atmosphere and all, but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, R+V is a failed attempt at an ecchi series, with plain characters and a boring story, but with an action element that served as decently refreshing and allowed for some plus points scored by the pathetic wimp main. And there's lots of fanservice, be warned.",

            "content": "Rosario + Vampire is a typical Shounen, Supernatural, Harem, Romantic, Comedy about an average, human, high school boy (Tsukune) who couldn\u2019t get into any private schools and was stuck going to a school for monsters. This may sound interesting but there\u2019s nothing particularly special about this set-up, since it is just your average school Rom/Com but with monsters. What\u2019s more is that each episode has some very predictable outcomes that get boring fast (monster appears, Moka transforms & sucks blood). So in the end, the weak and repetitive story turned this into a series that you can only enjoy once you turn off your brain.\r\nThere\u2019snothing unique about the characters, seeing how it does the same old thing; by having yet another \u201closer-kun\u201d male protagonist and surrounded by hot and cute girls. Their personalities usually match the way they look as well, so don\u2019t expect anyone to really stand out in this series, except maybe Mizore (snow girl). \\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is probably the best aspect, as the backgrounds and environments completely suit the ever changing horror atmosphere. Also everything is somewhat fluid, from the bouncing breast to swift action sequences. The music is also well done, especially during the short burst of action but it becomes fairly repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rosario + Vampire proved to be a somewhat entertaining Rom/Com that quickly turns into a typical harem, full of everything shounen (misunderstandings, ecchi, nosebleeds, etc.). Apart from the supernatural element, everything else is the same as in any typical school comedy with the usual clich\u00e9 situations we are all used to seeing. Fans of the manga will most definitely feel let down by the series, as it never managed to deliver the same story the manga produced and instead all it did deliver was an excessive amount of fanservice (100 panty shots per episode). Some may still enjoy this while the rest will wonder why you wasted your time on such a show.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Okay then, where to start? How about the fact that this was made by Gonzo. Now, before you go jumping down my throat, yes, Gonzo has made some really, REALLY good series, and are still making them today. However, they also have a very long list of bad shows they've produced as well.\r\nThis is one of those bad ones.\r\nI walked into this one having read the first two volumes of the manga and knowing fully that there was only a 50/50 chance of this series being any good. Unfortunately, my gamble didn't pay off. The first thing that bothers me is the fanservice. Yes, themanga also has copious amounts of it, but it takes a backseat to the plot. Here in the anime, the reverse is true. The show reverts to a cliched monster-of-the-week formula with no real tension in any of the situations because you know exactly how it will be resolved by the end of the episode. There are no over-arcing storylines and absolutely no character development.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, because there's a lot of potential here, with the setting they chose, putting a human in a school for monsters and all, but any clever setups we could have had are completely blown in favor of even more fanservice. The only consistent plot element is the insufferable on-again, off-again relationship between the two man characters, Tsukune and Moka, but even then, their arguments and troubles are not interesting, not sympathetic, and not really grounded in any sort of reality that would make us care for what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, that's also a place where the series falls flat on its ass. Moka and Tsukune are the only ones who have any real depth to them, and that's really only because of Moka's split personality, and their strained relationship. The rest of the characters, while having a few funny moments, only exist to create a little more conflict and to fill in the stereotypical rolls of a Harem anime: Kurumu's a bitch, Yukina's a loli, and Mizori's a quiet stalker. There, you know everything about them you'll ever need to know. Other characters, like Nekonome-sensei are actually far more fun to see, but they're only ever on screen for a small amount of time in each episode, if they're even featured at all. Oh, and since the villain changes every episode as well, don't expect any deep characterization for them either. They're all either perverts who want to get into one of the main characters' pants (by force if necessary) or want to prove their strength by maiming one of the heroes. There is one exception to this rule, but to avoid spoilers, I can't talk about her, and again, she only appears in like, two episodes before conforming to another stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to a different topic, the sound in this anime is probably the only really good part of this. The voice actors bring a lot of energy to their rolls, and it's competent enough, though a few of the characters do cross the annoyance line one too many times for my taste. The sound effects are also decent, if a little stock, though the one you'll probably hear the most often is the strange bouncing sound effect that happens whenever a female's breasts bounce. Yes, bouncing breasts have their own sound effect in this show. The music is also good, if a bit stock, and it has a good mixing of classical string scores and horn concertos, but there isn't a whole lot of variety.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well... it's Gonzo working on a school harem anime. The character designs are actually really well done and all of them do look very faithful to their original manga designs, though I do think a few of the coloring options for some of them was a tad strange... Kurumu having blue hair just doesn't seem right to me and Mizore's black and purple outfit and hair make me think she's going to turn into the Cheshire Cat at any moment. However, the designs are consistently good, but the animation itself is... well, Gonzo. Still frames abound, folks. Close-ups even moreso. Scenes of people running look a little choppy. You're getting the idea, I hope. The only parts that seem to be above this quality are during the fight scenes that take place in each episode, but these fights are so short (most of them end with a single blow, folks) that it's barely noticeable. The only other place that seems to have a budget on this show is the giggle physics. Seriously, an female who has breasts large enough to be noticeable, you will see jiggles and jumps all over the place that looks more fluent than the animation of the actual character.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said, I've only read the first two (out of a total of six) volumes of the manga, but even then, I still feel like I know more about the characters, their motivations, their thoughts, and their personalities than after watching all thirteen episodes of this series. The characters aren't interesting and at best only serve to further the plot while at worst just exist for more fanservice, the plot is nonexistent and the characters (if you haven't figured out by now) aren't strong enough to drive the story forward, and while the main focus would appear to be on Moka and Tsukune's relationship, absolutely nothing changes or gets resolved at all by the end of the series!\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, if you're really interested, skip the anime, skip the second season (capu 2) and just pick up the manga instead! trust me, you'll be glad you did... but hey, I do have one good thing to say about this: at no point during the series do any of the vampires sparkle!",

            "content": "Rosario+Vampire Review:\r\nRosario+Vampire was one of the first anime I ever watched. Due to this, I hold this show very close to my heart and may have a positively biased opinion so excuse me if it shows through. However, after revisiting the show and re-evaluating how good it actually is, I have to say that this show is perfectly \"meh.\"\r\nStory - 4.5/10:\r\nOne thing that I have noticed MANY people complain about with this anime, is that it basically disgraces the manga. Both the anime and the manga have the same introductory premise of a high school boy named Tsukune accidentally being enrolled in a school formonsters. During his time here, he develops his own harem consisting of various sexy monster babes with different personalities. However, while the manga grows from this premise and turns into an action packed, exciting ride, the anime decides to settle in this groove and remain a standard high school harem with a monster twist. Now, I am not saying this is a bad thing, but from a story perspective, yes, this means the anime is not as good as the manga. However, the anime does succeed in creating some funny moments, and somewhat unique plotlines due to its unique concept. It by no means has any emotional depth, riveting action, or psychological themes. However, the story in Rosario+Vampire is not \"bad\", it is merely just your average harem storyline with a monster twist.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5.4/10:\\n\r\nWhen I first saw this show I thought the animation was fantastic.... Oh how wrong I was. The main reason I thought the art was good, is because my prior anime experiences were with the likes of Girls Bravo, Pokemon, and DBZ, however, after watching more anime I have concluded that the art for this show is 100% average. The character designs were good at times, especially when we got to see the students change into monster form, however, for many reasons, this show does not stand out art-wise. First off, there is basically only one location, the school. Add in the fact that there are plenty of still frames and you can easily notice that not a lot of budget was needed for this show. There was also no eye-catching lighting or color schemes to go with it. The art wasn't poor, but not much better than average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6.5/10:\\n\r\nHere's where my nostalgia factor for this show might bring some bias. I really liked the music for this show. More specifically, I really liked the openings to this show. This remains true to this day and will likely not change. However, the voice acting could be cringe worthy at times and was extremely up and down for me. Add in the poor script and listening to those english voice actors could be painful. But none the less, the soundtrack was enjoyable for me and by no means was the voice acting \"bad\", just not good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5.2/10:\\n\r\nI really wanna give this section a higher score but I know I can't. The manga has made me fall in love with the characters, but when i look back at the anime and how it portrayed the characters.... ehhh. I watched the anime first, and was pretty up and down about the characters, and now that I know more about the standard character archetypes, I am even more meh about the characters. Tsukune is the standard wimpy lead for a harem, and the girls are all typical archetypes (the caring one, the tomboy, the shy one, the loli). Even though the characters were all standard, they were likeable for the most part and for this reason I consider them slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6.5/10:\\n\r\nLike I said: This was one of my first anime. For that reason, I really enjoyed this show when I first watched it. If I hadn't gotten to this show until let's say a week ago, I probably would drop it. But due to the fact that I watched it so early, I did really enjoy it. It was funny, the characters were likeable, and occasionally they will include some interesting fight scenes. The scenarios that the characters found themselves in tended to be interesting and definitely kept me enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.62:\\n\r\nIt might be a lot different than the manga, but Rosario+Vampire's anime adaptation holds its own. It isn't really overwhelmingly impressive in any area, but it definitely does what it has to do in order to be an above average harem. I recommend watching the anime before reading the manga to prevent disappointment, because (especially for fans of harem anime) the anime is worth a shot. If you enjoy harem romcoms, definitely watch this show. However, if you are just looking for a new show to watch, don't expect too much from this show because it really is barely above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nAn average high school harem with a monster twist.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ OPs are catchy\\n\r\n+ Solid comedy\\n\r\n+ Good concept\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot has no direction\\n\r\n- Manga fans will be disapointed\\n\r\n- English dub is inconsistent\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Rosario Vampire, watch...\\n\r\nGirls Bravo:\\n\r\nIf you liked the over the top adult humor that focused mainly on oversexual jokes and enjoy watching harems, this show is right for you.\\n\r\nSekirei:\\n\r\nIf you liked the harem idea (and boobs), but were more interested in the action than the comedy, Sekirei is for you.\\n\\n\r\n5.62 - Alright",

Like the art teacher. she was in the beging and the end too! how do you skip that? On the witches hill made my head hurt.that was also change at points that made no sense. the last of this horror story was the end. they tried to\"stay with the manga\" but failed! I mean if you cut out plot points it will make no sense , to bother. they wrap it up so badly if you try to think how does this make any sense at the school and what they heard about aono just does not make any sense.\\n\r\nart: was great! this is how anime should be done! the back grounds to the characters.\\n\r\nsound: was ok. at some points it grinded on my nerves ( like ever time there was a romic sense). but the songs in it was good.\\n\r\ncharacters: sigh.......I  love them in the manga but in the anime was bad! everyone seem to try way to hard to get aono's love. the manga was not like that. missing some ( art teacher) and chainging others badliy (Ginie).\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\nwas only had in the few esp. they did right. which was not a lot. why did they have so many panty shot's?

However, with the overwhelming focus on T&A shots, There's no way for me to enjoy this.  As a note, add 2-3 points to my \"Overall\" score if you really like fanservice.",

It is an unquestionable 10/10 for me.\r\nRosario + Vampire, the anime adaption, on the other hand is complete garbage and remains one of the biggest fuck ups in the history of anime. \r\nThe anime version of Rosario + Vampire takes out everything good that was in the manga (the story, meaningful character relationships) and replaces it with fan service.\r\nGonzo basically took one of the best mangas and COMPLETELY ruined it with fanservice. A little bit of fan service is okay once in a while (I don't like it though), but Rosario + Vampire bases its entire show on fan service. Gonzo basically exploited a masterpiece and turned it into trash to earn a couple bucks.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about Tsukune Aono. In the manga, Tsukune is a three diminsional character who gradually learns how to adapt to a dangerous school full of monster. I'm not going to say how, cause that will spoil the story. But in the anime, Tsukune is a stereotypical loser who somehow gets a harem of the hottest girls in school - I HATE this cliche. Why are all the characters so stereotypical and one dimensional?\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing redeeming about this anime adaption of Rosario + Vampire. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime needs to be remade correctly!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is dumb fun, and then there is just plain asinine. Rosario + Vampire tries hard to convince us that it is the former, it tries very hard. The show is openly aware of how stupid it can get, and happily points out how dumb it is being as its main source of comedy. Unfortunately, this is not only a flimsy source of comedy that only occasionally works, it also makes it irritatingly evident that the plotting is shoddy and the characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed; plus that the show was made to blatantly exhibition girls' cleavage. This results in a fan-service comedy thatis more obnoxious than it ever is funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe poor idiot in the middle of this mess is Tsukune, a human who ends up going to a school for monsters through ridiculous circumstances; namely being sent there by his parents that know nothing about the school (well, aren't they responsible) after he failed the high school entrance exam. Luckily for him, Yokai Academy is a school which is meant to teach monsters to co-exist with humans; all students are required to take human form and stay that way. Here he meets the obvious main love interest, a vampire named Moka. Moka is a nice girl with a bad habit of drinking Tsukune's blood, and has a separate personality that emerges when the rosary on her neck is removed. He also meets other girls that eventually try gaining his love, like the big boobed succubus girl, and the loli witch gir... you know what, none of this really matters. It is basically the same set up as any harem anime, with a bunch of extraneous details that either don't add much to the story, or are used to incredibly stupid effect.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show has a monster-of-the-week format, with silly school yard shenanigans and fan-service thrown in, of course. Most episodes go like this: Tsukune attends class and hangs out with Moka and other members of his growing harem; one of the monsters attending the school starts causing troubles for their group; when a confrontation finally flairs up, Tsukune removes Moka's rosary and she kicks the monster's ass; rinse and repeat. Needless to say, this formula gets boring quickly, but the show keeps at it with about three-fourths of the episodes more or less going like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also implements every trite trope found in any anime with a school setting, like the harem of friendly love-rivals, the pool and beach episodes, and so on. This is something that the show is fully aware of. There is this token animal mascot talking bat that appears often, and spouts wise-cracks about the characters' ridiculous behavior, how cliche a certain event is, or just says something during scene changes. This bat has to be one of the most annoying and obnoxious of mascot characters; he isn't the least bit funny because he comments on the most pointless of things, and he never says anything that is remotely witty. It is obvious what the show was going for with this, but it just completely fails. All it really does is make more apparent how poor the writing in the show is, and that the writers are aware how bad it is; this comes across as if they just didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nAs lackluster as the comedy is, the show's attempt drama in the show is even worse. Most of the show's dramatics revolve around things getting in the way of Tskune and Moka's developing relationship... if it can even be called that. All there is between them is Tskune fawning over how pretty and nice Moka is, and Moka drinks his blood as if he was a drinking fountain but still wanting to be his friend/ love interest. There really isn't any depth or dynamic between the two even the show tries to convince us there is. Any other attempt at drama similarly fails because the characters are barely developed to be anymore than trite stereotypes found in this kind of show, so it is hard to care about any of them. Even the stuff about Yokai Academy being a school which teaches monsters to fit into human society goes out the window when Tskune is revealed to be a human, sending the entire student body to form a mob calling for his blood, while the faculty deciding to do nothing for no other reason than to make things needlessly dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Rosario + Vampire is the definition of laziness. It isn't that it is terrible, it is just so damn generic looking. Girls with boobs that rival watermelons, flat chested lolis, really dumb looking hooligans, squirmy nerd losers, and a rainbow assortment of hair colors; every stereotype associated with anime character designs can be found in this show. The backgrounds are similarly bland, although admittedly the haunted looking woods surrounding the school are done pretty well. There are a lot of short cuts taken in the animation, in fact almost everything that is animated is a short cut. The use of music is unremarkable as is the soundtrack itself; mostly filled with bubbly pop compositions that accentuate silly moments, or slightly more aggressive compositions during tenser moments, so it is fitting but nothing sticks long after the scene passes.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up, don't watch Rosario + Vampire. It is a show that encapsulates almost everything bad about modern anime. Characters are plastic stereotypes; Tsukune is a thoroughly uninteresting male lead, and all the girls are little more than walking fan-service. Ecchi anime are usually dumb fun best not taken seriously, but that is hardly an excuse for a show to be so poorly written and so lazily executed. What's worse is that the show actually takes a stab at drama that is so hackney that it drags the show even lower than the decidedly low standards it set for itself. It doesn't even qualify as dumb fun, it is just embarrassing.\\n",

            "content": "I don\u2019t even know where to begin to talk about this mess of an anime. Why this is such a popular anime is completely mind boggling to me. Is it because it\u2019s trash? Is it because it\u2019s just so much of a mess, it\u2019s completely confusing everyone?\r\nEssentially, this is a story revolving around a gary stu. The main character is less than mediocre, and as to why an apparently amazing vampire is in love with his ugly perverted, absolutely useless self is absolutely beyond me.\r\nThe other main character is of course a mary sue. She is loved by all, immensely powerful, confident, etc. As towhy a supposedly \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d character would somehow hang around some sack of shit that isn\u2019t even supposed to go to that school is bizarre. And this little girl witch is supposed to make him fall in love with her too? (Okay, are we even going to address how that little girl is catering to the literal pedophiles of the audience? She\u2019s supposed to be seen as this innocent little girl that he\u2019s going to love. What the fuck? Get that loli stuff out of my face. Not to mention, they body shame her for having the smallest breasts in the show. WHY ARE YOU SEXUAIZING A LITTLE GIRL?)\\n\r\nWhy are people involved with him? He is not even remotely attractive in any way possible. I could see how a vampire would be attracted, as she needs blood. (The way she bites him is very annoying and cutesy, by the way.) Why is he the main character when a toothpick would be more relevant to the plot? Why does this anime exist?\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre. It\u2019s your typical anime series type of art, and every once in a while you\u2019ll see the style improve. (Of course, it\u2019s when the mary sue gets all powerful..) Also I would like to understand why on Earth it was necessary to ever add in a panty shot. Did we really need to see this? Is that necessary? Did seeing her \u201coh so sexy\u201d underwear further the plot? Did it help the audience really understand the struggles these characters go through? Not at all. These are high school girls. They aren\u2019t adults. Save the ecchi for a show with older characters.\\n\r\nThe logic in this series is an absolute mess, and it goes against the very (weak) fabric of the meaning of these characters. The main girl character is this amazing and all powerful vampire that can only really be that powerful once in a while? Okay, bye. Where are her REAL weaknesses? I\u2019d love to know, and I\u2019m sure the rest of the audience would like to as well.\\n\r\nFurthermore, a succubus that attacked the gary stu once and then realized she was \u201cin love\u201d and wanted to \u201cmanually make him fall in love with her\u201d? What the hell is this? The job of a succubus is to use men for sex, not to be romantically attracted to them. Even her mom points this out and she decides to ignore the obvious.\\n\r\nALSO the gary stu sometimes looks at other girls, unsurprisingly. And the mary sue gets upset EVEN THOUGH his crush on her is extremely obvious and she isn\u2019t requiting it? There is literally no reason for you to be jealous, you two aren\u2019t dating. There was no communication of this at all.\\n\r\nEvery second of this anime made me suffer, every \u201ckyu~\u201d and \u201cmochaaaa!\u201d made my ears bleed. Whoever edited this anime has my respect, I can barely watch this sack of shit once, god forbid several times. Don\u2019t watch this anime, for the love of god. I don\u2019t care if you want to watch it ironically or for a joke. Not even then would this anime be enjoyable. Don\u2019t waste your time. Take up literally almost anything but this trash. Love yourself.",

            "content": "It's a good concept. Although it's been done many times, the quirky characters and their personality grow on you. Having read all the way to chapter 33 of the manga I can say this for sure; the story is changed in a way that removes the depth of the characters and situations. The real problem is the Fan service, there is far too much. This anime had so much potential in the first few episodes, then the excess of fan service obliterated the depth of the story.\r\nFrom an artistic perspective the animation is of very good quality, the backgrounds are drawn very well and itis a pleasure to watch. If you love fan service than his anime will not disappoint you in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening and ending themes also performed by Nana Mizuki are nice to get you into the watching mood. The songs during the episodes become quite annoying at times; however, the voice actors are very well suited to the personality of their characters, Nana Mizuki's performance as Moka is very good, and one of the best followed closely by Kugimiya, Rie as Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters much like the story suffer the transition from manga to anime, however, the voice cast manages to make up for the shortcomings and bring the characters to life and make it fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love supernatural, fan service, cute girls, good voice acting and a pretty decent story, watch this anime.\\n\r\n(However)\\n\r\nIf you love supernatural, fan-service, cute girls, a very good story, and romance, read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good, it really is! I just happen to like substance over Fan service, as such; I will have to say that the manga is better than the anime.\\n",

            "content": "Having officially read the Manga a couple of days ago I pondered why I originally gave this show a 9 in the past when in all honesty it is incomparable to the manga in terms of plot, character and wait for it ~ external character design.\r\nBut nevertheless both the show and manga succeeded in their own intended ways, both were done good so to say. Removing the manga out of this discussion for the sake of the review  Rosario Vampire is a episodic series following a simple plot:\r\nMediocre guy who couldn't pass his HS entrance exams with no special talents gets admitted and sentaccidently to a a private school called Yolki academy ~ which plot twist is an academy that trains monsters to cope with blending in with the human realm. He meets a vampire named Moka. In the context of the series vampires are 'S Class' monsters or top tier monsters in battle. She protects and helps him develop his inner personality as they together study at the school throughout the plot. A harem is developed and mini adventures are made ect.. But each episode adds an element to the plot that is revealed as a arc in the end of this series. So there's no existential angst involved.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIts episodic and follows the same syntax:\\n\\n\r\nwhile(more episodes) {\\n\\n\r\nif (fow) == male {\\n\r\n bringin (Moka);\\n\r\nfow = null;\\n\\n\r\nelse if (fow == female){\\n\r\n bringin (Moka);\\n\r\nfow.savedbyProtagonist;\\n\r\nharem++;\\n\r\n }\\n\r\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nShueisha did a good job at animating the characters and monsters invovled. There was alot of imagination involved in the show and although not spectacular it did a good job in portraying the characters emotions and scenery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  4/10 (Character Design 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTypical harem characters. A mediocre guy with a good heart, a shy introverted sub-protagonist. But each of the girls is a monster with special abilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFan Service 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRV is the opiate of fan-service. The type of 'soul food' you need when watching anime. Let me elaborate. In the past I witnessed countless anime that were centred around similar plot styles. However the way they included fan service involve naked girls or devices/monsters that tore clothing (sigh).  \\n\r\nI like to call it forced fan service. With the exception of miniskirts Rosario Vampire added an element of 'Inner Moko' which I wont spoil but added a excellent type of treat for the fans that made them claw for her to show and develop herself more. I wont spoil it but youll see how this anime is separated from the usual harem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nif (intelligence < ....)\\n\\n\r\nNo Im joking. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it and watched the series within a day. \\n\\n\\n",

Or had characters that were likable instead of half-assed archetypes. The characters have no sort of synergy or chemistry with one another, only existing to pad out each episode's runtime with tired, predictable hijinks that elicit more groans than laughs.Lead \"love interest\" Moka's interactions with Tsukune are so stilted and unbelievable you'd think the guy who wrote them was raised by robots who spoke like Microsoft Sam. \\n\r\n Really, any sort of effort put into the story or characters world could have made it at least passable. As it stands, it's a tired, cynical attempt to cash in on teenagers who like staring at objectified girls fawn over someone they can project themselves onto.\\n\r\nOne cringeworthy entry in the harem subgenre to stand with all the others.",

Douchebags that watch ecchi and then bitch about fanservice\r\n2. The Manga Readers (fair enough Ifeel for you guys)\\n\\n\r\nTo the people who haven't read the manga, watch it its a great romcom that will make you laugh until your onto the second season.\\n\\n\r\nTo the people who have read the manga and not seen the show, you most probably wont enjoy it to the adaption is a kick in the dick for all readers. But it is still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now onto the review\\n\\n\r\nThe basic plot is about the main character Tsukune ends up accidently in a school only for monsters. Where he meets Moka a vampire, who becomes really powerful when her rosario seal is removed and an inner personality is revealed. Tsukune faces many troubles but is able to build up a harem over the season etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt is quite good nothing amazing but still effective for creating a good show. The music and the sound were also effective and a strong point towards the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- a reasonable amout of character development is good with the usual harem stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThough reading the manga i still enjoy this show and its a good couple of hours that you wont miss. Finishing it with you stomach sore from laughter.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime it is a good show that people should at least try.\\n\\n\r\nI hope its helpful! Cheers and have a good one!\\n\\n",

Rosario + Vampire brings all those kinds of characters we &quot;love&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 6/10 (D)\\n\r\nHonestly, a show such as Rosario + Vampire gives anime a bad name for being called porn and slutty. Bible Black has more of a plot than this (Bible Black is a hentai, by the way.) Heck, even NARUTO has a better plot. But it can somewhat repair with the talent singing of the dual voice acting/singing talents of the Rosario cast. Each episode has professional-grade animation other shows should use. For a plot-less show, the Art is top notch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: Animation, BGM.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Plot, character depth, basically everything.",

Also the anime have some good fight scenes that you can see in almost every episode and the fighting scenes are really short unlike other shows.\\n\r\nI gave sound a 9, because the sound was well and there was no pitch problems.\\n\r\nI gave the characters an 8 because the characters are original, but you either have to like or hate the characters. Plus I really love the character Nazo Koumori who's a bat that provides useless information most of the time.\\n\r\nOverall, I've really enjoyed the series so I gave both a 10. I really liked this anime because of the comedy, fight scenes, and the romance in it. This is one of my favorites anime and I really hope they make a second season.

This theme has been done before and done to death, and the overabundance of panty shots (second in number only to Najica Blitz Tactics) just further pigeonholes this anime into the mediocre ecchi territory held by Steel Angel Kurumi and Ai Yori Aoshi.  \r\nSo what sets Rosario Vampire apart?  I can'tin good conscience see anyone as taking this anime seriously.  Every character, episode, and scene is done so ridiculously over-the-top and bizarrely cliched that it's really impossible to accept Rosario Vampire as anything but a joke.  It does for harem anime what Nadesico did for teen pilot mecha anime.  Stunningly beautiful art and animation (even if what is depicted typically consists of booties, boobies, and panties) only serves to enhance the eye candy that this series strives to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have the ability to embrace the cheesy, ignore trite and overtroped plotlines and characterizations, and crack up head over heels laughing at the joke this series is, then Rosario Vampire is the show for you.",

            "content": "Rosario + Vampire the anime is the adaptation of a manga of the same name, or at least, thats what it was supposed to be.\r\nStory: I'm trying to best not to rip this show apart but bear with me, Tsukune is your unfortunate high-school male who has just been enrolled in a school he doesnt even know when his parents found an admission pass on the ground by accident. Little does he know is that the school is for monsters than hate humans and would prob kill any on sight. It is when he meets Moka, a beautiful girl who in reality is a powerfulvampire. What I just wrote was basically what you would get introduced with on the first episode, everything was cool then. As the &quot;story&quot; moved on, I slowly started to get irritated at the EXCESSIVE amount of panty shots this anime had. Now I enjoy fanservice every now and then like any other guy but in this show the fanservice was given to you in large and unnecessary quantities, a girl could be standing doing nothing WITHOUT EVEN WIND BLOWING, but they would still show you her panties for no real reason. I thought this was just another one of those fanservice shows so I didnt really wanted to hate this show for that reason. Around ep 5 I decided to pick up the manga as well since I heard good things about it, it was then when I realized what a mess this anime had become. They turned a good manga with interesting plot and good action, into a fanservice driven anime that had tunned down the action and REALLY changed the storyline just to turn it into an ecchi comedy. Also EVERY episode follows the same old formula, If I could describe a R+V episode it would be as follows:\\n\r\nTsukune meets Moka\\n\r\nTsukune meets an antagonist\\n\r\nTsukune gets in trouble\\n\r\nMoka tries to help\\n\r\nTsukune accidentally removes Moka's rosary\\n\r\nVampire Moka beats everyone up\\n\r\nEverything is happy again\\n\r\nThis same formula is applies for every episode of this show with exception of the last 2 episodes, which were good on its own right but still managed to butcher the goodness of the manga. If you watch animes to get a good story you wont find it here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As terrible as the story is, this anime's best feature was its animation. The colours were all great and the animation was fluent everytime. I failed to notice any sign of quality drop throughout the show. I will give this show props for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasnt bad, nothing really out of the ordinary. The ED song was really good though....IMO the best part of every episode was the end credits XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters of this anime are likeable, well Tsukune is the typicial guy who tries to help but ends up being helped instead because of its uselessness. Moka's normal form is a contrast to her vampire form as one is sweet and friendly and the other is rough and swift to act. To be honest my only motivation to finish this show was Shirayuki Mizore aka Ice Girl. Voiced by Kugimiya Rie it was nice to see her use a non loli voice and well the character itself IMO is awesome. She could've been the main character :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'll keep this simple, I didnt like this anime. It was hard to finish some episodes and then try my best not to drop it right after. Its safe to say I will not be watching the second season if they havent learned their lesson on this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rosario + Vampire was a rather disappointing show considering how Gonzo had a really good source to work with but decided to ruin it in order to bring ecchi comedy and pointless plot. If you are the type of person who likes this kind of ecchi comedy and mindless fanservice then R+V will be a good show for you to watch and I recommend it for you (also rejoice as a season 2 will be coming). For someone who likes a good story, dont bother, this anime is not worth it.",

            "content": "\"Side tracked from its original story and ended up being a half-baked series.\"\r\nBefore we begin, let me drill this into your mind. Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service; Fan service! That's the theme for this anime so don't start having high hopes for an amazing story or what not (at least nothing in comparison to the manga original). Rosario + Vampire, like many manga-to-anime adaptation series, made fans screamed with joy at first, but only to have their hopes and dreams shattered bit by bit as the anime progresses. It is true that the anime's story plot deviates from its origin, but itis also true that the artwork is astounding (the animation version of the characters look more attractive to me). So let us get into a deeper analysis of Rosario + Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe anime is considered pretty episodic (ie. standalone episodes) with a few exceptions near the end of the series. This goes parallel with its manga originals so it is nothing new to the readers. However, what is new is the extremely formulaic sequence in all episodes with an introduction to the &quot;monster of the episode&quot; (these monsters tend to get defeated and then become friends with the protagonists). Not only that, but the actual story coverage is also very minimal in the anime (only covered up to chapter 10 of the manga out of 40 chapters). But that is not to say it is all bad. In fact, certain portions of the story that were remade into anime were better planned (events flow smoother/made more logical sense) than the manga version. Overall, the story serve its purpose as an introduction to the Rosario + Vampire series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nConsistent animation quality throughout, beautifully animated characters, plus smooth transition from scene to scene, what more can you ask for? Gonzo, while not exactly known for extremely high quality animation (at least not at the level of KyotoAnimation), does indeed proved itself a worthy opponent to other studios in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP and ED are both very enjoyable for me (I didn't skip them like I did for a lot of other anime). It should not be an annoyance to you either (I hope). As for seiyu, there are many talented and well known professionals to voice for our pretty girls (and boys). For instance, there is the cute Rie Kugimiya voicing for the &quot;icy cold&quot; Mizore, and Saeko Chiba voicing for the &quot;very funny&quot; Ruby. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to bring the attention to Nana Mizuki who is the CV for our super hot/cute/pretty/gorgeous Moka and also the singer for the OP and ED of the series (and the singer for Capu2 as well). Nana is not only famous in the seiyu community, but is admired by all. She has an amazing ability to sing (even rivals those so-called &quot;professional&quot; singers) thanks to her powerful singing voice despite being a pretty tiny girl. She was also the winner of the &ldquo;Best Musical Performance&rdquo; award in the first Seiyu Awards. For those who have not yet experienced her excellent character voicing ability (and as a singer), I strongly suggest you give this series a try. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAside from the fact that most character's hidden abilities were not included in the anime, the show did a pretty good job with the characters. Plenty of character developments and showing their inner feelings toward each other (especially near the end when certain secrets were discovered). In addition, the interaction between the many different types of monsters can be quite refreshing from the traditional harem-oriented anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Final Thought:\\n\r\nJudging Rosario + Vampire solely as an anime, it has plenty of ups and downs. Judging it as an adaptation from a manga, it was pretty disappointing except for the animation and sound department. I recommend this to all people who have not yet read the manga (got some nice fan service), but for those who know the story already, you might want to skip this and move on.",

            "content": "Rosario Vampire is a typical male targeted anime filled with comedy, ecchi, and action. Typical school comedy with typical jokes associated with high school comedies. The \"special\" twist for this show would be that this school happens to be a school for monsters. To twist it even further, a human is accidentally accepted to the university and if he's found out he will literally be killed. Reading from the other reviews it appears that the manga had a \"real story and plot.\" ...lets think about it for a second. How can someone take a story so serious about a boy trying to survive a monsterschool? Regardless, this review will be biased based on the anime and not being tied to any book. \\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying, this show is about a human boy accidentally being accepted at a monster school. But on his way there the literally gets hit by a beautiful girl on a bike. Long story short, he finds out she's a vampire (hence the title), they hook up and the adventure begins. The episode structure is typically built the same for every episode: Story + new character + problem + fight = one Rosario vampire episode. Some shows don't pull that formula off very well (Jigoku Shoujo Season 1) but R+V does it pretty good. Each episode is very different from the last all thanks to being a high school full of monsters. Being a Japanese anime, it would be easy for them to follow the normal Japanese way and make their own random monsters. Thankfully, they pulled MOST of their monsters out of typical folklores and old wives tales like vampires, succubus, witches, etc ...with their own anime twist of course. At least they use east and and west references instead of making their own which is very refreshing. But the story line isn't the shows strong point....\\n\\n\r\nThis is an ecchi comedy and you will figure that out within the first 15 seconds of watching the show, that it's more ecchi than comedy. And the only way to be a successful ecchi show is if the art and animation is top of the line, this is where the show shines the most. All the backgrounds are hand painted with care. They even designed the school to resemble a Gothic style building with excellent accuracy. All the main and background characters are drawn with such perfection only an ecchi fan can understand. Every girl is drawn beautifully and have their own style. It even looks like they borrowed a few things from the book of Tenjo Tenge: Hairstyles, miniskirts, fighting, and even Moka acts alot like Aya Natusme But then again, they do pull off a few subtle spoofs and parodies. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters they're all very ...addicting. As an ecchi comedy they covered all bases of moe. You'll most likely get addicted to one or more of the main characters or villains. And to top it off, their voices are so mind numbingly addicting, you'll practically melt. (Kappuchuuu~). Apparently it's a requirement now that if you have fan service characters, their seiyu's have to have their own music cd. Each girl does have one and they even have some songs posted in the show. Be sure to look out for Kimiko Koyama (I'm listening while writing this ^_^) As for the op and ed songs, they fit perfectly for what you would expect from an anime titled Rosario Vampire. Other than the great music and great seiyu cast, the sound effects are pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nSure theres alot of fanservice in this show...it is an ecchi comedy after all. I don't understand why people are so surprised. This is the 21st century, movie/tv adaptations NEVER follow the book/manga. So haters should get over it or they will be constantly let down for the rest of their lives. Take this show for what it is... a fun ecchi comedy with great characters, fun fight scenes, and hilarious fanservice. I sure hope this show will last a few seasons.",

            "content": "R+V is an ecchi anime that has been received surprisingly good in my eyes. I mean, the only thing that makes it different are the elements of action which have found their way into each episode. It starts out with Tsukune Aono, the typical ecchi wimp main. He is starting high school, and due to some strange circumstances he ends up getting admitted into a youkai academy. On his way there he bumps into gets bumped into by a beauty, who's actually a vampire. She's supposedly one of the beauties in school, so you know what's coming... yeah, she ends up befriending the wimp, andhangs out with him all the time. But of course, she isn't the only one; soon there comes a girl who wants to steal him away, and on top of that, a tiny brat, tags along with the group, and there you have it! Standard ecchi setting deluxe!\\n\\n\r\nThe story fails to impress in any way aside the inital setting as well. Each episode brings about a new (mis)adventure for the group, which basically goes like this: Tsukune gets into bad company -> Hangs out with the girls -> The bad company comes to them -> The three girls kick ass + Moka transforms -> Tsukune whines -> Everyone gets happy after kicking ass -> End. And that's about it. The only refreshing thing is that it's actual action here, and that there's new youkai taking the role of bad guys every episode. But aside those, nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just about what you'd expect: The moe girl, her rival, a small girl (loli?), and the wimp they all stalk to death. Unoriginal, boring and non-developing, that's pretty much what there's to say about the characters. Both the recurring side characters and the ones who get renewed each episode brings out nothing specuial; they're just standard filler for their position, be it teacher or bad guy of the day. The only slightly refreshing thing was that Tsukune seemed like he wanted to actually help out in the fights, instead of being a wimp and passively receiving whatever assaults of love the girls threw at him. Props to him for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art department was okay, but nothing bragworthy. The backgrounds were nice, yet a little artsy, and the character designs, whuile generic, were pleasing enough. The action scenes were animated nicely, and no slumping in the special effects department either. There was too much fanservice, however.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty okay, and fit the series, but it was by no means anything special, and none of the tunes really captured me or made the scenes better. The OP and ED themes were good enough, fitting the series' atmosphere and all, but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, R+V is a failed attempt at an ecchi series, with plain characters and a boring story, but with an action element that served as decently refreshing and allowed for some plus points scored by the pathetic wimp main. And there's lots of fanservice, be warned.",

            "content": "Rosario + Vampire is a typical Shounen, Supernatural, Harem, Romantic, Comedy about an average, human, high school boy (Tsukune) who couldn\u2019t get into any private schools and was stuck going to a school for monsters. This may sound interesting but there\u2019s nothing particularly special about this set-up, since it is just your average school Rom/Com but with monsters. What\u2019s more is that each episode has some very predictable outcomes that get boring fast (monster appears, Moka transforms & sucks blood). So in the end, the weak and repetitive story turned this into a series that you can only enjoy once you turn off your brain.\r\nThere\u2019snothing unique about the characters, seeing how it does the same old thing; by having yet another \u201closer-kun\u201d male protagonist and surrounded by hot and cute girls. Their personalities usually match the way they look as well, so don\u2019t expect anyone to really stand out in this series, except maybe Mizore (snow girl). \\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is probably the best aspect, as the backgrounds and environments completely suit the ever changing horror atmosphere. Also everything is somewhat fluid, from the bouncing breast to swift action sequences. The music is also well done, especially during the short burst of action but it becomes fairly repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rosario + Vampire proved to be a somewhat entertaining Rom/Com that quickly turns into a typical harem, full of everything shounen (misunderstandings, ecchi, nosebleeds, etc.). Apart from the supernatural element, everything else is the same as in any typical school comedy with the usual clich\u00e9 situations we are all used to seeing. Fans of the manga will most definitely feel let down by the series, as it never managed to deliver the same story the manga produced and instead all it did deliver was an excessive amount of fanservice (100 panty shots per episode). Some may still enjoy this while the rest will wonder why you wasted your time on such a show.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Okay then, where to start? How about the fact that this was made by Gonzo. Now, before you go jumping down my throat, yes, Gonzo has made some really, REALLY good series, and are still making them today. However, they also have a very long list of bad shows they've produced as well.\r\nThis is one of those bad ones.\r\nI walked into this one having read the first two volumes of the manga and knowing fully that there was only a 50/50 chance of this series being any good. Unfortunately, my gamble didn't pay off. The first thing that bothers me is the fanservice. Yes, themanga also has copious amounts of it, but it takes a backseat to the plot. Here in the anime, the reverse is true. The show reverts to a cliched monster-of-the-week formula with no real tension in any of the situations because you know exactly how it will be resolved by the end of the episode. There are no over-arcing storylines and absolutely no character development.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, because there's a lot of potential here, with the setting they chose, putting a human in a school for monsters and all, but any clever setups we could have had are completely blown in favor of even more fanservice. The only consistent plot element is the insufferable on-again, off-again relationship between the two man characters, Tsukune and Moka, but even then, their arguments and troubles are not interesting, not sympathetic, and not really grounded in any sort of reality that would make us care for what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, that's also a place where the series falls flat on its ass. Moka and Tsukune are the only ones who have any real depth to them, and that's really only because of Moka's split personality, and their strained relationship. The rest of the characters, while having a few funny moments, only exist to create a little more conflict and to fill in the stereotypical rolls of a Harem anime: Kurumu's a bitch, Yukina's a loli, and Mizori's a quiet stalker. There, you know everything about them you'll ever need to know. Other characters, like Nekonome-sensei are actually far more fun to see, but they're only ever on screen for a small amount of time in each episode, if they're even featured at all. Oh, and since the villain changes every episode as well, don't expect any deep characterization for them either. They're all either perverts who want to get into one of the main characters' pants (by force if necessary) or want to prove their strength by maiming one of the heroes. There is one exception to this rule, but to avoid spoilers, I can't talk about her, and again, she only appears in like, two episodes before conforming to another stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to a different topic, the sound in this anime is probably the only really good part of this. The voice actors bring a lot of energy to their rolls, and it's competent enough, though a few of the characters do cross the annoyance line one too many times for my taste. The sound effects are also decent, if a little stock, though the one you'll probably hear the most often is the strange bouncing sound effect that happens whenever a female's breasts bounce. Yes, bouncing breasts have their own sound effect in this show. The music is also good, if a bit stock, and it has a good mixing of classical string scores and horn concertos, but there isn't a whole lot of variety.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well... it's Gonzo working on a school harem anime. The character designs are actually really well done and all of them do look very faithful to their original manga designs, though I do think a few of the coloring options for some of them was a tad strange... Kurumu having blue hair just doesn't seem right to me and Mizore's black and purple outfit and hair make me think she's going to turn into the Cheshire Cat at any moment. However, the designs are consistently good, but the animation itself is... well, Gonzo. Still frames abound, folks. Close-ups even moreso. Scenes of people running look a little choppy. You're getting the idea, I hope. The only parts that seem to be above this quality are during the fight scenes that take place in each episode, but these fights are so short (most of them end with a single blow, folks) that it's barely noticeable. The only other place that seems to have a budget on this show is the giggle physics. Seriously, an female who has breasts large enough to be noticeable, you will see jiggles and jumps all over the place that looks more fluent than the animation of the actual character.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said, I've only read the first two (out of a total of six) volumes of the manga, but even then, I still feel like I know more about the characters, their motivations, their thoughts, and their personalities than after watching all thirteen episodes of this series. The characters aren't interesting and at best only serve to further the plot while at worst just exist for more fanservice, the plot is nonexistent and the characters (if you haven't figured out by now) aren't strong enough to drive the story forward, and while the main focus would appear to be on Moka and Tsukune's relationship, absolutely nothing changes or gets resolved at all by the end of the series!\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, if you're really interested, skip the anime, skip the second season (capu 2) and just pick up the manga instead! trust me, you'll be glad you did... but hey, I do have one good thing to say about this: at no point during the series do any of the vampires sparkle!",

            "content": "Rosario+Vampire Review:\r\nRosario+Vampire was one of the first anime I ever watched. Due to this, I hold this show very close to my heart and may have a positively biased opinion so excuse me if it shows through. However, after revisiting the show and re-evaluating how good it actually is, I have to say that this show is perfectly \"meh.\"\r\nStory - 4.5/10:\r\nOne thing that I have noticed MANY people complain about with this anime, is that it basically disgraces the manga. Both the anime and the manga have the same introductory premise of a high school boy named Tsukune accidentally being enrolled in a school formonsters. During his time here, he develops his own harem consisting of various sexy monster babes with different personalities. However, while the manga grows from this premise and turns into an action packed, exciting ride, the anime decides to settle in this groove and remain a standard high school harem with a monster twist. Now, I am not saying this is a bad thing, but from a story perspective, yes, this means the anime is not as good as the manga. However, the anime does succeed in creating some funny moments, and somewhat unique plotlines due to its unique concept. It by no means has any emotional depth, riveting action, or psychological themes. However, the story in Rosario+Vampire is not \"bad\", it is merely just your average harem storyline with a monster twist.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5.4/10:\\n\r\nWhen I first saw this show I thought the animation was fantastic.... Oh how wrong I was. The main reason I thought the art was good, is because my prior anime experiences were with the likes of Girls Bravo, Pokemon, and DBZ, however, after watching more anime I have concluded that the art for this show is 100% average. The character designs were good at times, especially when we got to see the students change into monster form, however, for many reasons, this show does not stand out art-wise. First off, there is basically only one location, the school. Add in the fact that there are plenty of still frames and you can easily notice that not a lot of budget was needed for this show. There was also no eye-catching lighting or color schemes to go with it. The art wasn't poor, but not much better than average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6.5/10:\\n\r\nHere's where my nostalgia factor for this show might bring some bias. I really liked the music for this show. More specifically, I really liked the openings to this show. This remains true to this day and will likely not change. However, the voice acting could be cringe worthy at times and was extremely up and down for me. Add in the poor script and listening to those english voice actors could be painful. But none the less, the soundtrack was enjoyable for me and by no means was the voice acting \"bad\", just not good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5.2/10:\\n\r\nI really wanna give this section a higher score but I know I can't. The manga has made me fall in love with the characters, but when i look back at the anime and how it portrayed the characters.... ehhh. I watched the anime first, and was pretty up and down about the characters, and now that I know more about the standard character archetypes, I am even more meh about the characters. Tsukune is the standard wimpy lead for a harem, and the girls are all typical archetypes (the caring one, the tomboy, the shy one, the loli). Even though the characters were all standard, they were likeable for the most part and for this reason I consider them slightly above average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6.5/10:\\n\r\nLike I said: This was one of my first anime. For that reason, I really enjoyed this show when I first watched it. If I hadn't gotten to this show until let's say a week ago, I probably would drop it. But due to the fact that I watched it so early, I did really enjoy it. It was funny, the characters were likeable, and occasionally they will include some interesting fight scenes. The scenarios that the characters found themselves in tended to be interesting and definitely kept me enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.62:\\n\r\nIt might be a lot different than the manga, but Rosario+Vampire's anime adaptation holds its own. It isn't really overwhelmingly impressive in any area, but it definitely does what it has to do in order to be an above average harem. I recommend watching the anime before reading the manga to prevent disappointment, because (especially for fans of harem anime) the anime is worth a shot. If you enjoy harem romcoms, definitely watch this show. However, if you are just looking for a new show to watch, don't expect too much from this show because it really is barely above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nAn average high school harem with a monster twist.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ OPs are catchy\\n\r\n+ Solid comedy\\n\r\n+ Good concept\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Plot has no direction\\n\r\n- Manga fans will be disapointed\\n\r\n- English dub is inconsistent\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Rosario Vampire, watch...\\n\r\nGirls Bravo:\\n\r\nIf you liked the over the top adult humor that focused mainly on oversexual jokes and enjoy watching harems, this show is right for you.\\n\r\nSekirei:\\n\r\nIf you liked the harem idea (and boobs), but were more interested in the action than the comedy, Sekirei is for you.\\n\\n\r\n5.62 - Alright",

Like the art teacher. she was in the beging and the end too! how do you skip that? On the witches hill made my head hurt.that was also change at points that made no sense. the last of this horror story was the end. they tried to\"stay with the manga\" but failed! I mean if you cut out plot points it will make no sense , to bother. they wrap it up so badly if you try to think how does this make any sense at the school and what they heard about aono just does not make any sense.\\n\r\nart: was great! this is how anime should be done! the back grounds to the characters.\\n\r\nsound: was ok. at some points it grinded on my nerves ( like ever time there was a romic sense). but the songs in it was good.\\n\r\ncharacters: sigh.......I  love them in the manga but in the anime was bad! everyone seem to try way to hard to get aono's love. the manga was not like that. missing some ( art teacher) and chainging others badliy (Ginie).\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\nwas only had in the few esp. they did right. which was not a lot. why did they have so many panty shot's?

However, with the overwhelming focus on T&A shots, There's no way for me to enjoy this.  As a note, add 2-3 points to my \"Overall\" score if you really like fanservice.",

It is an unquestionable 10/10 for me.\r\nRosario + Vampire, the anime adaption, on the other hand is complete garbage and remains one of the biggest fuck ups in the history of anime. \r\nThe anime version of Rosario + Vampire takes out everything good that was in the manga (the story, meaningful character relationships) and replaces it with fan service.\r\nGonzo basically took one of the best mangas and COMPLETELY ruined it with fanservice. A little bit of fan service is okay once in a while (I don't like it though), but Rosario + Vampire bases its entire show on fan service. Gonzo basically exploited a masterpiece and turned it into trash to earn a couple bucks.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about Tsukune Aono. In the manga, Tsukune is a three diminsional character who gradually learns how to adapt to a dangerous school full of monster. I'm not going to say how, cause that will spoil the story. But in the anime, Tsukune is a stereotypical loser who somehow gets a harem of the hottest girls in school - I HATE this cliche. Why are all the characters so stereotypical and one dimensional?\\n\\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing redeeming about this anime adaption of Rosario + Vampire. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime needs to be remade correctly!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is dumb fun, and then there is just plain asinine. Rosario + Vampire tries hard to convince us that it is the former, it tries very hard. The show is openly aware of how stupid it can get, and happily points out how dumb it is being as its main source of comedy. Unfortunately, this is not only a flimsy source of comedy that only occasionally works, it also makes it irritatingly evident that the plotting is shoddy and the characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed; plus that the show was made to blatantly exhibition girls' cleavage. This results in a fan-service comedy thatis more obnoxious than it ever is funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe poor idiot in the middle of this mess is Tsukune, a human who ends up going to a school for monsters through ridiculous circumstances; namely being sent there by his parents that know nothing about the school (well, aren't they responsible) after he failed the high school entrance exam. Luckily for him, Yokai Academy is a school which is meant to teach monsters to co-exist with humans; all students are required to take human form and stay that way. Here he meets the obvious main love interest, a vampire named Moka. Moka is a nice girl with a bad habit of drinking Tsukune's blood, and has a separate personality that emerges when the rosary on her neck is removed. He also meets other girls that eventually try gaining his love, like the big boobed succubus girl, and the loli witch gir... you know what, none of this really matters. It is basically the same set up as any harem anime, with a bunch of extraneous details that either don't add much to the story, or are used to incredibly stupid effect.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show has a monster-of-the-week format, with silly school yard shenanigans and fan-service thrown in, of course. Most episodes go like this: Tsukune attends class and hangs out with Moka and other members of his growing harem; one of the monsters attending the school starts causing troubles for their group; when a confrontation finally flairs up, Tsukune removes Moka's rosary and she kicks the monster's ass; rinse and repeat. Needless to say, this formula gets boring quickly, but the show keeps at it with about three-fourths of the episodes more or less going like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also implements every trite trope found in any anime with a school setting, like the harem of friendly love-rivals, the pool and beach episodes, and so on. This is something that the show is fully aware of. There is this token animal mascot talking bat that appears often, and spouts wise-cracks about the characters' ridiculous behavior, how cliche a certain event is, or just says something during scene changes. This bat has to be one of the most annoying and obnoxious of mascot characters; he isn't the least bit funny because he comments on the most pointless of things, and he never says anything that is remotely witty. It is obvious what the show was going for with this, but it just completely fails. All it really does is make more apparent how poor the writing in the show is, and that the writers are aware how bad it is; this comes across as if they just didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nAs lackluster as the comedy is, the show's attempt drama in the show is even worse. Most of the show's dramatics revolve around things getting in the way of Tskune and Moka's developing relationship... if it can even be called that. All there is between them is Tskune fawning over how pretty and nice Moka is, and Moka drinks his blood as if he was a drinking fountain but still wanting to be his friend/ love interest. There really isn't any depth or dynamic between the two even the show tries to convince us there is. Any other attempt at drama similarly fails because the characters are barely developed to be anymore than trite stereotypes found in this kind of show, so it is hard to care about any of them. Even the stuff about Yokai Academy being a school which teaches monsters to fit into human society goes out the window when Tskune is revealed to be a human, sending the entire student body to form a mob calling for his blood, while the faculty deciding to do nothing for no other reason than to make things needlessly dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Rosario + Vampire is the definition of laziness. It isn't that it is terrible, it is just so damn generic looking. Girls with boobs that rival watermelons, flat chested lolis, really dumb looking hooligans, squirmy nerd losers, and a rainbow assortment of hair colors; every stereotype associated with anime character designs can be found in this show. The backgrounds are similarly bland, although admittedly the haunted looking woods surrounding the school are done pretty well. There are a lot of short cuts taken in the animation, in fact almost everything that is animated is a short cut. The use of music is unremarkable as is the soundtrack itself; mostly filled with bubbly pop compositions that accentuate silly moments, or slightly more aggressive compositions during tenser moments, so it is fitting but nothing sticks long after the scene passes.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up, don't watch Rosario + Vampire. It is a show that encapsulates almost everything bad about modern anime. Characters are plastic stereotypes; Tsukune is a thoroughly uninteresting male lead, and all the girls are little more than walking fan-service. Ecchi anime are usually dumb fun best not taken seriously, but that is hardly an excuse for a show to be so poorly written and so lazily executed. What's worse is that the show actually takes a stab at drama that is so hackney that it drags the show even lower than the decidedly low standards it set for itself. It doesn't even qualify as dumb fun, it is just embarrassing.\\n",

            "content": "I don\u2019t even know where to begin to talk about this mess of an anime. Why this is such a popular anime is completely mind boggling to me. Is it because it\u2019s trash? Is it because it\u2019s just so much of a mess, it\u2019s completely confusing everyone?\r\nEssentially, this is a story revolving around a gary stu. The main character is less than mediocre, and as to why an apparently amazing vampire is in love with his ugly perverted, absolutely useless self is absolutely beyond me.\r\nThe other main character is of course a mary sue. She is loved by all, immensely powerful, confident, etc. As towhy a supposedly \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d character would somehow hang around some sack of shit that isn\u2019t even supposed to go to that school is bizarre. And this little girl witch is supposed to make him fall in love with her too? (Okay, are we even going to address how that little girl is catering to the literal pedophiles of the audience? She\u2019s supposed to be seen as this innocent little girl that he\u2019s going to love. What the fuck? Get that loli stuff out of my face. Not to mention, they body shame her for having the smallest breasts in the show. WHY ARE YOU SEXUAIZING A LITTLE GIRL?)\\n\r\nWhy are people involved with him? He is not even remotely attractive in any way possible. I could see how a vampire would be attracted, as she needs blood. (The way she bites him is very annoying and cutesy, by the way.) Why is he the main character when a toothpick would be more relevant to the plot? Why does this anime exist?\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre. It\u2019s your typical anime series type of art, and every once in a while you\u2019ll see the style improve. (Of course, it\u2019s when the mary sue gets all powerful..) Also I would like to understand why on Earth it was necessary to ever add in a panty shot. Did we really need to see this? Is that necessary? Did seeing her \u201coh so sexy\u201d underwear further the plot? Did it help the audience really understand the struggles these characters go through? Not at all. These are high school girls. They aren\u2019t adults. Save the ecchi for a show with older characters.\\n\r\nThe logic in this series is an absolute mess, and it goes against the very (weak) fabric of the meaning of these characters. The main girl character is this amazing and all powerful vampire that can only really be that powerful once in a while? Okay, bye. Where are her REAL weaknesses? I\u2019d love to know, and I\u2019m sure the rest of the audience would like to as well.\\n\r\nFurthermore, a succubus that attacked the gary stu once and then realized she was \u201cin love\u201d and wanted to \u201cmanually make him fall in love with her\u201d? What the hell is this? The job of a succubus is to use men for sex, not to be romantically attracted to them. Even her mom points this out and she decides to ignore the obvious.\\n\r\nALSO the gary stu sometimes looks at other girls, unsurprisingly. And the mary sue gets upset EVEN THOUGH his crush on her is extremely obvious and she isn\u2019t requiting it? There is literally no reason for you to be jealous, you two aren\u2019t dating. There was no communication of this at all.\\n\r\nEvery second of this anime made me suffer, every \u201ckyu~\u201d and \u201cmochaaaa!\u201d made my ears bleed. Whoever edited this anime has my respect, I can barely watch this sack of shit once, god forbid several times. Don\u2019t watch this anime, for the love of god. I don\u2019t care if you want to watch it ironically or for a joke. Not even then would this anime be enjoyable. Don\u2019t waste your time. Take up literally almost anything but this trash. Love yourself.",

Having read all the way to chapter 33 of the manga I can say this for sure; the story is changed in a way that removes the depth of the characters and situations. The real problem is the Fan service, there is far too much. This anime had so much potential in the first few episodes, then the excess of fan service obliterated the depth of the story.\r\nFrom an artistic perspective the animation is of very good quality, the backgrounds are drawn very well and itis a pleasure to watch. If you love fan service than his anime will not disappoint you in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening and ending themes also performed by Nana Mizuki are nice to get you into the watching mood. The songs during the episodes become quite annoying at times; however, the voice actors are very well suited to the personality of their characters, Nana Mizuki's performance as Moka is very good, and one of the best followed closely by Kugimiya, Rie as Shirayuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters much like the story suffer the transition from manga to anime, however, the voice cast manages to make up for the shortcomings and bring the characters to life and make it fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love supernatural, fan service, cute girls, good voice acting and a pretty decent story, watch this anime.\\n\r\n(However)\\n\r\nIf you love supernatural, fan-service, cute girls, a very good story, and romance, read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good, it really is! I just happen to like substance over Fan service, as such; I will have to say that the manga is better than the anime.\\n",

            "content": "Having officially read the Manga a couple of days ago I pondered why I originally gave this show a 9 in the past when in all honesty it is incomparable to the manga in terms of plot, character and wait for it ~ external character design.\r\nBut nevertheless both the show and manga succeeded in their own intended ways, both were done good so to say. Removing the manga out of this discussion for the sake of the review  Rosario Vampire is a episodic series following a simple plot:\r\nMediocre guy who couldn't pass his HS entrance exams with no special talents gets admitted and sentaccidently to a a private school called Yolki academy ~ which plot twist is an academy that trains monsters to cope with blending in with the human realm. He meets a vampire named Moka. In the context of the series vampires are 'S Class' monsters or top tier monsters in battle. She protects and helps him develop his inner personality as they together study at the school throughout the plot. A harem is developed and mini adventures are made ect.. But each episode adds an element to the plot that is revealed as a arc in the end of this series. So there's no existential angst involved.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIts episodic and follows the same syntax:\\n\\n\r\nwhile(more episodes) {\\n\\n\r\nif (fow) == male {\\n\r\n bringin (Moka);\\n\r\nfow = null;\\n\\n\r\nelse if (fow == female){\\n\r\n bringin (Moka);\\n\r\nfow.savedbyProtagonist;\\n\r\nharem++;\\n\r\n }\\n\r\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nShueisha did a good job at animating the characters and monsters invovled. There was alot of imagination involved in the show and although not spectacular it did a good job in portraying the characters emotions and scenery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  4/10 (Character Design 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTypical harem characters. A mediocre guy with a good heart, a shy introverted sub-protagonist. But each of the girls is a monster with special abilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFan Service 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRV is the opiate of fan-service. The type of 'soul food' you need when watching anime. Let me elaborate. In the past I witnessed countless anime that were centred around similar plot styles. However the way they included fan service involve naked girls or devices/monsters that tore clothing (sigh).  \\n\r\nI like to call it forced fan service. With the exception of miniskirts Rosario Vampire added an element of 'Inner Moko' which I wont spoil but added a excellent type of treat for the fans that made them claw for her to show and develop herself more. I wont spoil it but youll see how this anime is separated from the usual harem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nif (intelligence < ....)\\n\\n\r\nNo Im joking. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it and watched the series within a day. \\n\\n\\n",

And make sure to keep them chaste, it would be such a SHAME if this wish-fulfillment centered premise actually fulfilled anyone's wishes. Or made jokes that were funny. Or had characters that were likable instead of half-assed archetypes. The characters have no sort of synergy or chemistry with one another, only existing to pad out each episode's runtime with tired, predictable hijinks that elicit more groans than laughs.Lead \"love interest\" Moka's interactions with Tsukune are so stilted and unbelievable you'd think the guy who wrote them was raised by robots who spoke like Microsoft Sam. \\n\r\n Really, any sort of effort put into the story or characters world could have made it at least passable. As it stands, it's a tired, cynical attempt to cash in on teenagers who like staring at objectified girls fawn over someone they can project themselves onto.\\n\r\nOne cringeworthy entry in the harem subgenre to stand with all the others.",

Douchebags that watch ecchi and then bitch about fanservice\r\n2. The Manga Readers (fair enough Ifeel for you guys)\\n\\n\r\nTo the people who haven't read the manga, watch it its a great romcom that will make you laugh until your onto the second season.\\n\\n\r\nTo the people who have read the manga and not seen the show, you most probably wont enjoy it to the adaption is a kick in the dick for all readers. But it is still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now onto the review\\n\\n\r\nThe basic plot is about the main character Tsukune ends up accidently in a school only for monsters. Where he meets Moka a vampire, who becomes really powerful when her rosario seal is removed and an inner personality is revealed. Tsukune faces many troubles but is able to build up a harem over the season etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt is quite good nothing amazing but still effective for creating a good show. The music and the sound were also effective and a strong point towards the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- a reasonable amout of character development is good with the usual harem stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThough reading the manga i still enjoy this show and its a good couple of hours that you wont miss. Finishing it with you stomach sore from laughter.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime it is a good show that people should at least try.\\n\\n\r\nI hope its helpful! Cheers and have a good one!\\n\\n",

This show should just be labeled as Yuri or Hentai. Those two categories have absolutely zero plot. Yet i gave it a six because it tried to make something out of it, i'll give it that. I can stomach the first few episodes, after that it's fanservice and more fanservice.\r\nArt - 8/10 (B)\r\nWell, for a really lame show, it still looks pretty, right? \r\nSound - 7/10 (C-)\r\nI'll admit it, i'm hooked on Nana Mizuki's singing, including \"Discotheque\" forthe second season. Forgive me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10 (D)\\n\r\nThis show has everything a school themed show should have: The perverted girls trying to flirt with the protagonist every episode in at least one scene, the male protagonist who can't turn away from yuri for 5 seconds, and the occasional geek or added-in character.  Rosario + Vampire brings all those kinds of characters we &quot;love&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 6/10 (D)\\n\r\nHonestly, a show such as Rosario + Vampire gives anime a bad name for being called porn and slutty. Bible Black has more of a plot than this (Bible Black is a hentai, by the way.) Heck, even NARUTO has a better plot. But it can somewhat repair with the talent singing of the dual voice acting/singing talents of the Rosario cast. Each episode has professional-grade animation other shows should use. For a plot-less show, the Art is top notch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: Animation, BGM.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Plot, character depth, basically everything.",

But luckily, a few of the episodes don't have muchof it (most of the fan service scenes are at the beginning of the series). Also the anime have some good fight scenes that you can see in almost every episode and the fighting scenes are really short unlike other shows.\\n\r\nI gave sound a 9, because the sound was well and there was no pitch problems.\\n\r\nI gave the characters an 8 because the characters are original, but you either have to like or hate the characters. Plus I really love the character Nazo Koumori who's a bat that provides useless information most of the time.\\n\r\nOverall, I've really enjoyed the series so I gave both a 10. I really liked this anime because of the comedy, fight scenes, and the romance in it. This is one of my favorites anime and I really hope they make a second season. I didn't really focused on the fanservice scenes and if you are going to watch this anime, don't focus on the fanservice or you might hate the series and give up on it before you have a chance to like it.

This theme has been done before and done to death, and the overabundance of panty shots (second in number only to Najica Blitz Tactics) just further pigeonholes this anime into the mediocre ecchi territory held by Steel Angel Kurumi and Ai Yori Aoshi.  \r\nSo what sets Rosario Vampire apart?  I can'tin good conscience see anyone as taking this anime seriously.  Every character, episode, and scene is done so ridiculously over-the-top and bizarrely cliched that it's really impossible to accept Rosario Vampire as anything but a joke.  It does for harem anime what Nadesico did for teen pilot mecha anime.  Stunningly beautiful art and animation (even if what is depicted typically consists of booties, boobies, and panties) only serves to enhance the eye candy that this series strives to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have the ability to embrace the cheesy, ignore trite and overtroped plotlines and characterizations, and crack up head over heels laughing at the joke this series is, then Rosario Vampire is the show for you.",

Tsukune, our male main character, is a human who's parents accidentally sent him to a monster only school. He runs into a vampire named Moka, who is becomes his friend. It's painfully obviously that they like each other, however nothing really happens in the end. Tsukune just ends up with a harem ofmonster girls who save him from other monsters, leaving him feeling helpless. So he tries to become stronger (with some help of Moka's vampire blood). Most of the scenes are just people groping each other though, with an attempt of humor sprinkled in. AND OH MY GOD, every single time Moka transforms into her other personality (which is every episode) the narrator has to say the exact same thing EVERY TIME. I found this highly annoying. The ending is very unsatisfying for both seasons. In all honesty, just read the manga.",

This review will also be spoiler free.\r\nThe story follows Tsukune, a human who is going to a highschool for monsters (you find this out in the first episode so it isn't a spoiler). From there the story mostly just develops into a full blown harem. There isn't much actual story or character development besides the typical boy meets girl, boyfalls for girl, but there are like 4 other girls as well. \\n\\n\r\nNow, you are probably wondering how I can give this series a 9 even though the story is atrocious? Well the art does help, and the voice acting isn't bad (English Dub), but the biggest this was that I found it funny. Ya, there are constant up-skirts, and there are copious amounts of fan-service. But at the end of the series, I honestly enjoyed watching it. I felt as though the characters where likable, there were good comedic moments and ya, I did enjoy some of the fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this to everyone? Probably not. I would recommend this to someone familiar with the ecchi genre, and I would do so with the fore warning not to expect much in the way of story line or character development.",

During the time I was watching this, I was constantly laughing just overall having a good time. \r\nSome people don't like Ecchi jokes, but when you incorporate it into a funny setting then it just all seems to flow evenly. One funny situation after another.\r\nLaughter is the best medicine!\r\nFrom all the art styles that I've seen, this one has to be one of the most clean cut well drawn styles. Which is also a factor of enjoyment when watching it.\r\nAnother reasonfor my Rating with this anime is the characters. When watching something it is important to have balanced characters that have different personalities. There are a lot of different personalities in Rosario + Vampire, which makes it diverse. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it was very enjoyable and I recommend this if you want to watch something that is perverted and funny!\\n\\n\r\n- WafflesForLunch\\n\r\n             (#) \"Where there's a waffle, there's a way\"",

Noooooo.\r\nThis show is 97% fan service for the male viewers.\r\nAlmost every scene is filled with jiggling boobs and panty-shots. Now, if they had some female fan service (ie, undressing some of the BOYS every so often), then maybe I'd be able to sit through it a little better. \r\nSeriously,this had a good plot going, from what I could tell! All of the fan service ruined it. I'm surprised I lasted 5 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nPlease, do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this if you're looking for a show with decent plot and humor.

A human goes to a monster school by mistake and gets lots of female friends that all want his D. Every other episode besides 1, 12 and 13 are all filler and all have the same exact tone to them and the same things happen in each one. 5/10\r\nArt: The art was pretty good. The (rare) fight scenes were done pretty well and nothing looked \"bad\" but it wasn't amazing quality.7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was okay. The opening and closings were okay and all the BGM's were okay...nothing really stood out much at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters have at least some development, but the male lead is not very bearable. He pretty much sucks. All the girls are rather odd but I can live with them. None of the supporting characters have development and only appear in 1 or 2 episodes. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I sort of enjoyed it. I liked the first episode thinking to myself \"This has a lot of potential\" but got bored with the show by the 6th episode, but eventually finished it anyway. The last two episodes were good, so it ending on a semi-strong point. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Rosario + Vampire is an anime that has little story and really wants to revolve around lots and lots of fan service, so don't watch it wanting a good plot.",

            "content": "This can be summed up in two words: harem fanservice. Granted this is more or less the angle taken in the manga as well so no one should be too surprised with this. Besides, i'm a fan of some good ol fanservice so I dont see this as a problem. \r\nThe story stays pretty close to the manga, well the first quarter of the manga since thats about all the farther the show takes things. The episodes are mainly stand-alone but thats okay because thats also how the manga was, difference is that with the manga this kinda bored me, but here that didnt happen.Obviously they come together at the end for some fairly good stuff. \\n\r\nThe animation was great, It was exactly what I was hoping for when I decided to watch this. \\n\r\nThe characters were... characters to say the least. Mokas still that hot red eyed badass, kurumu is still kinda sluttyish, mizore still stalks the shit outta people, yukari is that annoying-as-shit brat, and tsukune is still that pussy whos afraid of his own shadow but you know, apparently chicks dig that. Its a dynamic bunch if nothing else and it works well.\\n\r\nThe fights however were something that should have been improved because they were all weak as shit, but once again thats how it was in the manga anyways.  I suppose if we wanted good fights we would just go watch some action show, rather than an ecchi harem show. Honestly the thing that made the fights fun was when the bat would show up at the end and anounce how long that episodes big showdown was, using seconds as his unit of measurement. So essentailly in a 6 hour show there were between 10~15 minutes of fight scenes.\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed watching it because I was a fan of the manga so when I heard there was a show I jumped all over that. One thing that kinda pissed me off in the show is that tsukune never went super ghetto badass vampire on anyone but whatever, the show worked out just fine.",

So I began as clean as possible.\r\nBefore I continue I would like to point out that I have not read the original Manga. This is a flaw and I understand that a lot of people are going to hate me because of that. My point is however that I want to write this review while the anime is still fresh in my memory.\r\nYou might call it unprofessional, I call it convience.\r\nWell it's a harem anime(likethere aren't enough of that) with a special touch. After I had watched the first episode I was mindblown! Everything just fitted together like a well made puzzle. To be honest I found it hard to find any real critisism about this anime(well beside for the big one which I will come back about later). All I can do is nitpick. The art is pretty good although I did find some flaws in the final episode. The sound is brilliant, I especially like the ending song! The characters are a bit one sided but they change over time. There is also a huge amount of pantyshots but I don't consider that a huge flaw. The shots are spread pretty thin over the anime so it doesn't get in your face a lot. The anime is just overall enjoyable.\\n\r\nThere is however one thing that bothered me(now the big one comes).\\n\r\nIf you watch this anime you will find yourself getting a bit bored after about 6 episodes. You see this anime follows a certain rule every episode. (i'll try if I can do this without spoilering) Tsukune and Moka are happy together, A challenger appears, Moka beats the crap out of the challenger and that's it. Although this formula works well in the beginning of the series it get's repetative after about 5 episodes. I really had to push myself to watch episode 7, 8 and 9! Luckily the producers found out of the mistake they made and after episode 9 they decided to make the plot a lot more exciting and change the formula! This makes the final episodes a lot better!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah... A overall very good anime with a few little flaws. So if you are watching this anime and you are stuck one a episode.. Just continue watching. It get's a lot better in time!",

            "content": "Story: The idea behind this story is a neat twist on the generally bland ecchi and harem genre. A boy named Tsukune Aono becomes enrolled on accident to Youkai Academy, a school for monsters! Tsukune is just your average boy with nothing going for him, typical of this genre, but he soon finds himself in a very unusual situation. He first meets a girl with pink hair, Moka, who he very quickly finds is a vampire, but she also harbors a secret identity within. There is a rosary around her neck, that when taken off, she becomes a super powerful vampire. Through the rest ofthe series, he makes friends with a succubus named Kurumu, the ice woman Mizore, and a young witch named Yukari.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the first and last two episodes pertaining to the main story of him actually being a human within a world for monsters, the rest of the episodes are just about his daily life with these people and how he meets them. This generally involves Tsukune getting beat up or mind controlled by them, and then ends up accidently pulling off Moka's rosary to release her powerful vampire side. The powerful Moka then proceeds to beat up the person real quick, then by the end, the person becomes a good friend. While this seems a very poor way to make these people into friends, it is done rather well, and the events from one episode to the next flow together nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a six. While the first and last parts of the series tell a decent tale, there really is not much else to it. During many parts of the series, it almost become hard to tell Tsukune is having troubles being a human in a monster school, other than when his friends use their monster powers, but then is quickly forgotten again. Through the series, many characters comment on how he smells like a human, but no one really questions it until the very end, to bring out the main conflict of the story. Apparently these monsters have excellent smelling capabilities, but cannot really tell with Tsukune, so little things like this do not make much sense. Other than these few gripes, the rest of the story was pretty enjoyable and even got me a little excited during some of the parts, especially towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animations were excellently done and consistent throughout the series. Colors were used very liberally and the backgrounds were well done and detailed pretty decently as well. The art for the backgrounds also did a great job for setting up a feel for the area the characters were in. The characters were drawn very different from each other and made each character stick out in certain ways, making them pretty memorable characters. The animation deserved a ten from me; it was just well done and really helped enhance the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound used was just as well done as the animation. The sound effects were great and were not overbearing at all. The music was perfectly done and fit the style of the anime perfectly, and were also fit within the anime at the most appropriate times, setting the different moods just right. The voice acting was also very good. Each voice fit the character perfectly and only added to the enjoyment of the characters. This was done well enough for a ten.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were quite entertaining and done just right. Each character was given a decent amount of screen time to tell their story and to go through the process of conflict and resolution, to become friends with Tsukune. The only bad thing was some of the characters did not have enough screen time after their story, such as Mizore and another witch met later, Ruby. These characters could have been given a little more screen time instead of being practically background props. Other than that, I decided to give the characters an eight. I was not quite as hard on the series for this only because it is only thirteen episodes long and the story did a decent enough job of presenting the characters, given it is an ecchi harem comedy, which is not known for having the best character developments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, this series earned a seven from me. It was definitely one of the few series within this particular genre to try and go above and beyond the standard and was successful. The comedy in this was also not too shabby. It had me laughing in many parts, but the parts where there was comedy, they were not inappropriately placed. This series had a pretty good mix of seriousness with comedy and is definitely worth a look if you enjoy this genre of anime. I do not believe you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "After watching this anime i was convinced that all anime must be great like this one, it ceased to amaze me that an anime about a human trying to adjust in a monster world could make such deep connections with my own life! The story was great, we followed Tsukune (human) through his high school career at a school for monsters where he meets such friends as Kurumu Korono (Succubus) and Gin Sempai (Werewolf) and even falls slowly in love with Moka Akashiya ( S-Class Monster - Vampire), throughout many silly or serious adventures Tsukune keeps his deep secret about being human between himself andMoka buried, but slowly and surely the others suspect that he's not all that he claims to be.... The Art was great, and was one of the main reason i was attracted to the show, the detail put into the very colourful backgrounds and characters is what made this show a very excellent one, then my opinion was further increased by the excellent sounds, i rather was emotionally affected by the great soundtrack music of the show, in fact i admit i cried to the sad music many times and still do :P The characters made this show what it was, though it had a great look and sound, an anime always needs characters you can relate to, in whcih ase they nailed it, cause i find myself able to relate to every one of the fully developed characters, such as Mizore (Ice woman) who i admit is a better stalker then me! Overall i enjoyed everything about this show and i highly recommend it :P",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, gather round.\r\nWe take another look at \"Rosario To Vampire\".\r\nI will not be watching the second season, and I absolutely detest the manga of everything ever written. So for those of you who have an opinion about the second season, or manga in general; none of that will have any bearing on what I use as the source material for my review.\r\nWie will be examining the anime of \"Rosario To Vampire\", and nothing else.\r\nThe only reason I decided to initially start watching this anime was because it was on the list of anime published by 'Gonzo', the publishers of anime I like, such as\"WitchBlade\", and several that are pretty well rated by people that watch a lot of anime, like 'Gantz' and 'Full Metal Panic'. But publishing doesn't tell us the whole story does it?\\n\\n\r\nCurious however, for me; is the outright hatred, many of the reviewers, have for \"Rosario to Vampire\". And for that reason, I think a little balance is a very good thing.\\n\\n\r\nI am really beginning to detest comments like 'episodic', for one. This term is too often used as an attempt at a mild insult, as if it were a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nDoes no one seem to \"Get\" television? Some of the finest television, made in the U.S., were episodic. \"Twilight Zone\", \"Outer Limits\", \"StarTrek (the entire television universe of series)\", \"Battlestar Galactica (both series)\", \"Babylon 5\"; and dozens of others were, and still are entirely episodic. While many of these shows had story arcs within them, sometimes for a dozen episodes, at their base was still episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nSome of which, if watched by themselves, were entirely awful. Not because it was an 'episode', but because at the end of that particular story, the episode itself didn't pass muster and should never have been made.\\n\\n\r\nEach one of the great television shows, had something in common. The sum-total of the product held up, even when they contained a few bad episodes. The stories held the attention of the viewer, over the seasons it was broadcast. The characters were consistent and true to themselves. And the music became the stuff of television history.\\n\\n\r\nBut the largest mistake we make, as watchers of Japanese anime (other than those that actually watch anime in Japan on Japanese Television [because they're the only ones that actually will get this point]), is that we make a judgement about anime after we have marathon'd the whole 24+ episodes or so of a show, and then we have the audacity to get all huffy ... because it seems 'episodic'? I hate to burst everyone's bubble; but these shows were all meant, in the main, to be shown one at time on a weekly basis. Not continuously.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, we get to the reviewers who have the nerve to use 'episodic', so they can sound like they know from where they speak. In other words, too many of us use this term as a crutch, as a trading coin on your belief system.\\n\\n\r\nAnother term, that really gets me upset; then I'll quit on this topic. That term is \"fan service\".\\n\\n\r\nLook folks, most anime (including the genuine art-pieces), are done for one reason, and one only. And that's so a bunch of guys/gals can make a living at drawing pictures. Something they love. But an artist has to eat. So they choose material they think will attract a large enough demographic to make a living. So they tease a bit, and sometimes more than a bit, with a little view of skin; or the implication that we might see some. And the gender doesn't seem to matter (even when the targets are predominantly female, the point remains).\\n\\n\r\nIf a person really has a problem with \"fan service\" and then he goes on to watch all of the episodes of an anime; one then has a legitimate right to question how strong the moral outrage really is. Even I'm guilty of being somewhat critical of \"fan service\", but only when there is the intention to harm a character by that contribution to the anime. In other words, did the 'fan service' lead to a strong beating, or rape, or a loss of reputation; or related ideas. If not, it's just good old advertising. When the TV advertisers stop using pretty girls to sell car oil, or car insurance, then we can start on issues like fan service.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, does anybody really believe the short skirts used on the original \"StarTrek\" were a legitimate uniform? Does anybody really believe that 'Seven of Nine' looked like that because she was a Borg? Does anybody believe the girl in the red dress in \"Battlestar Galactica\" was wearing that because she was a Cylon?\\n\\n\r\nMoral outrage has its' place among the reviewers. No one should deny that. But moral outrage about something this minor; being blown out to something that requires condemnation, is beginning to appear a bit trite. Shakespeare had it right \"... The reviewer doth protest too much, methinks ...\".\\n\\n\r\nThe real point of any anime, for the reviewer is; \"Did I enjoy the show?\" \"Was I entertained?\" \"Was the music contributive to my enjoyment?\" Did the voice actors contribute properly to that enjoyment? Did the artwork move the story along? These questions are relevant for everything from art-piece anime to straight out hentai pornography.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, dear readers; I come back to \"Rosario to Vampire\".\\n\\n\r\nAs is most of the \"Gonzo\" products, the artwork is and was , more than adequate. It moved the story along, and properly described every one of the main and secondary characters. Some of the female characters were drawn so well, that the fact that some of the characters were really sweet persons came through via that artwork.\\n\\n\r\nDid the voice actors do a good job capturing the audible essence of the character each was trying to portray? The answer is a resounding YES. I watched the dub version, and I have watched the sub version. I can report that the voicing of all the actors were excellent.\\n\\n\r\nWas the music good enough? The answer is yes and no. The interior music and soundtrack was quite good. This was especially entertaining, when using music to describe events dealing with the interior Vampire inside the person of Moka. However, I absolutely hated the opening theme music, and all of the end-title tracks. While they were light and airy musical pieces, they were totally not appropriate to the show. This anime had some really ghoulish elements, and the OP and ED music failed to lead the viewer to the appropriate conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nWas the story entertaining? While some parts of the show were a bit simplistic, or (wait for it, I'm gonna use a fancy word) hackneyed; in the main the story was quit good. Unlike many anime of this variety, this story actually does travel from a beginning, a middle and an end. And each part lends itself to an understanding that leads us to an understanding of the rationales that allow the actions in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nMost episodes contain a lot of humor, and comedy. In fact most of the anime is a sitcom. And in the main, I like a well done sitcom. Like this one. I even liked the fact that as the show transpires, Mr. Aono's character matures, becomes more courageous, and so liked (for all the right reasons), that almost a half-dozen girls become a friendship harem. Okay, so there's a harem. So tell me a political candidate doesn't trot out a harem of girls to make a male candidate look good? Tell me a rock band at a concert doesn't hire a bevy of female beauties to stand in the front row?\\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the 'crucifixion of Tsukune \"Tsukki\" Aono'. The cross used, was an historical artifact. Roman records clearly show that Jesus Christ was the first person ever crucified on a 'T' cross. All previous crucifixions were carried out on an 'X' frame. 'Rosario to Vampire' got it right, especially the symbolism that made this the first crucifixion of a Human in the monster schools' midst. And, as in history, for exactly the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we have a story that amplifies on notions like friendship, affection for your associates, trust and the reclamation of trust; for the people you love. Defense of people who are standing up for the Right, even at personal risk; and most of all; true love. From quarters, even Tsukki Aono did not see coming. Who knew that 'Red-Eyed Moka' would go to the mat for the very person she originally despised for being weak and useless?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll of the previous, you will miss, if you never see (with an un-jaundiced eye) \"Rosario to Vampire\".\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a strong 7.\\n\\n",

It is a combination of comedy, ecchi, yuri (girls love) and action .\r\nThis 13-episode anime is adapted from a manga, and it is originally serialized in Weekly Shonen Manga to be exact. The anime version was aired in Japan since January 2008 and it ended in March.\r\nThe Plot\r\nAono Tsukune is an average high school student who is unableto get into any private school, due to his below-par test scores. The only school he is finally accepted into is actually an underground school for yokai (monsters), who are in disguise as humans. The very first student he meets is Akashiya Moka, who turns out to be a vampire. They, eventually, becomes friends for an unusual reason; she is attracted to the sweet taste of his human blood. Tsukune begins to fear for his life when he quickly learns that his admission into the Yokai Gakuen is a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Moka's vampiric nature always gets the best of her, she is a kind and overly sweet girl and apparently Tsukune quickly falls head over heel for her. Along the way he meets with a over-developed succubus named Kuruno Kuromu and a young 'lolita' witch Sendo Yukari. At this point there will be ridiculous love conflict! What's more, Yukari confesses her obsession for Moka....\\n\\n\r\n    The Verdict\\n\\n\r\n    Well, I find that the elements are rather repulsive and distasteful.

This series can be made to be wonderful series but anime wrapped it up so BAD.\r\n[SPOILER]\r\nFirst, Rubi shouldnt be made too strong at her arrival, manga story more REALISTIC. Second, WTF Moka who defeat Kuyou in last episode and not Tsukune just like manga, and no ghoul Tsukune here thatis the MOST IMPORTANT storyline there, WTF anime just cut them up the very IMPORTANT part of story there, this is what i hate the most from this anime.\\n\r\n[SPOILER]\\n\r\n-Anime only show the most of ecchi and harem part of this series without wonderful storyline there which is COULD be made but they just dont want to (for me this is cons)\\n\r\n-Art and Chara Design is so-so which could be improved further more, for year 2008 anime this anime art is so fair\\n\r\n-The fighting in here is very generalized and easy to read, much more intense in its manga. But i wont say more because generally RV season 1 is not focused in fighting just like its manga\\n\r\n-Moka transformation is very exaggerated here, please this is not mahou shoujo...\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n-I think sound is the best part here because this anime is so full of funny, cheerful, sad, romantic, all kind of sound there. Oh and there are lot of insert song, every char has its own and unique insert song which describe their feeling at many episodes. Musical anime isn't it?maybe...\\n\\n\r\nBut all and all i am still very dissapointed, i am a great fan of RV but this anime shocked me. I enjoy read its manga VERY MUCH and i never get bored waiting for its chapter after chapter, but this anime....nope sorry.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: If Rosario + Vampire has a redeeming quality, it\u2019s self-awareness.  The fight scenes are laughably short and one-sided, but the show actually turns this into a pretty funny running gag by having a character break the forth wall, telling the audience how many seconds the last pitiful excuse for a fight took up.  In one fight, the heroes pause to have a lengthy, emotional conversation with each other, and moments later, the screen zooms out to show the villains staring dumbfounded and wondering why the heroes are suddenly ignoring them.\r\nRosario + Vampire manages to be so skull-poundingly inane, that sometimes,the only thing you can do while watching it is laugh.  A scene from early in the series has a succubus named Kurumu attempting to seduce the hero, Tsukune.  So what brilliant and Machiavellian ploy does Kurumu, a demon who was literally born to seduce, come up with?  She claims her breasts are cramping up, and then immediately begins grinding her tits against Tsukune while he just stands there, freaking out.  It\u2019s one of the absolute dumbest things I\u2019ve ever seen, even in a Harem series, and when that scene played, I laughed my ass of, because I just couldn\u2019t get past how stupid it was.\\n\r\nAlso, while the series is very fan-service heavy, the panty-shot frequency is nowhere near as intense as other harem series like Maken-Ki!, and there are actually hints of characterization and plotting that are not completely overshadowed by fan-service.  Of course, watching Rosario + Vampire because it has less fan-service than Maken-Ki! is like pouring a boiling pot of water onto your own crotch because it\u2019s less hot than the surface of the sun. \\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side:  A stupid show that admits it\u2019s stupid is still a stupid show.  And Rosario + Vampire is indeed a very stupid show.\\n\r\nThe show makes a recurring plot-structure of having a monster (usually a girl) try to kill Tsukune or the main girl, Moka, before the heroes defeat the monster and befriend them.  The first time they do this, with Kurumu, it kind of makes sense because Kurumu\u2019s nature as a succubus requires her to seduce every man around, leading to her conflict with Moka.  The fight was nothing personal, so it\u2019s not completely unreasonable for them to become friends afterwards.  The more often they do it, however, the more ridiculous it becomes.  A peeping-Tom werewolf attacks Moka (presumably with the intention of either raping or killing her\u2014or, ya know, both), and after she kicks him off a roof, he shows up the next episode and is now friends with her and Tsukune, with absolutely no explanation, or even an acknowledgement of his past misdeeds.  \\n\r\nApparently, the moral of Rosario + Vampire is that if you don\u2019t have any friends, you should try to murder someone.  There is an 80% chance that you will become friends with them, and even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s no biggie, because in the world of Rosario + Vampire, attempted rape and murder have absolutely no consequences.  \\n\r\nStill not convinced?  In another episode, a Naga teacher physically abuses and sexually molests Tsukune, and is only stopped by Moka.  Obviously, she\u2019s going to be fired, thrown in jail and have her teaching license permanently revoked, because that\u2019s what happens to teachers who try to fuck high school students\u2026 right?  Ha, no.  She gets a cameo in a later episode and its revealed that she\u2019s still works there, and she\u2019s still abusing students.\\n\r\nOf course, no idiotic Harem Series would be complete without a Token Loli, also known as, The Character Who Exists to Pander to Pedophiles.  Rosario + Vampire gives us Yukari, a witch who looks like she\u2019s 14 going on 8.  Within ten seconds of meeting her, Tsukune pictures her naked and clinging to Moka.  In the beach episode, Yukari gets a special close-up of her swim-suit-clad ass while on all fours.  You know, in case you felt too comfortable about watching the show and needed something to trigger your gag reflex.\\n\r\nIf you like incredibly stupid and occasionally pedophilic Ecchi comedies, you\u2019ll probably like Rosario + Vampire.  That\u2019s literally the best endorsement I am capable of giving it.  If you want a romantic comedy that isn\u2019t disgusting and idiotic, go watch Princess Jellyfish or Ouran High School Host Club.\\n\r\n\tI\u2019d like to end this review with a shout-out to KazumiSan, who has been very complementary and supportive of my reviews so far.  Sorry I just shat all over an anime you enjoyed.  Again.\\n",

It was a little perverted which made it less interesting than it could've been, but It was still really entertaining.

            "content": "I found this anime while reading Megatokyo and figured it might be good for laugh (after all there it was labeled 'The Dumbening'). So i found one or two websites that had all its episodes in decent quality and decided to have a watch and see why it was called so.\r\nI immediately found out why.\r\nThe story is a sad excuse to pump out many shots of girls underwear and let the animators draw the biggest boobs they could, but it drew me in. For some strange reason i became the child i once was long ago content on seeing the same plot line happen againand again in each episode as long as i saw the main characters do what they do best (flaunt stuff they really shouldn't and act really cute).\\n\\n\r\nThe main story line for each episode went in the same pattern:\\n\r\n1-Tskune and Mako meet up outside school (promptly followed by repeating of each others names and blood sucking)\\n\r\n2-They meet up with the others\\n\r\n3-Tskune develops some problem, usually in some stupid (manly) way\\n\r\n4-The problem becomes dangerous\\n\r\n5-Mako turns into her Vampire form and kicks serious ass (usually in less then 30 seconds)\\n\r\nand it repeats... every episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite its lackluster overall story and failing in new plot twists, the animators did themselves proud. There was no hitches or lack of quality at anytime. There was no off colors. Even the synchronizing with the speech was ace. Needless the say of course the animations were great as well (too much bouncing in some parts... meant i had to open another window when anyone else was in the room to save embarrassment).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound i found to be excellant, and it always matched the mood of the time perfectly, whether it be an action moment or a cutesy moment. I especially loved Nana Mizukes' starting and ending themes (so much they are now on my ipod permanently). The best part was the robot noises Mako changes when she turns into the Vampire *vrrr**clunk* boobs get bigger *vrrr**clunk* bum gets bigger.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters i found to be rather annoying as they always fell for Tskune in the end, and stayed that way no matter what the plot made them do. Also they all seemed too fake. There was no realism in there way of thinking, and they never seemed to do the smart thing (like run and leave Tskune).\\n\\n\r\nDespite these flaws i cam back every night to watch it. It perplexed me. The story was not great, the characters were horrible, the only thing i liked was the artwork and the music, but i was there like clockwork watching the next episode (and hating when they didnt have episode 12 for 2 weeks!!). Dont get me wrong... there are parts i dont like but it was still very enjoyable (and very funny, i had to pause several times because i was laughing so hard).\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you love to laugh, and dont mind losing a night or two too your new found addiction you should watch this. Just be warned... EVERY EPISODE HAS PANTIES AND VERY FULL BRAS!!\\n\\n\r\nthat is all ^^",

It tells the story of the human Aono Tskune who accidentally gets transferred to a Yokai (monster) school. In this school he makes a couple of very good friends, all girls, who all like him very much. The friend he makes first, Akashiya Moka, a vampire, is his most precious friend though. This anime pretty much only covers him meeting them, they joining a club and a finale.\r\nThe story looked good at first but turned out to be very disappointing. Almost every episode (and they are only 13..) followsthe same formula. Something happens, they piss somebody off, Moka turns into a vampire and beats the bad guy. The ending was pretty good though.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough i am no animation expert I have to say this anime was done quite well. For me, it was always pretty awesome to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are quite good, and the sound in the anime itself fits the moments pretty well, nothing fantastic though.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that drew me to this anime as I watched the first episode were the characters. Tskune is great. And his friends all grow to like him quite well. Moka and the vampire inside her are also awesome characters. I was pretty disappointed when I found out this series was only going to be 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime of course, else I would not have watched it. But I am thankful I found it when it was just starting because I can not imagine myself watching those 13 episodes in a row. It just isn't an exciting series, except maybe the final two episodes, which is pretty common for anime's that are short. So.. if I had found it after it was over, downloaded it all and tried to watch it all in a row, I am not certain I would have continued.",

I give this anime an overall 7, its has funny scenes to keep you entertained and ecchi, if you're into that kind of thing. They seem to overdue it though, a few pantie shots every couple minutes. No sexy plot, just BAM! Panties and jiggly boobies.\r\nStory: The story is 'meh..\"  A boy gets mistakenly sent to a monster school, where he befriends a group of clingy possessive girls who all want to date him (one of which is an 11 year old). 6/10\r\nArt: The artisn't bad, not great either. Decent. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is okay. There's random singing throughout the anime, which is entertainment I guess? The voices are pretty good, except Yukari, (in both the English and Japanese version)  who's voice made me cringe slightly. She's suppose to be 11 though, so I tolerated it. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters aren't very creative. They all want the main character to date them (or marry them). 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7, I was able to watch the entire thing. It was fun, but not good if you want an in-depth and inspiring plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's an okay anime, watch it if you like cheesy jokes and need a laugh.

But they each have a unique storyline, just the big battle fights are always the same so it becomes a little predictible.\r\nI love this anime, because you have cute and loveable characters. You might not be able to relate to them aswell as another character in another Anime, however they make you laugh and in some episode's, I found them hilarious.\\n\r\nI personally, much prefer the dub of this anime, but it's okay if you want sub. I found the english voices to be a much more expressive way in fitting with the characters.\\n\r\nTo enjoy this anime fully, you must be prepared to see a little bit of *cough* girl perviness. Because at times they are not full clothed and they do like to express things quite openely.\\n\r\nBut if you don't care about that, and want a story that is amazingly gripping, cute, fun and something to keep you busy, then Rosario+Vampire is the anime for you :-)",

The show blatently makes fun of itself, which is just great when you've seen way too many harem and ecchi shows and want something new! Not to mention the animation is gorgeous and the music fitting.

Its really an episodic anime about a guy who has 3 really hot chicks and a little girl following him around. But really he only likes one. There was a plot that took 3 episodes and took up the ending of the anime. So i give them credit for making an ending that wasnt a single episode. There is an ecchi warning, because there is very very random ecchi moments. \r\nThe art in my opinion was really great. I couldnt find any parts where they screwedup. Im also a fan of the art that Gonzo produces, so i think thats what made me love it so much. And the best part of it was the backround art. It was really one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty great. Everything fit properly. And there was no sound that got screwed up, and didnt fit what was happening. All the sound was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is the best part. I think all the characters are unique in there own little way. They all stood out a lot. And they had there wierd ackward opinions and interests.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. So if you want to see if you enjoy it, i would suggest looking at my anime list and see if its close in what ive watched and what ive liked.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun!",

The sound as well is well done, without too much harem style grunting, ohhh yeahhs, and other cringeworthy noises. The character's voice actors doing a good job at making the characters sounds like they look, and not being too high pitched and whiney.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all well written, styled and the personalities make them all likeable. Even Tsukune, the hopeless chap he is, doesn't really get on my nerves, he has reasons for being useless as you'll see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very enjoyable series if your looking for a harem anime with a decent plot and plenty of pants/bra fanservice, or something pleasureable on the eyes. If you are wanting a better plot then why are you looking at a harem anime?",

Average guy, with average grades (aka the boring male lead who looks like any guy you'd pass on the street) needs to pick a high school, but none have accepted him except for one. The one school just so happens to be a school for demons and monsters. The first girl he meets just so happens to be a Vampire, who keeps a rosary around her neck at all times to supress her abilities. Hence, the title.From there on he aquires a colorful harem of monster girls who all want to bone him because he apparently smells like catnip for monsters. Some monsters come to attack him, Vampire girl comes to his aid, and he finds out he has the ability to remove her rosary and unleash her true vampyric powers (which just so happens to enhance her bust and bum as well...) Some of these monsters are said harem girls who the male lead naturally scoops up and takes pity on after their defeat at the hands of his Vampire girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nNot terrible, but nothing special. Looks like it was animated in flash.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing special.

I can't even remember the names of most of the characters, it's been a few years since I've seen it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this series to be quite average. It is a time waster, it's nothing special. Watch it if you haven't got anything better to do, or you're in the mood for a fairly lighthearted romantic harem series with some monster girls.",

            "content": "This has got to be one of the worst anime I've watched. I'll just give a review of what I felt watching it and what happens in the show (Don't worry about spoilers, literally every episode is the same)\r\nStory 4/10:\r\nSo you got a lame protagonist who accidentally gets admitted to a monster school. He meets a vampire girl who falls in love with him (his blood actually). The monster school doesn't allow humans to enter and so the boy starts his fearful life in the school with his own harem. The protagonist is one of the lamest guys I've seen, and he does literally nothingexcept talk about how he will protect his harem but in the end, they end up protecting him. It's just another ecchi harem with some action that takes place at the end of an episode and usually involves a kick or something similar from the vampire. That's all you will see in EVERY episode. Oh yeah, the monsters in the school maintain their human form, so the boy manages to blend in.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nThe art is good. That's all there is to it. And I guess that's what keeps people from turning away after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10:\\n\r\nLame protagonist. All talk, no show. The girls are cute. No character history, no nothing. The only story of the characters you will know is their relation with the protagonist. As for the vampire, you won't know any history, how she was formed, what's with the dual personality, nothing. All that they tell are 4 lines which are narrated when she turns into a vampire. Aside from that, it sucks. The girl designs are good but that's all there is to it. No history or stuff. And the protagonist can't do anything except \"accidentally\" rip off the vampires necklace to awaken her powers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10:\\n\r\nI can't believe I watched the whole first season. I always complete the anime I start. It's that responsibility that is keeping me from leaving this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I regret this decision. It's not an anime worth your time unless you like ecchi harem with no story. Every episode is a new skit with the same routine that's followed through each episode. After 2 episodes, you can predict everything that will happen. It's a boring anime, but maybe you might like it since this was recommended to me from friends.\\n\r\nMy personal opinion, don't watch it.",

I am a pure anime watcher and I judge what I see in front of me regardless of other original adaptations. Onto the review.\r\nThis is another one of those huh. It kinda feels like a downwards spiral of the same ideas over and over again.....Then again its those same damn mind hypnosis ideas that still gets chuckle from me. Dammit fan service!\r\nStory 7/10: Not reading the manga I choose to judge it by whats on my screen and what I see was something predictable. Its nothing new herefolks but I would be lying if I said it did its job rather poorly. For the most part it held up.\\n\\n\r\nArt Style 8/10: Though its not something very artsy like Oreimo or Black Rock Shooter OVA, the graphics are.....outdated but not bad at any means. Its just not really that special compared to its competition though again it does have really good view scenes that are eye candy. Heh.....and the \"other\" type of Eye Candy.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: Surprisingly I really liked the sound of this anime. The OP was pretty good and the general sound effects of the anime held up pretty well. Nothing much can be said here as I rarely judge a anime by its sound. If it has a good plot then forget all that extra crap.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Its basically a variety of cute girls with different personalities doing cute things to a male character.....Which we have seen before. But hey they did there best FLOODING us with fan service.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: I will cut this anime some slack as I do like this anime. I found some of the fan service to be hilarious and the bat to be insanely funny. However there is one flaw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: I feel it suffers the same syndrome as many other animes like this suffer from. They use Fan Service, Ecchi, Comedy, and etc. to make the viewer ignore the plot. This would work it is was something like Nichijou but its not and it kinda feels like more Fan Service and Cuteness. If you are the type of viewer that likes to see Fan Service, some SLIGHT drama, and some good laughs give this one a watch. Otherwise stay away.\\n\\n\r\n[Cut]Especially those who are fans of the Manga.[/Cut]",

Its interestig in that you don't get this kind of anime with so many monsters, so if you are a fantasy fan you might take a liking to it. Again the romance is minimal, which i swhat i hate about harems. Even as a haremanime it isnt that good. It is way too short as well which is possibly why it cannot establish a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average, nothings special..\\n\\n\r\nThe songs were okay, not so much to my liking but still fine. If there were inserts in the anime it might have evoked more feeling or made it a bit more captivating.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very dry, you have the usual harem mix of girls from the quiet and soft-spoken to totally outgoing anf lively to the lolicon to the one that is really in love with the main character. The boy is practically useless in the fights which last like less than a minute so the action is minimal as well and the episodes are raftly the same the vampire just ends up wining most of the time.\\n\\n\r\n The comedy is not very appealing in the show and is quite lame at points. There was no real excitement or interest till lik eone of the last episodes, and even then had they made it more like the manga it might have been better.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion i don't suggest the anime, go read the manga because the anime makes the boy look like crap, when he is actually quite strong in the manga...Thats all....",

To be blunt, those looking for a deep story/message will be dissapointed, but even for the usual harem-bashing-crew, this show can be enjoyed simply because the creators kept things simple, it's funny, you know what you'll get in every episode, and you get to enjoy (in my opinion) probably the best looking female leads outside of Ai Yori Aoshi.\r\nLike my other reviews, I'll keep things short and sweet, whilemaintaining vague enough that no spoilers are spilled.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is probably the most polished anime visually I've ever seen in a comedy (I mean comedies don't exactly always have Code Geass/Death Note budgets), the perfect way to describe the show is &quot;clean&quot;, the enviroment, and not to mention every female character, are just so clean and pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n*Harem-bashers: I know you want to bash Harems for a lack of substance, if so, then wouldn't it be wise to just skip to the next show instead of watching a whole series and writing a review just to vent?*\\n\r\nWe don't exactly expect this show to put us to tears like Kimi ga Nozumo Eien or Elfen Lied, you won't find anything shocking or out of the ordinary with the story, but your enjoyment is found through the comedy, so in that regard the thin story can be excused.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is a show for you if you're looking for something where you can relax, laugh, and get your fix of fan-service, however, someone's 8 can be someone else's 5, so for the 100th time, if you don't like shows like this, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Ok, I'm not going to lie this review will probably be pretty bias because I have already read the manga, and I just loved it.\r\nStory: The story is pretty good on nailing a few stuff in the manga. And each episode is usually an episode that can be watched by itself without having to watch the previous episode. Another thing is that there is some laughter here and there but not a full blown comedy, so there might be some times where the episode just seems dull. Also the thing that is filled in EVERY single episode is fanservice. So it is obviously made fora male audience, but ignoring that fact, it is pretty good in introducing the Rosario+Vampire series. The amount of plot the anime covers compared to the manga is relatively low.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I do however love the artwork in the anime more than the manga. The characters are just a lot more cuter in my opinion and the way they are drawn is just spectacular. Though the fanservice can get kind of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I personally liked the OP and ED. Normally I would skip them if I thought it was boring, but I really liked the songs they picked, and the beat is alright. I do have to mention that the character's voices do sound like the voice I imagined while reading the manga so that is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There is a decent amount of character development. The characters are just so cute together, but the bickering over Tsukune is a bit more than in the manga. Like in every episode or near the end of each episode they would fight over Tsukune, and it is just funny. Also the characters' personalities are pretty accurate when compared to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really liked this anime. Well it may have been influence by the fact that I really loved the manga. The characters were just really well drawn and I just thought that they looked better than the manga. Also I thought the characters' personalities were really accurate and their voices really did sounded the way I had imagine their voice would be so I really enjoyed this anime. However the fanservice really does get annoying though, but beside that, the anime was pretty good. Well hope you enjoy this anime, if not try reading the manga, because in the manga there is way more plot and character development, and it is a pretty good story :D So have fun!",

            "content": "So this is my first review, and it ain't pretty. First of all, I haven't read the manga (I often hear it's much better) so this review is based on the anime alone, and is not a comparison. If I would have to summarize the anime, I only need one word: \"panties/pantsu\"; what some ecchi anime have with boobs, this one has pantsu, and while watching it you'll see a lot of pantsu shots more than every minute. So let's start my review:\r\nStory (3)\r\nUsually it's difficult to define the story for an ecchi anime; but for this one it is almost impossible. A human guyaccidentally ends up in a school for monsters; and for some reason he only makes female friends who also become in love with him; well, that's the story. But then again, who watches ecchi for it's brilliant stories...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\r\nThe main guy is called Tsukune, and he is your typical male ecchi/harem lead, nothing to comment on further.\\n\r\nThe main girl is Moka, who is a vampire, but unlike you would expect from a vampire she is very kind and cheerful (she reminds me a bit of Lala). She becomes Tsukune's first friend, loves sucking his human blood and falls in love with him. The only interesting and unique part about Moka is her rosario; if removed from her chest Moka becomes her true self (a true vampire); her personality changes and she becomes much more powerful.\\n\r\nFurthermore, 3 more girls join Tsukune's harem. The first one being Kurumu, a huge boobed succubus who tries to win him for herself. The second girl is the child witch Yukari who tries to behave like the older girls. The third girl is Mizore, a yukki-onna, and stalker.\\n\r\nFurther characters include Gin, a guy who likes to take pictures of girls in their underwear, a teacher with cat ears and tail, Ruby another witch, Kokoa, Moka's younger sister, a bat who serves as narrator and many other minor characters.\\n\r\nOverall, the characters lack personality but who cares, there are some cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) and Sound (4)\\n\r\nI will be short on this one: the art is very good, but the sound (music) can be annoying at some times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\r\nThere is a lot of fanservice in the anime, this fanservice mainly consists of pantsu shots, of course for a man this is enjoyable and occasionally give a good laugh. \\n\r\nBut even so many pantsu shots get repetitive, some uncensored boobs might have been a welcome sight.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, besides the fanservice the episodes are boring and repetitive. Every episode is the same (except maybe 1 or 2): all girls fight over Tsukune, then Tsukune gets harassed by  some kind of monster, Moka comes and Tsukune removes her rosario, and vampire Moka kicks the monster's ass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\r\nOverall the anime is very repetitive, both the fanservice (just pantsu shots) and the events in every episode. Whether you like a good story, or ecchi and fanservice, there are better shows out there; so I can't recommend watching this anime unless you would exactly like to know which colour underwear each girl is wearing.",

            "content": "I really liked this anime from about episode 1 to episode 11 (Other than the unrealistic swooning over Tsukune and the constant panty shots) \r\nThe characters, Moka, Tsukune, Yukari, Kurumu, and Mizore, are all very unique in their own ways and they all have a background story. The only thing I have a problem with is that they all seem to be in love with Tsukune for no apparent reason. It starts off as Kurumu wanting him to be a slave but then it turns out to be something more. So what, if he helped them out? Many people have been kind and helped meout with problems it doesn't mean I fall madly in love with them.\\n\\n\r\nThat's probably my biggest problem with Rosario+ Vampire. I can handle the panty shots, seeing as I have seen things much worse. I advise not to watch this in public (Living room, computer room, etc, etc...) Unless you live by yourself or your parents don't care, then knock yourself out. But if you live with other people that might not approve of underwear shots then you should probably watch this in your room or when your home alone. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes from 1 to 11 are great, everyone is happy and everything is great. But episode 12 and 13 things change. And in my opinion, it wasn't for the best. The big climax of the season was pretty weak, if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was not one of my favorites...it would probably be in my bottom five. But it is funny and a cute and perky romance/comedy anime. So if you like those kinds of light shows, then go ahead and watch it, you might like it. :)\\n\\n",

I mean fan service fan service with a sprinkle of fan service on the side, not only is it obnoxious but it is just plain annoying. Even when they tried to add some sort of story to the show they ruined the moment with fan service it really hurt the show overall. Predictable is an understatement, a blind man of a galloping horse could haveseen how this show was going to play out. The male lead was just really annoying and whiny, i just couldn't get behind him at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this? No No No for the love of all that is good don't punish yourself like i did, might be good if your looking to go to sleep i suppose.  \\n\r\nHope my review helped \\n\r\nMurphy",

I have yet to really find moments that I hate in it. Now, I will say, if you have read the manga, this anime has a LOT of altered details ranging from order of events, how events go, and even characters' personalities. Even with that, it is a good anime. It's some what short and easy to get into. I find the love story to be very interesting to watch, and the concept that this anime has is amazing. Ahuman goes to a monster school and a bunch of monster girls fall in love with him. What's not to love? The art of this anime is pretty god and I love it's look. The music is amazing and sets up everything pretty well, and (even though this is from Capu 2) I love the song Snowstorm when Mizore sings it. Anyway, I can easily recommend this to anyone that likes a comedy that revolves around a bunch of girls fighting for one guys attention. I have a hard time recommending it to anyone that has already read the manga, because this anime does change a lot of things in it. Any, I hope this was helpful to you guys and to the girls. \\n\r\nCapu~chu\\n\r\nSincerely yours,\\n\r\n-Darkness_Knight",

This is the the kind of anime that you might not care to finish, but it will help you to appreciate all the better series that are out there.\r\nThe story is almost non-existant, which usually isn't a problem. I like slice-of-life. But the overall concept of Rosario was so interesting, it seems like such a waste of potential.\r\nArt? I mean, they knew how to draw panties pretty well. And the second season's opening is rotoscoped, which is pretty cool.\r\nThe sound is nothing spectacular. Most sound effects here could befound in a soundboard somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I did like some of the characters by the end. I really was rooting for the obvious main pairing. But overall, they cast is just a generic set for a harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it's good enough to watch, but it will leave you with an appreciation for better anime.",

I'm not sure why.\r\nThis is by far the worst anime that has ever been made. I've lost sleep over the abysmal quality presented with Rosario + Vampire. This was the first anime I have ever seen and the entire time the weeaboo of a friend I had insisted me that it gets better. \r\nIt doesn't get better.\r\nThe first episode establishes everything the show is going to be. Panty shots and pathetic characters. Tskune and Moka are the worst leadsa show could ever have. Weak male character leads can be a good thing with an example being Accel World. This can be good because it allows for good development of said character. However Tskune is reliable in how awful he can be. He has one redeeming action throughout the entire series and it's not even the ending of it all. I thought that after all my suffering through these 26 episodes there would be a pay off. There's not, there's no reason to finish this anime, and there's no reason to start this. \\n\\n\r\n1/10 avoid entirely if you have self-respect.",

A human boy meets a very attractive vampire girl and they fall for each other, i wanted to see more. But as the episodes rolled, it was the same old thing over and over. A new \"monster\"appears out of nowhere and they defeat it. The two main character's relationship doesn't improve much either. It pretty much dragged like that for the entire series and ended abruptly. Forunately, they're coming out with a season 2 which i am planning to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThey're both afraid of committing and telling each other their true feelings, something i hate about animes. The romance is very childish, they have a tough time admitting they like each other. Aside from the romance, every episode is just a new \"monster\" they have to face. There's some comedy here and there and the running gags are a bit over-used\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nLooked like it had potential, but the anime does too much fan service. The manga toned it down but the plot just really deviates and it feels like a filler heaven. Every episode in the manga felt like a filler, it was pretty annoying. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThe art is flawless, that's all i can say. The only reason i wanna watch the anime is cause of the amazing art, however there's a bit too much \"fan service\" as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nNot bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were actually pretty well thought out and memorable. One thing i can stand about animes/manga's is generic looking characters that DO NOT stand out. Everyone in the series was pretty memorable, i can picture them and see their uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nI gotta say i enjoyed it, but it definitely felt like a naruto filler with every episode. New random enemy appears out of nowhere and they have to take them down, repeat rinse, very dull after a while. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nIt didn't suck, so in other words it's enjoyable overall. This is DEFINITELY something not \"deep\" like Elfen Lied or Evangelion (which gave me trouble sleeping for a week, lol). It's just something fun to watch, especially if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend with you, it always makes things much better.",

            "content": "Vampires, witches, werewolves and other monsters. Rosario to Vampire proves that even with them you can make your own personal harem. Effortless romantic comedy with halloween atmosphere.\r\nAono Tsukune arrived to a new school. We have a default beginning but something seems fishy. Since Youkai Academy is a school for\u2026 monsters. Aono as a human is imperceptible because of  an important rule of  this academy- every student must be at his human form. Normal people at monster world aren\u2019t welcome. In some horror like atmosphere everyone would run away but Tsukune found some reasons to stay. This reason is Moka Akashiya, a pink hairedvampire. The choice to stay may be apposite because to our hero\u2019s harem have joined another three girls . If he can stay with this four girls, the fact that he can lose his life to some monster is nothing. Besides every girl gladly protects our defenseless human. Especially Moka, who is one of the most powerful monsters, a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nRosario to Vampire is a combination of shounen, harem and ecchi genre. We can add some mahou shoujo and  horror too. The author doesn\u2019t hide his inspiration for monsters. We have all kinds of them, from European legends and from Japanese myths. Main heroin is a vampire, later appears a werewolf , witch, succubus and other monsters. A fair group from horror story. Every of them tries to kill or seduce Tsukune. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are very schematic. To Tsukune and his group time flows by and than they get to know one of the students. This student unveils his true monster form. It tries to attack Tsukune, so Moka come to rescue and defeats the delinquent with her roundhouse kick. This repeats for almost all episodes. Rosario to Vampire is a typical ecchi genre. The difference is that the story is set in a monster school. From this assumptions we know that it will be funny, relaxing and without any obligations and if you don\u2019t expect anything special it is. Though the humor isn\u2019t too good.\\n\\n\r\nAs a typical harem anime every heroine tries to seduce the main hero. Everyone has their own episode to show their personalities but after that they don\u2019t develop. Most of time we have our main pair Tsukune and Moka. That\u2019s a big loss because the female characters are likeable and interesting. Sweet witch Yukari dressed in a characteristic hat and cape, succubus Kurumu that has an ability to seduce and a snow woman Mizore a quiet stalker. A well done small harem. But they don\u2019t have too much screen time. Instead of that we have many episodic characters that appears only in one episode. \\n\\n\r\nA big advantage of this title is the female vampire. When Moka unlocks her eponymous rosario she changes like a magical girl from cute and delicate person to a blood-thirsty invincible vampire. Plus she get some body increase for free. This second form of Moka will win  everyone hearts. She\u2019s sexy, almighty and has a good kick. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very accurate. We have a lot of deep colors. The female monsters have pink, violet and blue hair. The background is very colorful too. We have a genial surrounding atmosphere. Graveyards, crosses, pumpkins. Maybe they aren\u2019t horror like but we can say that there is Halloween Day all the time in Youkai Academy. Mokas transformation is also good looking. It\u2019s similar too magical girl transformation but we have domination of bats. Opening and ending singed by Nana Mizuki show two sites of this title- harem and monster fights. \\n\\n\r\nManga and anime of Rosario to Vampire are different. First of all the plot in the anime don\u2019t develop at all. We mostly have the harem site here. In the manga Tsukune became involve in various organizations and mysterious intrigues. The atmosphere is more serious and dramatic. The anime producers didn\u2019t want to make anything beside a typical ecchi. If you want some harem in a different convention watch the anime. If you want some harem with intrigues and fights read the manga. \\n",

Not only that but the romance dialogue gets very cliche and repeats the same scenes many times over for no real reason.\r\nCharacters will just open up 'lovey-duvey' dialogue mid combat that can stretch for up to and over 20 seconds and completely neglect their opponants whojust sit their and wait in a painfully obvious way.\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\nThe character development wasn't bad and the art is very easy on the eyes. Theirs nothing special about the main character, hes easily relate-able to the average but is fairly unique when compared to many protagonists of similar titles.\\n\r\nThe comedy in Rosario + vampire was quite entertaining and had some parts where i could have giggled like a school girl. \\n\r\nOverall the series was pretty good but is only worth watching if you have the time, its not something you should go out of your way to watch.",

            "content": "Let me start off this review with an overly exaggerated *sigh*. I had this series recommended to me as I am a fan of romance comedies (Love Hina, Ah! My Goddess etc.). This is not comparable to those simply because it takes fan service to an entirely excessive level and at the cost of any form of character development or legit story. I pushed through it because I liked the idea and quickly decided to read the manga version (I cannot recommend it enough!). \r\n**Compared to the manga** The manga became everything I was looking for and goes on for much longer than the animedepicts anyway. The manga has much less noticeable fan service, actual character development, better action and just as much if not more humor at times, definitely a worthwhile read. \\n\\n\r\n**Standalone** Be advised that the story actually differs immensely (and inaccurately) from the manga, presumably due to its sheer focus on boobs and panty shots. While that may be what some are looking for, I for one found its emphasis unbearable. \\n\\n\r\n**Rating** I gave this a 4 because I love the actual story (manga) so much that I gave it a courtesy point. The sound is repetitive, out of place and odd. The main character is a cut-out piece of board and the girls are virtual inflatable blow-up dolls for your amusement. The attempt at a story is repetitive and predictable and the only presentable aspect of it is its rather appealing animation art. Consider myself a virtual lifeguard, as I am writing this review as a raft, hoping to save as many prospective fans from the disappointment of the anime and instead guiding them safely to the manga version :)",

Of the few reviews I read about this series I gathered the idea that it wasn't going to be particularly amazing and while I admit it might not make my top 5 it was entertaining in its own way.\r\nThis series had some of the best animation of its genre that made every episode wonderful to look at. In addition to this the character personalities were charming to say the least (Mizore 4 life). For example, the subtle reminders that while she looks human, Kurumu confuses typical human colloquialisms only to becomically corrected by Yukari. Coupled with great music R+V was certainly worthy of an 8, but I'm afraid not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters, animation, and music were entertaining enough the story line and episodic nature was fairly weak. And honestly, that's pretty okay with me. If anything, this series made me really interested in picking up the manga right away and start reading. Even though the plot development and story construction was mild, it is pretty clear that I could gain a better appreciation for the story if I read the manga as well.",

            "content": "If you first watch the anime and then read the manga, you'll have a blast.  But if you first read the manga and then watch the anime (especially the second season) you'll end up extremely frustrated.  I'll get into this more in my review of the second season, but keep this in mind when reading some of the reviews.\r\nI'm going to forgo the normal category review and get straight into the meat of this season.  The anime version of R + V is a shounen mixture of high school slice of life/harem that finishes up with a battle at the end.It mostly follows an episodic structure with some character development between the \"episodes\".  \\n\\n\r\nClassic harem tropes are followed, and you'll recognize some of the classic female characters in this sort of anime.  Also, the lead guy, in order to not make him a complete douchebag, is largely clueless as to the level of affection of his \"friends\".  Not that these harem elements are a bad thing--many of the best anime have semi-harems or harems usually (Steins;gate, Code Geass, Evangelion, etc)--and when done right provides funny and interesting stories for the male lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization is superb, the stories generally interesting, and the setting pitch perfect.  It its category, shounen/harem, it's probably one of the best if not the best.  The art, sound, and voice acting are all solid.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why the negative reviews?  Well, the anime suffers the same problem as what happened with the first Fullmetal Alchemist.  The anime's creators for whatever reason will sometimes depart from the source material or mix up the stories, resulting in a weaker product.  It also underestimates its audience by dialing up the fan service to overkill.  But the first season does stay closer to its source material, and thus is significantly stronger than the second season.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend watching the anime first and then jumping into the manga.  Think of the anime as an appetizer until you can move onto the main course.",

            "content": "Rosario Vampire. Not a kid anime. A very VERY mature ecchi anime. If you don't know what ecchi is, then its perverted things and NOT for little kids to see. Its a okay series, I mean, its not bad, I liked it. But its just so strange.\r\nStory line 7/10-There is no spoilers,so its fair. Tsukune is a failed high school student. He comes across Yokai Academy. When he gets there, he mets a pink haired girl,and becomes friends with her. He then finds out that the school is for monsters, and if any humans are to be found, they'll be killed.(Tsukune is a human). Nowhe must live with monsters. The story line was a great idea. I really liked the cleverness of it. The story just felt to simple. It was a great idea, but it would have been better if the story could have explained more with more episodes. I still like it, but it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10-The characters in this anime are enjoyable, but annoying. Moka is a good character. Shes funny. Tsukune is just strange. Mizore is the best character in my opinon, because shes cool(literally). Kurumu is funny, eta. The witch girl is annoying, and the monsters in this anime are just, weird. watch it, and you'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSound Track 6/10-The music is okay. The opening theme song is good. The rest of the music is also good, but it doesnt stand out, unlike other anime. There really isn't anything for me to say about the music because I never really thought of it as amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10-The best thing about this anime. The art. Its very bright,and fits the anime well. It does has some dart animation, and that doesn't fit it well, but the color is good for everything else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment7/10-I liked Rosario Vampire. It was funny, which is why I enjoyed it. However, its not as good as I thought it would be. I liked the art, and the comedy, and the story line, but its not the most enjoyable anime ive watched. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10-There are tons of better anime out there, plenty. Rosario Vampire is good for anyone who loves mature, ecchi anime. Its enjoyable, but just strange.",

            "content": "I watched both seasons of this show after I bought the first volume of the manga (which is better than the adaptation). While its formulated, repetitive and too predictable I still really enjoyed it.\r\nStory: First episode you get introduced to Tskune, some average high school boy. He gets enrolled in a school strictly for monsters in another world. He meets Moka, a vampire with two personalities, the true vampire one which is locked away when the Rosario is on her chest that only Tskune can remove apparently. For a majority of the show:\r\n- Tskune is with Moka and something happens\r\n- One of them (and lateron their friends) meets an antagonist\\n\r\n- Antagonist threatens Tskune, Moka or friends\\n\r\n- Tskune \"accidently\" takes off Moka's rosario\\n\r\n- Vampire Moka kicks everyone into submission\\n\r\n- Antagonist is defeated or becomes their ally\\n\\n\r\nIt gets more spicy in the last 2 - 3 episodes, but that's the formula for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing wrong with the art style from what I can see, I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I watched it in English dub (first version I could find and I felt lazy), sound is good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Tskune just seems the average cliche teenage boy in high school who suddenly gets a harem of girls who want to date him.  Moka seems like his obvious girlfriend choice, but the friends he picks up after a formulated battle want to take him too and they all fight over him. The antagonists just happen threaten Tskune and co. and then get beaten up. The narrator bat (who wasn't in the manga) is just really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Much as its formulated and predictable I did enjoy it, still reading the manga which is better than its adaptation with a better story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The adaptation just seems to have plucked some chapters out of the manga (including key chapters like the first one, the ones where he picks up his friends, the school trip, but the end is actually a really early on chapter, the chapters adapted into the anime were swapped around though). Not really a show to be taken seriously, but I wouldn't mind watching it again.",

            "content": "The story is all about a teenage boy who can't get into high school, but through an amusing circumstance, ended up getting into a school but not an ordinary one called Youkai Gakuen. On his first day of class, while trying to find his way to the school, he stumbled upon a very beautiful girl. They immediately became friends and the boy said that he will surely have a nice time in his new school. Little is he aware of what kind of school he is entering or the true identity of the girl.\r\nRosario + Vampire is presented in a 1 monster per episode format,and new characters are introduced gradually as the series moves along. Admittedly, the format tends to become a little boring for a while because in the surface the story doesn't seem to have any direction, but for people who love harem and fan-service, this is but little annoyance for enjoying the show. The series ended quite abruptly leaving much to be desired, thankfully there is a season 2 (by the time of this writing). \\n\\n\r\nAs expected of GONZO, the animation is superb, the movement is very fluid, and the girls are really cute - very nice for any harem shows. The fan-service is a plus, and you can never be tired watching the transformation sequence of Moka as she transformed from a whimsy character to a total badass and powerful vampire.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is nice, very appropriate for the show. Background music is also superb! I especially like it when Aono and Moka look face-to-face blushing while saying each other's name and in the background it is playing the \"lalalalala...lalala...lalalalala\" sound, it's really cute and hilarious!\\n\\n\r\nI like the anime in general. It's only 13 episodes, not much room for character development. I wish to see more development on the relationship of the main characters, but it is not something that the series focuses on in its first season. Recommended for anyone who loves romance, comedy, fantasy, harem and fan-service.",

It would have been a good one if added elements can be inserted to make it feel special in some ways to veteran otaku viewers thus definitely lacking in a meaningful plot.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nGONZO, GONZO, GONZO. As I expected, the story may be bad in a way but the art work andstyling was done pretty much above average. In some of the end episodes, the quality improved a tad bit but noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNana Mizuki did a good part in making up for the OST of the series. OP theme is upbeat and catchy while the ED is mysterious but vibrant. BGMs throughout the series is good too with the addition of off-beat humor and hints of naughtiness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nLove em or hate em, there is no stopping why most people adore Moka and hate Tsukune or the other way around. Character development in some of the characters are a big ? since more questions are being thrown. Voice actors are good but some (cheesy?) dialogs can always be heard all the way till the end that may be a bit irritating and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nAs a change of viewing habits, I was drawn in by the fanservice but the story really disappointed me. I was expecting that in the end, it may all end in a &quot;bang&quot; but a whimper of many unanswered questions. All that comes to mind that this anime brings is like a washing machine...&quot;wash, rinse, dry...then repeat&quot; XD\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI could have lowered the score for this but I do think that since the anime will air a 2nd season, they can improve the plot very well as not to disappoint fans alike. If you like copious amounts of fanservice and pantsu shots, well...go for other anime series like Najica Blitz Tactics or Agent Aika for action and Negima (1st) if you want harem + comedy + fanservice galore. R+V and GONZO really did screw up for once but who knows once the 2nd season airs. Happy pantsu viewing-chuuu~ ^__^",

Sometimes I really hate GONZO mainly because they are not loyal to the source material. Well I think I could praise the character designs of this show because all the girls here are adorable and cute. This show is funny sometimes but usually its annoying. It's full of panty shots and every episode you will SEE panties I guarantee you. I also have to complain about the battles because its like 'monster ofthe day' battle and are usually defeated easily. \\n\\n\r\nFine I admit that I enjoyed the comedic scenes of this anime but I don't really like how they played the plot. The manga is way better than this so I suggest that you should just read it than waste your time watching this but if you like shows like this then I think you will quite enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is said that there is a second season to this anime so the fans of this show will be overjoyed by the news.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this show is worth 1 out of 5 stars but I think I could forgive the show a bit because I admire their character designs and I even like some characters like Mizore Shiraiyuki. \\n",

The characters were well developed and funny and i don't see why other reviewers have said they are sterotyped. I admit Tsukune is a bit of a wimp, but isn't that the fun of watching it? The sound and the theme is exciting and lively, and add to the overall enjoyment of it. The only things i can say i didn't like is the fact tsukune didn't use his vampire abilitiesas much as he did in the manga, but this doesn't matter for people who haven't read it. Overall Rosario + Vampire is an above average anime with lots of action and romance.",

Also some of the scenes were a little sappy and lovedovey for me, but then I dont like the hardcore romance stuff :P Rosario+ Vampire gets a good 7/10",

            "content": "*Insert obligatory first review sentence here*\r\nNow with that out of the way, let's get on with this. First off, let me begin by saying Rosario + Vampire is one of if not my favorite harem manga ever. Let me repeat, MANGA. This thing is not the manga, not in the slightest. The first few episodes seemed promising since they were following the manga however I always got a sinking feeling whenever the preview came on since they decided to advertise a different pair of panties for each episode. Nevertheless, I continued on and boy did I regret it.\r\nStory 3/10 - Like I said, the firstfew episodes seem promising mainly because they actually follow the manga and are paced reasonably well. However, things begin to fall apart by the time the trip to the human world arc takes place. After this point, the story more or less takes a back seat until the final two episodes which has always been a pet peeve of mine. I am sick of romcom shows that think they don't need any plot progression until the last two episodes, I'm looking at you Girls Bravo. Anyway long story short this is not the manga's plot, it is a watered down version with only the bare essentials.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 - This coupled with the sound is probably the best part of this anime. The characters and backgrounds look nice and everyone is animated pretty well. I'm not going to go any further into this since I've never cared that much about this field.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 - Like the art, the sound is pretty good. The OP is pretty catchy in my opinion and I honestly love the ED and really highlights what this anime should have been about, Moka kicking lots of ass and looking damn good while doing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10 - Here we go, this is where the differences with the manga really become distingushed. Let's start with our MC Tsukune, instead of manga Tsukune who is thrust into an unfamiliar environment, relies on Moka for a while until that isn't enough and gets powers of his own that he learns to control, we get just another generic MC who relies on Moka for the whole season except for the last damn episode. Speaking of Moka, part of her appeal was the whole mysteriousness of her other self and how she became that way, but the people making this anime didn't seem to care. In the anime, Moka never evolves past the beautiful, perfect nice girl with a badass alter ego, granted it takes a while before she does so in the manga. Next up is Kurumu, or Tits Mcgee. Even in the manga I never particularly enjoyed Kurumu but she does have some genuine moments in the manga. Unfortunately the most important thing she does in the anime is sing a song in a bikini..... moving on. Yukari the witch is next and I like how they portray witch in this world as between human and monster but not really belonging to either. In the manga she really stands on her own as a character during the club trip arc however even that is ruined in the anime which also includes another character Rubi who, even in the manga, I found her affection towards Tsukune unnecessary. Finally we have everyone favorite character, Mizore. Mizore is what made me want to keep watching since she is my favorite character, but alas even she couldn't save it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10 - From what you can tell, I did not enjoy this anime, I can only see it as an insult to the source material. Aside from the character introduction episodes, no part of what made the manga so great is in the anime. Where is the school festival arc? Where's Hokuto and Kiria? Those guys are part of the reason I love the manga so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10 - My biggest problem with the Rosario + Vampire anime is that they took a series that started out as just another harem comedy but turned into a thrilling monster action series with harem elements and assumed that what it was in the beginning was what everyone liked about. I would've scored it lower but I just couldn't grade an adaptation of something I loved so low.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this was my first attempt at a review. I'm sure my arguments aren't that great and I could have gone into more detail in some places, but I just wanted to throw out my 2 cents. I'm open to any discussion or counter-arguments.",

            "content": "Rosario to Vampire is a very generic fantasy ecchi/harem anime that rushes through every plot point too quickly and expects us to believe in the romance between the two main characters by default. The characters kind of make up for its failures, as Inner Moka steals the show over and over again. Kurumu is hot and fun to watch, while Mizore is interesting to say the least. The only main girl I didn't like that much was Yukari because she is a glorified sexualized loli for no reason and has no relevance to the story besides her one episode love interest and helping save theother witch girl. Oh, I should mention the generically weak and dense main male character who has absolutely no reason to be doing what he does, and of course the girls fawn over him because of his love of his \"friends\" and his passion to save them even though he cannot do anything himself. The plot itself is difficult to even find until the last 2 episodes and by then it's too late to save itself from failing. The ending was, as expected, a \"happy\" one, but to achieve this they form a plothole in how all the students magically changed their minds about Tsukune being human. It could have been done a lot better, but that remains to be seen in the next season.",

I'd highly recommend it.\r\nRosario + Vampire is really just taking the characters from the manga, murdering the story, and creating a huge fanbase. That being said, the anime wasn't... Awful. The series is about Tsukune, a human boy who gets put in a Highschool for monsters/demons, and tries to fit in without being discovered. Seems interesting, no?\r\nLets talk about the positives first. The animation style is really amazing. It looks really smooth, and has a cutesy, happy feel to it. It makes you want to keep looking atit.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is actually really good. Both intros are really good, and the background music for the fight scenes, awkward scenes, and whatnot are all really fitting and really enjoyable to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThat's it for the good, really. The plot isn't even there, it is clearly stated what's supposed to be going on (a human boy trying to fit in at a Highschool for monsters/demons) but it never progresses. It's mostly filler, every once in a while adding a new character, every one of which happens to fall in love instantly with the main protagonist for absolutely no reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe execution of the anime was miserable. That aside, it is enjoyable to watch for humor's sake. It's cute, funny, happy, and it's something mindless to pass the time with. However, if you're looking for a plot on the level of Clannad or something, you're going to want to pass on this one, as it definitely isn't for everyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you do end up watching this, please read the manga too. It's MUCH better, and it still retains the silly, mindless feel of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! c:",

It is ok, but becomes excessive, beyond the succubus character there is no such dire need to shove ecchi into the faces of viewers.\r\nLetus delve into the true problem with the show, it does not follow the manga.... well it KIND of does but not in the way you would want it to. Take for example Shirayuki, she comes later in the story than the actual ending of the anime, hell half the anime is taken from after the same events in the manga. To be totally true, the Anime HAS around 15 chapters of the first manga thrown about out of order, but the ending of the show is chapter 10. To further compound this the first season focus' on very little that makes the manga truly great, its like Kurokami all over again, they hit some good points but totally screwed around with some major selling points and just gave it their own spin with no intention of following the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6: its OK and just that, nothing to write home about, the anime favors harem ecchi while the manga is multitudes better\\n\\n\r\nart 8: its good, but not amazing, the biggest plus is that it is not all over the scoreboard  depending on the episode.\\n\\n\r\nsound 8: good, somewhat memorable.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 6: see above, it can be placed here as well.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 8: its fun, and thats why this is so high, but this is personal preference.\\n\\n\r\noverall 7: will continue on to the second season and hope it gets some good stuff in.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal quibbles:\\n\\n\r\n- as said before the anime does its own thing at its own speed, it could have been so much better...\\n\r\n- every time moka transforms (every episode) it goes through the entire sequence and describes what is happening by a narrator. The camera pans her butt, as it enlarges, as well as her chest as a button comes loose. Unnecessary and tedious.\\n\r\n- to transform, except once, mokas rosario needs to be ripped from the chain. Somehow every time Aono is trying to embrace Moko his aim is off and it goes directly to the rosario\\n\\n\r\nIf you ended up reading any of this DO NOT READ THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS, the key characters descriptions are pretty much ripped from the manga and you will be sorely disappointed.",

The reason I'm giving this anime such a low rating is because I enjoyed the story line of the manga much better and there are elements of the main character that are supposed to change within less than six novels of the manga that didn't in the anime. I thought that the anime was kind of lame. It even seemed censored whenever the main character, Tsukune, was bitten by his vampire crush, which I thought was dumb, because that wasfunny in the manga. The anime just seems a let down after reading the manga first and having things actually happen in it. However, it might be slightly enjoyable if the audience has not yet read the manga series first, which I highly suggest.",

            "content": "First of all, I just want to say that very few animes make me want to write a review. The fact that I indeed did write one only proves that I do honestly love this anime.\r\n-BASIC PLOT-\r\nNow, back to the main topic. Rosario + Vampire is your average harem/shounen (I'd say it's more of a harem. There's more googly-eyed, cheesiness than action) with a weak, helpless guy being surrounded by big chested/cute girls, and is always making mistakes and being sexually harrassed by having boob hats or having his arm hugged by boobs...\r\n-STORY- (6/10)\r\nAono Tsukune, an average highschool boy fails his grade and ends uphaving to retake it again next year. By sheer coincidence, his father picks up an acceptance letter to Youkai Academy. Excited as him and his parents are for his first day, he finds himself on a shady, stay-the-fuck-out mountainside just infront of a forest bordering the school. On his way there, he gets ran over with a bike by Akashiya Moka, who later reveals is a vampire...\\n\\n\r\nThe story did, in my opinion got boring at times -- I found myself skipping through an episode or two in order to cut to the chase. Sometimes the episode was filled with repetition that really wasn't needed, and saved me 5-10 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n-ART/SOUND- (7/10)\\n\r\nThe art (character wise) looked a bit old, or amatuerly drawn especially for an anime which came out in 2008. This is only my personal opinion. Usually, the only time I see this kind of anime is in old American-made hentai (which generally suck... hard), though at certain angles the character's designs looked nice. As for the scenery, it did look very detailed but just like the character art, it did seem a bit retro.\\n\r\nThe sound was good, but I personally did not like some of the voice acting of the Japanese dub. For some characters, like Auno, it didn't seem to fit with his character.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER- (8/10)\\n\r\nThe character's personalities are very different from one another, and when they're all put together in a group it's quite cute how all of their opinions and emotions clash together.\\n\\n\r\nTsukune - An innocent, and defenceless teenager who is very clumbsy about what he does, and has a hard time understanding people's obvious feelings (common in harem). He feels as though he is a minority at his school, and having a group of girls defend him only makes him feel worse. Though, when he is serious about something, he is determined and strong.\\n\\n\r\nMoka - Moka is kind hearted vampire who is living as two different people. The pink haired, kind hearted, shy, cute Moka you generally see is a personality which was created in order to hold the second Moka using the Rosarie on her neck. The other Moka is a silver haired, mellow, intimidating, cute-in-a-scary-way personality. She is generally reffered to as \"the REAL Moka\" among her family -- this is revealed in Rosario + Vampire Capu 2. This Moka comes out whenever there is a battle, Tsukune is always the one to remove the rosarie (wether on accident or on purpose).\\n\\n\r\nKurumu - Kurumu is a succubus, a creature that uses their bodies and special ability called \"Charm\" to bend the will of the opposite sex. Though at first, she may seem like the evil type, it is later revealed that she is indeed a nice girl. Kurumu is generally the flirty type, and she seems to love suffocating Tsukune with her boob-trench.\\n\\n\r\nSIDENOTE: Yukari and Kurumu often playfully argue with eachother about boob size. Yukari taunts Kurumu saying \"they will get saggy when you get older, I still have a long time till I grow up!\" And so starts an argument. Though in reality, Kurumu seems to love Yukari like a little sister.\\n\\n\r\nYukari - Yukari is a witch... need I explain what a witch might POSSIBLY be? In the beginning of her appearance in the anime, she seems like an arrogant brat who cares about no ones feelings, and only her own enjoyment. Later on though, she reveals her feelings and why she treats everyone poorly and eventually befriends the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT- (8/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much. It made me laugh, facepalm, and feel embarrased for a few characters at times. Though I think this anime wont be enjoyable to some if they're picky about character personality and story line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime an 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime has quite a bit going for it in general, but the execution feels a bit lacking. In terms of characters, the cast overall is pretty\u00a0great. The main characters interact well with each other, and there's some solid character and relationship development that all feels solid. Of note is Ruby's background, which got the most development\u00a0and who had the strongest introduction arc, though afterwards she seemed to integrate into the group too fast, which feels somewhat strange in the final scene. But overall, the group feels cohesive and solid. However, most of the plot, and especially how the characters were framed\u00a0felt lacking. Most ofthe anime up to the end has a simple loop of\u00a0Tsukune\u00a0getting in trouble,\u00a0Tsukune taking off Moka's Rosario, and her defeating whoever was causing trouble. This is a loop that grows old incredibly fast. It's fine for the plots where new characters are introduced, as the focus is mostly on developing their background and such, but the others, while sometimes managing to hit a couple solid beats in character development, felt largely pointless. This combined with how the anime overall was pretty slow results in many episodes being quite tedious. Though I should note, this is something that as it approaches the end is no longer an issue, in that the last few episodes go in a different direction that gets\u00a0away from the loop and works much better. However, the other issue still remains, mainly the way characters are framed.\u00a0Tsukune\u00a0is pretty useless. His character is decent enough, but he doesn't really do much beyond removing a Rosario. A good amount of the time, he's brainwashed, tied up, or other things that remove him from having any real involvement. Even in the end, in what seems like it would be the perfect opportunity to have him finally do something, Moka's still the one that strikes the finishing blow. Now, it's fine to not focus on the protagonist all the time and focus more on other characters, but that's not what this did. This kept the focus on\u00a0Tsukune\u00a0while he was useless, which makes the stories, many of which are quite decent, feel somewhat lame, and\u00a0Tsukune's\u00a0character seem worse than it is. Still, overall\u00a0I'm going to have to say the plot is decent, with the last few episodes still being quite solid and it ending\u00a0on a reasonably satisfying note.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs and style I really liked. The animation was quite lacking though, with some\u00a0noticeably\u00a0cheap shots, such as panning across characters the exact same way multiple times while they're talking. The animation during battle\u00a0also needed to be a lot\u00a0flashier, because while depth to the battles didn't feel completely necessary, it still felt like it needed to be cooler. The soundtrack I quite liked, sounding somewhat Burtonesque at times for lack of a better way to describe it. The OP was decent and the ED was good. There was also a lot of insert song use, though the use was only decent. The comedy was never really funny, but it it kept up a lighthearted mood pretty well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nA really solid concept and good cast of characters but a mostly\u00a0repetitive story\u00a0that is not\u00a0framed that well.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "The public opinion of Anime in general seems to be one of disdain. \"It's all about a bunch of magical girls in school uniforms with short skirts, fighting a bunch of ridiculous enemies, with a lot of panty shots in between.\" would be more than less an average passerby's assessment of Anime on the whole. I am always one to speak up and correct those naysayers, informing them of the rich and diverse content that exists within the genre. But with \"Rosario to Vampire\", they actually hit the nail on the head.\r\nThis is a show that fits into the generic and stereotypical anime show likea glove. It's as if they used the old \"Do It Yourself\" Anime starter pack complete with checklist;\\n\\n\r\nDoes it take place in a school?\\n\r\nYes- check.\\n\\n\r\nIs the lead character a pretty, tomboyish, but still feminine girl or a super serious, spiky-haired boy?\\n\r\nYes (half the time) to the first one, check.\\n\\n\r\nIs there a supernatural or fantasy element that centers the plot?\\n\r\nVampires, Witches, and other monsters from various folklore, yes. Check.\\n\\n\r\nAre there fight scenes with guns, handheld weapons, or magical powers?\\n\r\nLots of magic. Check.\\n\\n\r\nIs there a mid-series break to make one season like two?\\n\r\nYes, check.\\n\\n\r\nIs there an obligatory fan service episode at a pool/hot spring/beach so all the female characters can be seen in swimwear?\\n\r\n2/3 of those. Yes, check.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you have seen so many shows like this, you have to ask aloud, \"They can't be serious with this, can they?\" Well, the good news is- No. This show is very self-aware and uses a lot of 4th wall breaks for effective laughs here and there. It's refreshing the first few times, but if someone keeps telling the same bad jokes- even if someone admits their jokes are bad- it doesn't succeed in making them funny. The episodic formula of the show gets very repetitive very fast and the drastic overuse of fan service only adds annoyance to the monotonous nature of the show. It's a grind to get through.\\n\\n\r\nWhile grinding through, you are given some decent art and some okay special effects which culminates in some of the most boring and short fight scenes I've ever seen. Even when the story does proceed far enough to finally raise the stakes and ability of the enemy of the week, it's still too little, too late as they only succeed in delaying the predictable and leading us towards a Season 2. This was all rather disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nAnother so-so aspect of the show is it's use of music, with equally mediocre opening and closing themes to accompany a fair in-show soundtrack. It also has the occasional musical number in the show itself which sometimes features characters singing. All a reason to show off the voice actresses wide range of vocal talents, which brings me to the Sub vs. Dub battle. I liked the Japanese cast better than the English one, but there is very little required of either cast script wise and each performance has their ups and downs making me decide in favor of the Japanese cast by a hair, but if you're more comfortable with English dub, you won't experience much of a drop off in quality.\\n\\n\r\nI'm probably being a bit too harsh on this show, it's not even close to terrible, but it fails to impress. With a TV-MA rating that could have been utilized to show more monstrous and violent aspects of their cast of monsters, it only succeeds in being a one-note program with a lot of chuckles, the occasional decent looking monster, boob jokes, and the transformation sequence into a fight scene for dessert. Remarkable for being totally unremarkable. Watch it for the little smile it gives you or just to fill out your MAL profile. 5/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

Censorship is strong, which really reduces all of the injected fanservice. The fanservice art is also quite \"half-assed\". If you watch this anime, you need to look for the value in how adorable their romance is. This series contains tons of relationship and character development disguised as fillers. A common critic of this series states that the story is poor but a lot of it is actually relationship content and exploration of the characters. However, I think they could have done this while placing emphasis on a moremeaningful plot. This anime also overly sexualizes a child which is in poor taste for me. \\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, Rosario really shines in some areas. The music fits the mood of the series perfectly and it's quite adorable when the characters have musical performances where they sing songs about their love. The romance that developed is very cute and compelling. There are multiple moments that will have you rolling over laughing as well. All in all, this anime could best be described as cute and cuddly, sprinkled with decent fanservice.",

I love seeing how tsukune deals with his problems and how such a mess up can land a \"human\" like tsukune into a monster world. It has a good idea, and being a fanservice anime, you would probably expect a lot of that, but in here there is a story to follow, as you try to see what happens next to tsukune....\r\nArt - I love the art in this one, it really has deep colorsand bright visuals in the fight scenes and the scene changes are flawless.\\n\r\nSound - Again, i listen to all of my anime in Dubbed so going off of the voice actors, they seem to fit almost perfectly for the characters in this anime too. I also like the OST in this one, it's kinda cheesy, but it's bearable and get's stuck in your head after listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The character development is good thru the anime in this, the main character develops nicely. But some characters seem kinda cliche for the most part. I do like how Moka has a double personality, and i like her bad side more, as she is more straightforward. Again, it's mainly fanservice so NOT much character development is here...but all the characters do have their own personality though they're powers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - So being a fanservice anime, it's very funny and enjoyable to watch, and overall if you want to add another GOOD fanservice anime that balances everything good, then this is your anime. OVERALL - 8/10, i recommend you watch this!",

After 5 episodes I dropped the anime, needless to say if you are looking for a full review of the anime this is not it. If you enjoy broken records set on repeat this anime is for you!\r\nIt started off great, a human get sent to a monster school because of his parents picking up an acceptance letter that someone dropped. But after that it goes down hill every episode is the same: Main character gets in trouble > Needs Saving > \"Accidentally\" Removes vampire rosary > Getssaved > Sucks blood repeat. Oh no wait we always need to add in that who ever they just fought becomes madly inlove with the pathetic main character. Now repeat. I like the art and the music which is probably the only reason I stuck around for 5 episodes to begin with. I still suggest you judge for yourself but for me this was a no go.",

Nothing... especially when your dad finds a flyer for a private boarding school with no requirements. Seems like a good deal, until you find out that it's a school for Monsters who don't exactly have a fondness for humanity.\nStory (5/10) - There seems to be a simple formula for this series. Guy accidently enrolls in a school for monsters and tries to hide his true identity, gets targeted for various reasons for being friends with a popular Vampire; fight ensues, and he's powerless to do anything, until he removes theseal for her powers, which only HE can do. She then proceeds to win the fight without any effort. During his survival of school, and his life in general, he befriends other Monsters, who fall in love with him. (Who would've thought?)    \\n\\n\nArt (7/10) - The colors were bright and wonderful. You could really feel the growing chemistry between Tskune and Moka before something ruined the moment.\\n\\n\nSound (4/10) - The narration of what happens to Moka when her power is unsealed is nice, but wears thin. The Intro and Outro of the show isn't anything special, something to let you know how the meat of the episode was starting, or letting you know that it was over, and you can move on to the next.\\n\\n\nCharacter (6/10) - Tskune is your average teenage who got thrown into a 'strange' situation, to say the least. That doesn't stop him from being who he is and positively effecting those around him, particularly the girls who've fallen for him. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment (6/10) - This Anime was one some recognize at first glance. Since I couldn't, I watched it, and it wasn't horrible, but felt that it could've been better.\\n\\n\nOverall (5.6/10) - This is the lowest-rated score I've given so far, but I'm sure there's worse out there. Despite it, I'm interested in seeing what the source Manga is like.",

I have watched all the hentais in the world. This anime was so stupid that I laughed every episode. The plot was not to my taste. Though I have read the manga before making this review. The manga was pretty decent but I still have to make this review to warn kids and old men who think this anime is good. In my opinion the plot is childish. Thecharacters are annoyingly obnoxious. I don't even want to say their names. Moka is by far the most annoying character. I hate the dub. I personally don't mind dubs but oh my god. The dub made me laugh my ass off. Her dubbed voice is so obnoxious that it made my ears ring for like 4 minutes after hearing it. When I watch animes and finish them I will watch the dub. I am just the type of person who likes to give animes a chance. Especially ones like Rosario to Vampire. I don't hate it but I don't recommend it. The only character that I didn't hate was Mizore. Her overall design wasn't terrible. She was a perfectly fine character. I just really hate the plot. If the anime was thought out more then I would have been happy to watch the anime,considering the manga wasn't terrible and it was enjoyable. I just hate the fact that this anime has no depth. Pantie shots every 5 seconds, Boob bouncing. I don't really hate fanservice but this whole anime somehow revolved around the fanservice instead of the plot of the anime. I may seem hypocritical since I liked B H Gata Kei, Yamada's first time, But it was actually funny. I like romance and comedy. I just didn't like this anime. I feel  ashamed of this world when I see people making reviews about how this anime was amazing or something. I gotta say props to them though. I wouldn't be able to make a review about how I loved an anime that was literally shit. I don't recommend you watch this anime for the plot.\\n\r\nIf you want to jack off to this anime go ahead.\\n\r\nThe plot was lousy.\\n\r\nThe characters were okay.\\n\r\nThe dub was horrifying.\\n\r\nAnd I didn't enjoy it at all.\\n\r\nSo. The anime was MEDIOCRE and obnoxious.",

So I understand many people don't like how they adapted the manga into this anime, but that's not why I watched this anime.\r\nWas the story all that great? No. The plot of most every episode is the exact same thing, just with different words. However, what allowed the \"story\" to progress was the character development and interaction. I felt the charactersgrew tremendously through the episodes and by the time I had finished watching, I had become very attached to each of them. Although the comedy can be sort of crass, I enjoyed it and laughed many times. Lastly, I gave this anime a 10 on sound, mainly because some of the musical pieces that  were incorporated became some of my all time favorite songs, and I still listen to them consistently.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't get past a mediocre story and can let go the \"manga is better\" mindset, I think you can really enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "With attractive character designs, on-model appearance, detailed backgrounds, and a brilliant color palette, the production quality of Rosario + Vampire is strong. A Funimation cast of regulars give a great performance for the English dub.\r\nRosario + Vampire is comfortably formulaic: a panty-laden harem comedy with monsters, plus a few magical girl elements (Moka\u2019s repeated transformation scenes & catchphrase).\r\nTsukune is a cookie-cutter male lead: a lovable, pure-hearted wimp who only has eyes for Moka but still likes the other girls as friends. Granted, Tsukune\u2019s flimsiness is more excusable given the monster-power of the other characters. Throughout the series, his girls protect him through climactic one-on-one fights.This pattern continues with minor character growth, leading up to a few final episodes framed with themes of friendship and tolerance. Some viewers may find this repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nFor humor, this show is hit or miss. Characters like to break the fourth wall, which can be fun. The music director did a terrific job of choosing themes to support the comedic moments of this series. The running gags which get further lampshade treatment by a bat character mascot (rather than the writers making new jokes) get stale very fast.\\n\\n\r\nAside from some predictable jokes and episode pacing, Rosario is good, light entertainment. There is much action, and some surprisingly emphatic scenes.  The main attraction of Rosario + Vampire  is the fanservice, and it is present in every part of the series (on a Najica Blitz Tactics level), to include the opening, closing, and \u201cNext Episode\u201d preview. If you enjoy ecchi anime and risqu\u00e9 situations, this show will appeal to you.\\n\\n\r\nManga Fan Disclaimer:\\n\\n\r\nThe timeline of Rosario+Vampire the anime is very different from the manga. There are many storyline changes. Some characters appear earlier, some are anime exclusive, and certain minor characters appear more. It is the general consensus among fans of the manga that this show took excessive liberties.\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first glance this may seem like your typical, big breasted, typical guy, mythical girl anime but, you have to dig deep to get to the heart of this anime. The plot is simple, a normal human boy \"coincidentally\" gets admitted to a school filled with monsters. This anime is considered a romance but you have to go past all the fan-service to find it. The relationship between the main character and main girl is quite funny and at times heart warming. His extreme love for her no matter who or what gets in the way is surprisinglysweet. The comedy is slap stick for its repeated boobs to the face and trips with panty shots. For all the ladies, like me, that take a chance at this anime, you have to try your best to forget about all the breasts laying around. The fan-service,to say the least, gets old fast. If you stick with this though, and don't give up, it can turn out to be somewhat funny and romantic. So I gave the story a 7, since it is quite typical and hard to find the true meaning behind the work. Though it is still high since the plot is there, somewhere.\\n\r\n      The art work on the characters is... once again typical. The girls are very cute and extravagantly made to look \"sexy\", like most ecchi animes. The boys are typical and oh so very plain. If you are a girl watching this, there are few fan-service for us ladies. A couple times throughout the main guy has his shirt off, but it is so plain and not very well drawn out that it is not very attracting. Though for the lads the girls boobs and panties are typically well drawn and bouncy , very very bouncy. You may be wondering , why such a high number for the art, well it is the landscapes. The human world, nature, and Yokai Academy is very well drawn. It has attention to detail, but not to realistic. \\n\r\n      The sound on the character is well. The voice actors do a good job representing their role on the character. The guys voice is plain but sweet. All the girls are cute and each have their on role. Either the voice actor can play the seductive girl or the cute innocent one, they make it work. Why such a low number than, the music. The same repeated quotes and music played every fight, romance, or dramatic scenes get old, so so quick.\\n\r\n       Even though I hate so much on the characters they actually are quite unique. Their is one thing you don't see to much which is a stalker. The typical moe girl, the normal sweet girl(and her sadistic side), and many others. With each introduction into a new character, the producers give enough time to get to know them. They each have very deep personal stories and sides, except of course the main guy. Anyway, each character is still very well represented the way they were supposed to be.\\n\r\n       Enjoyment, this really just matters on the viewers eyes. If you are a guy then this will be more like porn then anything. The girls though may get to see the true meaning and enjoyment in this anime. Except of course if you are a decent enough guy to see past it too.\\n\r\n       Overall it is a pretty typical anime, but still has enough RomCom, mythical creature, action fights to keep you through at least the first season. The second season, I believe, is a lot better so if you can fight through this one, and another round of fan-service, you may be able to see what Rosairo Vampire is all about.\\n\r\nGet ready guys for a lot of nose bleeds. Get ready girls for a lot of feels.\\n\r\n                          Love, oreo23a\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I heard this series was going to Capu2 I almost cried with happiness. The story follows a very cliche harem/ecchi plot, which is a guy surrounded by girls in a magical world, and each one of them dig him.\r\nFrom there, you can already understand what's going to happen. For the first season, it's tiny sub-stories with a dramatic ending. BUT the thing is that the humor in this story totally makes up for the lack of serious plot. And for you ecchi lovers..well there's only two things that we are pleased with and this show has it and you know what I mean.\r\nOverall I'monly giving a rating to the first season, which is an 8/10. As for the second season, I have high expectations and so far they have been fulfilled.",

            "content": "It's a story about a 15 year old boy named Aono Tsukune who goes to high school but it is not a normal school it's one for monsters. It doesn't sound very unique but the thing that made it unique for me was that the monsters weren't scary, mean or horrible looking but they were friendly and cute. \r\nThe story itself contains mostly separated adventures which introduces you to new character (you won't see this really much in Capu2). The way the character is introduced says a lot about the personality of the character. The most of the characters are girls and that fits becauseit's a harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is compared to the manga way more of a comedy. In the manga you see a good story without as much comedy as the anime but the anime contains way more fanservice than the manga and I think the amount of fanservice was way to high so if you don't like fanservice you probably won't like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf I look at this anime overall there is way to much fanservice for me but I liked the storyline and the combination of the genres comedy and romantic is also amazing like always.\\n\\n\r\nI hope there will be a season 3 soon but I hope there isn't as much fanservice as in season 1 and 2.",

            "content": "What do you get when you take a vampire monster show and make a love story about it? You get something that is exactly like Twilight. At least, close to it in a sense but with more sexual stuff it seems. I am not going to lie, this show is extremely ecchi with its use of panty shots. Those who are like me might wonder just what this show has besides that and I actually wonder that myself. From the personalities to the ecchi, it just seems like another school life show.\r\nWe start out with a character named Tsukune Aono who is pretty much aaverage human\u2026 actually should I consider him below average since he flunked most of his high school entrance exams? Anyway, his parents seem to be the type of people to be so air headed that when they find an entrance letter to a school, they just take it and have their son go to a school they know nothing about in typical anime trope. To this point, I wonder if most anime characters would actually be better off if they were considered orphaned or their parents are abroad because most parents who stay with their children seem like complete idiots. Going back to Tsukune, there really isn\u2019t anything at all that makes him stand out. He has average looks, a slightly below average grade point average (I\u2019m guessing because of the tests), and is from a middle class family. He has average temperament, and overall is a bland character. So why the hell does all these magical creatures want to get with him? The only thing that explains it is that Moka seems to like his blood a lot. That\u2019s really all there is about it. It\u2019s like if Edward told Bella he liked her for her personality. (For real, I do not like Twilight. Bella just seems to have no personality at all.)\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have the Vampire Moka\u2026 who does not act like a vampire for most of the series. Sometimes I wonder if her pink hair dye seeped into her brain and permanently damaged it as she is a pretty big air head. First glance of her we see is her panties by the way. She is not winning best intro scene for the main character award as we don\u2019t get to see her face first, it\u2019s her butt. In fact, most scenes with her, I wonder if she is a talking butt or boobs as they keep on centering in on those areas. I don\u2019t understand why a school would even say it\u2019s ok to have a school uniform that does not cover the girl\u2019s butts at all because no matter what, we get a nice long look at those panties even from a distance. For the longest time, I have been wondering weather I should call this a magical girl anime as well because there is a lot of transformation scenes because of Moka\u2019s other side. I would rather that this other side be the main character of this show as she seems to be more put together\u2026 more sex appeal which the artists would probably play off of but at least the personality would be better. \\n\\n\r\nAnother woman that seems to be all over Tsukune is Boobie McFlirty\u2026 I mean Kurumu Kurono. Sorry but throughout the whole show, I only really understood her as the Succubus because that was all her character really was. She throws her boobs around so much and her shameless panty showing. She ended up being a love rival to Moka but I really didn\u2019t even understand why it happened. Her first reason is to help make sure that succubi don\u2019t die out\u2026 and then because he just decided not to let her have her wings and tail from being ripped off.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have miss pedophile bait\u2026 I mean Yukari Sendou. By now, I think you can tell that I never really remembered any of the characters names. They were just stereotypes that I could not get away from. I could never understand her much as she seems like a cute lesbian girl who is a child prodigy, meaning that she is a young girl who skipped a few grades. If you want an example of this, look at Chi from Azumanga Daioh or Negi from Negima. Unlike the two I listed off, Yukari is just childish and immature. I never have seen one time in which she acted more adult or smart. Now the lesbian part is because she falls head over heals for Moka, and then just like that it seems she ends up falling for Tsukune as well. I think it would have just been better if they just had her interested in Moka if they even had to make her interested in someone. By the way, get used to seeing her underwear too because boy do they not care how old the girl is. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple other girls that end up wanting Tsukune but I can\u2019t go fully into them as it may spoil a lot of the show. All I can bring up is that yes, there are a lot more panty and boob shots.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something interesting they did when it came to the fights. They actually timed the fights and tell you just how long it was through this strange narrating talking bat. I liked this for the fact that it actually added a bit to the comedy of the fights and the fact they were even having a fight happen to begin with, what I didn\u2019t like was that it just meant that with that short of a fight, the rest of the episode was going to probably be more panties and boobs from the \u2018main character\u2019 group. Not that the fights were without panty shots and boob shots, but at least they had a little more of a reason seeing as when Moka grew into her true vampire form, her clothing didn\u2019t grow with her. That meant that her rather short skirt got shorter and her shirt got tighter around her bust area. That was the only part that actually made any sense in having that much to see. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is panties\u2026 panties\u2026 panties and more panties\u2026 and a little bit of boob. Alright, so besides that, the artwork is pretty average when you get right down to it. Most all of the girls are moe and the guys are sometimes bishonen to ugly, I think probably because of the fact this is such a harem style anime. When Moka does her transformation thing, they just reuse the scene over and over with the bats and its one of the reasons why I have a hard time not calling this a magical girl show. I think they also reuse a scene where Moka and Tsukune are staring at each other and calling out each others name too much as well. They will go back and forward a few times saying their names in a really glittery pink looking background and then finally the gag will hit. And since the animation was created by Gonzo, they have all the normal problems that go with that. Gonzo has had times where the animation is really nice and beautiful and then in things like action scenes or comedy scenes, things can get strange. Characters lose proportion a lot; the animation can look sort of half done, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is nothing special. I could probably pick out only one song from all the songs they played that could be linked to this show. The others were pretty much stock music from other anime high school romantic comedies I think. The ending song is a bit energetic and mysterious piece but not really catchy. When we get to the voices, this is where the show shines\u2026 with bland to bad voices. I understand that it\u2019s not because the voice actors are bad at all, in fact, they fit the characters really well. We have Todd Haberkorn as Tsukune (he seems to always be in the supernatural animes, doesn\u2019t he?), Monica Rial as Yukari, and Alexis Tipton as Moka. The problem lies within the script. The script seems a bit dull compared to what the story could be. They created the show to be more like a slice of life school genre anime with a \u2018monster of the day\u2019 problem happening. Because of the over saturation of the school life genre, it feels like they tried to copy every other show out there. Oh, and why do we need a voice over explaining what happens when Moka transforms every single time? I don\u2019t get it. Nothing changes in why she would transform so there is no need to bring it up every time.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show isn\u2019t all that bad, it did bother me that they kept on showing the girls panties so much. They over sexualized the show and the characters. The rest of the show was more like typical school life drama with a guy who has so many girls flaunting around him.",

Me personally I have not watched it in sub yet, but I plan on soon.\r\nOverall Rating:7 Good\\n\\n\r\nI would for sure recommend this for 2 reasons, 1) It's different and if you enjoy fan service and or ecchi then this is right for you. and 2) Even though the anime take a large gap from the Manga it still turned out nice.",

In the first episodes, when Tsukine was being beated up by some monsters he didn't die because he is just a normal human. An example, When Tsukune was trown off the vending machine, his spinal cord must be already broken when that happened because if you have common sense, that vending machine was completly crushed and when that happens your spinal cord gets broken then you die. Just like that and he recovered injust a few minutes. I mean its pretty crazy for a normal human.\\n\\n\r\n2. The girl named Kurono Kurumu which is a succubus. She has an ability to charm males. In the last episode, why didn't she used her charm to use it against her enemy which is Kuyou. She could have just used her charm to calm him down and settle the problem, well although the story will get boring.\\n\\n\r\nWell thats all well I'm sure that many people notice that too.",

It really struck a chord in me because if you look pass the superficial level of, \"Oh, it's just an anime,\" and reallyfocus on the adversity and tension that our hero faces each day, it really tells you something about the creators' underlying message.\\n\r\nWould've been better if they hadn't introduced a VERY key part of the story until the last few episodes. You'll see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nWow. Really stunning visuals. The only thing that kept it from being perfect is there is a considerable drop off between the animation in the first episode, compared to the last. Trust me. Watch the series, then compare the first and thirteenth. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nGood music, loved the bat's voice, voice acting, etc. You can tell that this wasn't rushed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nClear and distinct characters really guide the series through to the end. The only problem is that the majority of the characters are too one-dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI had a great time watching it. Except they didn't (***SPOILERS***) even allow Mako and Tsukune to kiss, which was, actually, a bigger let-down than one might think. Then they drop a bombshell by explaining that Tsukune might be in love with Mako's vampire form, instead of Mako. That just doesn't make sense if you've watched the series through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nYou don't need to put your brain under your sofa to watch this one. It keeps you thinking... well, at least for the final few episodes. \\n\r\nGood harem, good anime. If you like being entertained by this kind of genre, you can't really go wrong with this one.",

The character development and the relationship between Moka and Tsukune is just amazing, and they thrown quite a twist in this in the sense Moka has 2 different personalities,or better put she's quite literally 2 different people in 1 and Tsukune has managed to make both of thim love him.\\n\\n\r\nIt's heartbreaking to live through the painful memories of having to end this show!

            "content": "Rosario Vampire is basically your average fantasy harem comedy that made me have mixed feelings in regards to several departments of the show.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around a human teen who is enrolled into a school during the summer, only to find out it's filled with monsters. The show basically revolves around him and the girls he becomes friends with and their attempts to stop a random bad guy/girl from doing something bad. It also revolves around every girl in his group trying to get him to fall in love with them.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art was good for an anime that was released in 2008, themovements looked fluid, although I had two complaints about the art. One, for starters, was the massive amount of panty shots in this series. In all the animes I have seen, I've seen a fair amount of fanservice in the form of breasts and practically nudity, but rarely panty shots. This one took it to another level, showing a panty shot in every other camera shot. Another issue I had was in one of the episodes (Epi. 9) where in animators used a shot of Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore in the water, and then when they were talking to Tsukune and Moka, they used the exact same shot, but at a distance. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP was good, but the ED was really great. Sincerely, the ED was the only thing I genuinely enjoyed out of every episode. The music throughout the episode is okay, but nothing noteworthy of remembering. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are okay, with Tsukune being the Main Male Character who's pretty much trying to cover his ass from being found out he's a human while being pretty much a wimp; Moka is a vampire who's very kind and caring but tries to protect Tsukune at all costs, Yukari is basically an 11 y.o. witch who has a \"little sister\" personality, and Mizore is an ice fairy who constantly stalks Tsukune. The only good character of this group is Inner Moka, which is summoned when Tsukune takes off her rosary, which brings out Inner Moka and she basically becomes a badass kicking the enemy's ass in a matter of seconds to minutes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThe anime was okay, there were scenes that made me laugh, some made me cringe from how cheesy it was or cringe when there was a scene with too much fanservice. The one thing from the show I enjoyed was, as I mentioned, the ED of the show and the fight scenes of Inner Moka and whoever the antagonist is for the episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nRosario Vampire felt kind of a waste of time for me, it had it's ups and downs, there were scenes I enjoyed while some scenes I cringed at. If you're a fan of harems and fanservice, go ahead and watch it, if not, just move on for something better.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE!!\r\nI put Rosario Vampire on my list of anime that are simply so terrible that you can't stop watching them. A simple, average, puny, wimpy boy, played by Shinji Ikari, surrounded by gorgeous teen and preteen girls who all for some reason or another desperately want him in the pants. This theme has been done before and done to death, and the overabundance of panty shots just further pigeonholes this anime into the mediocre ecchi territory. Personally, the manga is much better and if you are reading this you should give it a try.\r\nStory: (5/10)\r\nThere really isn't any story besides the first episode andthe last couple episodes. A human goes to a monster school by mistake and gets lots of female friends that all want his D. Every other episode besides 1, 12 and 13 are all filler and all have the same exact tone to them and the same things happen in each one.  In short, it\u2019s your typical harem anime where the main lead is weak and needs help CONSTANTLY!\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : (8/10)\\n\r\nShueisha did a good job at animating the characters and monsters involved. There was a lot of imagination involved in the show and although not spectacular it did a good job in portraying the characters emotions and scenery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : (6/10)\\n\r\nThe main guy is called Tsukune, and he is your typical male ecchi/harem lead, nothing to comment on further.\\n\r\nThe main girl is Moka, who is a vampire, but unlike you would expect from a vampire she is very kind and cheerful (she reminds me a bit of Lala). She becomes Tsukune's first friend, loves sucking his human blood and falls in love with him. The only interesting and unique part about Moka is her rosario; if removed from her chest Moka becomes her true self (a true vampire); her personality changes and she becomes much more powerful.\\n\r\nFurthermore, 3 more girls join Tsukune's harem. The first one being Kurumu, a huge boobed succubus who tries to win him for herself. The second girl is the child witch Yukari who tries to behave like the older girls. The third girl is Mizore, a yukki-onna, and stalker.\\n\r\nFurther characters include Gin, a guy who likes to take pictures of girls in their underwear, a teacher with cat ears and tail, Ruby another witch, Kokoa, Moka's younger sister, a bat who serves as narrator and many other minor characters.\\n\r\nOverall, the characters lack personality but who cares, there are some cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nSound : (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art and the animation is nice. The OP and ED is good, nothing bad about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : (6/10)\\n\r\nI purely rated the enjoyment factor just on the fanservice/the cheesy romantic parts. I did not enjoy the story nor did I enjoy a weak male lead whose progression got no where. It\u2019s a fun anime to watch, but don\u2019t expect any real progress story wise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : (6/10)\\n\r\nOverall, this was not one of my favorites...it would probably be in my bottom five. But it is funny and a cute and perky romance/comedy anime. So if you like those kinds of light shows, then go ahead and watch it, you might like it. :)\\n\\n",

MC is the only human in a monster school (like OMG what are the odds) and the story follows him trying his best to fly under the radar even though all he does is attract attention to himself. \r\nCharacters: Awful. God awful. No. No. No. No.No. The fact that I endured two seasons of this is amazing. There is no development. This show is so cliche it is shitty. Every time the rosary comes off, Moka's alter ego comes out and some fight scene happens. Every episode this happens. EVERY EPISODE THIS HAPPENS. And of course during every fight scene, Tsukune's harem looses their clothes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Unless you're into cliche harems that attempt to be funny but fail, don't bother.

The art is great and the voice actors did their jobs very well in both English and Japanese. Although harem is not exactly my style, the \"love\" scenes between all of the characters are quite enjoyable.\r\nThe characters definitely all have their own personalities and it is intriguing to see all sorts of monsters meeting other monsters. I find the concept interesting, but think they could have made the series even MORE interesting.\r\nOverall, I gave the series an8 and look forward to seeing what happens to Tsukune and everyone else in Capu2!",

            "content": "Well, it seems like almost every comedy anime out there wants to be the new, \"Tenchi Muyo\", and this series is no exception.\r\nNow I'm not saying that that is a bad thing mind you. The story is a little unique in it's own right, but there are many similarities to other shows out there. For example:\r\nMany girls, one guy = Tenchi Muyo\r\nTwo personalities dependent on a specific item = Yu-Gi-Oh!\r\nGirls always save guy = Ah! Megami-sama!\r\nMany situations from misunderstandings = Three's Company\r\nOk, now that I have that out of my system...This series is actually rather well done. The main characters are easy to get usedto, yet don't seem generic. Character growth is a little slow, but it does exist. And while the show has a heck of a lot of, \"fan service\", the story is still the most intriguing part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have yet to read the manga of this, so I do not  know how it will compare, but I do know that if you take the show as a completely different experience, instead of trying to make it hold up to the book (like most people do),  more than likely you will enjoy it...Especially if your a guy (don't deny it, you all know that you like fan service shots).",

Of course not to judge a book by its cover and delved deeper.\r\nThe series gets a straight 7 across the board. It wasn't perfect and it certainly had it's down sides but the artwork was decent, similar to what is normally seen in anime and has plenty of fan service.\r\nThe music was fitting to the series, very lovey dovey in the beginning sequence then turns to a sensual feel for the ending.The story is somewhat unique but barely since the series does deal with the traditional monsterslike vampires, werewolves, and witches; along with some not so known monsters, and a human manages to trick them all- yeah! But watching the series, I see there is an obvious lack of common sense among the characters and their decisions and a constant back and forth love talk between the main two protagonist (Tsukune and Moka) and the butting in of the other girls of this put together harem.\\n\r\nWhile most of the characters have their own special personalities and traits they all seem to have one thing on their minds and that's the man of the series (and in some cases their is a bit of yuri). \\n\r\nOverall the anime did keep me interested and laughing, if anything it is good for embarrassing comedy and one anime you might want to be careful of watching with certain groups. \\n\r\nAlso some fourth walls are broken but that just adds to the fun.",

I found it very fun to watch and had a lot of fun watching Tsukune's adventures with the girls :). \r\nAs it is a harem anime with ecchi written all over it with crazy fan-service, I feel that it actually has a pretty decent story behind it. I found there is some good character development (namely with Inner Moka, Kurumu and Tsukune) and it also has it's deep moments too. I really like how the character Tsukune seems to be moreinvolved wth the other characters than typically known in harem anime and is not often shoved to the side like most. This very fact is one of the bigger reasons I enjoyed it more and overall, I give this anime an 8/10 for having some decent character development, serious moments and being very enjoyable, despite it's large amounts of fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind silly mountains of fan-service, than this might be a good watch :).",

His parents have managed to enroll him in a school, but it's no ordinary school! Tsukune will be attending the Youkai Academy, a place where monsters learn how to co-exist with humans! As the werewolves, vampires, witches and other monsters are required to retain their human forms, Tsukune - the lone human - is able to avoid their bloodthirsty gazes. However, hequickly attracts the attention of a number of devilish beauties including the vampire Moka, a busty succubus and even a young witch!

The jealousy thing is a bit too serious in this anime.\r\nSome shortcomings of the story:\r\n-Where on Earth is this thing situated?\r\n-The school seems pretty small but as the story proceeds, it kind of fleshes out in thenumber of students and classes. This seems pretty weird.\\n\r\n-Come on, there's no patrolling or security outside campus considering this whole area belongs to monsters? Students can practically go a bit farther than school, transform into their monster states, and freaking kill each other and no one says anything. How absurd.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that made the story stand out was that it's not an intense story even if it's filled with superpowers and monsters. In other words, no one actually dies.

I guess so they wouldn't be so cool or to give the main character a since of still being human in a world that is far from.  \r\nThe show seems in a rush to cover as much of the first 5 volumesas possbile and compress that into 13 epi all the while leaving out the elements that helped build up and make the story as interesting as it was. With season 2 coming out there is little sign that this highly compressed half baked setup will be changed.",

I don't hate the fanservices but some of it appeared at the wrong time. I also hate the main character because he almost can't do anything before he have vampire's blood flowing in him.\r\nSTORY 5/10 \r\nThe story is just like the manga. If you have read the manga, then you already know what will happen. \r\nArt and sound 8/10\r\nThe art and the animation is nice. The OP and ED is good, nothing bad about it.\r\nCharacter 4/10\r\nThis is the part where I hate most. The characterare so bad written, I more like the character in manga instead in the anime, I dunno why but I just hate it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really enjoy this because of the story and the character were bad. I just hope the manga aren't bad like the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI regret watch this show since it horrible, it's not worth your time, I suggest you to read the manga instead of the anime.",

It's satiric purpose which many who have watched don't understand is astounding. The reason many people say it is essentially the same thing over and over is because it is. Funny situtation leads to main guy confusing or hurting a girl, girl runs off, guy gets in trouble, girl comes back and miraculously saves him. This is a ircet pardy of the majority of these romance/action animes.",

            "content": "Rosario vampire. This is basically the monster girl quest of anime. The main character is trying so hard not to get laid while a bunch of monster girls want to sleep with him.\r\nThe bad. It seemed like it was going for the monster of the week approach by in a more adult series. As childish as some of the jokes are, it is still meant for older teens to adults. So this monster of the week scenario isn't really all that good of an idea. It would have benefited from having arcs dedicated to a different monster rather than having a monster of the week,because we don't get the want for these villains to go down. The villains are another thing I don't like about the series, they all seem too forced, with the exception or Ruby, who has a legitimate reason for attacking and killing human beings. The series doesn't take itself as seriously as it should at most points. At some points it does, but those parts aren't serious enough to warrant almost a whole season of comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nThe good. Where as it doesn't work as a whole, the monster of the week scenario does add a lot of humor to the series, making it forgivable. The comedy is something that this series does very well, whether it is situation comedy or a play on words within the series, they handle the comedy very well. But when it comes to being serious, and having a serious scene between two characters, they can pull it off well. I did really enjoy the art style of this show and felt that it fit with the feel of the series. And the ending was a really good.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nIt's good. I really enjoyed it and I would suggest giving it a try.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "Rosario+Vampire is sooooo stupid, why would I want to watch an harem anime that's so stupid? Because it's fun! This is so stupid that it's fun I actually found myself laughing with this anime a lot just as I did with Highschool DXD, but just because it's fun does that make it good? Well, let's take a look. \r\nThe plot centers around a human named Tsukune who accidently gets enrolled into a school named Youkai Academy, a school that's purely inhabited by monsters and meets a beautiful vampire named Moka who wears a rosary. He also comes across a few other monster girls that heends up befriending and each of them wanting a piece of him. Kurumu the Succubus, Yukari the Witch, and Mizore the Yuki-Oona, (Ice Woman). \\n\\n\r\nIt's basically just a typical harem story of more then one woman wanting the same guy cause they either find him attractive or they love his personality and want to be his girlfriend and eventually; marry him but what keeps it entertaining is the comedy. The comedy is just freaking hilarious and yes there are times that it can get a little annoying but the comedy keeps it going. It's also got some great fighting sequences in it though it does get a little boring cause it only lasts like 1-3 minutes, but it's still good. The anime while probably could had been a little better I will say is pretty good. Hell, I really love the fact that they made Moka a very colorful vampire and I don't say that often for vampires because we're typically used to seeing the goth like version of a vampire which is usually what they are, but here it's just a nice change of pace really. \\n\\n\r\nThe music unfortunatly didn't really do it for me here. It wasn't entertaining or anything nor was it that good, with the exception of one thing, the ending theme. The ending theme was actually pretty good and I loved the scenery that they used for it. I also loved that it started out slow and then got really going with this fast pace, rock theme to it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the characters acting the same in every episode, with them trying to win Tsukune over by either seducing him, sucking his blood, or freezing him, etc. The characters were honestly not that bad, they had their own personality, their own reasons for wanting to have Tsukune to themselves, Mizore in perticular, and I liked the fact that they were all of a different race. Hell, I really enjoyed Mizore a lot. I loved her story arc, I loved her design, and I actually loved the fact that she was the only monster outside the school who knew about Tsukune before she came into the picture. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, while this anime is undeniably stupid, it is honestly a ton of fun to watch, because it was the comedy that really kept it going. Though I will say that even though we did get a second season that was also only of 13 episodes, I honestly wish we had gotten more because I think they could had made it a little better if they had more episodes to it.",
