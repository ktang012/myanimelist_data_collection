            "content": "Sket Dance is an interesting and hilarious anime that will make you laugh at almost every episode. It's about 3 people who came together and made a club to help others who are in need. They then try their best to complete every task they are handed;even when someone or something blocks their way, they still find a way to through.\r\nStory- 9\r\nIn every episode, there will be various ways to make you laugh out loud, like jokes,puns,random funny comments, etc.The jokes are easy to understand and  the whole series almost flows smoothly.I never laughed so much by watching an anime before~\r\nThere is also somedrama  developement in the series that you don't expect from AN anime of this genre.\\n\r\nThe story is thought out well and does have episodes that has some seriousness in there.It showed some of the main characters pasts and how they all meet and became Sket Dance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nA wanna-be samurai? A sensitive but TALENTED boy? A boy that only talks with a computer?YES this anime has many characters that have their own unique personality which i like and they work off of each other, which makes the anime more amazing! There are flaws, but not too much that makes you dislike them. For example: Over-reacting on simple mistakes *cough* tsubaki* but it makes him cute (X\\n\\n\r\nBossun made me laugh the most. He may child-like characteristics but he becomes serious when in focus mode. He makes the most hilarious face expressions and is really talented in art and craft.And his great enemy is Tsubaki , one of the student council members and.....read more about it in the manga\\n\\n\r\nHimeko comes next.You see her swinging her hockey stick around,and hitting people down, but don't think her as a delinquent yet. She shows her mother-like skills as you watch the anime and she makes the perfect comedy duo with bossun.\\n\\n\r\nSwitch is my third favorite, with his random comment and computer sounds. Even thought he doesn't talk with his voice, he uses a computerized sound systems to talk. I am mostly amazed of how he could type so quickly , its like he's speaking himself.And he's pretty handsome too XD\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nAll i can say about it is that is shows the expressions perfectly and detailed;sharp and clear. To me the art is like gintama,Beelzebub,and,MM!.Not too much detail with the casual parts but when its time for seriousness of a extreme joke, it becomes more complex or like the art you see in Ben 10 ,dragon ball,or one piece.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs i said, its a funny, enjoyable anime. It made me LAUGH OUT LOUD and made me want to re watch some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nSomething worth watching.With it's comedy and drama that will leave you satisfied after each episode.also recommend to read the manga too to read about the protagonists pasts in more detail.\\n\r\nI can't find anything i dislike about this!",

            "content": "\"Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.\"\r\nThere are some stories that end up having a lot more to them than was initially expected. They aren\u2019t perfect, they might not even be completely logical \u2013 but they\u2019re something that managed to catch you off guard in the best ways possible. Take a look; there\u2019s a chance that SKET Dance might blossom into such a series for you\u2026\r\n[STORY]\r\n------------\r\nThe core plot is just a simple, mainly episodic story about a quirky trio of friends that solve problems and help people out. But there are also some very tightlywritten and amazingly powerful (multi-episode) storylines within it that I can\u2019t say much about \u2013 for fear of spoilers. Just know that they don\u2019t come off as abrupt, but rather fit smoothly into the \u2018narrative\u2019 and add a lot to it. Don\u2019t let the comedy-oriented episodes fool you into thinking that that\u2019s all the show has in store for you.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note - being perfectly blunt and honest - this series is best classified as a \u2018dramedy\u2019. The overall tone you are first introduced to is that of a school-life comedy. The drama picks up slightly near the beginning, but truly picks up a little farther in. After that point, both exist within the show almost equally (with a few exceptions). The balance struck between the two is well-done, as neither overwhelms the other. They work together to create a fantastic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing should be noted though. When the show ends, there\u2019s no solid culmination for the characters. It just kind of... ends. So be prepared for that.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe art is very high-quality. Frenetic motion (due to the fast-paced comedy within the series), facial expressions, backgrounds and lighting are all above par. Character designs have had a lot of thought put into them \u2013 almost everyone is unique. And the best part is that the quality stays consistent through all seventy seven episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nSKET Dance utilizes music in a very effective way. It plays songs that match the current scene. If it\u2019s comedic, the music will be bombastic and crazy. If it\u2019s serious and dramatic, the music will fit that. It helps enhance the presentation. But it also does one thing that is greatly appreciated: it shuts up when it needs to and lets what\u2019s happening play out with no influence from the music at all. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting side of things, this anime also excels. The seiy\u016b gave their all in every episode. Everyone was well-voiced and sounded natural.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe main three characters are pretty unique and unconventional, having a lot of depth and personality. Switch, the genius otaku, who talks through his computer\u2026 Himeko, the occasionally violent Okinawan \u201cYankee\u201d with a soft-spot for cute things\u2026 And finally the leader of the SKET club, Bossun. He's a rather interesting choice for a main character, as at times he\u2019s almost completely inept and useless - but at other times he really shines. It\u2019s actually quite refreshing.  \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, these aren\u2019t the main character\u2019s real names, but rather their nicknames. They go almost entirely by those nicknames - each of which has a story behind it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also almost too many side characters to mention (which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on your tastes). Most of them are great, having something of worthwhile value to contribute. A few serve almost no purpose \u2013 but they don\u2019t overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the true heart and soul of this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis was, honestly, one of the funniest anime series I\u2019ve had the pleasure of watching. It was also very emotionally powerful at times. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not perfect. There are plenty of flaws. But they never detracted from the true experience of the anime. That experience being the character interactions, and also the lessons the show teaches. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic series in the areas of character development and comedy. Most everyone can find something of value in this anime. If the comedy doesn\u2019t do it for you, the serious bits of the show probably will, or vice-versa.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance. \r\nJust the title itself say's alot about the anime. \r\nSKET stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot. The second (\u52a9\u56e3), which instead uses kanji, derives from the verb tasukeru (\u52a9\u3051\u308b), meaning to help or save.\r\nSo just from the title you can in some sorts understand that this series is about, well.. Helping. \r\nJudged by many as Gintama set in a school life setting, the series have had a tendency of being flooded by \"hate war\" comments. I agree with the Gintama fans that the series is very similar. But at the same time it really shines on it's own at times.\r\n But if youthink about the fact that author Kenta Shinohara worked as the assistant of  Hideaki Sorachi (creator of Gintama), it's really not that weird for him to be influenced. \\n\\n\r\n--- Story ---- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nStory wise I have to deduct some points due to it being too heavily influenced by Gintama. So if you can picture a scene where Gintama didn't exist, I would have given it a 10/10.  \\n\\n\r\nBasically the story is as simple as 3 people, get to know them, see them interact with other people. Easy huh? But it doesn't have to be more complicated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about Sket Dance, is how the story progresses. You get introduced to many supporting characters, but not so fast that you feel that it affects the relationship with  the main cast. And this way you get to know the characters in a perfect pace. Both past, present and \"future\" gets depicted in a decent way.But as said, even if it's really well made, it's kinda too similar too Gintama to give it a full score. \\n\\n\r\n---Art-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSket Dance is just a really good looking anime. It's very typical shounen art. They have a very tyipcal shounen trait in the fact that they give the main cast something special, like an item, special hair color or something similar to recognize them by. In this case, you have Bossun's hat for example. What I love about the art in SKET Dance, is how they play with different ways of drawing. Take for example one of the characters, called Saotome Roman, who turns everything around her into a manga. This playfulness really got to me, and I loved it so much. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound--- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really, enjoyed the music in SKET Dance. I have a tendency of skipping openings and/or endings, but SKET Dance, really just got me hooked on both how well made the openings were made to fit the music, and how good the music was. The Sketchbook really fits the anime, and I struggle to decide which opening of 2 and 4 I love most. The youtube part in opening 4 was absolutely awesome. \\n\\n\r\n--Character-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe maincast is made up off:  Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun) , Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch).  Mostly all of the fun about the series is based on interactions between the main cast themselves, or between the main cast and supporting characters. Like how Bossun and Himeko make the perfect boke and tsukommi pair for example.  Or how you have Switch and a girl called Yuuki Reiko have epic arguments about science vs occult.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I find most fascinating about the character maincast, is how the protagonist is in terms, the weakest character, which is very uncharacteristic for a shounen anime. He gets picked on alot for having this kinda role, and I love it. \\n\\n\r\nBut I can't withold the fact that the main cast, do have kinda, sad backstories, but this is what I enjoyed most of this anime. There is two different types of characters (in some sense). The ones you look up to, and the ones you wanna support, give a hug and so on. The main cast have tendencies of both. Very nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are hilarious and extremely well made. Almost all of them are super weird, like overly tsundere girl, a fatty thinkining she is really hot, student council sadist and so on. My favorite supporting character is probably Dante, who only speaks in Visual Kei mode. It's just so funny. \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the anime's I've enjoyed most in quite sometime. It's not as funny in the start, but just takes off after a little while. My favorite epsiode probably has to be an episode, where the protagonist Bossun, drinks a fluid which mixes up all his facial expressions, or the episode where they play Hyperion. Just watch it ok? Come on. Go go. \\n\\n\r\n--Overall-- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall. It's just great. I really hope it will return like Gintama has done so many times. If you have seen Gintama, give it a chance. If you wanna watch a series that just makes you laugh and laugh, but can also hit that soft spot inside, check out SKET Dance. You won't be dissapointed. \\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance became my instant favorite the moment I got into it, and it has valid reasons for so. It's one of the very few anime's which execute both the Slice of Life and Comedic elements perfectly well. 77 episodes is not a very huge number considering the vast amount of entertainment it provides. \r\nSo the story revolves around the fictional Kaimei High School, with our three members of the 'SKET Club' who aid the people in need of help, whatever their issue maybe. You may think at first the number of episodes for this show is too much, considering that it revolves around thevery same concept of the SKET Club supporting the people and getting rid of their troubles, but there's more to it. SKET Dance has an extremely funny and a humorous nature that goes hand in hand with its plotline. With each episode there's a great amount of witty and comical jokes cracked and at times sticks to making parodies of other anime as well although that in comparison is very less than the original humor the show provides. Adding to the uniqueness of SKET Dance. \\n\\n\r\nMaking a show with a school setting but at the same time the genre comedy being its core is not a very easy task to accomplish as it tends to have a lot of clich\u00e9d objects but this is where SKET Dance truly shines. While being humorous most of the time, SKET Dance also achieves what its actually about, helping others in need. Whatever their request maybe, with each and every episode our SKET Club manage to complete the task given and end that certain episode on a high note, while also being true and original every time. However if you are thinking that with each episode, no matter how humorous it may be or how good a finish it provides, it's inevitable that with the mixture of comedic situations and solving the problems of those in trouble and sticking with the same concept, it's bound to get boring at some point. But this is where the character development comes in to play. SKET Dance gives a great amount of devotion and concentration to its characters. Each of our three protagonists of the SKET Club, Bossun aka Fujisaki, Himeko aka Onizuka Hime (Also known as the legendary 'Onihime' in her past) and Switch aka Usui Kazuyoshi. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters, these are our trio of the SKET Club who support the ones in need. Bossun is the leader of the club, the one created the club and helped both Himeko and Switch join the club. For starters, Bossun is depicted as quite an unconventional character. He's not your typical cool-guy who overwhelms everyone else on talent on other things, but in fact the exact opposite of it. I don't mean to say that he's no help to the people and the club itself, it's just that he's never taken seriously. Compared to Himeko's brute strength and Switch's power of information, Bossun doesn't have anything you'd call a special talent. Or there's probably one, \"The concentration mode\" as he calls it. With the glasses he doesn't always wear and keeps it at the top of his red hat, when he does use it though it helps to go over the tiniest details and always help him solve them a case. Bossun is always overlooked at, and I don't mean in a bad way but in a funny way. As I said before he's not your typical cool character or some lazy ass guy who them goes on become a hero later in the show. However this does not in any way degrade Bossun's character and I'd say he's one of the most likeable protagonist around. \\n\\n\r\nNext is Himeko. Once known as the legendary delinquent Onihime, Himeko's past is quite irritating. Always feared by local thugs and students alike, Himeko is unable to make a friend for herself but that's when she encounters Bossun and things began to change for Himeko. Personally I love Himeko's accent, where she speaks in a different dialect than the usual. Himeko is a very crucial member to the club and they always rely on her strength which is her power in the time of need. Switch is our next character and he's a bit weird. He's a guy who likes crappy video games and always hangs around with his Laptop and so much so that he speaks with people using it too. Switch also is a hardcore otaku and has all the information stored about the students and teachers alike from Kaimei in his laptop which is always an helpful accessory to the club. I'd love to talk about Himeko and Switch in detail but I'm afraid I couldn't by giving away some spoilers. A couple of episodes are dedicated to both Himeko and Switch later in the show which tells the backstory of the two and it's very sad which will leave you teary-eyed. \\n\\n\r\nOne of SKET Dance's trademarks is definitely its epic voice acting. Most of the jokes and humor is greatly accompanied by the way our characters react to the scenario, and in that aspect SKET Dance does it better than almost any other. There's a variety of opening and ending themes for SKET Dance both meant to be fun and dramatic varying from episodes to episodes. Many of the special episodes thrown between the show which focuses solely own its character has its own theme as well. The artwork is well synchronized with all the other elements as well giving birth to a highly entertaining and at times sad piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nSKET Dance does not follow a single pattern and thus is mostly episodic. In other words there are no separate arcs and it simply continues to follow it storyline. From the start till the end SKET Dance does not dissapoint you in any way. With light-hearted humor, sad moments accompanied by shocking plot twists, all play a very pivotal role in this anime. The inclusion of the Student Council Academy and its characters is important too, as they serve as a rival to the SKET Club but in a rather friendly manner. For the ones who are having a thoughts or two considering the length of this anime, I'd advice you to overlook it immediately as the fun it provides makes you forget about how long it is. In fact once I finished it I was left with hopes of watching more episodes. Make no mistake, SKET Dance ends perfectly well and does not leave the viewer any questions unanswered, but just as I finished SKET Dance I was beginning to miss the antics our SKET Club provided us. At the start of this show, I had planned on finishing this quick with atleast finishing three episodes a day. Considering how good this is and the laugh it provides you, I can tell you there are certainly some dull moments in this show when I stopped watching it for a while. Yes, the fact that is 77 episodes long does come to light at some point, but that's all the more reason to take this slow and steady as the enjoyment in the coming episodes is endless as is the same for the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSKET Dance is an anime that will definitely go down as one of the best within its genre and is highly recommended by me to anyone who likes anime with some fun and humor.\\n",

            "content": "You're probably wondering, is this anime good enough for me to watch? What is all the hype about this anyway?  Well, if you are into comedy anime and just want to have a good laugh, read on!\r\nThe story for Sket dance is about these three friends: Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun),  Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch) and their formation of the SKET Dan! This stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement and Tech, an Assistance club to help students with their problems, big or small at Kaimei High School. Each and every episode there is usually some problem around the school or their city thatthey go and fix, no matter the obstacle they encounter, they go all lengths to complete the tasks they get, usually with hilarious results. There are also some episodes that they just do some random things, hang out in their club room or actually have some story progression. Most of the story progression so far in the anime has been about the three main characters\u2019 pasts, which show how they became the people they are today. Also there are some twists and turns in the story and of course some romantic progression as well, but the anime focuses more in the silliness instead of the seriousness. Which is not all annoying, unlike in some anime where you just keep yelling at the screen, \"WHY ARE YOU NOT TOGETHER YET?\" or \"WHERE'S THE STORY PLOT?\" As I said, this anime is mostly comedic, so it's not strange to not see much of a story plot since it's mostly hilarity between Bossun and his friends. So if you're just wanting a bit of silliness once in a while, go ahead and watch. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation of the show, it's your semi-typical shounen anime. There are actions scenes but mostly are there to make fun of the classic shounen scenes, the girls are a bit busty at some times, but not to the point where it becomes eechi. Of course there are some instances where the animation art changes to something different, mostly for comedic reasons, for example Roman Saotome, is the embodiment of shojo anime that there's time she breaks the fourth wall and turns the scene into her image of shojo anime and also the episode when Gintama and Sket Dance get together and change the art style of the main characters to fit into the Gintama world. All in all, the animation is amazing and well-drawn.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music of Sket Dance... I have to say, it's awesome! In each OP and ED of the series, there is different music playing, and each is as amazing as the next. Each is an alt. rock songs, but it's pretty good that makes you want to dance! Of course, that's me, but I'm sure it's enjoyable for all who watches it as well. \\n\\n\r\nFor characters, as I said before this is a comedic shounen anime, It's full of wild and unique characters that you wonder to yourself, is there a school like this I can transfer to? While the main cast are quite the interesting bunch, the supporting cast is much more unique. Have you been to a school where a wood shop teacher looks like Jason, a chemisty teacher that is so lazy but a genius and constantly experimenting on his students with various of chemicals with interesting side effects, a kendo student that dresses and talks like he's a samurai, a student that is a descendant of ninjas, a girl that for some reason has the power to break the fourth wall and change the anime to her shojo paradise and the girl that is so creepy that reminds us of the girl from the Ring? I WISH! but while the show is mostly focused on the comedic aspect, it does have its moments where the drama shows up or the romance, which doesn't disrupt the enjoyment of a shounen anime. The most of the character development does go more to the main characters but sometimes it shown in the supporting cast as well, The more important ones are the characters\u2019 pasts, which really shows more about the characters and make you understand them more. Why does Switch talk all the time on the laptop or not show much emotion? Why is Himeko always hesitant to talk about her past life? And why is Bossun always wearing that hat? And then there's the twist... oh yes the twists... this twist is really well placed that while it is shocking at least, it does make you feel that you, for some reason, knew it. But I do say the drama aspect is what makes me hooked because you have to know more! Not just those questions and problems occur but more are asked and answered as their pasts are revealed and the show continues. \\n\\n\r\nWhy I enjoyed this anime so much was because I love comedy because it brings a smile to my face and makes me forget about the stress I had for the week, so I enjoyed this quite a lot. This anime made me laugh and cry like no other anime, especially the invisible man episode... that still makes me cry tears of laughter each time I see it. I was always so excited for Fridays because each and every episode has been so funny, you want to see more. What are Bossun and the gang up to this week? Is there going to be more progression involving the characters? \\n\\n\r\nSo I suggest this for who want to watch just some hilarity and want to have some fun, all in the same time have some drama and romance in the mix. If you want to laugh so much that you will remember the show for eternity, then I say watch Sket Dance! Hopefully you'll love this more than I did. All I can say to wrap this up is that I really hope they keep the anime alive and continue it. The manga does continue the anime and it is a great read. The anime is what made me fall in love with the series and made me read the manga as well, so go and read the manga as well as watch the anime. So in other worlds, WATCH THE ANIME AND LOVE IT! \\n\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10",

            "content": "Overall this series is a 5. And boy is it a 5; SKET Dance takes mediocrity to a whole new level of blandness, leaving the audience apathetic and not really sure why they watched it or if they gained anything from doing so. \r\nStory: The first thing you think right off the bat from the first episode \"so it's Gintama but in high school, right?\" and really, that's not far off. Two guys plus one girl who is obscenely strong form a team that performs odd jobs around the school which leads them to zany adventures.  Meanwhile there this student council whose leader isn'treally all that responsible so he around very often for one reason or another and the uptight vice comma-...er, vice president, who is doing all the work for the Student Council  doesn't really care for the SKET-dan all that much. While it certainly does sound familiar, that wouldn't matter as long as the jokes were funny and with its humor it could stand on its own two feet......\\n\\n\r\n..... However SKET Dance lacks this sort of humor it so sorely needs. The attempts at comedy come off as being very uninspired, self-absorbed, or, in a few cases like it's censoring itself, the last one being very damaging if your plot and production team is so closely related to Gintama, and thus are going to be compared with it. The strength of Gintama lies within its characters and its willingness to push boundaries for its jokes; which SKET Dance either lacks the ability to do or never even considers in the first place. Whenever it makes fun of a trope in anime it\u2019s usually in sweeping generalities and when it does name drop an actual show, they never take it any further than that.  for the introductory of the shoujo-manga-loving girl instead of trying to make fun of \u2018hot guy saves a puppy/kitty from the rain\u2019 trope, which everybody and their mother has made fun of by now, they could have pointed out the fact that in shoujo manga whene there is an attractive foreign prince who has never been to Japan before, he speaks fluent Japanese by the sole power of plot contrivances! By taking something that everyone blindly accepts and poking fun at it you get relevant humor that actually makes the audience laugh. For example, in one Gintama episode they use the Metantei Conan method of showing a crime in progress without showing the perpetrator by using a dark shadowy figure. In Gintama they then reveal that that\u2019s actually just how the person looks but the audience laughs because they can remember when they watched that show and how they never thought that much about the shadowy figure before. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s a saying on the internet that goes \u201cDon\u2019t remind the audience of the awesome movie they could be watching in the middle of your crappy one.\u201d They pretty much beat you over the head with the fact that they are really similar to Gintama by even animating the crossover chapter. And instead of getting a enjoyable little meaningless crossover where two bands of funny people join forces for a while, all we get is the author stroking his own ego for a bit and some padding, but don\u2019t worry, because as long as we get to the point where Gin-san recognizes What\u2019s-his-face as a proper comedic protagonist it counts as a successful crossover. I never knew that a crossover with Gintama of all things could feel so stereotypical, and they even graze over the opportunity to make fun of that. Not to mention the fact that in the pilot episode Shinpachi\u2019s voice hits you like a ton of bricks and then you see Usui and it\u2019s suddenly Gintoki\u2019s voice. It poses as a great detriment to a new show that\u2019s just trying to find it\u2019s identity. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bland. Bossun, our protagonist has no real business being a protagonist because he\u2019s nothing but a self-insert of the writer. And of course, like every Shounen protagonist, he has some sort of special ability tacked on; extreme concentration. Lord knows he has no intelligence, but if he concentrates really, really hard he can solve the puzzle, which was the crux of my strategy to pass grade 12 Calculus. Sure it worked, but it doesn\u2019t mean I should get my own show. Also, an anime consists of moving pictures used to tell a story, if you are just going to sit around thinking as you ultimate skill, what\u2019s the point of being animated. But my main problem with his is that he has no motivation. Why\u2019d he even create the SKET-Dan? If it was explained back in a previous episode I sure as hell don\u2019t remember it, so it must not have been that spectacular. For all I know he was this loser kid who thought he was really popular so he made a club as homage to himself and everyone would come to him for advice. At least Gintoki opened Yorozuya so that he could get money to, you know, pay the bills. However, to its credit the show does recognizes how useless Bossun is, but appropriately enough they don\u2019t comment on the fact that he could be the author\u2019s self-insert. Hime is a good character that has a lot of potential to be something more than a Kagura clone if written correctly. I always enjoy seeing a female as the manpower of the team. Usui is probably one of the most boring characters of the show, but one of the most fascinating if you read spoilers, more specifically the one surrounding his backstory and why he talks through his computer like Akihabara@Deep. It explains why he does what he does and it fits in with his awkwardly obsessive personality, other than that there nothing much to say about him. Don\u2019t ask me about any of the other characters because I can only remember them with single-sentence descriptions or I don\u2019t remember them at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors they cast for these parts have done some really fine work in the past. They are very talented but it feels like their talents are wasted on bland dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Not particularly memorable. Character models look a little odd in places but other than that it\u2019s satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Is this show terrible? No. Is it worth watching? No. All it does is leave you asking why this show was ever created.  It doesn\u2019t stand for anything nor does it do anything particularly different for a High School comedy, or comedy in general. It just feels like the producers wanted a safer more marketable version of the ever-salacious Gintama. It's a real shame that it seems like they don't even try to be original.",

            "content": "(Based on the 2 first episodes released)\r\nMy first review so, please enjoy and I hope you will find this will help you...\r\n- Story - 7/10\r\nSket Dance has a pretty simple storyline, a group at school that works together to make the students every-day life a little easier, with hilarious outcomes.\r\nEven though the story is simple, it makes it really enjoyable because of the diversity of characters that show up, with different requests and personalities we can truly say that each episode is unique and I dont feel ripped-off after seeing them, they really amused me to no end.\r\n- Art - 7/10\r\nI actually enjoy the art,with not too much detail the characters are well presented and the typical \"Comedy\" expressions goes along with them.\\n\r\nIt is well taken care of even in some scenes were animation could have slaked off (For example, the chase scene in episode 2)\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is great! It fits the upbeat mood of Sket Dance...Voice-actors, I love them! The voices fit perfectly with each characters personality and in the funny moments, they tend to make me laugh, specially Bossun\u00b4s reactions.\\n\r\nHime has a really good voice that can \"mold\" itself to when shes...ahem, pissed, and Switchs voice fits very well because, as a computer voice system, it doesnt show much emotion\\n\\n\r\n- Character - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the things that attracted me to this anime in the 1st place...The characters! The way they looked, so different from what Im used to see, the way they act...everything!\\n\r\nWe have cheerful people (Bossun), we have the bi-polar one (Hime) and we have the geeky-cool type (Switch), together they make a great team that makes me laugh everytime they jump into action, making any moment a hilarious one!\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot many anime made me laugh as much as this one, it was really amusing and I cant wait for more!\\n\r\nI hope they keep going on and make great episodes like these 2, I certainly enjoyed them!\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 7.6 (Ill make it an 8 ;O) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope they keep the good quality this show has and the potential to become a great comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\n- A really funny show that wont bore you, at least, it didnt bore me! - Give it a try and maybe you will find yourself counting the days until that next new episode!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is a series that could have been WAY better if they had tried harder. It's pretty much a poor man's Gintama, and that's saying alot since this is adapted from a manga by the former assistant to Hideaki Sorachi.\r\nThe story about SKET Dance revolves around a club that helps people with their problems of any. Led by the enthusiastic Bossun (voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino), the foxy Himeko (voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi) and the otaku Switch (voiced by teh Sugita), the go around school receiving help and solving problems.\r\nSKET Dance has everything pre-packaged to make it a good anime. You've got not one, but twoall-star openings by AKB 48's French Kiss and Gackt along with ending themes by The Pillows. You also have an all-star seiyuu cast featuring Tomokazu Sugita, Ryoko Shiraishi, Hiroyuki Yoshino, Hiro Shimono, Tomokazu Seki, Yuu Kobayashi, Fumiko Orikasa, Marina Inoue and cameos from Ayana Taketatsu, Saori Hayami, Satomi Sato, Kaoru Mizuhara and lots more. There is also an episode directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Hell, they even adapted the Gintama crossover chapter, bringing the cast and characters of the Yorozura Trio into the SKET Dance world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, it still didn't fulfill its potential. Why? Because it's not funny enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe jokes are too safe and mediocre. The reason why Gintama is awesomely hilarious is because it holds no bar to how far the humor can go. In Gintama, they can show Okita creating a Human Centipede out of Gintoki, Hijikata and Katsura on top of the Bible because that's how they roll. But Sket Dance plays safer than the combination safe at Fort Knox. Hell, the few funny moments in this series is basically when the Gintama crew do one or two dirty jokes in this, and that's about it. That's as far as it goes with the humour. Come on Shinohara-sensei. You got your lucky break and blessing from Sorachi-sensei, and this is what you gave us? You can try harder than that.\\n\\n\r\nBut this series can really score in drama. When it has a backstory moment with some of its characters, it can get emotional and awesome, especially Switch's backstory. If it manages to have a Benizakura-esque arc later in this series, then why not? The show might just got better like what happened to Gintama after the Benizakura arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why i'm quite optimistic. It has room to improve, and they can nail some serious drama. And this is one of the few series that is awesome for Tomokazu Sugita himself. If you love him as Kyon, Hajime, Gintoki and Hoshi, you will definitely love him in this. He's pretty much having fun voicing Switch, and he's the one reason that kept me continuing with this series.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest you watch this only if you're a harcore fan of Sugita or Ryoko Shiraishi. Unless if this series manages to be as great as Gintama in its latter years, i would not think a casual anime fan would enjoy this.",

            "content": "Sket Dance is a funny, school-based shounen anime. If you are looking for random laughs, strange characters and censored pukes, this is the right anime for you.\r\nStory-wise, there's no real plot to speak of and I don't think that's really necessary but remember this is based on a manga which is long running so things may start to develop soon. \r\nArt is also good in terms of the character designs and the animation is standard.\r\nI haven't noticed the soundtrack so much, so commenting about only the OP/ED, they are lively enjoyable songs but nothing that gets stuck in your head.\r\nMy opinions:\r\nI will not say thatit is an extremely hilarious anime, but its loud, wacky and fun. Its meant to be a bit childish.\\n\r\nIf you're watching without high expectations and looking for an anime that doesn't try too hard, this is it. The exaggerated drama, the weird gags, the outrageous characters all add to the humor of the anime.\\n\r\nAlso, there are fun characters like Bossun and the samurai dude and things happen for no reason really, but I'd say that's one of the plus points.\\n\r\nIt may not be one of the best anime you'll ever see and I can't talk about the manga, but the plot is next to zero and things just happen and that's the way it is, episode after episode. \\n\r\nThe humor isn't witty or anything, the jokes pop out of nowhere and are usually directed towards the characters and their antics, but I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who's looking for a laid back, fun anime which makes no promises and just lets you feel like you don't have to be serious about everything in life.  \\n\r\nGive it a try and see if it suits your taste. As for me, I love the anime, I love the Sket Dan and I look forward to having a good laugh every week :)",

But, as you can see from synopsis, SKET Dance is actually a Living Assistance Club. They help many people from their own problem. But, is it worth to watch this anime? Is this fun to watch? Let's see...\r\n- Story: 8 / 10\r\nThe story mostly happened in their school, doing some random things together in their school, and help many people. Not just like the ordinary slice-of-life anime, but extraordinary slice-of-lifeanime. The story is light and not confusing every part. It's actually pretty funny and entertaining every episode. If you fan of Slice of Life and Funny anime, i recommend this anime to you.\\n\\n\r\n- Art 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art style well fit together along the story. The character design is match from their own personality (like most of Shounen Anime). Each character art style is different and unique. This anime art style and animation are good and always consistent from beginning until end of series.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening songs and Ending songs is pretty catchy, and i enjoyed listening them. Not only that, SKET Dance also has a lot Opening songs and Ending songs (so, you won't be easily bored with same OP and ED songs). Their seiyuu/character voice is fit and improve all character unique personality. The background music is also fitting for the story and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n- Character 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nEach person has their own unique personalities. I like all the character in this entire series. Not only the main character, the supporting character is also well made. There's a lot of supporting character in entire series. All of them is actually very weird in some ways. For example, we have a genius-idiot person (Bossun), a giant-strong female character (Koma Morishita), a person who always talk no sense (Dante), a person who can \"break\" the 4th wall (Roman),  etc...\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime. So far,  havei already re-watch all the series 4 times because i never bored watching this. Sometimes i just re-watch certain episode. This anime is fun, random, and funny. The beginning of this anime is pretty weak, but give it a try, you will love this.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great. I actually wanted the staff do sequel of SKET Dance. But 77 Episode is more than enough to satisfy yourself. Watch it? Yes.. You will love this Anime.",

            "content": "Sket Dance is a comedic/slice of life/dramatic anime that will leave some of you in tears, laughing. Notice how I didn't address the whole group? Reason being, is that the anime tends to make a lot of jokes and references that the average foreign viewer will fail to understand at times. The show also tends to break the fourth wall every so often which in my opinion, isn't very funny. But some good points is that the show has some serious and dramatic arcs which are enjoyable to watch and some episodes that will leave you laughing despite if you're unfamiliar to Japanese culture. \r\nHowever,there isn't really a running story behind Sket Dance. A three man school club group called the \"Sket Dan\" includes Bossun, Himeko, and Switch. They have suffered from their past and because of it they want to help out people in need. But sometimes you might find yourself wondering where the story is going and if there is going to be a climatic ending at all. In some ways, it falls flat compared to the Gintama anime (very similar anime but with action) because a lot of their jokes usually don't try to go overboard in the silliness and inappropriateness.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great and sometimes hilarious. Okay, all the time hilarious. The sound is clear, good music, and funny sound effects. The characters though, have to be the richest part of the show. There is a collection of over 20+ characters who all have a different look and hilarious personality to them. (Ex: The Creepy Occult Girl, The Genius but Lazy Science Teacher, The teacher who resembles Jason Voorhees, The Enigman and Quettion duo, The baseball captain with a huge appetite, The tsundere girl, The wannabe-samurai, and many more.) \\n\\n\r\nLike most animes, the first episode may seem bland, but continue on watching and you'll quickly fall in love with the series. Overall, I give the show an 8. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nSket Dance, meaning \"helpers club\" (\"\u52a9\u4eba\u56e3\"; \"Suketto Dan\") follows the highschool lives of a trio of friends with what could be described as depressing backgrounds that form the club \"Sket Dance\" which aims to help any academy member in need. They grow strong bonds with a good bunch of the town that they live in as they go through their daily lives. Sket Dance is a comedy that follows the \"recipe\" of fellow comedy Gin Tama along with quite a few voice actors, they even did a crossover episode!\r\nPlot 8/10:\r\nNice little story going on here, the anime itself doesn't actually start and finish withthe manga as it is ongoing, though I do feel like it stopped at a good time. We have our group in the \"Skettu Dan\" working towards the problems brought to them by fellow members of the school, some sort of contest against the notorious members of the school counsil, and interactions with recurring classmates and teachers as thus. Even though Sket Dance follows this episodic formula, it doesn't leave us without character and story progression, it may be slow but there is things going on in the background to leave you a little teary from either sadness or laughing a little too hard.\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nWe do see a newer form of artwork in place with some unique character design. Fan service is minimal but certainly still there as you would expect from a school setting anime. The artwork put in place does a fairly good job to enhance situations going on to set the mood of what could be very funny or very gloomy.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see some pretty cool action themes!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: \\n\r\nAs the students actually partake in forms of music from time to time we do see quite the variation in sound used, jRock is seen at times along with some heart-warming ballads during the OT's, ET's and throughout what were some very gloomy scenes. There was also no shortage of OST's to get us through the more important themes, a little jig to get through the humorous content or a low-key piano piece as a character gets through a sudden heart felt realisation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters themselves progress at a very alarming rate, that is, all except for our main characters in the Sket Dan. Through helping others out they sure do define themselves as above saving so to speak, though this is not without conquest... they sure have their own hearts.\\n\r\nThese students all have their own lovable stories, some of them will surely bring anyone with a soul to tears and some will have you just about punching through your tv screen (and a few walls), we see strong relationships which will seemingly last to the grave and others which are surely temporary for the comedic intent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nIf comedy is something that is up your alley and you did enjoy Gintama then surely give this one a shot, not without some tears Sket Dance is to be taken seriously as a fully fledged Shonen!\\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance is a slice of life comedy manga written and illustrated by Shinohara Kenta. In 2011, Tatsunoko, the same studio behind Kyatto Ninden Teyandee & C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control, started airing an anime adaptation. The anime lasted for nearly eighty episodes and ran for over a year, ending in late 2012.It was introduced to me as like Gintama, but done well. So how true is that and is it worth watching?\r\nStory:\r\nKaimei High School has an unusual student organisation. This is the titular SKET Dan, a support club that helps students or other clubs who need them. It has three members,Himeko, Bossun & Switch. The series basically covers their misadventures and the quirky people they encounter. This is one of those series where there's a general order to the episodes, but where most of them have little connection with one another aside from starring the same cast. So, let's cover the important aspect, how well the humour works.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this is very hit or miss. There are times when it works nicely and others where it just falls flat. Generally speaking, the points where they try something really outlandish are the points where the comedy just fails. Mainly because these moments rely on randomness and characters shouting to be funny. The stuff with their teacher's bizarre science experiments. The stuff with their other teacher's obsessions with overly convoluted nonsense. The episode that crosses over with Gintama, and so on. Those are the moments that are just tired and stupid. Whereas the comedy that uses more exaggerated realism tends to work pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, a series like Galaxy Angel can get by with overblown absurdity. Not only is the execution better, but the series is never tied with any real semblance of reality, except in that serious episode that was out of place and terrible. But with this series, so much of its humour is tied to realistic situations being slightly exaggerated. Which means that when they do put something in that's completely absurd, it doesn't really fit. This series tries to be a cross between the everyday school life comedy and the absurdist zany comedy but it's only good at the former and its attempts to mesh the two just don't work particularly well.\\n\\n\r\nComedy aside, there is a huge flaw with the series as a whole. It sucks at incorporating romance. Every single scene where they try to throw in some high school crush or to force chemistry between two characters, ends up being just banal and poorly done. Its like they took scenes from a shite romantic comedy and just threw them in whenever they wanted to develop their characters but couldn't think of a good way to do it.\\n\\n\r\nI will give the series credit for having some pretty solid serious scenes. There are quite a few moments where they focus on the characters, without the lousy romance angle, and they show something tragic, dramatic, heart-warming or a blend of the three. And those scenes are largely pretty solid and do their job well. Truth be told, they're also a big part of why the absurdist elements don't work. The contrast between a stupid plot where Himeko & Bossun switch bodies and a semi-serious story about Himeko's tragic past is simply too glaring. In that sense, it is a bit like Gintama, except in Gintama the attempts at drama were out of place with the usual absurdity whereas in Sket Dance the absurd moments are rarer and they come across as out of place while the more dramatic moments work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this varies quite a bit. The major characters tend to be nicely fleshed out and have some level of depth to them beyond comedic quirks. The secondary and side characters, on the other hand, are their comedic quirks. Usually that's two things to them, which makes them better than those comedic characters with one joke, but it can still get old and repetitive. There's also the issue with the character dynamics. Mainly, the aforementioned way the series fails at romance. Those relationships that are supposed to read as having romantic chemistry are either badly done in general or inconsistent, with the romance dynamic being bad but with the characters also having a more friendship-oriented dynamic that works.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is decent enough. There are times during the more absurd scenes where things get hectic and difficult to see. On the positive side, the series does have some good visual gags. Aside from that, it all looks fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is competent overall but, like most elements of this series, inconsistent. Yoshino Hiroyuki, Sugita Tomokazu & Shiraishi Ryoko all do quite well and demonstrate some nice emotional range but a lot of the side actors only have to do one or two jokes and, consequently, don't need range. Although, to be fair, the actors still generally do fine and it gives you the chance to hear Gackt do some voice acting. There are a few performances that are annoyingly exaggerated though and times when those actors who are generally fine have their over-acting bombastic moments.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nMomoka's dynamic with Himeko frequently comes across as her having a crush on Himeko. It's probably the best semi-romantic dynamic you get in the series just because it's actually natural for the characters and never feels contrived or forced. But it's also pretty clear that they're not going for a romantic dynamic, but an adoring disciple-master thing. There are some other homo-erotic moments interspersed throughout, but nothing major.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI can see where the comparisons to Gintama come in. And not just because there's a crossover episode. Both series try to blend absurd comedy with more down to earth comedy and drama. Both also have massive casts of largely boring characters who are mainly there for a few reoccurring japes. I would agree that Sket Dance is better at the whole juggling act than Gintama was. That being said, I wouldn't say that Sket Dance is particularly successful at it either. If the series had dispensed with the more outlandish elements and not  bothered with teenage romance elements, it might have been really good. However, as it stands, those highly absurd comedic moment are its biggest flaw. They aren't funny, clever or a good fit. In the end, my rating for Sket Dance is a 6/10. It's okay, not good. Next week I'll take a look at Toradora.",

The rest of the episodes were either simply pleasant to watch or slightly amusing. Many were downright boring. But these are not the only problems of Sket Dance...\r\nSomehow, Sket Dance fails to get you emotionally involved with the characters. It is not that they are not likeable, they are. Yet they miss that certain quality that makes you really care what happens with them, that quality that makes it a joy to watchthem go about their lives and interacting simply because they are great characters. Which I guess is the point: They are not in fact great characters, otherwise we'd care, otherwise just watching them talk would be fun. But it is not.\\n\\n\r\nMost bizarrely, this series took a very sudden and totally unexpected turn to fanservice around the last 15 episodes or so, right after going through some of its funniest episodes. After 65 or so episodes with an absolute absence of fanservice the sudden gratuitous nudity and constant breast bounces were jarring and cheap.",

            "content": "I don't know why but every time SKET Dance re-broadcast on TV, when I decided to watch it, they always broadcast the episode where Bossun really want to go to the toilet but always find hindrances along the way. I don't know if this is some omen or just a very bad coincidence. Nevertheless, SKET Dance became one of the best comedy anime I have ever watch and I still thought so until the day I write this. And I am going to tell you why.\r\nSKET Dance follows a story of a club in Kaimei High School called Sket Dan (derived from Suketto or Helpin Japanese) and their daily shenanigans. Since the club is about helping other people, the story revolves around the club's effort to solve other people's problem and because everyone seems like requesting crazy things to Sket Dan, they never have a regular day while solving the problems. SKET Dance's jokes are always spot on and they occasionally threw reference jokes which I love and not afraid to take it into the next level. Many of their jokes contain sarcasm towards the community and they managed to make it so funny and so relatable at the same time. Aside from jokes, I think they excel in their character development and story around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile mainly being a comedy show, they did not shy away to develop their characters in some and any way. Backstories of each characters explored carefully and made them very lovable despite their usual shenanigans. All of the main characters have a horrific past and it made the closeness between each of the main character very reasonable and not just because of they are in one club kind of thing. Bossun is the main reason why they are together. Not just the main cast, the other \\n\r\nsupporting casts may not be together if there's no Bossun in their school.\\n\\n\r\nOh, yeah. I really love the music by The Sketchbook that were used for their insert songs and even OP or ED. Not to mention that they did a cover of The Pillows' Funny Bunny and nailed it gracefully. It fit the scene completely as they managed to make it feels like it came out from a highly talented high school band. Then there's the opening and the ending songs. I'm not going to lie but all of SKET Dance's OP and ED are worth to listen. From the first one to the last one. If I'm going to pick, my pick for best OP would be The Sketchbook's Message and my pick for best ED would be The Pillows' Comic Sonic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, SKET Dance is one of the best anime comedy out there and an anime that never left out from my favorite anime of all time. Even my brother, who is not an anime or manga lover like me, loves this anime so much and constantly talks about this anime with me. While it may not be possible, I really hope they continue this anime into the next season.",

It was like taking all anime genres and squishing them all together x) At first glance i thought sket dance would be your typical comedy/ school life anime but its way more than that. Sket dance pulls you in, to the point where you feel like youve known the characters for a long time and it feels like youve become one of them, the Sket Dance.The story was well outstanding. Why? because even if Sket Dance starts off as a typicalclub anime it had its own unique spin, which it expresses quite well. The characters background stories were unexpectedly deep, so deep that sometimes i have to pause while watching to realize whats happening so far. Sket Dance also has romance, but its not over the top and its rarely touched upon which is very good for this type of anime. The art styles and the colors were great, it felt lively we it needed to, and it felt serious when it became serious.(which is usually cut off by unserious elements) YOU HAVE TO WATCH SKET DANCE! whether your a hater, a fanboy/girl, or your new watch sket dance. as the Sket Dance say: Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot Sket Dance!!!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as my opinion goes i give sket dance a 10/10",

            "content": "Sket Dance is an interesting and hilarious anime that will make you laugh at almost every episode. It's about 3 people who came together and made a club to help others who are in need. They then try their best to complete every task they are handed;even when someone or something blocks their way, they still find a way to through.\r\nStory- 9\r\nIn every episode, there will be various ways to make you laugh out loud, like jokes,puns,random funny comments, etc.The jokes are easy to understand and  the whole series almost flows smoothly.I never laughed so much by watching an anime before~\r\nThere is also somedrama  developement in the series that you don't expect from AN anime of this genre.\\n\r\nThe story is thought out well and does have episodes that has some seriousness in there.It showed some of the main characters pasts and how they all meet and became Sket Dance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nA wanna-be samurai? A sensitive but TALENTED boy? A boy that only talks with a computer?YES this anime has many characters that have their own unique personality which i like and they work off of each other, which makes the anime more amazing! There are flaws, but not too much that makes you dislike them. For example: Over-reacting on simple mistakes *cough* tsubaki* but it makes him cute (X\\n\\n\r\nBossun made me laugh the most. He may child-like characteristics but he becomes serious when in focus mode. He makes the most hilarious face expressions and is really talented in art and craft.And his great enemy is Tsubaki , one of the student council members and.....read more about it in the manga\\n\\n\r\nHimeko comes next.You see her swinging her hockey stick around,and hitting people down, but don't think her as a delinquent yet. She shows her mother-like skills as you watch the anime and she makes the perfect comedy duo with bossun.\\n\\n\r\nSwitch is my third favorite, with his random comment and computer sounds. Even thought he doesn't talk with his voice, he uses a computerized sound systems to talk. I am mostly amazed of how he could type so quickly , its like he's speaking himself.And he's pretty handsome too XD\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nAll i can say about it is that is shows the expressions perfectly and detailed;sharp and clear. To me the art is like gintama,Beelzebub,and,MM!.Not too much detail with the casual parts but when its time for seriousness of a extreme joke, it becomes more complex or like the art you see in Ben 10 ,dragon ball,or one piece.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAs i said, its a funny, enjoyable anime. It made me LAUGH OUT LOUD and made me want to re watch some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nSomething worth watching.With it's comedy and drama that will leave you satisfied after each episode.also recommend to read the manga too to read about the protagonists pasts in more detail.\\n\r\nI can't find anything i dislike about this!",

            "content": "\"Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.\"\r\nThere are some stories that end up having a lot more to them than was initially expected. They aren\u2019t perfect, they might not even be completely logical \u2013 but they\u2019re something that managed to catch you off guard in the best ways possible. Take a look; there\u2019s a chance that SKET Dance might blossom into such a series for you\u2026\r\n[STORY]\r\n------------\r\nThe core plot is just a simple, mainly episodic story about a quirky trio of friends that solve problems and help people out. But there are also some very tightlywritten and amazingly powerful (multi-episode) storylines within it that I can\u2019t say much about \u2013 for fear of spoilers. Just know that they don\u2019t come off as abrupt, but rather fit smoothly into the \u2018narrative\u2019 and add a lot to it. Don\u2019t let the comedy-oriented episodes fool you into thinking that that\u2019s all the show has in store for you.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note - being perfectly blunt and honest - this series is best classified as a \u2018dramedy\u2019. The overall tone you are first introduced to is that of a school-life comedy. The drama picks up slightly near the beginning, but truly picks up a little farther in. After that point, both exist within the show almost equally (with a few exceptions). The balance struck between the two is well-done, as neither overwhelms the other. They work together to create a fantastic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing should be noted though. When the show ends, there\u2019s no solid culmination for the characters. It just kind of... ends. So be prepared for that.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe art is very high-quality. Frenetic motion (due to the fast-paced comedy within the series), facial expressions, backgrounds and lighting are all above par. Character designs have had a lot of thought put into them \u2013 almost everyone is unique. And the best part is that the quality stays consistent through all seventy seven episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nSKET Dance utilizes music in a very effective way. It plays songs that match the current scene. If it\u2019s comedic, the music will be bombastic and crazy. If it\u2019s serious and dramatic, the music will fit that. It helps enhance the presentation. But it also does one thing that is greatly appreciated: it shuts up when it needs to and lets what\u2019s happening play out with no influence from the music at all. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting side of things, this anime also excels. The seiy\u016b gave their all in every episode. Everyone was well-voiced and sounded natural.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe main three characters are pretty unique and unconventional, having a lot of depth and personality. Switch, the genius otaku, who talks through his computer\u2026 Himeko, the occasionally violent Okinawan \u201cYankee\u201d with a soft-spot for cute things\u2026 And finally the leader of the SKET club, Bossun. He's a rather interesting choice for a main character, as at times he\u2019s almost completely inept and useless - but at other times he really shines. It\u2019s actually quite refreshing.  \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, these aren\u2019t the main character\u2019s real names, but rather their nicknames. They go almost entirely by those nicknames - each of which has a story behind it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also almost too many side characters to mention (which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on your tastes). Most of them are great, having something of worthwhile value to contribute. A few serve almost no purpose \u2013 but they don\u2019t overstay their welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the true heart and soul of this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis was, honestly, one of the funniest anime series I\u2019ve had the pleasure of watching. It was also very emotionally powerful at times. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not perfect. There are plenty of flaws. But they never detracted from the true experience of the anime. That experience being the character interactions, and also the lessons the show teaches. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic series in the areas of character development and comedy. Most everyone can find something of value in this anime. If the comedy doesn\u2019t do it for you, the serious bits of the show probably will, or vice-versa.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance. \r\nJust the title itself say's alot about the anime. \r\nSKET stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot. The second (\u52a9\u56e3), which instead uses kanji, derives from the verb tasukeru (\u52a9\u3051\u308b), meaning to help or save.\r\nSo just from the title you can in some sorts understand that this series is about, well.. Helping. \r\nJudged by many as Gintama set in a school life setting, the series have had a tendency of being flooded by \"hate war\" comments. I agree with the Gintama fans that the series is very similar. But at the same time it really shines on it's own at times.\r\n But if youthink about the fact that author Kenta Shinohara worked as the assistant of  Hideaki Sorachi (creator of Gintama), it's really not that weird for him to be influenced. \\n\\n\r\n--- Story ---- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nStory wise I have to deduct some points due to it being too heavily influenced by Gintama. So if you can picture a scene where Gintama didn't exist, I would have given it a 10/10.  \\n\\n\r\nBasically the story is as simple as 3 people, get to know them, see them interact with other people. Easy huh? But it doesn't have to be more complicated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about Sket Dance, is how the story progresses. You get introduced to many supporting characters, but not so fast that you feel that it affects the relationship with  the main cast. And this way you get to know the characters in a perfect pace. Both past, present and \"future\" gets depicted in a decent way.But as said, even if it's really well made, it's kinda too similar too Gintama to give it a full score. \\n\\n\r\n---Art-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSket Dance is just a really good looking anime. It's very typical shounen art. They have a very tyipcal shounen trait in the fact that they give the main cast something special, like an item, special hair color or something similar to recognize them by. In this case, you have Bossun's hat for example. What I love about the art in SKET Dance, is how they play with different ways of drawing. Take for example one of the characters, called Saotome Roman, who turns everything around her into a manga. This playfulness really got to me, and I loved it so much. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound--- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really, enjoyed the music in SKET Dance. I have a tendency of skipping openings and/or endings, but SKET Dance, really just got me hooked on both how well made the openings were made to fit the music, and how good the music was. The Sketchbook really fits the anime, and I struggle to decide which opening of 2 and 4 I love most. The youtube part in opening 4 was absolutely awesome. \\n\\n\r\n--Character-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe maincast is made up off:  Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun) , Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch).  Mostly all of the fun about the series is based on interactions between the main cast themselves, or between the main cast and supporting characters. Like how Bossun and Himeko make the perfect boke and tsukommi pair for example.  Or how you have Switch and a girl called Yuuki Reiko have epic arguments about science vs occult.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I find most fascinating about the character maincast, is how the protagonist is in terms, the weakest character, which is very uncharacteristic for a shounen anime. He gets picked on alot for having this kinda role, and I love it. \\n\\n\r\nBut I can't withold the fact that the main cast, do have kinda, sad backstories, but this is what I enjoyed most of this anime. There is two different types of characters (in some sense). The ones you look up to, and the ones you wanna support, give a hug and so on. The main cast have tendencies of both. Very nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are hilarious and extremely well made. Almost all of them are super weird, like overly tsundere girl, a fatty thinkining she is really hot, student council sadist and so on. My favorite supporting character is probably Dante, who only speaks in Visual Kei mode. It's just so funny. \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment-- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the anime's I've enjoyed most in quite sometime. It's not as funny in the start, but just takes off after a little while. My favorite epsiode probably has to be an episode, where the protagonist Bossun, drinks a fluid which mixes up all his facial expressions, or the episode where they play Hyperion. Just watch it ok? Come on. Go go. \\n\\n\r\n--Overall-- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall. It's just great. I really hope it will return like Gintama has done so many times. If you have seen Gintama, give it a chance. If you wanna watch a series that just makes you laugh and laugh, but can also hit that soft spot inside, check out SKET Dance. You won't be dissapointed. \\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance became my instant favorite the moment I got into it, and it has valid reasons for so. It's one of the very few anime's which execute both the Slice of Life and Comedic elements perfectly well. 77 episodes is not a very huge number considering the vast amount of entertainment it provides. \r\nSo the story revolves around the fictional Kaimei High School, with our three members of the 'SKET Club' who aid the people in need of help, whatever their issue maybe. You may think at first the number of episodes for this show is too much, considering that it revolves around thevery same concept of the SKET Club supporting the people and getting rid of their troubles, but there's more to it. SKET Dance has an extremely funny and a humorous nature that goes hand in hand with its plotline. With each episode there's a great amount of witty and comical jokes cracked and at times sticks to making parodies of other anime as well although that in comparison is very less than the original humor the show provides. Adding to the uniqueness of SKET Dance. \\n\\n\r\nMaking a show with a school setting but at the same time the genre comedy being its core is not a very easy task to accomplish as it tends to have a lot of clich\u00e9d objects but this is where SKET Dance truly shines. While being humorous most of the time, SKET Dance also achieves what its actually about, helping others in need. Whatever their request maybe, with each and every episode our SKET Club manage to complete the task given and end that certain episode on a high note, while also being true and original every time. However if you are thinking that with each episode, no matter how humorous it may be or how good a finish it provides, it's inevitable that with the mixture of comedic situations and solving the problems of those in trouble and sticking with the same concept, it's bound to get boring at some point. But this is where the character development comes in to play. SKET Dance gives a great amount of devotion and concentration to its characters. Each of our three protagonists of the SKET Club, Bossun aka Fujisaki, Himeko aka Onizuka Hime (Also known as the legendary 'Onihime' in her past) and Switch aka Usui Kazuyoshi. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about characters, these are our trio of the SKET Club who support the ones in need. Bossun is the leader of the club, the one created the club and helped both Himeko and Switch join the club. For starters, Bossun is depicted as quite an unconventional character. He's not your typical cool-guy who overwhelms everyone else on talent on other things, but in fact the exact opposite of it. I don't mean to say that he's no help to the people and the club itself, it's just that he's never taken seriously. Compared to Himeko's brute strength and Switch's power of information, Bossun doesn't have anything you'd call a special talent. Or there's probably one, \"The concentration mode\" as he calls it. With the glasses he doesn't always wear and keeps it at the top of his red hat, when he does use it though it helps to go over the tiniest details and always help him solve them a case. Bossun is always overlooked at, and I don't mean in a bad way but in a funny way. As I said before he's not your typical cool character or some lazy ass guy who them goes on become a hero later in the show. However this does not in any way degrade Bossun's character and I'd say he's one of the most likeable protagonist around. \\n\\n\r\nNext is Himeko. Once known as the legendary delinquent Onihime, Himeko's past is quite irritating. Always feared by local thugs and students alike, Himeko is unable to make a friend for herself but that's when she encounters Bossun and things began to change for Himeko. Personally I love Himeko's accent, where she speaks in a different dialect than the usual. Himeko is a very crucial member to the club and they always rely on her strength which is her power in the time of need. Switch is our next character and he's a bit weird. He's a guy who likes crappy video games and always hangs around with his Laptop and so much so that he speaks with people using it too. Switch also is a hardcore otaku and has all the information stored about the students and teachers alike from Kaimei in his laptop which is always an helpful accessory to the club. I'd love to talk about Himeko and Switch in detail but I'm afraid I couldn't by giving away some spoilers. A couple of episodes are dedicated to both Himeko and Switch later in the show which tells the backstory of the two and it's very sad which will leave you teary-eyed. \\n\\n\r\nOne of SKET Dance's trademarks is definitely its epic voice acting. Most of the jokes and humor is greatly accompanied by the way our characters react to the scenario, and in that aspect SKET Dance does it better than almost any other. There's a variety of opening and ending themes for SKET Dance both meant to be fun and dramatic varying from episodes to episodes. Many of the special episodes thrown between the show which focuses solely own its character has its own theme as well. The artwork is well synchronized with all the other elements as well giving birth to a highly entertaining and at times sad piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nSKET Dance does not follow a single pattern and thus is mostly episodic. In other words there are no separate arcs and it simply continues to follow it storyline. From the start till the end SKET Dance does not dissapoint you in any way. With light-hearted humor, sad moments accompanied by shocking plot twists, all play a very pivotal role in this anime. The inclusion of the Student Council Academy and its characters is important too, as they serve as a rival to the SKET Club but in a rather friendly manner. For the ones who are having a thoughts or two considering the length of this anime, I'd advice you to overlook it immediately as the fun it provides makes you forget about how long it is. In fact once I finished it I was left with hopes of watching more episodes. Make no mistake, SKET Dance ends perfectly well and does not leave the viewer any questions unanswered, but just as I finished SKET Dance I was beginning to miss the antics our SKET Club provided us. At the start of this show, I had planned on finishing this quick with atleast finishing three episodes a day. Considering how good this is and the laugh it provides you, I can tell you there are certainly some dull moments in this show when I stopped watching it for a while. Yes, the fact that is 77 episodes long does come to light at some point, but that's all the more reason to take this slow and steady as the enjoyment in the coming episodes is endless as is the same for the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSKET Dance is an anime that will definitely go down as one of the best within its genre and is highly recommended by me to anyone who likes anime with some fun and humor.\\n",

            "content": "You're probably wondering, is this anime good enough for me to watch? What is all the hype about this anyway?  Well, if you are into comedy anime and just want to have a good laugh, read on!\r\nThe story for Sket dance is about these three friends: Yuusuke Fujisaki (Bossun),  Hime Onizuka (Himeko) and Kazuyoshi Usui (Switch) and their formation of the SKET Dan! This stands for Support, Kindness, Encouragement and Tech, an Assistance club to help students with their problems, big or small at Kaimei High School. Each and every episode there is usually some problem around the school or their city thatthey go and fix, no matter the obstacle they encounter, they go all lengths to complete the tasks they get, usually with hilarious results. There are also some episodes that they just do some random things, hang out in their club room or actually have some story progression. Most of the story progression so far in the anime has been about the three main characters\u2019 pasts, which show how they became the people they are today. Also there are some twists and turns in the story and of course some romantic progression as well, but the anime focuses more in the silliness instead of the seriousness. Which is not all annoying, unlike in some anime where you just keep yelling at the screen, \"WHY ARE YOU NOT TOGETHER YET?\" or \"WHERE'S THE STORY PLOT?\" As I said, this anime is mostly comedic, so it's not strange to not see much of a story plot since it's mostly hilarity between Bossun and his friends. So if you're just wanting a bit of silliness once in a while, go ahead and watch. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation of the show, it's your semi-typical shounen anime. There are actions scenes but mostly are there to make fun of the classic shounen scenes, the girls are a bit busty at some times, but not to the point where it becomes eechi. Of course there are some instances where the animation art changes to something different, mostly for comedic reasons, for example Roman Saotome, is the embodiment of shojo anime that there's time she breaks the fourth wall and turns the scene into her image of shojo anime and also the episode when Gintama and Sket Dance get together and change the art style of the main characters to fit into the Gintama world. All in all, the animation is amazing and well-drawn.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music of Sket Dance... I have to say, it's awesome! In each OP and ED of the series, there is different music playing, and each is as amazing as the next. Each is an alt. rock songs, but it's pretty good that makes you want to dance! Of course, that's me, but I'm sure it's enjoyable for all who watches it as well. \\n\\n\r\nFor characters, as I said before this is a comedic shounen anime, It's full of wild and unique characters that you wonder to yourself, is there a school like this I can transfer to? While the main cast are quite the interesting bunch, the supporting cast is much more unique. Have you been to a school where a wood shop teacher looks like Jason, a chemisty teacher that is so lazy but a genius and constantly experimenting on his students with various of chemicals with interesting side effects, a kendo student that dresses and talks like he's a samurai, a student that is a descendant of ninjas, a girl that for some reason has the power to break the fourth wall and change the anime to her shojo paradise and the girl that is so creepy that reminds us of the girl from the Ring? I WISH! but while the show is mostly focused on the comedic aspect, it does have its moments where the drama shows up or the romance, which doesn't disrupt the enjoyment of a shounen anime. The most of the character development does go more to the main characters but sometimes it shown in the supporting cast as well, The more important ones are the characters\u2019 pasts, which really shows more about the characters and make you understand them more. Why does Switch talk all the time on the laptop or not show much emotion? Why is Himeko always hesitant to talk about her past life? And why is Bossun always wearing that hat? And then there's the twist... oh yes the twists... this twist is really well placed that while it is shocking at least, it does make you feel that you, for some reason, knew it. But I do say the drama aspect is what makes me hooked because you have to know more! Not just those questions and problems occur but more are asked and answered as their pasts are revealed and the show continues. \\n\\n\r\nWhy I enjoyed this anime so much was because I love comedy because it brings a smile to my face and makes me forget about the stress I had for the week, so I enjoyed this quite a lot. This anime made me laugh and cry like no other anime, especially the invisible man episode... that still makes me cry tears of laughter each time I see it. I was always so excited for Fridays because each and every episode has been so funny, you want to see more. What are Bossun and the gang up to this week? Is there going to be more progression involving the characters? \\n\\n\r\nSo I suggest this for who want to watch just some hilarity and want to have some fun, all in the same time have some drama and romance in the mix. If you want to laugh so much that you will remember the show for eternity, then I say watch Sket Dance! Hopefully you'll love this more than I did. All I can say to wrap this up is that I really hope they keep the anime alive and continue it. The manga does continue the anime and it is a great read. The anime is what made me fall in love with the series and made me read the manga as well, so go and read the manga as well as watch the anime. So in other worlds, WATCH THE ANIME AND LOVE IT! \\n\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10",

            "content": "Overall this series is a 5. And boy is it a 5; SKET Dance takes mediocrity to a whole new level of blandness, leaving the audience apathetic and not really sure why they watched it or if they gained anything from doing so. \r\nStory: The first thing you think right off the bat from the first episode \"so it's Gintama but in high school, right?\" and really, that's not far off. Two guys plus one girl who is obscenely strong form a team that performs odd jobs around the school which leads them to zany adventures.  Meanwhile there this student council whose leader isn'treally all that responsible so he around very often for one reason or another and the uptight vice comma-...er, vice president, who is doing all the work for the Student Council  doesn't really care for the SKET-dan all that much. While it certainly does sound familiar, that wouldn't matter as long as the jokes were funny and with its humor it could stand on its own two feet......\\n\\n\r\n..... However SKET Dance lacks this sort of humor it so sorely needs. The attempts at comedy come off as being very uninspired, self-absorbed, or, in a few cases like it's censoring itself, the last one being very damaging if your plot and production team is so closely related to Gintama, and thus are going to be compared with it. The strength of Gintama lies within its characters and its willingness to push boundaries for its jokes; which SKET Dance either lacks the ability to do or never even considers in the first place. Whenever it makes fun of a trope in anime it\u2019s usually in sweeping generalities and when it does name drop an actual show, they never take it any further than that.  for the introductory of the shoujo-manga-loving girl instead of trying to make fun of \u2018hot guy saves a puppy/kitty from the rain\u2019 trope, which everybody and their mother has made fun of by now, they could have pointed out the fact that in shoujo manga whene there is an attractive foreign prince who has never been to Japan before, he speaks fluent Japanese by the sole power of plot contrivances! By taking something that everyone blindly accepts and poking fun at it you get relevant humor that actually makes the audience laugh. For example, in one Gintama episode they use the Metantei Conan method of showing a crime in progress without showing the perpetrator by using a dark shadowy figure. In Gintama they then reveal that that\u2019s actually just how the person looks but the audience laughs because they can remember when they watched that show and how they never thought that much about the shadowy figure before. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s a saying on the internet that goes \u201cDon\u2019t remind the audience of the awesome movie they could be watching in the middle of your crappy one.\u201d They pretty much beat you over the head with the fact that they are really similar to Gintama by even animating the crossover chapter. And instead of getting a enjoyable little meaningless crossover where two bands of funny people join forces for a while, all we get is the author stroking his own ego for a bit and some padding, but don\u2019t worry, because as long as we get to the point where Gin-san recognizes What\u2019s-his-face as a proper comedic protagonist it counts as a successful crossover. I never knew that a crossover with Gintama of all things could feel so stereotypical, and they even graze over the opportunity to make fun of that. Not to mention the fact that in the pilot episode Shinpachi\u2019s voice hits you like a ton of bricks and then you see Usui and it\u2019s suddenly Gintoki\u2019s voice. It poses as a great detriment to a new show that\u2019s just trying to find it\u2019s identity. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bland. Bossun, our protagonist has no real business being a protagonist because he\u2019s nothing but a self-insert of the writer. And of course, like every Shounen protagonist, he has some sort of special ability tacked on; extreme concentration. Lord knows he has no intelligence, but if he concentrates really, really hard he can solve the puzzle, which was the crux of my strategy to pass grade 12 Calculus. Sure it worked, but it doesn\u2019t mean I should get my own show. Also, an anime consists of moving pictures used to tell a story, if you are just going to sit around thinking as you ultimate skill, what\u2019s the point of being animated. But my main problem with his is that he has no motivation. Why\u2019d he even create the SKET-Dan? If it was explained back in a previous episode I sure as hell don\u2019t remember it, so it must not have been that spectacular. For all I know he was this loser kid who thought he was really popular so he made a club as homage to himself and everyone would come to him for advice. At least Gintoki opened Yorozuya so that he could get money to, you know, pay the bills. However, to its credit the show does recognizes how useless Bossun is, but appropriately enough they don\u2019t comment on the fact that he could be the author\u2019s self-insert. Hime is a good character that has a lot of potential to be something more than a Kagura clone if written correctly. I always enjoy seeing a female as the manpower of the team. Usui is probably one of the most boring characters of the show, but one of the most fascinating if you read spoilers, more specifically the one surrounding his backstory and why he talks through his computer like Akihabara@Deep. It explains why he does what he does and it fits in with his awkwardly obsessive personality, other than that there nothing much to say about him. Don\u2019t ask me about any of the other characters because I can only remember them with single-sentence descriptions or I don\u2019t remember them at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors they cast for these parts have done some really fine work in the past. They are very talented but it feels like their talents are wasted on bland dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Not particularly memorable. Character models look a little odd in places but other than that it\u2019s satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Is this show terrible? No. Is it worth watching? No. All it does is leave you asking why this show was ever created.  It doesn\u2019t stand for anything nor does it do anything particularly different for a High School comedy, or comedy in general. It just feels like the producers wanted a safer more marketable version of the ever-salacious Gintama. It's a real shame that it seems like they don't even try to be original.",

            "content": "(Based on the 2 first episodes released)\r\nMy first review so, please enjoy and I hope you will find this will help you...\r\n- Story - 7/10\r\nSket Dance has a pretty simple storyline, a group at school that works together to make the students every-day life a little easier, with hilarious outcomes.\r\nEven though the story is simple, it makes it really enjoyable because of the diversity of characters that show up, with different requests and personalities we can truly say that each episode is unique and I dont feel ripped-off after seeing them, they really amused me to no end.\r\n- Art - 7/10\r\nI actually enjoy the art,with not too much detail the characters are well presented and the typical \"Comedy\" expressions goes along with them.\\n\r\nIt is well taken care of even in some scenes were animation could have slaked off (For example, the chase scene in episode 2)\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is great! It fits the upbeat mood of Sket Dance...Voice-actors, I love them! The voices fit perfectly with each characters personality and in the funny moments, they tend to make me laugh, specially Bossun\u00b4s reactions.\\n\r\nHime has a really good voice that can \"mold\" itself to when shes...ahem, pissed, and Switchs voice fits very well because, as a computer voice system, it doesnt show much emotion\\n\\n\r\n- Character - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the things that attracted me to this anime in the 1st place...The characters! The way they looked, so different from what Im used to see, the way they act...everything!\\n\r\nWe have cheerful people (Bossun), we have the bi-polar one (Hime) and we have the geeky-cool type (Switch), together they make a great team that makes me laugh everytime they jump into action, making any moment a hilarious one!\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot many anime made me laugh as much as this one, it was really amusing and I cant wait for more!\\n\r\nI hope they keep going on and make great episodes like these 2, I certainly enjoyed them!\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 7.6 (Ill make it an 8 ;O) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI hope they keep the good quality this show has and the potential to become a great comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\n- A really funny show that wont bore you, at least, it didnt bore me! - Give it a try and maybe you will find yourself counting the days until that next new episode!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is a series that could have been WAY better if they had tried harder. It's pretty much a poor man's Gintama, and that's saying alot since this is adapted from a manga by the former assistant to Hideaki Sorachi.\r\nThe story about SKET Dance revolves around a club that helps people with their problems of any. Led by the enthusiastic Bossun (voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino), the foxy Himeko (voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi) and the otaku Switch (voiced by teh Sugita), the go around school receiving help and solving problems.\r\nSKET Dance has everything pre-packaged to make it a good anime. You've got not one, but twoall-star openings by AKB 48's French Kiss and Gackt along with ending themes by The Pillows. You also have an all-star seiyuu cast featuring Tomokazu Sugita, Ryoko Shiraishi, Hiroyuki Yoshino, Hiro Shimono, Tomokazu Seki, Yuu Kobayashi, Fumiko Orikasa, Marina Inoue and cameos from Ayana Taketatsu, Saori Hayami, Satomi Sato, Kaoru Mizuhara and lots more. There is also an episode directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Hell, they even adapted the Gintama crossover chapter, bringing the cast and characters of the Yorozura Trio into the SKET Dance world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, it still didn't fulfill its potential. Why? Because it's not funny enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe jokes are too safe and mediocre. The reason why Gintama is awesomely hilarious is because it holds no bar to how far the humor can go. In Gintama, they can show Okita creating a Human Centipede out of Gintoki, Hijikata and Katsura on top of the Bible because that's how they roll. But Sket Dance plays safer than the combination safe at Fort Knox. Hell, the few funny moments in this series is basically when the Gintama crew do one or two dirty jokes in this, and that's about it. That's as far as it goes with the humour. Come on Shinohara-sensei. You got your lucky break and blessing from Sorachi-sensei, and this is what you gave us? You can try harder than that.\\n\\n\r\nBut this series can really score in drama. When it has a backstory moment with some of its characters, it can get emotional and awesome, especially Switch's backstory. If it manages to have a Benizakura-esque arc later in this series, then why not? The show might just got better like what happened to Gintama after the Benizakura arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why i'm quite optimistic. It has room to improve, and they can nail some serious drama. And this is one of the few series that is awesome for Tomokazu Sugita himself. If you love him as Kyon, Hajime, Gintoki and Hoshi, you will definitely love him in this. He's pretty much having fun voicing Switch, and he's the one reason that kept me continuing with this series.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest you watch this only if you're a harcore fan of Sugita or Ryoko Shiraishi. Unless if this series manages to be as great as Gintama in its latter years, i would not think a casual anime fan would enjoy this.",

If you are looking for random laughs, strange characters and censored pukes, this is the right anime for you.\r\nStory-wise, there's no real plot to speak of and I don't think that's really necessary but remember this is based on a manga which is long running so things may start to develop soon. \r\nArt is also good in terms of the character designs and the animation is standard.\r\nI haven't noticed the soundtrack so much, so commenting about only the OP/ED, they are lively enjoyable songs but nothing that gets stuck in your head.\r\nMy opinions:\r\nI will not say thatit is an extremely hilarious anime, but its loud, wacky and fun. Its meant to be a bit childish.\\n\r\nIf you're watching without high expectations and looking for an anime that doesn't try too hard, this is it. The exaggerated drama, the weird gags, the outrageous characters all add to the humor of the anime.\\n\r\nAlso, there are fun characters like Bossun and the samurai dude and things happen for no reason really, but I'd say that's one of the plus points.\\n\r\nIt may not be one of the best anime you'll ever see and I can't talk about the manga, but the plot is next to zero and things just happen and that's the way it is, episode after episode. \\n\r\nThe humor isn't witty or anything, the jokes pop out of nowhere and are usually directed towards the characters and their antics, but I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who's looking for a laid back, fun anime which makes no promises and just lets you feel like you don't have to be serious about everything in life.  \\n\r\nGive it a try and see if it suits your taste. As for me, I love the anime, I love the Sket Dan and I look forward to having a good laugh every week :)",

I told you, this is SKET Dance!\"\r\n(SKET Dance Episode 26)\r\nSKET Dance.. What is it actually??\r\nIt's not an anime Dancing. But, as you can see from synopsis, SKET Dance is actually a Living Assistance Club. They help many people from their own problem. But, is it worth to watch this anime? Is this fun to watch? Let's see...\r\n- Story: 8 / 10\r\nThe story mostly happened in their school, doing some random things together in their school, and help many people. Not just like the ordinary slice-of-life anime, but extraordinary slice-of-lifeanime. The story is light and not confusing every part. It's actually pretty funny and entertaining every episode. If you fan of Slice of Life and Funny anime, i recommend this anime to you.\\n\\n\r\n- Art 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art style well fit together along the story. The character design is match from their own personality (like most of Shounen Anime). Each character art style is different and unique. This anime art style and animation are good and always consistent from beginning until end of series.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening songs and Ending songs is pretty catchy, and i enjoyed listening them. Not only that, SKET Dance also has a lot Opening songs and Ending songs (so, you won't be easily bored with same OP and ED songs). Their seiyuu/character voice is fit and improve all character unique personality. The background music is also fitting for the story and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n- Character 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nEach person has their own unique personalities. I like all the character in this entire series. Not only the main character, the supporting character is also well made. There's a lot of supporting character in entire series. All of them is actually very weird in some ways. For example, we have a genius-idiot person (Bossun), a giant-strong female character (Koma Morishita), a person who always talk no sense (Dante), a person who can \"break\" the 4th wall (Roman),  etc...\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime. So far,  havei already re-watch all the series 4 times because i never bored watching this. Sometimes i just re-watch certain episode. This anime is fun, random, and funny. The beginning of this anime is pretty weak, but give it a try, you will love this.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great. I actually wanted the staff do sequel of SKET Dance. But 77 Episode is more than enough to satisfy yourself. Watch it? Yes.. You will love this Anime.",

            "content": "Sket Dance is a comedic/slice of life/dramatic anime that will leave some of you in tears, laughing. Notice how I didn't address the whole group? Reason being, is that the anime tends to make a lot of jokes and references that the average foreign viewer will fail to understand at times. The show also tends to break the fourth wall every so often which in my opinion, isn't very funny. But some good points is that the show has some serious and dramatic arcs which are enjoyable to watch and some episodes that will leave you laughing despite if you're unfamiliar to Japanese culture. \r\nHowever,there isn't really a running story behind Sket Dance. A three man school club group called the \"Sket Dan\" includes Bossun, Himeko, and Switch. They have suffered from their past and because of it they want to help out people in need. But sometimes you might find yourself wondering where the story is going and if there is going to be a climatic ending at all. In some ways, it falls flat compared to the Gintama anime (very similar anime but with action) because a lot of their jokes usually don't try to go overboard in the silliness and inappropriateness.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great and sometimes hilarious. Okay, all the time hilarious. The sound is clear, good music, and funny sound effects. The characters though, have to be the richest part of the show. There is a collection of over 20+ characters who all have a different look and hilarious personality to them. (Ex: The Creepy Occult Girl, The Genius but Lazy Science Teacher, The teacher who resembles Jason Voorhees, The Enigman and Quettion duo, The baseball captain with a huge appetite, The tsundere girl, The wannabe-samurai, and many more.) \\n\\n\r\nLike most animes, the first episode may seem bland, but continue on watching and you'll quickly fall in love with the series. Overall, I give the show an 8. \\n\\n",

They grow strong bonds with a good bunch of the town that they live in as they go through their daily lives. Sket Dance is a comedy that follows the \"recipe\" of fellow comedy Gin Tama along with quite a few voice actors, they even did a crossover episode!\r\nPlot 8/10:\r\nNice little story going on here, the anime itself doesn't actually start and finish withthe manga as it is ongoing, though I do feel like it stopped at a good time. We have our group in the \"Skettu Dan\" working towards the problems brought to them by fellow members of the school, some sort of contest against the notorious members of the school counsil, and interactions with recurring classmates and teachers as thus. Even though Sket Dance follows this episodic formula, it doesn't leave us without character and story progression, it may be slow but there is things going on in the background to leave you a little teary from either sadness or laughing a little too hard.\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nWe do see a newer form of artwork in place with some unique character design. Fan service is minimal but certainly still there as you would expect from a school setting anime. The artwork put in place does a fairly good job to enhance situations going on to set the mood of what could be very funny or very gloomy.\\n\\n\r\nWe also see some pretty cool action themes!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: \\n\r\nAs the students actually partake in forms of music from time to time we do see quite the variation in sound used, jRock is seen at times along with some heart-warming ballads during the OT's, ET's and throughout what were some very gloomy scenes. There was also no shortage of OST's to get us through the more important themes, a little jig to get through the humorous content or a low-key piano piece as a character gets through a sudden heart felt realisation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters themselves progress at a very alarming rate, that is, all except for our main characters in the Sket Dan. Through helping others out they sure do define themselves as above saving so to speak, though this is not without conquest... they sure have their own hearts.\\n\r\nThese students all have their own lovable stories, some of them will surely bring anyone with a soul to tears and some will have you just about punching through your tv screen (and a few walls), we see strong relationships which will seemingly last to the grave and others which are surely temporary for the comedic intent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nIf comedy is something that is up your alley and you did enjoy Gintama then surely give this one a shot, not without some tears Sket Dance is to be taken seriously as a fully fledged Shonen!\\n",

            "content": "SKET Dance is a slice of life comedy manga written and illustrated by Shinohara Kenta. In 2011, Tatsunoko, the same studio behind Kyatto Ninden Teyandee & C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control, started airing an anime adaptation. The anime lasted for nearly eighty episodes and ran for over a year, ending in late 2012.It was introduced to me as like Gintama, but done well. So how true is that and is it worth watching?\r\nStory:\r\nKaimei High School has an unusual student organisation. This is the titular SKET Dan, a support club that helps students or other clubs who need them. It has three members,Himeko, Bossun & Switch. The series basically covers their misadventures and the quirky people they encounter. This is one of those series where there's a general order to the episodes, but where most of them have little connection with one another aside from starring the same cast. So, let's cover the important aspect, how well the humour works.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this is very hit or miss. There are times when it works nicely and others where it just falls flat. Generally speaking, the points where they try something really outlandish are the points where the comedy just fails. Mainly because these moments rely on randomness and characters shouting to be funny. The stuff with their teacher's bizarre science experiments. The stuff with their other teacher's obsessions with overly convoluted nonsense. The episode that crosses over with Gintama, and so on. Those are the moments that are just tired and stupid. Whereas the comedy that uses more exaggerated realism tends to work pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, a series like Galaxy Angel can get by with overblown absurdity. Not only is the execution better, but the series is never tied with any real semblance of reality, except in that serious episode that was out of place and terrible. But with this series, so much of its humour is tied to realistic situations being slightly exaggerated. Which means that when they do put something in that's completely absurd, it doesn't really fit. This series tries to be a cross between the everyday school life comedy and the absurdist zany comedy but it's only good at the former and its attempts to mesh the two just don't work particularly well.\\n\\n\r\nComedy aside, there is a huge flaw with the series as a whole. It sucks at incorporating romance. Every single scene where they try to throw in some high school crush or to force chemistry between two characters, ends up being just banal and poorly done. Its like they took scenes from a shite romantic comedy and just threw them in whenever they wanted to develop their characters but couldn't think of a good way to do it.\\n\\n\r\nI will give the series credit for having some pretty solid serious scenes. There are quite a few moments where they focus on the characters, without the lousy romance angle, and they show something tragic, dramatic, heart-warming or a blend of the three. And those scenes are largely pretty solid and do their job well. Truth be told, they're also a big part of why the absurdist elements don't work. The contrast between a stupid plot where Himeko & Bossun switch bodies and a semi-serious story about Himeko's tragic past is simply too glaring. In that sense, it is a bit like Gintama, except in Gintama the attempts at drama were out of place with the usual absurdity whereas in Sket Dance the absurd moments are rarer and they come across as out of place while the more dramatic moments work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this varies quite a bit. The major characters tend to be nicely fleshed out and have some level of depth to them beyond comedic quirks. The secondary and side characters, on the other hand, are their comedic quirks. Usually that's two things to them, which makes them better than those comedic characters with one joke, but it can still get old and repetitive. There's also the issue with the character dynamics. Mainly, the aforementioned way the series fails at romance. Those relationships that are supposed to read as having romantic chemistry are either badly done in general or inconsistent, with the romance dynamic being bad but with the characters also having a more friendship-oriented dynamic that works.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is decent enough. There are times during the more absurd scenes where things get hectic and difficult to see. On the positive side, the series does have some good visual gags. Aside from that, it all looks fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is competent overall but, like most elements of this series, inconsistent. Yoshino Hiroyuki, Sugita Tomokazu & Shiraishi Ryoko all do quite well and demonstrate some nice emotional range but a lot of the side actors only have to do one or two jokes and, consequently, don't need range. Although, to be fair, the actors still generally do fine and it gives you the chance to hear Gackt do some voice acting. There are a few performances that are annoyingly exaggerated though and times when those actors who are generally fine have their over-acting bombastic moments.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nMomoka's dynamic with Himeko frequently comes across as her having a crush on Himeko. It's probably the best semi-romantic dynamic you get in the series just because it's actually natural for the characters and never feels contrived or forced. But it's also pretty clear that they're not going for a romantic dynamic, but an adoring disciple-master thing. There are some other homo-erotic moments interspersed throughout, but nothing major.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI can see where the comparisons to Gintama come in. And not just because there's a crossover episode. Both series try to blend absurd comedy with more down to earth comedy and drama. Both also have massive casts of largely boring characters who are mainly there for a few reoccurring japes. I would agree that Sket Dance is better at the whole juggling act than Gintama was. That being said, I wouldn't say that Sket Dance is particularly successful at it either. If the series had dispensed with the more outlandish elements and not  bothered with teenage romance elements, it might have been really good. However, as it stands, those highly absurd comedic moment are its biggest flaw. They aren't funny, clever or a good fit. In the end, my rating for Sket Dance is a 6/10. It's okay, not good. Next week I'll take a look at Toradora.",

The rest of the episodes were either simply pleasant to watch or slightly amusing. Many were downright boring. But these are not the only problems of Sket Dance...\r\nSomehow, Sket Dance fails to get you emotionally involved with the characters. It is not that they are not likeable, they are. Yet they miss that certain quality that makes you really care what happens with them, that quality that makes it a joy to watchthem go about their lives and interacting simply because they are great characters. Which I guess is the point: They are not in fact great characters, otherwise we'd care, otherwise just watching them talk would be fun. But it is not.\\n\\n\r\nMost bizarrely, this series took a very sudden and totally unexpected turn to fanservice around the last 15 episodes or so, right after going through some of its funniest episodes.

            "content": "I don't know why but every time SKET Dance re-broadcast on TV, when I decided to watch it, they always broadcast the episode where Bossun really want to go to the toilet but always find hindrances along the way. I don't know if this is some omen or just a very bad coincidence. Nevertheless, SKET Dance became one of the best comedy anime I have ever watch and I still thought so until the day I write this. And I am going to tell you why.\r\nSKET Dance follows a story of a club in Kaimei High School called Sket Dan (derived from Suketto or Helpin Japanese) and their daily shenanigans. Since the club is about helping other people, the story revolves around the club's effort to solve other people's problem and because everyone seems like requesting crazy things to Sket Dan, they never have a regular day while solving the problems. SKET Dance's jokes are always spot on and they occasionally threw reference jokes which I love and not afraid to take it into the next level. Many of their jokes contain sarcasm towards the community and they managed to make it so funny and so relatable at the same time. Aside from jokes, I think they excel in their character development and story around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile mainly being a comedy show, they did not shy away to develop their characters in some and any way. Backstories of each characters explored carefully and made them very lovable despite their usual shenanigans. All of the main characters have a horrific past and it made the closeness between each of the main character very reasonable and not just because of they are in one club kind of thing. Bossun is the main reason why they are together. Not just the main cast, the other \\n\r\nsupporting casts may not be together if there's no Bossun in their school.\\n\\n\r\nOh, yeah. I really love the music by The Sketchbook that were used for their insert songs and even OP or ED. Not to mention that they did a cover of The Pillows' Funny Bunny and nailed it gracefully. It fit the scene completely as they managed to make it feels like it came out from a highly talented high school band. Then there's the opening and the ending songs. I'm not going to lie but all of SKET Dance's OP and ED are worth to listen. From the first one to the last one. If I'm going to pick, my pick for best OP would be The Sketchbook's Message and my pick for best ED would be The Pillows' Comic Sonic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, SKET Dance is one of the best anime comedy out there and an anime that never left out from my favorite anime of all time. Even my brother, who is not an anime or manga lover like me, loves this anime so much and constantly talks about this anime with me. While it may not be possible, I really hope they continue this anime into the next season.",

The stupidity and parody were really amusing and at times I couldn't stop laughing because of the funny scenes. \r\nHowever the first episode putted me off the anime at first because it didn't have impact and it confused me about who was the main character but as the anime progress you feel more intact with the anime and learn about the pasts of bossun and onihime and switch . Which were very emotional because of them having such sad pasts. because of the drama and comedy it totally mademe want to finish the anime and I think that unless u don't like comedy's , I wouldn't recommend this for you",

While the story is simple enough, it can both be funny and sometimes very touching, it's hard to believe that every of the main characters have very touching and difficult past's since this isn't the most serious anime in the world, but I also enjoy the serious part of this anime and could wish it was more of it! \r\nSince some of the episode tend to be a little boring sometimes.\r\nI can't stop helping but love every character in this anime, since almost all of them have unique personality's that only make you laugh sohard sometimes.\\n\r\nWhile I would like the creators show more of Bossun's good side than idiot side.

It was like taking all anime genres and squishing them all together x) At first glance i thought sket dance would be your typical comedy/ school life anime but its way more than that. Sket dance pulls you in, to the point where you feel like youve known the characters for a long time and it feels like youve become one of them, the Sket Dance.The story was well outstanding. Why? because even if Sket Dance starts off as a typicalclub anime it had its own unique spin, which it expresses quite well. The characters background stories were unexpectedly deep, so deep that sometimes i have to pause while watching to realize whats happening so far. Sket Dance also has romance, but its not over the top and its rarely touched upon which is very good for this type of anime. The art styles and the colors were great, it felt lively we it needed to, and it felt serious when it became serious.(which is usually cut off by unserious elements) YOU HAVE TO WATCH SKET DANCE! whether your a hater, a fanboy/girl, or your new watch sket dance. as the Sket Dance say: Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshoot Sket Dance!!!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as my opinion goes i give sket dance a 10/10",

            "content": "I was still pretty new to anime when I started watching SKET Dance, but it really got me hooked on Slice of Life anime. It makes me laugh and cry. The plot mostly changes episode to episode, but there is some continuous plotline going on. I love this anime and I feel it deserves to get more recognition! \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe series follows three teenagers: Bossun, Switch and Himeko; who run a school club. The club, called SKET Dan, is for helping people with any problems. Whatever it is, the SKET Dan will be there to help! \r\nEach episode follows the SKET Dan helping a differentperson, whether student or teacher. Sometimes there are special episodes, usually at the end of each season, showing more about the main characters' backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in SKET Dance is a simple shounen style. Nothing flowery, but all the same very well drawn. The style perfectly fits with the series. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like is how Bossun pulls a hilarious embarrassed face! If anything you should watch the show just for that!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThere have been a lot of episodes of SKET Dance, and therefore, a lot of opening and ending songs. So far my favourites have been, 'Comic Sonic,' by 'The Pillows,' which was ending song 1; and, 'Graffiti,' by, 'GACKT,' which was opening song 3.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing for fans of Japanese music is that J-Rock singer GACKT voice acts for a guest character! \\n\\n\r\nThe other music in the show is quite catchy, but can become annoying after a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are amazing! From otaku geek Switch, to Samurai obsessed Shinzou, all the characters are wacky and fun. \\n\r\nOne of the things I love about this show is the utter craziness of the characters. I also like how some seem to represent stereotypes!\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of sadness behind the main characters, as you find in the episodes about their pasts. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series is mostly a comedy, and it's very easy to get into! The plotline isn't serious, so I'd watch it maybe when you need a break from a deep series. If you're an otaku, you'll notice a lot of references to anime and games!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI love this show! I think you should definately watch it! The stories and charcters are hilarious, and it's great fun to watch. If you feel down, this is a great anime!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I hope you enjoyed my review. I tried to keep it short and sweet! If you have any comments, please feel free to tell me your views!\\n\r\nThanks for reading!!!!\\n",

            "content": "All thats wrong about sket dance in story section below.\r\nIve dropped this anime so many times in the past bcs some episode isnt that funny and i admit some are boring but lets take a look at gintama if you watch season 1,season 2 there are many boring episodes and some episodes are just re airing last week's episode or past episodes and its not only happening once but many times, some episode is just filled with dialogs about how they run out of ideas,etc and  maybe from 100 episodes the legit episodes will be about only 20-30 of it. Making a long runcomedy anime are real hard thats why we dont have long run comedy anime besides gintama. I understand the struggle.\\n\\n\r\nBut i remember now why i drop this anime in the past despite of its great  story concept and decent comedy scenes. I really cant stand some of the characters and i will explain it below and it really destroy my great experience warching this show and the purpose of sket dance club is to help people and bosun supposedly become your biggest ally when you are in trouble, he will help everyone in need even tho he will get beaten up,spending money,ashamed and lose to the enemy. The point is he will always help you no matter the consequence. Now some of the episodes and his interactions with another characters really makes me feel betrayed and destroy the whole point of sket dance club. I will talk about it below in character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nAwesome animation,great detailing well actually many anime nowadays have great arts especially the one made by big studio.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSome of the OP are great and the some of the ED are great too, it really suits about the school life friendship animation. But the most important things some of the BGM are well placed.\\n\\n\r\nStory&Characters: 1/10\\n\r\nPart 1: \\n\\n\r\nThe story is so rich and many of characters background are explained very well in the anime, the protagonist bossun is pretty likeable and have a good influence for the others. But some of the characters are bitch and smartass douchebags who act tough and act like they know everything. What i dont like the most a character like himeko which when everybody see her you will instantly know that she is a normal girl, but then she is a tomboy and she was some kind of gang leader in her middle school, wtf are you talking about? A middle schooler? As a bitch eho always bring a golf stick to fight(im sure her enemy is far worse and bring weapons too in a fight) She doesnt even have physical scars and if this anime take place in some kind of war zone or a shithole country with high criminal rates and many gang members then it will be pretty reasonable but not in civilized country and a good school, especially if she is truly a legit delinquent kicking ass here and there like her story she will surely kicked out from school or at least falling a grade. Kagura from gintama is a badass girl but she is some kind of alien race and they have a whole different plot. This is where i feel sket dance fails at most, she is pictured like a biker gang with lame hair,lame costume and she is fighting people with violence and with golf stick on top of that. That kind of people isnt the righterous people who fight for the weak but the people who go around makes trouble for everyone, asking money from the weak, and probably in some fucked up situation where they are in some kind of debt or human trafficking. Thats bullshit, how can a bitch like that join a club to help people? People describe her as legend and if thats a legit story then im sure she already hurt so many people or make people disabled especially she always bring her golf stick to battle and im sure she hurt and asking money from good people too, on top of that she was only a middle schooler when it all happened. I even skipped eps 20-30 where the story focused on that bitch getting praised for acting all high and mighty. \\n\\n\r\nPart 2: \\n\\n\r\nLastly there is one guy named katou he appears at the end of the anime. He is strong kid and thats because he have this one riend in middle school who got bullied and was kicked out unfairly by his teacher and mock his weakness instead of helping him take care of the bullies. So that becomes his motivation is to become strong and prevent any other bullies in the high school. But magically one day his teacher from his middle school become his homeroom and start making troubles in his high school, so this katou guy kidnapped that teacher to the forest and planned to hurt him real bad, and then the righterous student council leader tsubaki and the leader of sket dan bossun come to him and try to talk some sense to this katou guy, but what i dont like is this tsubaki kid is always been having a good life and maybe only in trouble once or twice, this tsubaki kid suddenly said that katou should forget his past about his friend who kicked out from the school because bullying. WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? That guy who got bullied lost his friends,his human rights,ashamed because he is kicked out from school even tho he is a good student and nobody knows where is he ends up after he kicked out from middle school. When you kicked out from college and you are at least 17-20yrs old you can work almost everywhere from fast food chains,clerk,etc. But when you are just a middle schooler who is underage and all you can do is depend on your family, wtf do you think will happen to this kid if his parent have this weird crazy kamikaze ashamed japs mindset? He can end up getting suicide if his parents are close minded and ashamed with him too, the best scenario he can move to another school and start fresh or maybe he is kicked out from his family and become criminals or maybe kidnapped,getting into shady human trafficking,molested,etc or maybe he somehow manage to find a job with only his primary school diploma but im sure it will be doing really bad jobs surrounded by bad peoples, basically his life is RUINED and all the talent that he have is RUINED because he has his chances taken out from him especially his education. Bullying is known as one of the biggest factor to suicide and japan have one of the highest suicide rate in the world. And that tsubaki kid who always had a good life easily said that katou need to forget the past and stop blaming himself and he needs to forgive his teacher whayever the reason, wow yeah what an amazing  words to come out from student council leaders who claims that he will help everybody and always act like the most righterous guy, and i was expecting bossun the leader of sket dance to say \"this is not the most rightful choice to help your friend, i can help you find your old friend and we can help him together somehow if he is in trouble and having hard times because the incident caused by your teacher and we can make this teacher viral on the internet for destroying somebody`s life\" but sadly it all ends with bossun only punching that evil teacher and then the next day it feels like it was never happened at all and i think the teacher still doing fine and teaching at that school. So this katou guy was never once contacted his friend who got bullied  in his middle school after he kicked out, and im still doesnt understand why this guy feel that much guilt for his old friend and kidnapped that teacher when he never even there for his friend who got kicked out from school or when he still at school and bullied in class? He doesnt need to fight the bullies or giving that kid money but simply being there for him and stand by his side will really help him. But he didnt do nuffin. WHAT A FUCKING BULLSHIT HYPOCRITICAL GUY\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS ANIME DOESNT EVEN DESERVED TO BE COMPARED WITH GINTAMA AND THE CHARACTERS ARE FILLED WITH BUNCH OF HALF ASSED MTFCKERS WHO ACTS LIKE A GOOD GUY. IN THE END OF THE DAY THEY ARE THE SAME WITH EVERYBODY EGOIST BASTARDS. AT LEAST GINTAMA`S ODD JOBS IS PRETTY SOLID WITH THEIR OBJECTIVE AND WHAT THEY SAID. YOU GIVE THESE BUNCH OF EMPTY COCKSUCKERS WHO ACT LIKE THEY ARE LEGIT GOOD GUYS WHO HELPS EVERYONE 8 SCORE? FUCKIN CRAP LIKE THIS I ALMOST SLAMMED MY MONITOR TO THE WALLS WATCHING THESE FAKE ASS RIGHTEROUS PEOPLE.",

            "content": "This anime is one that I'd rewatch if i had no more anime to watch at the moment, and thats only because the anime is long and its really good. \r\nIf any of you watched Gintama its similar in many ways: It has LOADS of comedy, its main characters are 3 friends that are really close, but the difference between the 3 characters in Gintama and Sket Dance is that in Gintama the 3 meet up during the anime and in Sket Dance they knew each other before hand. \r\nSket Dance is about those 3 main characters, whose Nicknames are Bossun, Himeko, and Switch. Bossunis the leader of the group, Switch is an Otaku who is good with the computer, which he uses to talk, and Himeko, even if she doesnt look like it, is a former delinquent, but as you watch the anime you'll know the back story of these characters and i wont spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nThese 3 are in an after school club called the Sket-Dan whose purpose is to help those in need. And before you think thats all it isnt, they sometimes hangout outside of school with each other or their classmates/friends, and each of these outside characters are very unique and wont seem like their just background characters.\\n\\n\r\nMost episodes start off with the 3 chilling and hanging out in their clubroom after school until someone comes and asks them for help, and when the request comes in thats when the real show starts.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very basic but has alot of perks just like Gintama does, and just like Gintama, you have to get into the episodes for the deep stories and back stories to come in. The character designs are really good, just like most up to date animes. I dont remember the music that came in the background but it was really good especially during funny moments. As i said before, the characters that arent main characters are so unique they wont feel like they're just background characters. I really Enjoyed everything this anime had to offer and thats why i gave everything a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nThis may have seemed like a boring Review but its because the anime is just to good too explain and its one of those animes that you wont truly appreciate until you watch it. This anime has made me laugh hard, shed tears, especially when it ended (Not to confuse you the ending isnt sad, its just so good it left me in tears when it ended, especially when i rewatched the last opening,  which really felt like a \"Last Opening\". Speaking of that ALL the openings are AMAZING, which is a first from the animes I've watched before this. I assure you that watching all 77 episodes of this will be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way after you finish there is an ongoing manga that releases kinda....like...Its once a month but the amount of chapters they release a month varies. But they are still worth reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most of you have probably heard of the anime Gintama. It's know as the best comedy anime of all time for some people. They even saw that it's completely unrivaled and that there's nothing else that can make you feel multiple emotions in the same episode. I consider that statement false. Because SKET Dance, what may repel you away due to the unappealing concept, is actually an anime that delivers in multiple aspects which inclues hilarious joke and heartwrenching drama. To persuade Gintama fans who are skeptical of watching this anime, the assistant of Sorachi Hideaki (Gintama's author) is the one who created SKET Dance.You might also want to watch it for the crossover with Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very simple and is actually only what the synopsis says. It's all about some kids who go around in a school helping people out. This however, is very broad and leads to a great amount of world building. Due to the random requests they recieve, the locations the episodes take place in can vary alot. The huge cast of characters are usually met because of the requests they recieve. There's mostly a purpose for the seemingly meaningless episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA negative point about the storyline is that it starts off slightly bland and repetitive. It feels pointless to watch some kids wander out doing nothing but random and cheeky stuff. This, is however, the prime source of comedy that tends to grow on you as time passes. Once in a while there will be some arcs that derives from the usual stuff and those are the heartwrenching parts. To not make everything repetitive, SKET Dance delivers arcs that build up the characters relationships and also dwells into their pasts. It does take a while for the anime to pace up and get into the interesting storyline, however waiting it out shouldn't be hard as the primary reason of watching this is to enjoy a nice laugh, which is what'll most likely be doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe arcs themselves aren't going to be masterpieces and instead just focuses on developing relationships. This means that there's not going to be many deep and provacative arcs in a psychological way, but rather you'll probably think more about the characters and develop some sort of emotion for them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation / Art 9/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThere's not really much to discuss, however the art is really fresh to look at. It's completely perfect for the age it was created in. The animation is fluent and the uncommon action scenes that take place tends to be very consistent and great. The art doesn't differ too much from your average shounen anime, which tends to put off some people who're looking for more creativity. Although it's not creative and unique, it's still at the top of the shounen pyramid and looks near flawless in comparison to most long running anime. If you've watched something similar to One Piece and enjoyed it despite the simplistic art, detailed animations should still feel good to enjoy, despite the lack of originality.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is simply amazing. The voice acting is on point and fits most of the characters. A downside would however be that a few of the characters have voices that seem out of place, or do not simply fit them at all. That might be annoying in the start, however just like most anime, the voices do tend to sit with you in the span of a few episodes. The expressions are great and the emotions delivered feel realistic. The voice actors in this anime are very popular and experienced.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is great as well, because there's a great variety of them that plays during the course of the anime. Some of them are very memorable and might even make you crave to have a re-listen. Although the soundtrack is well done, the theme songs are even better. The famous band \" The Sketchbook \" performs most of the openings which do tend to set the mode for the episodes and personally, i listen to the openings a lot, even when i'm not watching the anime. The style of the songs would suit other people's tastes, even those that aren't into anime music. The songs are a bit different from the usual rock songs and the voice is epic. There are even good ending songs that are not performed by them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 :\\n\\n\r\nAs the story might have indicated, this is where the development shines. SKET Dance focuses on a large cast with a lot of unique people. The best thing is that none of the characters get left out and tend to return and provide themselves to the storyline of the episodes they appear in. There are so many different characters that are likeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters gets heavily relevant arcs that focuses on building up them as characters which shows how they've developed and grown compared to themselves in the past. The flashbacks provided are detailed and even introduce new characters that become interesting. It's kind of a wish that their role would become more apparent outside of the flashback arcs because of how interesting they were, whether that's possible or not, is up to your judgement. Personally, i think that some of them could have had re-appeared and played a role in some arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the main characters starts of as basic friendship which transcends into something deeper and more unbreakable than that. Whilst there is romance, the primary focus is the friendship between all the characters and how they care for each other. Side characters tend to want to join the friendship between the main character. Some of them develop feeling towards one of the guys in the trio.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing are the character interactions. It's clearly visible what every character thinks about one-another when they speak with each other. Depending on if it's someone they respect, or someone they think is annoying, their speaking patterns differ a lot. This is also where a lot of the comedy is brought up because of the funny and creative ways they speak and sometimes even hit someone. There's a lot of pointless fighting that's plain hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 :\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is primarily comedic and puts out jokes and a lot of fun stuff. Laughing is natural as day and becoming hooked is also natural. There's a lot more than the jokes to enjoy. The world building is very interesting, and thinking about the locations they're in is nice to do. The story arcs are also enjoyable as feeling emotions towards characters is considered enjoyable nowadays. Actually, it's always been like that. The vibe of the anime is always bright and only feels depressing when it needs to be. Depressing vibes in a comedical scene is a sign of boredom, which SKET Dance avoids to do by any possible means.\\n\\n\r\nThe part most people might complain about is that it starts off really slow and that it's boring. This anime does take time to feel natural and the jokes might seem stale at first, however, they grow on you until you adapt to their sense of humor. Regardless of that, there's parodies which fans of other anime will enjoy. There's mostly some type of humor that will match your tastes.\\n\\n\r\nPros & Cons :\\n\\n\r\n+ Great humor with parodies\\n\r\n+ Heartwrenching drama\\n\r\n+ Loveable and unique characters\\n\r\n+ Crossover with Gintama\\n\r\n+ Shippings + Romance\\n\r\n+ World building\\n\\n\r\n- Possibly slow & stale\\n\r\n- Humor can vary and be unappealing\\n\r\n- Inapparent storyline",

Overall it did not pick my intrest.\r\nBut boy was i wrong, now i can understand that this anime was great. So many heartwarming stories and amazingly funny comedy.\r\nAfter the void i feelt after watching Gintama i knew that i needed someting to fill it, after watching some random recommendations i finally decided to watch it.\r\nAt first it was really slow and i gave up many times, but one day i thoughtto myself that in order to get use to it i needed ti marthon a couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt was so worth it, i almost cired, laughted and could not wait to see the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the anime wont come back, but i now i can atleast enjoy reading the manga( hopefully more story and more Sket Dance)\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot, maybe the humor wont suit everybody,but if you liked Gintama i cant recommend this anime  enough.\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

A younger version of Gintama definitely -- which i found hilarious too (for most of the episodes anyway).\r\nFor Sket - i found the characters interesting all throughout the 60 episodes i've watched so far. I have a huge crush on Bossun! I feel that the characters are very relatable - friends that i could have if they were real so to speak. =)\r\nSo that's my 2 cents! For those thatare thinking of watching a light humored comedy (and some touching episodes - loved them too - made me cry) -- go for Sket!",

            "content": "This anime has been finished not too long ago, and unfortunately, it didn't actually seem to ended ( if you watch the last episode ). Many people probably know this anime and some people may want to know if it's worth wasting their time to watch 77 episodes or so. In my opinion, it really depends on what your personal preference for anime are. Even though I rate SKET Dance 10 overall, it really didn't mean that this anime is the best all the way. It just so happens that in Some episode of SKET Dance there're just ones that really interest me, and inspiredme to move on to the next. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story of SKET Dance is what made it especially appealing for everyone to watch. It does not just stick to one genres all the way, but instead switch to others such as, horror, romance, action ( maybe a little ), drama, etc. Although it doesn't really switch up that much, since most of the time it sticks with school, and comedy ( in fact, i got really bored in some episode until i reach the 2nd half of the anime where romance started to come up, and I'm a sucker for romance). the comedy, however, was half of the time not That funny, or maybe not as funny as other comedy mainstream. In my opinion, Gintama has much better jokes and more funny moments than this, but what this anime have that Gintama doesn't is A REAL PLOT. You can't really skip much episode, since one episode connects to the other, and there's no sudden change of feelings ( ex. in Gintama the scene gotten completely sad in an episode but just when the tears almost escape from the viewers eyes, they ruin it with something funny or happier things, which really ruin the mood). In SKET Dance, if an episode was i intended to be sad, they keep it that way or they might bring in livelier mood shake down on excitement. This anime, especially the sad part, really bring out the emotion that the character feels in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNot much to really say here since I think that all the art are nice. The best part in the art of SKET Dance is how they made the character and background really match the mood in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNo  complain on the sound. Every object and people in SKET Dance sounds much like how they should be. The voice really match the face, the sounds of moving object, etc. really give off details and shake things up in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI really like the Characters in SKET Dance, for every characters ( or most of the characters) have their own unique personality. This means that most of the characters that keeps appearing in the anime will make things more exciting and not so boring. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI have quite a few episodes that I personally didn't like, but most of them were \"extra\" episode that wasn't really in the main plot of the story, so I don't mine it that much. Like I said, the actual part of this anime that i truly like are episodes in the 2nd half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a really unique anime with mixes of many genres. I think most people could really enjoy this if they put in a little time on it, but those who doesn't like comedy probably shouldn't watch this, because it's mostly intended to be funny. I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I really have to say that the ending really makes me angry in how they could continue so much from their, which i really hope they do, since I am dying here to see what would happen next.",

            "content": "This is my second review on MAL.. (:\r\nSKET Dance isn't the type of anime I usually watch, however, I have come to actually enjoy this series so far.  This review is based upon the first 13 episodes.  I have not read the manga, so this is entirely on the anime.\r\nSTORY 8/10\r\nThe story is pretty basic - a group of friends who take on tasks to help others.  Each substory is what makes up the larger story, I suppose.  Each episode provides laughs and entertainment, and the story flows, so it's isn't too random.  I give this 8/10 because there isn'ttoo much depth in the stories.  Then again, SKET Dance isn't an anime that promises much depth (so far) - though that's not necessarily a bad thing.  When I watch a new episode of SKET Dance, I see it as a breather from all my other anime, I just watch it to laugh a bit to myself and relax.\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is good for the anime's intentions of entertaining viewers.  There isn't too much to say about it - it's not particularly special nor is it beyond viewable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nNo complaints, really.  The OP/ED are all \"meh\".  There's nothing too special about them, like the art, but it's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\r\nI guess this is what keeps me watching this series.  The characters are very enjoyable.  Bossun, Hime, and Switch (especially!) make the anime laughable and their lines keep the anime light-hearted.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\nIt's not the most hilarious anime I've seen, but it is fun to watch.  I would recommend this anime to people as kind of a... \"just for fun\" anime.  Whenever you're waiting for another anime to air its new episode or when you need a break, this is the anime I'd recommend you go for.",

Despite being episodic, it reminds of the TV sitcom Friends where regardless of how many times I watch the same episodes, I find it extremely funny. \r\nArtand Sound - pretty much average, nothing really worth mentioning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - As I stated, the main characters are apart of a club which goes round helping people, the characters are hilarious and are extremely likeable. The anime also dives into the deeper personal aspect of the characters making them even more likeable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable - Watch the first 10 episodes at least, by then you should be hooked to this, if not then there is something seriously wrong with you.",

            "content": "Plot:\r\nSket dance is an anime series based on the manga of the same name in which you 3 students sitting in there club house which is called as the sket club and helping the helpless ones in the school. Fairly simple plot which in the beginning would make you doubt that why the hell does it have 77 episodes. It\u2019s not an action pack series although it does have bits and pieces of action in it. It hardly contains any drama and the amount of romance is also close to nothing. Then most of the people would be wondering why they should even bother watchingit and the answer to the question would be \u201cit\u2019s amusing that\u2019s why\u201d. \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWhen the content of a series is so moderate the only thing that can help series to survive is characters. Sket dance have an amazing set of characters, weird ones but amazing. All the 3 main characters are amazing. People who watch the series would definitely fell in love with those 3 for sure. The side character is also likeable and you probably should not have any issue with them. \\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nWell 1st the art is something I won\u2019t it\u2019s amazing because the anime is from 2011 and there were anime which had much better art at that period but it is fairly consistent , warm and likeable which so at least I didn\u2019t had any problem with it .\\n\r\nThen when it comes to sound in between of some episode you\u2019ll hear a guitar tune which would give you the warm and fuzzy feeling which would definitely make you check it out on YouTube. Rest of the score is also decent.\\n\r\nFlaws:\\n\r\nThe biggest flaws it has is that it doesn\u2019t end where the manga ended which kind of piss me off because I like when an anime have a proper ending. The second issue I have is that there are at least dozen of episodes which you could just skip and not worry about it kinda like filler but it is not filler because the source manga also have in it. So instead of including those they could have included a lot of other chapter which I think were more important to the story just in case if it had any kind of no. of episodes restrictions from the studio. \\n\r\nOverall verdict:\\n\r\nEven with all the flaws mention above it\u2019s a good anime. It could definitely be considered as a hidden gem which in my opinion everyone should at least give it a try. People with tastes for parody, slapstick humour and slice of life should be able to enjoy it. I would give it an overall rating of 7/10. \\n",

Some scenes may be very unexpected you will see as didn't know whether it's great or disappointment. Also some scenes are very funny and hilarious much xD.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nWell overall in background, animation and characters of art, it's very fine much I'm not explaining this much sorry!, so it's good too! :)\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nFrom the sounds, first of all the opening it's very rock music that I hear too much same as the ending too. Then the background music are quitefantastic it matched perfectly of what scene it expressed such as funny,intense,dramatic,etc. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nAll of the characters are very various traits and attitudes, of course it's an\\n\r\nhigh school! The main characters as they have some heartbreaking families which is very unexpected to see, and also it's very cooperative and close in each other. I'm so disappointed there is one character did not appear much in the episodes which is Himeko talks something on some episode told about her which is named \"Nakatani\". And finally the relationship... probably some may appear romance less, probably it's kind of lack.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this it's so funny and epic, whatever the scenes I saw it's funny I laugh it very much! Sometimes I'm curious what will be happen like they solve something mysterious or a problem I'm quite nervous xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nFinally for the overall, this anime Sket Dancce is the most epic,cool and funny I've ever had! I really like this because, it spreads everything coolness and unexpected to see and I learned some what would be the important of being a friendship! I hope there could be season 2... need to watch more episodes.\\n",

            "content": "Support - Kindness - Encouragement - Troubleshoot \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is fairly straight-forward and follows The Living Assistance Club (Sket Dance) at Kaimei High School that help out their fellow students with problems that they are currently facing. No matter how big or small they are always there to provide assistance and advice to deal with the situation. \r\nComing into this show you will find that a majority of the episodes will deal with a student having a problem and the club members coming up with a way to solve their problem. And yes it does get episodic which for some people could get boringand perhaps repetitive. However it is the way the club members go about trying to solve the problem that I find enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is hilarious and funny with plenty of jokes to get you laughing. Not everything goes exactly according to plan, but in the end they are able to achieve a conclusion that most of the time everyone is satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nIn some occasions you get a back story on the three main characters, Bossun, Himeko and Switch which slowly leads to show how the club was formed. You get to understand who they were before and who they are now. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also references to other popular anime that appear throughout the show which they like to joke about. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing spectacular, but the characters are drawn nicely. The background is colourful and similar to other types of anime based around a school setting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are quite catchy and the rock music works very well with this sort of anime. The background music when something funny or ridiculous pops up fits the moment and I always get a smile or laugh from it.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFujisaki, Yuusuke AKA Bossun is the leader of the Sket Dance. He is not your typical main character as he doesn\u2019t really stand out from others, but his sense of always wanting to help others and not giving up is what I like about him. His talent seems to be able to pick up new skills like drawing manga and creating origami very quickly which his friends see as impressive. However he doesn\u2019t seem to care as much, but does get obsessive over it once he gets into it. \\n\\n\r\nOnizuka Hime AKA Himeko was once called the legendary delinquent \u201cOnihime\u201d before she joined the Sket Dance. She is always looking out for Bossun and Switch and tends to be the motherly figure of the group which I find adorable. Just don\u2019t get on her bad side or she will take you down with her signature hockey stick that she always has with her.\\n\\n\r\nShe is also the \u201cstraight man\u201d of the group and always points out the ridiculousness of what someone says and tends to go overboard when she explains why it is so absurd. This aspect of her character is what I love as she can be really funny, especially when it is directed at Bossun. \\n\\n\r\nKazuyoshi, Usui AKA Switch is unique from the other two since he speaks through his computer after an incident in his past. He is an Otaku and loves everything anime, manga, games and figures. Judging from his appearance he looks serious, but can be hilarious and silly as well. He has information on virtually everyone at school so he is the brains behind the club when they need information that they don\u2019t have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also plenty of support characters throughout the series that all have their own unique traits and personalities.          \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was a joy to watch. There were plenty of laughs throughout the series with the introduction of different characters as I went on. There was always a sense of satisfaction when the club solved a student\u2019s problem which always gave me a smile. Sometimes there were moments that were not as enjoyable or funny, but that didn\u2019t take too much away from the show. Sometimes I wish I could join the Sket dance as it seems like so much fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith 77 episodes there was plenty of laughs you could get from this show. The music was fun to listen to and the art was fairly standard. I would recommend this to anyone that loves anime based around a school setting and seeing how the club members go about solving their fellow student\u2019s problems.",

I have been hesitant picking it back up, but after watching Gintama I decided to reluctantly. \r\nWow, I'm so glad that I did. This show really grows on you. This is more than just a comedy...all of the characters have interesting and heart breaking back stories. \r\nI just want to encourageyou, if you want to give Sket Dance a try...do it. I know it may look similar to Gintama in a school setting, but it truly has its own flare. \\n\\n\r\nI just finished watching this show and I truly feel a void. This show will always have a special place in my heart and I wish that it would have continued, as the manga just ended in 2016. The last episode leaves you on a bit of a cliffhanger if you don't dive into the manga. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if this was a good review or not...but I was truly very pleasantly surprised with this anime and how much I grew to love it. 10/10 for me!",

What I'm saying is, I'm going to be more subjective and objective. It's also rather difficult to review without spoiling much as well. Let's get started.\r\nStory: SKET Dance is, in one word, episodic. If that doesn't turn you on, then I'm pretty sure you won't like it then. It's a type of story where each episode has it individual story, but continues the character routines. There are a few episode that has two-part episode. While, I wouldn't say an arc,but it's like a minuscule version of an arc. But most of the episodes are pretty much standalone type. I suppose, you can say it's like a detective show where it focus one case at a time. The real potential of SKET Dance, however, is basically the concept of a sitcom in TV series. Basically, just enjoy what you watch. It has tons of humor and comedy. Story can be basic and at times, a little dull, but that's where characters are counted on more than the story itself. I will talk more about characters on the bottom section. For now, you just need to know that the story is just simply about these main characters wanting to help out other students in need and why they created such club for a reason. It gets really good on backstory as you progress through the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Honestly, art is art and I believe most art is subjective rather than objective. You can like one of this and dislike another. If you are talking about animation and graphic visual and stuff, then yeah, it's great. It's not that I have any problem with it. A person who is an expert on art, animation, and graphic and such, you would probably want answers from an expert and not from me. In most cases, I'll rate any anime I watch for art work will always be 10 as the highest and lowest as 6. In this case, it's an 8 because while, I'm sure there are some flaw and I actually found some, it wasn't a total distraction and didn't bother me at all. So, that should say something. I guess, if I had to say something meaningful, it would be that the artist isn't a shame about drawing ugly people as well as good looking characters. A lot of anime tends to be very stereotypical and draw girls with perfect body and even guys with perfect body, but SKET DANCE, it's not embarrassed of drawing chubby girl and chubby guys when needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Sketchbook. Awesome band with good music and setting perfectly for SKET Dance. If you ever watch Beck, this might slightly be a turn on for you. Although, it was only a few episode that involves music and such, it was fun and enjoyable to watch and listen to. I honestly, don't have a problem with the sound. Let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where SKET Dance shines. Main characters are well developed. Most sides and major characters can be interesting. The only thing I hoped more was more \"bad people\" or real antagonist because that's where the show lacks the most. Without that, this show is really just meant to entertain you at a comedy level. Which is why it can never surpass Gintama because Gintama has it all, not just the flawless comedy of it. Other than the lacking of a real antagonist, majority of characters can be interesting to watch, but I also felt most of them were one-dimensional because each character has a unique trait, but that's about all it really speaks about them, which is also a sad thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Had fun just watching casual anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The story being it's weak link and reason why the score is slightly lower. It still deserve an 8 due to appropriate backstory and three main characters are very likable which is a huge plus in my case. I would recommend it to anybody who is into comedy, parody, and just want to sit down, relax, and watch a casual anime.",

            "content": "Going into this series I couldn't help but be weary as the series falls under the shounen genre which is always notorious for dragging out longer then necessary. On top of this the show exceeds 50 episodes which usually guarantees the show will drag out. To my surprise Sket Dance kept me entertained from the beginning to the end. While there were times in the series I felt the story was stagnant and I questioned what this really had to do with the series as a whole. This was bound to happen with the huge cast the show has. Still there were times the seriesgot surprisingly dark and genuinely surprised me with how heart wrenching it could be. As for music I found other than the openings and ending, to be pretty forgettable. The art was very pleasing to look at especially for its age, but I felt sometime in the middle of the series the art tweaked itself to look different though I never figured out what. By the end of the series you really get a sense of growth for the characters and I do think the amount of episodes is necessary to achieve this sense of growth, however I can't look past the times in the series where I feel it drags out due to slow pacing. If you are thinking of giving this series a watch I recommend giving it a chance as it was over all a fun series to watch.",

As the name implies, they provide Support, Kindness, Encouragement, Troubleshooting to the characters as well as the viewers.\r\nArt and Sound of anime are just good.But it maintains to be boringless.\r\nThe characters and their past story are extra ordinary and I didn't expect this much from acomedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nPeople at any age can just sit back and enjoy this anime in a relaxing mood.

            "content": "Yes I am biased to the fact that this show has many similarities to it's metaphorical father Gintama. So excuse and ignore the incessant ramblings of a Gintama fan boy; if you want an incredibly critical and in depth review picking apart the different aspects of Sket Dance this is not the review you are looking for.\r\nSo with introductions aside, let's begin.\r\nI will be completely honest, Sket dance suffered from the same thing that Stein's Gate did that in the beginning, I wasn't completely hooked and put off watching it for quite a long time. So I pottered along watching silly episodes and laughing whenappropriate, until the Usui Kazuyoshi (Switch) background arc began. After watching this arc, I realized that this show can pull of what makes Gintama so great - It can jump from silly straight into serious melodrama and make it tear-jerkingly believable. It was this, the same with Gintama, that made me fall in love with the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, for those who know Gintama, is usually quite sporadic and involves a huge cast of characters (Some you obviously want too see more than others). Arcs range from 3 - 4 episodes to half an episode and usually balance the funny with the emotional with the serious quite well. In all, I quite enjoy the story and the characters that inhabit it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is superb, backgrounds are very detailed and pretty to look at. The characters are well drawn and movements make sense. Bossun's facial expressions are just fantastic to watch. I really have nothing to complain about with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also superb with a fantastic cast of voice actors, including fan favourite Sugita Tomokazu, whom plays the voice of Sakata Gintoki in Gintama and Switch in Sket Dance; and both in the crossover episode!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in this show is fantastic. Throughout the episodes you will see subtle changes in the way characters behave or approach a certain situation, and then when background story arc for each of the main characters come you find out why they are the way that they are in the first place. Every character in this huge ensemble has something to offer and love. Again I really can't complain about the characters as I have found something to enjoy in each of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for those who are looking to find whether or not this show is for you, I will honestly tell you that this show is not for everyone. It is a long running series and a lot of it will seem random and pointless to those who don't appreciate random and pointless. But if you enjoy Gintama, and you enjoy a good balance of comedy and emotion, then I will implore you to just give it a shot, watch up until episode 30 (roughly half of what has aired) and then judge it for yourself. And when you do, let me know what you thought of it!\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helps some people to make that leap and watch a few episodes.\\n\r\nUntil then, enjoy your anime!",

            "content": "SKET DANCE\r\none word: awesome.\r\ni've read some of the reviews of this series, and a lot points out that this series is a highschool-setting gintama (or something like that) that lacks humor. \r\ni haven't watched gintama yet so i wouldn't know for sure, but there is one thing that i know. sket dance isn't all about the comedy. \r\nthe story is all about three interesting highschool protagonists. our main hero, fujisaki yuusuke (let's just call him \"bossun\"), is an ordinary protagonist (like most shounen heroes). his special skills includes drawing and total concentration (which activates everytime he puts his goggles on). then we have onizuka hime(or \"himeko\"), the tough female protagonist who has a weird taste for lollipops. and last but not the least, my favorite character from this series, usui kazuyoshi or \"switch\", the smart-ass otaku who speaks using his laptop. together, they form a club in kaimei high called \"sket dan\", and their goal is to help anyone who needs them.\\n\\n\r\nwell yeah, almost all of the themes are quite the same with gintama. two guys and one girl team, inhumanely strong female protagonist, nerdy megane-kun and stuff. indeed, a lot might say that sket dance is a \"copy\" of gintama, but.. oh come on. get over it. sket dance has OTHER things to brag about.\\n\\n\r\nthere are different other casts that completes this series, and believe me, all of them are unique in their own ways. a samurai, creepy teachers, a manga-ka, a fast eater, otakus, sadako-like ghost(ehem), a seiyuu/singer and a lot more! all of them can be found here. \\n\r\nwhat's more is that this series can give you laughs. sure, the comedy isn't as hardcore as gintama, but.. well, it still manages to give the audience good vibes. there are also episodes which are definitely hilarious (the ep wherein they were mascots for a live show but then they were locked in a storage room), some give off a few smiles, and the others end in a satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\nbut the main reason why i LOVE this series is because of it's drama content, and when i say drama, it includes the 'kizuna' (bond). the backstory of every protagonist is dramatic, and for some reason - in my opinion, really tragic. i got really close to the characters after their pasts were revealed, especially switch's. i love him the most. his feelings of the past (and the present) reached me. i was actually shocked to find myself shedding tears at a simple dramatic backstory. it just isn't me to cry. bossun's backstory also made me shed a tear, but not for him, but for his dad(haha) (when he was so excited and happy then he got in a car accident.. it's so.. UGH.). as for this \"kizuna\" .. i've seen series that tackles friendship, but sket dance is just so different. (e.g. kimi ni todoke, lovecom, anohana, hanasaku iroha etc.) these three characters give this feeling of \"inseparable friendship\" and \"irreplaceable bond\". these three are more than just best friends, but they're not a threesome (hahaha). if you watch closely, their bond is REALLY more than a family. while watching it, you'll feel that it's real. it doesn't look like they're just acting it up. i cannot explain it very well, but if you just watch carefully, i'm sure you'll understand what i mean. \\n\\n\\n\r\nsket dance isn't all about making it's viewers laugh. it also wants to show the audience the beautiful bond that was created. the realistic feel of friendship of these three unique smiling human beings. \\n",

The characters are really funny, lovable, yet dramatic people. It's a funny anime where it centers around in the Sket Dance club room in school. They help anybody in need. \r\nThe main character Bossun is the leader. He's an excellent artist whose also a really good detective. There are funny moments when he becomes awkward around women or new people he meets but in all he's a good person who genuinely enjoys the benefit of helping others. Then there's Himeko she'susually seen caring around a hockey stick she's a dangerous fighter.And then Switch he's the brains he uses a computer talk due to the death of his brother who he blames himself for. Anyways he really good at intelligence gathering like personal information like name, weight, class, height, hip size, bust size, etc. \\n\r\nLike i said before it's usually a funny anime and most of the time the characters sit around in a club room but it's enjoyable and entertains you for hours. But the characters back story are so sad it makes me cry. But that's what happens when a funny anime goes serious. Anyways I recommend for all people who enjoy the funny, school type anime or just looking for an anime to past time or make me laugh.",

            "content": "SKET Dance is a slice-of-life comedy about the members of the Campus Support Group or the Sket-dan whose purpose is to help students with whatever problem they may have. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nWhat I really like about the story is how the SKET-dan doesn't just solve people's problems, but makes their lives better. Momoka almost becomes an entirely new person because of how the SKET-dan helped her. It always bothered me how in other anime like Pokemon they'll introduce these new characters that appear in one episode and are never seen again, but with SKET Dance we see what happened to these characters later and how theirlives are better. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, SKET Dance also has some very funny comedy and could get pretty surreal. There's a running joke where Bossun and the others repeatedly accidentally take some drug their faculty advisor Chuu created which could turn them invisible or who knows what! There's also all the weird and wacky supporting characters as well like Roman who constantly breaks the fourth wall and Shinzo who dresses and talks like a samurai that each bring a lot of comedy. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it's funny whenever SKET Dance would makes references to and parodies to other anime or anime cliches. For example, there's an episode where the MC's compete in a sports tournament and parody all the shounen cliches. There's also a crossover episode with the cast of Gintama where Himeko accuses Gintama of trying to steal their airtime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHiimeko: Himeko is the muscle of the SKET-dan who can take down a dozen delinquents by herself with the help of her trusty field hockey stick. Himeko also serves as the straight-man of the group who reacts and comments whenever Bossun or Switch do or say something stupid. It's funny how fast Himeko is with her quips (or tsukomis) and it's even funnier when she breaks the fourth wall with them like when she asks Bossun \"why are you the main character, again?\". \\n\\n\r\nSwitch: Switch is the brains of the SKET-dan who has data on almost everyone at the school in his laptop. What I like about Switch is he's a true otaku; whenever they're in the clubroom, he'll be playing dating sims. Furthermore, since Switch never shows any emotion, he does a great deadpan face whenever he does something funny.\\n\\n\r\nBossun: Bossun is the leader of the SKET-dan thus he naturally comes up with all the plans on how they solve their clients problem and, although Bossun may seem like an idiot, he comes up with some very creative ideas. Also, I love it whenever Bossun would get obsessed over something in an episode; for example, there's an episode where Bossun gets obsessed with origami and starts making origami versions of everything. \\n\\n\r\nSaaya: I'm sure there are people who don't agree with me, but I think SKET Dance would have been better without Saaya. Saaya is a girl who has a crush on Bossun and what I don't like about her is how I think the writers only added her because they wanted a love-interest character. Saaya has a crush on Bossun and she's a tsundere (you know she's a tsundere because the other characters repeatedly call her one) and that's all she is. There's nothing interesting about her, but she appears so much in the later episodes. Also, why does the anime need Saaya when Bossun and Himeko already work so well together? I would've much rather seen them get romantic!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSKET Dance has a good balance of drama and comedy; it has a lot of funny characters and great jokes, but it also has serious and emotional episodes as well with characters who grow and change over time. However, many of the supporting characters only have one personality trait that makes them stand out and some characters like Saaya were just unnecessary.",

            "content": "I recently watched this anime and what really surprised me was how enjoyable it was. I binged watched the entire series within a matter of days. This show was something different, special. It had a type of humour that you don't see anymore, and it was pretty refreshing (even though it a few years old).\r\nThe very first episode of SKET Dance is probably how you get hooked by the show, It just comes of nowhere and you end up wanting to see the next episode. As you go along it just ends being a wild, wacky and fun ride as you watch.\r\nI do admit thatsome jokes fall flat at times, as some are Japanese based, and you'd have to be very well versed if you were to understand a few of them, but that doesn't really hold back the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I really enjoyed about the show was the characters. I felt like I could really connect with them, and understand each and every problem they faced as if i were there myself. The dynamic between the three main characters Bossun, Himeko and Switch is special.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't really get see much on how they interacted before they friends, and i wish they dwelled on that a bit further, but that's just me. They do give you enough information about them to show how and why they are, so I really do appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nThe jokes in this is hilarious, for me I guess. Because the real appeal of this is the humour, and if you can't laugh and smile as they do throughout the show, then really it isn't worth watching. The shis show all depends if you have that type of humour.\\n\\n\r\nSo I do suggest to watch at least 5-10 episodes and if you don't end up enjoying (*whipers* \"It's probably not for you.\"). I guess all anime series are like that, you test the waters and if you don't like watch something else that catch your fancy.\\n\\n\r\nWell all in all, this was a really good watch for me, I laughed and nearly cried at point (sad cry not a happy one ;) ). This series will stay with me for a long time. And in a few years I might end up watching this again,\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, great fun, lots of laughs, i HIGHLY recommend :) .\\n\\n",

            "content": "Support, \r\nKindness, \r\nEncouragement, \r\nTroubleshoot.\r\nThis anime revolves around those four points. In short, it's an anime about a club which help anyone and everyone regardless how big/disturbing/annoying the request is.\r\nFirst of all, I read somewhere that this show is somehow derived from Gintama. I can't say anything about that because I've never seen Gintama. I didn't feel like catching up with hundreds of episodes...\r\nLet's get back to Sket Dance shall we?\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThis is arguably bias among fans. One might say it barely have any plots, while the other is vice versa. Anyway, IMO Sket Dance do have a plot and an interesting way of tellinga story.\\n\\n\r\nThey use a lot of 'requests' from the other students to flesh out the main characters. So one will get to know the protagonists traits and characters as they kept watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting thing is... some 'request' trigger a flashback on one of the main trio. Needless to say, these flashbacks is heartbreaking/ tear-jerking/ dramatic/ important to the story. They slowly explain how SKET DAN came to be... By the end you would understand why there is a SKET DAN in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSee that? By the end, they explain how it begins... How could that not be interesting??\\n\\n\r\nNo, the story is not mainly about the past. The present itself feature itself with a lot of relationships issues. I will spoil nothing.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nIn my eyes, the graphics were beautifully done with intricate details.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThis may be bias coming from an audiophile, I love almost all animes OST and VA. All of the animes I've seen have great sound and Sket Dance is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs are really good too! I could feel the emotions portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Sket Dance plays a VERY IMPORTANT role to the story. I think it's the way they relate the characters that made this anime really alive. Each characters have their special personality which come with a ridiculous idiosyncrasies. The main character, Bossun himself has the biggest flaw of all. Don't get me wrong, these flaws are the reason this show is so good. I won't tell what is it...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nI couldn't give a full score to avoid being to biased. One might say the repetitive pattern of request becomes dull throughout the series while some says the otherwise. IMO, I enjoyed all the episodes. Oh! Another thing is Sket Dance tends to break the fourth wall a lot with a certain character. This can only lead to two things: you find it funny or you find it disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sket Dance is definitely worth watching regardless what genre you like. It's a well-rounded anime which mix the genre with deft writing and planning. I'm hoping they animate more episodes from the manga because there's much more to be told!",

            "content": "Sket Dance strikes me as an under rated show.  While I've seen it compared to Gintama (and there were crossover episodes), somehow, it reminds me most of the first few seasons of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. There were no world threatening vampires or other monsters, but the relationship between the 3 core characters reminded me somewhat of Buffy (Himeko), Wilow (Sketch) and Xander (Bossun, even though he's the leader here.) \r\nIt's a show that's greater than the sum of its parts.  The story was usually a one episode plot, but there were several arcs throughout.  There were several episodes that were LOLfunny, several that were tear jerkers, and many that were both.  While it was more a comedy than anything else, the back stories of the three main characters, and some of their friends, were moving, some tragic.  \\n\\n\r\nGoing through the usual review list, story, art, sound, character, is a little difficult. Most stories, even the moving arcs, taken by themselves, were no better than good.  I enjoyed the art, but there was nothing that made me say, Oh my, this is incredible.  It was good, and didn't get in the way.  The songs were good, there are some I enjoy enough to find on Youtube and listen to from time to time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where the show shines.  You care about them,  and the show manages to show you how even the nasty seeming ones have their good points.  There's the Captain, (so called because she's the captain of the female softball team), and in a few scenes, you see why everyone likes and admires her.   There's the nasty girl on the student council, who you gradually get to know, and like.  It's a large cast of characters, and eventually, you get to know and care about almost all of them.  \\n\\n\r\nI liked this enough so that when I finished the show, I went on to the manga and read it to the end.  I think the only other anime that I liked that much was Gintama.  And yes, there are similarities, but I still think it reminds me more of Buffy than anything else. \\n\\n\r\n The strongest part of this show, and the reason I give it a 10 for enjoyment, was the wide cast of characters, and how well the anime made you care about them. \\n\\n",

            "content": "SKET dance is an anime about a club whose whole purpose is to help people with their problems. It uses interesting characterization and captivating stand-alone episodes as well as arc segments to great effect.\r\nStory- 8\r\nThe \"SKET-dan\" (Support, Kindness, Encouragement, and Troubleshoot club) spends its days lounging around in the club-room, waiting for someone to knock on the door and ask for help.\r\nThe show takes an episodic, self-contained, approach to most of its episodes, which does not give it much in the way of an overarching plot. What this does add is a much needed change-of-pace each episode, as the contents are varied and never becomestale.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show decides to dig deeper, it presents us with story arcs. each arc taking a few episodes and following one plot-line in depth. Here we see the show shine, as the plot in these episodes explores the characters in various ways: back-story, relationships and so on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork in the show are quite good. With drawn out movement and exaggerated expressions, there is not one a dull moment or lapse in the quality of the animation through the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there is no moment when the animation truly takes a turn for the breathtaking. It is clean and watchable, but not amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6\\n\\n\r\nLike the art, there are no noticeable problems with the sound in the show. It lends itself solidly to the atmosphere, but there was no part in the show when I could say that I stopped and listened to a certain track or theme. It was OK, but not memorable in any specific way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show truly shines. Although the show has a very large and assorted cast of characters, the show makes a point to highlight the various quirks of each character. This in turn makes the characters so memorable that even after a character vanishes for a while I was still able to remember them on their return.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention goes to the three main characters. While at first appearing to be just quirks hiding behind the title of main character, over the course of the show they come to life before your eyes. By the end of the show, I really grew attached to them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this series was hampered slightly by the fact that I tend to have trouble coping with shows that do not have a steady plot-line. This happened 3 times over the course of the 77 episodes of SKET dance.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, every time I came back to the show, I kept wondering: why did I stop in the first place? This was a show that, despite being longer than usual and episodic, managed to welcome me back in every time I tried it again.\\n\\n\r\nBe it the characters or the story, there was something that kept pulling me back to the show. This is a show that draws you in and does its best not to let you go.",

But my attention caught the description!!!!\r\nSket Dance is totally different from what its title means. It is actually a school club whose motive is to help someone who is in trouble. Well trouble can be of any type physical mental or social!!\r\nIts like any trouble Just call \"SKET-DAN'\"!\r\nSTORY- 10\r\nWell every episode folds out a new situation new problem and our helpers will find out the best possible solution to it. Along thiswe have hilarious comments, jokes its like you will laugh out loud again and again. And the timing for a joke is just perfect (actually there are some episodes where you will laugh like crazy throughout)\\n\\n\r\nAlong with all these elements there are some Super cannon episodes which talks about the past lives of our Main Characters  and  how they come up with the idea of forming this club and there are some useless fillers with it (but the laughter element never diminishes). it is full of comedy, slice of life, brainy things, little romance and most of motivation here and there! The jokes are still as hilarious after rewatching as they were before. XD\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 9\\n\\n\r\nAlong with our main character we have numerous side characters each having unique importance impression and ability to make you laugh!!!\\n\\n\r\nBossun is the protagonist. He is a bit childish but when he becomes serious, when in focus mode he is a genius. He is multi-talented. He is good in drawing, origami and makes the most hilarious face expressions!\\n\\n\r\nHimeko is another character . She is a blonde, despite a female she is far from delicate , very strong and can pulverise anyone with her hockey stick. She has somewhat wife and mother like qualities and along with bossun form a perfect duo with their hilarious jokes!\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Switch, well this character is absolutely unique. He is handsome, tall and talks using voice of his computer!! He is good in making apt jokes at right time. He has a lot common with Bossun when it comes to toys manga and girls!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION - 8\\n\\n\r\nWell this is the only thing that i didn't like about this anime that is its average animation!! It's not that the characters are not well drawn and don't worry the animation is not like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z !. Still that won't bother you as the story is very smooth and meaningful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't remember that i laughed so much after watching an anime!!! You won't get bored even in the fillers!!! To be honest the jokes get better and better as you move on with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9\\n\\n\r\nWell to sum up I would say it is very interesting anime with loads of laughter and belly aching jokes! There is everything you want in this anime ! Comedy, Seriousness, High school life, and even good lessons to be learnt!!! :p\\n\r\nDamn can't think of witty reason to dislike it !!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\nAnimation-8\\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nCharacter Development-9\\n\r\nDialogues-10\\n\r\nEnding-9\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10000000000 XD\\n\r\nKey Episodes- 24-25,36-37,46,47-48,59,77,OVA\\n",

The  type of humor. There are many comedy anime out there trying to do what this anime did and they fail badly. What is the problem? Why do they fail? Well of-course , because they try too hard to be funny! Sket Dance does it's comedy different , the jokes are random and totally amusing as the reactions of the characters make the situation even better. You'll also see mocked cliches and manyanime references and not only. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAt first the story might seem to be episodic. As you can pretty much watch the episodes in any particular order and you won't lose too much. But don't get fooled , later on when the story starts to develop pretty much every episode is bound to the other. You could also say that every episode has it's own unique story because you're presented with all types of different cases because .. yeah they're the Helpers Club. \\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple overall. They're just spending their time in their club room doing all sorts of stuff until somebody needs their help. But it's really exciting because at some points the problems and the way they solve them is really intriguing not to mention the impact some stories in some episodes have.\\n\r\nThe story isn't unique overall but it's enjoyable because it's set differently from other anime with similar stories. It also does a good job in entertaining you a little in every episode through all the episodes. \\n\r\nThe story pacing seemed a little slow , but it isn't a bother because the episodes are pretty funny and enjoyable to watch even if they don't have a massive impact to the story, or no impact at all.\\n\r\nThe comedy of the story is totally random and whack at some points but it never failed to make me laugh. There aren't many anime out there that made me laugh as hard as Sket Dance did , that's for sure !\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty much satisfying and it didn't leave any plot holes at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good , some characters are weird but that's for the comedic taste xD. Great colors and character designs but not really unique that's why  i give it just 9. \\n\r\nThe mangaka definitely tried to achieve a comedic mood with some characters and even with the normal characters that make funny or retarded faces that totally set the mood sometimes. \\n\r\nThe art style i would say , fits perfectly with the story. The gags work well with the characters. The personalities work well with the character looks too. \\n\r\nThough the opening kinda contained little spoilers , a little example is characters that are about to appear. \\n\r\nThe animation was pretty fluid and well done , nothing bad to say about it.\\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly if the animation changed through the series, but i do have the impression that it improved a little through the series. It might be just me though.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were great , they fit the story and idea of the show perfectly.\\n\r\nSome character designs were really good and memorable for sure. After you meet those characters you'll know who am i talking about for sure. It also fit their personalities well. I actually think that the mangaka stereotyped every character's looks with the personality for the comedy part. \\n\r\nThe characters were unique between themselves with understandable exceptions. They were all easy to tell apart.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nWell damn !! The voice actors were pretty much the best for like all the characters. They voice fitted for every character and the synchronization was perfect.\\n\r\nSome of the seiyuu   had to adapt their voice to the characters. While others used pretty much their common voice which was easy to detect and recognize.\\n\r\nSome seiyuu pretty much improved their skills with the role by a little. For example Tsubaki Sasuke's seiyuu sounded a lot better in this series than the ones i checked previously. \\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is a dubbed version of the anime but in my case i saw it in Japanese so i'm not sure about other voice actors for dubs. \\n\r\nThe background music was perfectly fitting with the situations. And about the openings and endings they were totally great. I pretty much liked all of them. \\n\r\nMostly the soundtracks were doing a great job to make the scenes more entertaining. \\n\r\nI totally added some of the ost to my playlists and i listen to them from time to time just to remember the awesome scenes.\\n\r\nThe openings that did the best for me were the 1st , 3rd ,4th and 6th. Opening 2 and 5 were also good but the ones i mentioned are the ones that always come up in my mind whenever i'm thinking about Skent Dance openings.\\n\r\nThe endings were pretty much all great. I added all of them to my favorites. The one i like the least out of them is the last ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had all types of stereotypical traits like the \"blonde delinquent super bad-ass women\", \"The guy with glasses is always the smartest\" , \"The main character has multiple talents\" and so on. But don't worry , this is all a part of the gag actually. The characters are stereotypical intentionally for the comedy act/ parody.\\n\r\nThe characters react/act in most of the situation in a hilarious/ridiculous way, sometimes even unexpectedly.\\n\r\nI could relate to some traits of some characters in the series , but nothing big. Though i really enjoyed every character and every character was unique in its own way. \\n\r\nThe characters developed pretty slow in the beginning of the story but it went a lot better a little later. \\n\r\nThere weren't really characters more flashed than the others though as every character got similar number of episodes in which they appear. Well excluding the main characters of-course.\\n\r\nTsubaki Sasuke is probably a foil for Fujisaki Yusuke.\\n\r\nThere weren't any real villains in the anime. More like rivals, which kinda helped the characters to develop too. But they didn't get too much background. As for other types of bad guys and so on they were doing it for grudges or satisfaction most of the time.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was great. All supporting characters are awesome in different ways. Also they never failed to help bring the laughter. \\n\r\nThere was a narrator  at one point of the series just for a little mocking. Though no true narration through the whole series.\\n\r\nFrom time to time the characters would narrate some parts of the story.\\n\r\nThere wasn't any specific character that i would dislike, well except one .. \\n\r\nBut it would be a spoiler if i talk about it.\\n\r\nEven so the character was intentionally made to be hated in the end. Or so do i believe. \\n\r\nI'd have to say that the main characters all have wonderful and unique background stories which made them who they are in the present part of the anime. The backgrounds were so deep and unique it's the main reason i give a 10 for the characters. I will most likely remember Bossun , Switch and Himeko.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series a lot and i'm just sad there there isn't more. I'm sure everyone else would enjoy it too. Even if you don't find it funny sometimes , it is most likely enjoyable to watch anyway.\\n\r\nEven non anime/manga fans would probably have a little laugh though they would watch it only with bad thoughts i believe.\\n\r\nI probably wouldn't go through the whole anime again too soon , but i already did go through my favorite episodes few times now. I might go again through the whole thing when i have the feeling that i forgot most of the things , just so i can enjoy it as much again. Thing is that it's a comedy anime and it's not as funny if you watch it 2 times in a short amount of time , also it's time consuming because it has 77 episodes.\\n\r\nI'll definitely purchase this series in Japanese as soon as i have the money. The series is worth the money even if i wont re-watch it too soon. \\n\r\nThis is the type of series i'll have with me , in my brain and heart till i die. It was totally awesome , totally memorable and totally worth remembering.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\\n\r\nMy final mark will be 10 as i have too many good traits in this anime to love , that they nullify the bad traits (which aren't so big anyway).",

            "content": "I dunno how I should describe this anime in one word. It was a great anime and has caught my eyes.\r\n\u2022 Story\r\n  It was an average story. Just a normal school life and enjoying the life. The story is about a club that helps other people's problems. Sometimes it felt a little bit boring but at the same time interessting. In my opinion.\r\n\u2022 Art\r\n The art was OK. They didn't have so much extreme color theme and I kinda like art style. \r\n\u2022 Sound\r\n *gulp* just kidding. I didn't really focus on the sound or anything else. I just gave something so I couldjust go to the next.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character\\n\r\n Four words: Very easy to remember. Except one.LOL. \\n\r\n But the MCs are very interessting and I could keep up those new characters. They have a unique character each one of them which made me easy to remember. Plus their personality is not bad at all either. Just keep in mind that one of them is forgetable \u2022~\u2022.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment\\n\r\n Absolute. It is so good that it made me laugh about every episode. And not only that, I was not expecting those facial expression. It fits with the anime at least \u20223\u2022.\\n\\n\r\nLike/dislike: I like when it was that many episodes. Just kept me going. I dislike some of the characters. Kinda felt unnecessary. I recomend to give this show a go even if it was bad or good.",

            "content": "At first, I though Sket Dance was just a Gintama anime set in a school. It might be true and the same as in their purpose in helping people from students, teachers and even people from outside the school. \r\nThe story progress into a very good plot especially when Tsubaki (Bossun's rival from the Student COuncil) turned out to be his twin brother. I would have heard anyone from the story telling that that  they have  similarities but  it's so shocking. Hahaha. It was so different from the typical Gintama story. And the love story between Bossun and Himeko (if it reallyis), its just something I never expected from the story too no matter how close they had been.\\n\r\nOverall, I really like Sket Dance plus its soundtracks. How shocking it be for me when I discovered that the fact I can't stop listening to their first opening theme is because that Yukirin and her group from AKB is singing it. The other tracks sung by sketchbook were so good too. I actually have the playlist and listened to it every time. \\n\r\nBut I still wish that here will be a continuation. And how did Bossun met Switch? Or how did the club really started. There are just hints but I would like to know how exactly. And I's still looking forward to when the three of them finally gets to confront with their own past hat leds them to what they are now. \\n\r\nThe art is so good. I've got  a lot of crush in this anime. But of course, Bosun's my most love male character. So just have to love him. He's so like a kid you would want to take care of him. And so smart too. Ah, I love how his childishness and maturity blends so perfectly.\\n\r\nLoe. LOve. Love!\\n",
