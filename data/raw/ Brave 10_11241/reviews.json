            "content": "Well, at first sorry about my English and if there are any mistakes.\r\nBrave 10 is a ninja shounen anime about Sanada Yukimura and his ten heroes.\r\nI started to watch it becouse I like shounen, but I had not any big expectatives about it.\r\nWhen I watch the firsts episodies, I thought:\r\n-This is a fucking bishounen anime, man.\r\n-The story is pretty bad...\r\n-Why Isanami is so stupid?\r\nEtc. But I didn't drop it. Why? Well, I say to you: this anime is bad. But it's not boring. There are some bad animes that when you are watching and episode you are praying for the end. Not in Brave 10.That's a good point.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThe plot is simple and the development is very bad. All the anime Saizou is kicking asses with Isanami screaming \"HELP ME SAIZOU!\" and criying very loudly... While this they meet new characters that will be heroes too. That' s all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is good, so the fighting scenes are decent. The style is good too, but it doesn' t feel like a shounen anime (is more a choose-your-bishie style xD).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OST is good. It isn't a OST that I will listen in my MP4, but it is good to ambientation. The opening is fucking catching (xD).\\n\r\nOne of the better points of this anime is the seiyuus. There are a lot a famous seiyuus in this anime (Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, etc.) so if you want to listen your favourites seiyuus this anime is a mine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nThere are too many character for 12 episodies, and the most have no deep or development.\\n\r\nI like Sanada Yukimura and Nezu Jinpachi, but there are very bad characters. For example, Isanami is the typical Mary Sue. I prefer to not talk about Kamanosuke.\\n\r\nThe only character that has a personality development is Saizou, but it' s a veeery typical development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAs I' ve said, the enjoyment is good. I prefer the bad, simple animes that are not boring than bad, strange and stupid animes that pretend to be \"deep\" and they are only boring.\\n\r\nBrave 10 is not a masterpiece, but at least is fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nBrave 10 is a 4 anime, but I give it a 5 for the enjoyment. So, I don' t recomend this to you if you aren' t:\\n\r\n-A fangirl.\\n\r\n-A shounen/ninja anime super lover.",

            "content": "I am commenting this as a person who expected a Sengoku Basara/Historical Seinen anime out of this and not a romance-themed one. Just so you know. This is also why I decided to write a review, since I don't do that much... I just thought people should have my two cents on this as  someone who is not interested in the anime at all, but will see it in its entirety.\r\nPathetic. That was the word I was looking for my review's main theme. I am very thankful to MAL for putting it as the 1's title. If you're looking for a seinen, historical, samurai/ninjaanime with a lot of battles - this is not for you. It's pure shoujo (otome games type) in my eyes (I watch the aforementioned genres a lot).\\n\\n\r\nFollowing MAL's list of characteristics, I will try to be as informative as possible:\\n\\n\r\nStory: there is a story line, yes. But it is so fragile and broken that it makes no sense at all. Yes, it is normal for a 12-episode anime to lack in this field, but this is absurd. There is a the main story of Izanami and her temple, which gets forgotten near the middle of the series. The second plot-line we follow is one we don't know about until the middle of the series - the Unity of the 10, that Sanada Yukimura-sama explains near the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I agree, it has good artwork and the movements of the character sis nicely done. Background are excellent and where the staff wanted us to believe something, we would, if it weren't for the squeaky little shoujo (Izanami)\\n\\n\r\nSound: What? It had music? Really? I don't think so or even if it did - I can't even point a single moment I have heard it. That, I think, tells you a lot about how 'well' it is chosen and performed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: this is where I am stricken with a high fever. What characters and what development? We watch tons of people who we don't know anything about. I couldn't feel for any of the characters since the very beginning and up until now (I have seen all 11 episodes for now and will finish the anime till the end). We don't know anything about side-charatcers such as Date Masamune even. I mean, okay, you're telling a story of the Sengoku and we are supposed to know what it's about... or are we? I began loving historical anime because of the Shinsengumi and Sengoku characters in other anime and I am grateful for them, but this one would've made me sick to the stomach from the period if it was my first.The only character who is developed during the series is Izanami, the priestess/diety, who is the only character I couldn't care less about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: An advice for the fans of Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing and more similar anime: This is as shoujo as the Sengoku can Get. We have the priestess wimpy kid who is talking all  about how Saizou is her love, her light and her blah-blah, she is even aided by the plot and other characters (which is probably more agitating than her own reactions). She is always there when the main male character fights and it drives me crazy. Just when I get to see some action (2 times with Hattori Hanzo and Saizou)she interrupts it with her crying moe eyes and her squeaks of displeasure \"Saizou, leave me! Run away!\" I don't know how many such characters you've seen, but I am feeling a gutty feeling it is not much since it just doesn't quite suit the genre of the Sengoku... Actually, it can be funny, yes, but it is not regarded as such, it is the main story line and she is a the main character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're expecting an anime that would feel like  Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing or another such one, don't see this. It reminds me more of Neo Angelique Abyss,  and Hakuouki (though even Hakuouki is better, but I have another story with it - watched only the first season, so don't mark my words as much).\\n",

            "content": "Obviously I loved the feudal Japan background. The fights are not stretched forever, usually 1 or 2 episodes max. These are necessary to advance the story. The plot is fairly predictable and shallow: faction conspiracies, good vs evil, resolving matters by fighting your way through, brotherhood, etc. \nThe first episode is actually one of my favorite and I do believe the story should have followed a bit more its spirit. For instance, Saizou's skills and unwillingful attitude were worthwhile and promising but the feeling fades away as the story goes on and he gradually becomes next to useless.  Basically, he's super strong against hiscomrades before they join in the Braves and also against the general cannon fodder type ninjas but that's another story with the enemy main characters.  It's a pain when you see a main character show off so much for lesser results. \\n\\n\nI also understand that they needed to make time to introduce the other characters since the story goal was to revolve around 10 braves fighting together.  They should have appeared way faster. For example, Jinpachi Nezu appears at episode 8 or 9 I believe.. wait! what? But there is only 4 episodes left!\\n\\n\\n\nStory: 6 - Fair : it's pretty much what you expect from a ninja combat based anime. As described above, nothing more or less.  The ending comes way too abruptly in my opinion. Its has if they wanted to get it done and go onto the next project.\\n\\n\nArt: 8 - Very Good:  I liked the style, nothing epic. Enough said.\\n\\n\nSound: 7 - Good: I enjoyed the opening, mostly skipped the ending. The overall BGM during specific events and encounters were adequate and matched the anime theme.\\n\\n\nCharacters: 5 - Mediocre:  I was expecting more, sadly didn't get it. The character development is typical and very basic. You will find some flashbacks about Saizou, Isanami, Anastasia, Miyoshiseikei to add extra understanding of the storyline. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 7 - Good: Even if the story and characters weren't flawless, I had a good time watching it. \\n\\n\nOverall: 7 - Good:    It's definitely an anime to watch if you like combat-oriented storylines and a nice addition to the ninja theme. It's nothing epic but definitely entertaining. I would definitely watch it again if I eventually get bored and don't have anything better to do.\\n\\n\nExtra comments:  \\n\\n\nI would have enjoyed seeing a serie of 25-26 episodes out of it. Simply to extend the story and introduce deeper content, elaborate on characters, get Saizou to finally kick those bad guys' ass properly, see Isanami get abusively destructive with her power and also to get a decent fight done between Kamanosuke the psychotic warmonger and Saizou. It would have contributed greatly to a longer and better ending.",

            "content": "Saizo is an assassin who runs into a young girl by the name of Isanami. Her bubbly personality along with her cute charm annoys him simply because he's always been under the impression protecting someone will weaken his fighting ability. She also annoys him by doing things like crawling in bed with him and tripping over things. This honestly would be considered an endearing part to Isanami's character if she were five to six years of age, but instead it becomes part of the annoyance that occurs to the watcher of this Anime because Isanami is actually a lot older then this, old enough tobe in a romantic relationship with most of the male characters of Brave 10.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this Isanami is a Mary Sue. The easiest traits that can be found are the fact she has godlike powers and the fact everybody likes her and wants her including the enemies. On top of the fact she can't get on anyone's bad side, she also has no fatal flaws. She is shown to be clumsy, but that only crops up when it can land her in the guys arms. The Anime talks about how she's always causing trouble but in reality she isn't causing the trouble because of her actions, the trouble occurs because everybody wants her. She also angst horribly over how she is weak, but it is revealed early on in the series that she has the strongest power of anybody. Might I add the fact she is supposed to be naive about the world, but it comes across more along the lines of her being mentally handicapped. I doubt that is what the creator of her character intended.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I stuck with the Anime is because despite the fact Isanami is so obnoxious most of the good guys from Brave 10 are actually interesting characters. The exception to the rule is the wind user. Despite the fact he is obnoxious, he at least isn't a Gary Stu. Despite the fact the other characters are interesting, their characterization and character development tends to fall apart when Isanami is around. Which adds to another Mary Sue trait about her, the fact none of the main good guys don' always act like themselves around her.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the art work, I have to say the art work in Brave 10 is horrible. The character designs are clumsy and chunky in places most of the characters shouldn't be chunky. The movement of the characters lacks any dynamic and is stiff. As for the elemental powers that the braves use, they don't really mimic well the traits that go with their elements and they look unrealistic. This I think extends to the bad buys. Some people might say right about here, but the art work is beautifully designed and the costumes are elaborate. Unfortunately, about half way through the show, I realized that the reason all the outfits were intricately designed is to actually hide the flaws in the character design. And might I add that some of the flaws are glaring. I remember one scene where Benmaru is a head taller then he should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also something that is very beautiful. However, the music doesn't match the storyline of the Anime at all, which ruins the wonderful opening and closing scenes. Actually, these scenes also have the best animation. The sad thing about Brave 10 was I had high expectations of the show and expected to enjoy a nice historical fantasy. Instead I ended up with a bunch of pretty boy wish fulfillment and the reasons I enjoyed the Anime wasn't because it was amazing. It was because it was so badly done, it was laughable.",

I find this Anime rather good but it does have some flaws, If you are looking for a quick Anime to kill some time or get rid of boredom then I say you should watch it. The story gets straight to the point and doesn't drag on like most Anime's do.. There isa lot of fighting which is pretty awesome aswell. I would have rated it higher than a 7 but the story is rather short and it would be much better if they did have more episodes, But that is just my opinion.. Thanks for reading :)",

They meet other assassins and ninja's along the way, things happening, people fight(obviously).\r\nThe story itself seemed to have some potential throughout the first episode at least, but then I just felt like everything was going downhill.\r\nPersonally, I don't feel like the creators put much work into the story at all, as everything feels like something they had to rush through in order to make it into the 12 episodes nowavailable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's a style I don't really mind, it's smooth and well made.\\n\\n\r\nSound: same. As long as you find a decent version either online or through fansubs, the audio is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: now, I just wanna say that random is random. The main leads had something to offer, or at least I felt like they had at first. If you are a fan of a group of \"originals\" gathering, each who feel like they almost radiate stupidity, then this is most likely something you would enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I finished this series in 2 days, just so I could be done with it. I don't like skipping a series unless it is really, really bad, and this wasn't the worst I've seen.\\n\r\nThe plot had potential, the characters looked interesting, and every episode keeps you on a cliffhanger until the next episode, making you wanna see what happens next. Even so, the whole concept is something we've all seen so many times before. \\n\r\nHidden powers, betrayal, and OP villains, you've all been there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I found it to be a \"ok\" show. There was nothing extraordinary about it which made it stand out. I do hope for a 2nd season however, in hope for some character development etc.\\n",

But after watching some samurai anime and began craving some completed anime with action, I had nowhere else to turn to except Brave 10 and man, it was my saving grace!\r\nBrave 10 is ENTERTAINING! I believe thats what the creators intended and thats what was delivered. Just some good ol' entertainment. It was like being able to sit back on a saturday morning as a kid to watch a favorite cartoon marathon on cartoonnetwork while eating english breakfast or something. \r\nStory.\r\nThe story is a mix of same old (i.e if you'vewatched a lot of anime) with new or intelligent delivery. Strong samurai meets priestess being chased and saves her from her pursuers. Priestess then grows attached to him and decides to stick to him for protection. But its just delivered to the audience in an interesting way that you'll probably watch the series to the end. The one problem I had with this anime is that it was a bit rushed to an annoying point but not too annoying. As the story progresses you'll definitely notice that they tried to cram a lot of stuff into some episodes. I guess its because its a 12 episode anime but they really should have made it longer so things progressed more naturally.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art was great! Nothing new though but certainly not  bad. Where the art really shone was in the cool battles. \\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nNothing memorable but no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nCharacters are same old too if you've ever watched a similar type historical anime but they're still interesting and entertaining. I guess if the formula still works there's no need to change it right? But personally I found the priestess a bit annoying though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI was entertained and so Im thankful to the creators for making this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is an 8. Hope you give it a try and thanks for reading! :]",

The girl is some sort of priestess that possesses great power, but it is only hinted at the entire time, and finally revealed in the most anticlimactic scene at the end of the show.\r\nThe whole point is that whoever controls this power controls the world, so you already know that people will come after her, so to protect her, 10 \"brave\" warriors that represent the elements have to be found and persuaded toform a team.\\n\r\nThe characters aren't anything special, each one has a specific skill and they all vary in shape and size. The only interesting character is the protagonist, which receives almost no character development. Same goes for every other character.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, not horrible, but you won't remember it. Voice acting is fine, but it is also not memorable.\\n\r\nIn the end this anime has so many flaws that it really takes you away from it. Story is boring, characters are boring, and the main \"antagonist team\" was only introduced in the final episodes, so they just came out of nowhere, join that with the most anticlimactic transformation/reveal and the forced romance and you are left with a pretty crappy anime",

            "content": "So I just yesterday finished watching Brave10 and my expectations were really high but did this anime were that good?\r\nStory: It's a story about old samurai named Saizou he's samurai that don't want to serve any lords and want to just live own way. One day old guy named Yukimura offers deal that is Saizou would protect him and would be accompanying him in travels. There is also mysterious girl who is important to many people.\r\nThis story is really interesting and it also tells some old interesting facts about samurai's.\r\nSo story gets 9/10\r\nArt: It was really great kind of samurai type art. But weapons weredesigned really well and special attacks were awesome. Places looked really historically old and it seemed to fit in anime. Animation was also really good and battle scenes were great.\\n\\n\r\nArt gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Anime OP song was really good and it starts first in slow and then quickly change speed. Kind of interesting way they went in this opening.\\n\r\nED song is also really good. It fast phased song and promo pics in ending are fit in right places in OP if I should say which one would be better I would say Ending song.\\n\\n\r\nThen again voices in this anime are really unique like sword battle music and enemy appearing themes are really put in good places in anime. Then again it seemed anime did not have so many music themes and they played OP and ED theme.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are too many characters to speak about in this anime. But I am going to speak about Saizou and Yukimura.\\n\\n\r\nSaizou: He seemed really not care stuff liking guy first but Saizou is really getting developed in last episodes of anime. Saizou really doesn't care about women or sake but always irritating others to fight.\\n\\n\r\nYukimura: He is very funny old man he doesn't really like to fight with others and he hates dark powers but he really doesn\u2019t want anyone to get the power for themselves. Yukimura also like to dance with opponents and he would dance them than fight them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed every scene in this anime an there was no boring scene at all which was really suprising. One of the scenes definitely were funny was this other guy who challenged Yukimura to fight with him and Yukimura fight without his sword and finally fall ground and  with his one hand throws a  this guy's sword in the air.\\n\\n\r\nSince this were enjoyable anime it gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Samurai stylish anime with humor and some cool fights in it great scenes and emotions packed with a lot of history explanations. This anime really deliver inexperienced samurai experience to viewers and it does it one of the unique ways. This is really one of the best Samurai anime there is now and I hope to see great series like this one.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall score for this awesome anime is 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story is one of the main factors that kept me watching the anime;\r\n- Great art: Personally, I consider the art can decide whether an anime is great or not. Fortunately, the art of this anime is great;\r\n- Exciting action scenes: Looking for a action-filled anime? Brave 10 is for you! There is at least one tense fight or chasing scene in each episode that isguaranteed to keep you watching. The even better part is that the gore is not exaggerated, so you can say the fights are somewhat realistic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's pass to the more unfortunate parts of the anime:\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n- Poor character development: Except the main characters, you don't really get much back-story for the characters. Not only that, some of the characters have poorly-developed personalities that I cringed in pain when saw them. This is kind of unfortunate, since a decent character development could have made the anime much better;\\n\\n\r\n- Rushed story: With only 12 episodes, you can tell that the story is kind of rushed. The action happens really fast, and you don't even have the time to process all the action happening that the characters already did something else important in the storyline. This is another unfortunate part of the anime that could have made it much better;\\n\\n\r\n- Crappy jokes: The anime has a few comedy scenes, and even those few comedy scenes were bad because of the character development. But, this is not really that big of a con, since the comedy scenes are 1-2 minutes long, and if you can \"go with the flow\", then you won't have any problem.\\n\\n\r\nRATING: 7.5\\n\r\nOVERALL: Brave 10 is a decent anime. If you are looking for a great story, for good battle scenes and for good art, then you can watch this anime. If you can pass over the lack of storyline and the rushed story, then this is actually quite a good anime.",

Although it's an interesting twist, it doesn't deliver much in actual story; however if the story were to continue beyond the current episodes expected to air there is ample room for improvement. Personally, I love the artwork. Lines are crisp and clean, plus the color palette offers plenty of visual flair. Battles are short, too short in my opinion, and the main protagonist is made out to be some sort of bad ass warrior but is continually getting his butt handed to him. (Not a good sign)\r\nOverall, thestory just seems too rushed and not completely thought through on many elements. It's a decent watch but don't get your hopes up on being a spectacular anime...at least not yet. The ending could be rather epic...maybe.",

There were one or two characters I liked. Honestly I expected much more action and good fight sequences. But it seemed as if the fights were mediocre and were there just to help move the story along. \r\nA tad too much of twists, with the plot already being convoluted as it is. The animation was good though, and was quite colourful. \r\nThe climax was meh and the ending was weak and confusing as well. If you're goingfor story along, I'd say don't. But if you just want an enjoyable anime with some funny moments, this is fine.",

            "content": "I was honestly excited when reading about this feudal-timed Anime, hoping it would star many of those Sengoku Heroes that are often praised in games like Samurai Warriors. Unfortunately in the kind you see in Brave 10, it doesnt do a very good job.\r\nHello, My Name is Ryoki and Welcome to my review of the Anime Brave 10. The review contains spoilers. If you dont like spoilers at all, please scroll away.\r\nThe scenery is settled in feudal japan, those of you who play or remember playing samurai warriors may be a little bit more familiar with this times. The anime practically throws you into anburning temple where you see a blue haired woman and a priest escape, then as they were stopped and attacked by the enemy - the priest then lets her escape once more through a trapdoor. This was a little bit confusing to myself as i had at least expected an considerable intro. But nonetheless the scene jumps further where you face our main male lead , Saizou Kirigakure.\\n\\n\r\nHe is suprised by seeing the woman in the woods and doesnt want to protect her, yet still does it when facing immediate danger, which is her pursuers. The girl insist him to go with her to the nearby Ueda Castle , where the famous Yukimura Sanada should live. Later then she tells him her Name, which would be Isanami and tells him nothing before their journey goes on to Ueda Castle.\\n\r\nOnce there, Yukimura decides to make them believe that he isnt interested in protecting them and when they were attacked at the way back - a mysterious orb began to expand from the girls' head. Yukimura sees the potential and decides to let them stay. \\n\\n\r\nAs I already said Saizou Kirigakure is our male lead , he is a young shinobi that is mostly known for his cold attitude and also because he refuses to serve anyone. You dont get to know much more about him as the anime tries to cramp in as much as it can from the manga.\\n\r\nIsanami on the other hand is our typical Damsel in Distress, sad/happy female lead. She is a priestess that lived in Izumo before a certain group of ninjas attacked and slaughtered everyone besides her. The twist with her is that she is the reincarnation of the death goddess and is only held back by her hairpin that was blessed by the gods. She pretty much is a big key point during the whole anime as they try to protect her from being taken away and to make her happy as strangely the trigger to summoning the darkness is - for her to be sad. This is something that you might like or not, that is to be left with you.\\n\r\nAlso if you dont like obvious stereotypical character, then this anime is definetly not for you. There is no clever packed in twist and you will be able to distinguish them from a mile away like ; ,,That's the bad guy!'' ,,That's the clumsy but too earnest guy.'' ,, That's the blood hungry guy.''\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is quite good, nothing that would be overestimatingly awesome, but the animation is fitting and sometimes, especially hard with a dancing scene for example (compare Isanamis graceful dance with the cg robot in blade and soul animation, it is quite opionated which one would fit better i think.) The fighting scenes are also very plain animated, dont understand me wrong - it is certainly well done but also here not exceptional. Unfortunately the sound cant keep much up as well, i have the opinion that if a fight comes up , you really have to feal tension - you have to feel epicness, you have to feel tension - that doesnt mean it has to be rock or a certain kind of genre - but something that keeps the viewers atention on the moves.  Unfortunately the op, is something that I wouldnt recommend anyone, maybe fitting to ninja movies but it sounds very annoying to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow then based on my personal opinion on story, arstyle, sound and characters and naturall also enjoyment - i issue Brave 10 a : 6 \\n\\n\r\nStream it, if you want to explore this certain universe. At the moment of this review Brave 10 wasn't yet licensed and thus isn't dubbed into english yet. So you will have to deal with subbed episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review could help you deciding if you want to take a look at Brave 10. See you next time.",

It's strange when you find an anime that is lacking in the most important areas but you still enjoy it regardless. That would be Brave 10 in a nutshell.\r\nThe story is too short and underdeveloped. The artwork is good but it is nothing special. The sound wasn't bad but there was nothing special about it either. Even most of the characters were underdeveloped.\r\nThankfully a couple main characters were developed pretty well, and with a good mix oflight comedy and decent action this really somehow worked in a weird sort of way. The characters were drowning in anime stereotypes, but the voice acting and the chemistry between the group were fun to follow. Scenes were rushed and dialogue was lacking, but it didn't bother me at all. I was entertained through all 12 episodes. That's all you can ever really hope for when dedicating time to a series.\\n\\n\r\nThat all aside, you can tell that this should have been great, but it was just good. Thankfully it's based on a manga series, so this anime has done it's job with me since I'll be reading that next.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't care about story (there is one, and it is just simply ok), and you want to see something that's a little fun, then this is worth a look. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's entertaining.",

            "content": "Well, at first sorry about my English and if there are any mistakes.\r\nBrave 10 is a ninja shounen anime about Sanada Yukimura and his ten heroes.\r\nI started to watch it becouse I like shounen, but I had not any big expectatives about it.\r\nWhen I watch the firsts episodies, I thought:\r\n-This is a fucking bishounen anime, man.\r\n-The story is pretty bad...\r\n-Why Isanami is so stupid?\r\nEtc. But I didn't drop it. Why? Well, I say to you: this anime is bad. But it's not boring. There are some bad animes that when you are watching and episode you are praying for the end. Not in Brave 10.That's a good point.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThe plot is simple and the development is very bad. All the anime Saizou is kicking asses with Isanami screaming \"HELP ME SAIZOU!\" and criying very loudly... While this they meet new characters that will be heroes too. That' s all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is good, so the fighting scenes are decent. The style is good too, but it doesn' t feel like a shounen anime (is more a choose-your-bishie style xD).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OST is good. It isn't a OST that I will listen in my MP4, but it is good to ambientation. The opening is fucking catching (xD).\\n\r\nOne of the better points of this anime is the seiyuus. There are a lot a famous seiyuus in this anime (Ono Daisuke, Kamiya Hiroshi, etc.) so if you want to listen your favourites seiyuus this anime is a mine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nThere are too many character for 12 episodies, and the most have no deep or development.\\n\r\nI like Sanada Yukimura and Nezu Jinpachi, but there are very bad characters. For example, Isanami is the typical Mary Sue. I prefer to not talk about Kamanosuke.\\n\r\nThe only character that has a personality development is Saizou, but it' s a veeery typical development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAs I' ve said, the enjoyment is good. I prefer the bad, simple animes that are not boring than bad, strange and stupid animes that pretend to be \"deep\" and they are only boring.\\n\r\nBrave 10 is not a masterpiece, but at least is fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nBrave 10 is a 4 anime, but I give it a 5 for the enjoyment. So, I don' t recomend this to you if you aren' t:\\n\r\n-A fangirl.\\n\r\n-A shounen/ninja anime super lover.",

            "content": "I am commenting this as a person who expected a Sengoku Basara/Historical Seinen anime out of this and not a romance-themed one. Just so you know. This is also why I decided to write a review, since I don't do that much... I just thought people should have my two cents on this as  someone who is not interested in the anime at all, but will see it in its entirety.\r\nPathetic. That was the word I was looking for my review's main theme. I am very thankful to MAL for putting it as the 1's title. If you're looking for a seinen, historical, samurai/ninjaanime with a lot of battles - this is not for you. It's pure shoujo (otome games type) in my eyes (I watch the aforementioned genres a lot).\\n\\n\r\nFollowing MAL's list of characteristics, I will try to be as informative as possible:\\n\\n\r\nStory: there is a story line, yes. But it is so fragile and broken that it makes no sense at all. Yes, it is normal for a 12-episode anime to lack in this field, but this is absurd. There is a the main story of Izanami and her temple, which gets forgotten near the middle of the series. The second plot-line we follow is one we don't know about until the middle of the series - the Unity of the 10, that Sanada Yukimura-sama explains near the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I agree, it has good artwork and the movements of the character sis nicely done. Background are excellent and where the staff wanted us to believe something, we would, if it weren't for the squeaky little shoujo (Izanami)\\n\\n\r\nSound: What? It had music? Really? I don't think so or even if it did - I can't even point a single moment I have heard it. That, I think, tells you a lot about how 'well' it is chosen and performed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: this is where I am stricken with a high fever. What characters and what development? We watch tons of people who we don't know anything about. I couldn't feel for any of the characters since the very beginning and up until now (I have seen all 11 episodes for now and will finish the anime till the end). We don't know anything about side-charatcers such as Date Masamune even. I mean, okay, you're telling a story of the Sengoku and we are supposed to know what it's about... or are we? I began loving historical anime because of the Shinsengumi and Sengoku characters in other anime and I am grateful for them, but this one would've made me sick to the stomach from the period if it was my first.The only character who is developed during the series is Izanami, the priestess/diety, who is the only character I couldn't care less about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: An advice for the fans of Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing and more similar anime: This is as shoujo as the Sengoku can Get. We have the priestess wimpy kid who is talking all  about how Saizou is her love, her light and her blah-blah, she is even aided by the plot and other characters (which is probably more agitating than her own reactions). She is always there when the main male character fights and it drives me crazy. Just when I get to see some action (2 times with Hattori Hanzo and Saizou)she interrupts it with her crying moe eyes and her squeaks of displeasure \"Saizou, leave me! Run away!\" I don't know how many such characters you've seen, but I am feeling a gutty feeling it is not much since it just doesn't quite suit the genre of the Sengoku... Actually, it can be funny, yes, but it is not regarded as such, it is the main story line and she is a the main character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're expecting an anime that would feel like  Sengoku Basara, Peacemaker Kurogane, Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, Sword of the Stranger, Hellsing or another such one, don't see this. It reminds me more of Neo Angelique Abyss,  and Hakuouki (though even Hakuouki is better, but I have another story with it - watched only the first season, so don't mark my words as much).\\n",

            "content": "Obviously I loved the feudal Japan background. The fights are not stretched forever, usually 1 or 2 episodes max. These are necessary to advance the story. The plot is fairly predictable and shallow: faction conspiracies, good vs evil, resolving matters by fighting your way through, brotherhood, etc. \nThe first episode is actually one of my favorite and I do believe the story should have followed a bit more its spirit. For instance, Saizou's skills and unwillingful attitude were worthwhile and promising but the feeling fades away as the story goes on and he gradually becomes next to useless.  Basically, he's super strong against hiscomrades before they join in the Braves and also against the general cannon fodder type ninjas but that's another story with the enemy main characters.  It's a pain when you see a main character show off so much for lesser results. \\n\\n\nI also understand that they needed to make time to introduce the other characters since the story goal was to revolve around 10 braves fighting together.  They should have appeared way faster. For example, Jinpachi Nezu appears at episode 8 or 9 I believe.. wait! what? But there is only 4 episodes left!\\n\\n\\n\nStory: 6 - Fair : it's pretty much what you expect from a ninja combat based anime. As described above, nothing more or less.  The ending comes way too abruptly in my opinion. Its has if they wanted to get it done and go onto the next project.\\n\\n\nArt: 8 - Very Good:  I liked the style, nothing epic. Enough said.\\n\\n\nSound: 7 - Good: I enjoyed the opening, mostly skipped the ending. The overall BGM during specific events and encounters were adequate and matched the anime theme.\\n\\n\nCharacters: 5 - Mediocre:  I was expecting more, sadly didn't get it. The character development is typical and very basic. You will find some flashbacks about Saizou, Isanami, Anastasia, Miyoshiseikei to add extra understanding of the storyline. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 7 - Good: Even if the story and characters weren't flawless, I had a good time watching it. \\n\\n\nOverall: 7 - Good:    It's definitely an anime to watch if you like combat-oriented storylines and a nice addition to the ninja theme. It's nothing epic but definitely entertaining. I would definitely watch it again if I eventually get bored and don't have anything better to do.\\n\\n\nExtra comments:  \\n\\n\nI would have enjoyed seeing a serie of 25-26 episodes out of it. Simply to extend the story and introduce deeper content, elaborate on characters, get Saizou to finally kick those bad guys' ass properly, see Isanami get abusively destructive with her power and also to get a decent fight done between Kamanosuke the psychotic warmonger and Saizou. It would have contributed greatly to a longer and better ending.",

This retarded overused story is what little children can make up. \"Bunch of ninja good guys with powers team up and fight bad guys\" OH DAMN, NEVER DID I THINK OF THAT! How the helldid this become an anime anyways?\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is normal, not like it matters that much.

In the show's second half, more and more supporting characters got crowded in, the main couple's focus became fuzzy and the story started to drift around and lose its purpose and became less interesting. \nLooking back on the show as a whole there was a story they wanted to convey and I can understand it and its emotional core, but it's too bad the later episodes weren't written as well as the foremost. \nI love the main couple'sart and design, animation started out good bet went downhill later.",

            "content": "Saizo is an assassin who runs into a young girl by the name of Isanami. Her bubbly personality along with her cute charm annoys him simply because he's always been under the impression protecting someone will weaken his fighting ability. She also annoys him by doing things like crawling in bed with him and tripping over things. This honestly would be considered an endearing part to Isanami's character if she were five to six years of age, but instead it becomes part of the annoyance that occurs to the watcher of this Anime because Isanami is actually a lot older then this, old enough tobe in a romantic relationship with most of the male characters of Brave 10.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this Isanami is a Mary Sue. The easiest traits that can be found are the fact she has godlike powers and the fact everybody likes her and wants her including the enemies. On top of the fact she can't get on anyone's bad side, she also has no fatal flaws. She is shown to be clumsy, but that only crops up when it can land her in the guys arms. The Anime talks about how she's always causing trouble but in reality she isn't causing the trouble because of her actions, the trouble occurs because everybody wants her. She also angst horribly over how she is weak, but it is revealed early on in the series that she has the strongest power of anybody. Might I add the fact she is supposed to be naive about the world, but it comes across more along the lines of her being mentally handicapped. I doubt that is what the creator of her character intended.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I stuck with the Anime is because despite the fact Isanami is so obnoxious most of the good guys from Brave 10 are actually interesting characters. The exception to the rule is the wind user. Despite the fact he is obnoxious, he at least isn't a Gary Stu. Despite the fact the other characters are interesting, their characterization and character development tends to fall apart when Isanami is around. Which adds to another Mary Sue trait about her, the fact none of the main good guys don' always act like themselves around her.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the art work, I have to say the art work in Brave 10 is horrible. The character designs are clumsy and chunky in places most of the characters shouldn't be chunky. The movement of the characters lacks any dynamic and is stiff. As for the elemental powers that the braves use, they don't really mimic well the traits that go with their elements and they look unrealistic. This I think extends to the bad buys. Some people might say right about here, but the art work is beautifully designed and the costumes are elaborate. Unfortunately, about half way through the show, I realized that the reason all the outfits were intricately designed is to actually hide the flaws in the character design. And might I add that some of the flaws are glaring. I remember one scene where Benmaru is a head taller then he should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also something that is very beautiful. However, the music doesn't match the storyline of the Anime at all, which ruins the wonderful opening and closing scenes. Actually, these scenes also have the best animation. The sad thing about Brave 10 was I had high expectations of the show and expected to enjoy a nice historical fantasy. Instead I ended up with a bunch of pretty boy wish fulfillment and the reasons I enjoyed the Anime wasn't because it was amazing. It was because it was so badly done, it was laughable.",

I find this Anime rather good but it does have some flaws, If you are looking for a quick Anime to kill some time or get rid of boredom then I say you should watch it. The story gets straight to the point and doesn't drag on like most Anime's do.. There isa lot of fighting which is pretty awesome aswell. I would have rated it higher than a 7 but the story is rather short and it would be much better if they did have more episodes, But that is just my opinion.. Thanks for reading :)",

They meet other assassins and ninja's along the way, things happening, people fight(obviously).\r\nThe story itself seemed to have some potential throughout the first episode at least, but then I just felt like everything was going downhill.\r\nPersonally, I don't feel like the creators put much work into the story at all, as everything feels like something they had to rush through in order to make it into the 12 episodes nowavailable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's a style I don't really mind, it's smooth and well made.\\n\\n\r\nSound: same. As long as you find a decent version either online or through fansubs, the audio is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: now, I just wanna say that random is random. The main leads had something to offer, or at least I felt like they had at first. If you are a fan of a group of \"originals\" gathering, each who feel like they almost radiate stupidity, then this is most likely something you would enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I finished this series in 2 days, just so I could be done with it. I don't like skipping a series unless it is really, really bad, and this wasn't the worst I've seen.\\n\r\nThe plot had potential, the characters looked interesting, and every episode keeps you on a cliffhanger until the next episode, making you wanna see what happens next. Even so, the whole concept is something we've all seen so many times before. \\n\r\nHidden powers, betrayal, and OP villains, you've all been there. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I found it to be a \"ok\" show. There was nothing extraordinary about it which made it stand out. I do hope for a 2nd season however, in hope for some character development etc.\\n",

But after watching some samurai anime and began craving some completed anime with action, I had nowhere else to turn to except Brave 10 and man, it was my saving grace!\r\nBrave 10 is ENTERTAINING! I believe thats what the creators intended and thats what was delivered. Just some good ol' entertainment. It was like being able to sit back on a saturday morning as a kid to watch a favorite cartoon marathon on cartoonnetwork while eating english breakfast or something. \r\nStory.\r\nThe story is a mix of same old (i.e if you'vewatched a lot of anime) with new or intelligent delivery. Strong samurai meets priestess being chased and saves her from her pursuers. Priestess then grows attached to him and decides to stick to him for protection. But its just delivered to the audience in an interesting way that you'll probably watch the series to the end. The one problem I had with this anime is that it was a bit rushed to an annoying point but not too annoying. As the story progresses you'll definitely notice that they tried to cram a lot of stuff into some episodes. I guess its because its a 12 episode anime but they really should have made it longer so things progressed more naturally.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art was great! Nothing new though but certainly not  bad. Where the art really shone was in the cool battles. \\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nNothing memorable but no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nCharacters are same old too if you've ever watched a similar type historical anime but they're still interesting and entertaining. I guess if the formula still works there's no need to change it right? But personally I found the priestess a bit annoying though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI was entertained and so Im thankful to the creators for making this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is an 8. Hope you give it a try and thanks for reading! :]",

The only interesting character is the protagonist, which receives almost no character development. Same goes for every other character.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, not horrible, but you won't remember it. Voice acting is fine, but it is also not memorable.\\n\r\nIn the end this anime has so many flaws that it really takes you away from it.

            "content": "So I just yesterday finished watching Brave10 and my expectations were really high but did this anime were that good?\r\nStory: It's a story about old samurai named Saizou he's samurai that don't want to serve any lords and want to just live own way. One day old guy named Yukimura offers deal that is Saizou would protect him and would be accompanying him in travels. There is also mysterious girl who is important to many people.\r\nThis story is really interesting and it also tells some old interesting facts about samurai's.\r\nSo story gets 9/10\r\nArt: It was really great kind of samurai type art. But weapons weredesigned really well and special attacks were awesome. Places looked really historically old and it seemed to fit in anime. Animation was also really good and battle scenes were great.\\n\\n\r\nArt gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Anime OP song was really good and it starts first in slow and then quickly change speed. Kind of interesting way they went in this opening.\\n\r\nED song is also really good. It fast phased song and promo pics in ending are fit in right places in OP if I should say which one would be better I would say Ending song.\\n\\n\r\nThen again voices in this anime are really unique like sword battle music and enemy appearing themes are really put in good places in anime. Then again it seemed anime did not have so many music themes and they played OP and ED theme.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are too many characters to speak about in this anime. But I am going to speak about Saizou and Yukimura.\\n\\n\r\nSaizou: He seemed really not care stuff liking guy first but Saizou is really getting developed in last episodes of anime. Saizou really doesn't care about women or sake but always irritating others to fight.\\n\\n\r\nYukimura: He is very funny old man he doesn't really like to fight with others and he hates dark powers but he really doesn\u2019t want anyone to get the power for themselves. Yukimura also like to dance with opponents and he would dance them than fight them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed every scene in this anime an there was no boring scene at all which was really suprising. One of the scenes definitely were funny was this other guy who challenged Yukimura to fight with him and Yukimura fight without his sword and finally fall ground and  with his one hand throws a  this guy's sword in the air.\\n\\n\r\nSince this were enjoyable anime it gets 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Samurai stylish anime with humor and some cool fights in it great scenes and emotions packed with a lot of history explanations. This anime really deliver inexperienced samurai experience to viewers and it does it one of the unique ways. This is really one of the best Samurai anime there is now and I hope to see great series like this one.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall score for this awesome anime is 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Brave 10 is a decent anime.\r\nPROS:\r\n- Outstanding storyline: I don't know about you, but, to me, the story of a merciless ninja who escorts a priestess who has a rune that can annihilate anything around feudal Japan is awesome. The story is one of the main factors that kept me watching the anime;\r\n- Great art: Personally, I consider the art can decide whether an anime is great or not. Fortunately, the art of this anime is great;\r\n- Exciting action scenes: Looking for a action-filled anime? Brave 10 is for you! There is at least one tense fight or chasing scene in each episode that isguaranteed to keep you watching. The even better part is that the gore is not exaggerated, so you can say the fights are somewhat realistic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's pass to the more unfortunate parts of the anime:\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n- Poor character development: Except the main characters, you don't really get much back-story for the characters. Not only that, some of the characters have poorly-developed personalities that I cringed in pain when saw them. This is kind of unfortunate, since a decent character development could have made the anime much better;\\n\\n\r\n- Rushed story: With only 12 episodes, you can tell that the story is kind of rushed. The action happens really fast, and you don't even have the time to process all the action happening that the characters already did something else important in the storyline. This is another unfortunate part of the anime that could have made it much better;\\n\\n\r\n- Crappy jokes: The anime has a few comedy scenes, and even those few comedy scenes were bad because of the character development. But, this is not really that big of a con, since the comedy scenes are 1-2 minutes long, and if you can \"go with the flow\", then you won't have any problem.\\n\\n\r\nRATING: 7.5\\n\r\nOVERALL: Brave 10 is a decent anime. If you are looking for a great story, for good battle scenes and for good art, then you can watch this anime. If you can pass over the lack of storyline and the rushed story, then this is actually quite a good anime.",

Although it's an interesting twist, it doesn't deliver much in actual story; however if the story were to continue beyond the current episodes expected to air there is ample room for improvement. Personally, I love the artwork. Lines are crisp and clean, plus the color palette offers plenty of visual flair. Battles are short, too short in my opinion, and the main protagonist is made out to be some sort of bad ass warrior but is continually getting his butt handed to him. (Not a good sign)\r\nOverall, thestory just seems too rushed and not completely thought through on many elements. It's a decent watch but don't get your hopes up on being a spectacular anime...at least not yet. The ending could be rather epic...maybe.",

But it seemed as if the fights were mediocre and were there just to help move the story along. \r\nA tad too much of twists, with the plot already being convoluted as it is. The animation was good though, and was quite colourful. \r\nThe climax was meh and the ending was weak and confusing as well. If you're goingfor story along, I'd say don't.

            "content": "I was honestly excited when reading about this feudal-timed Anime, hoping it would star many of those Sengoku Heroes that are often praised in games like Samurai Warriors. Unfortunately in the kind you see in Brave 10, it doesnt do a very good job.\r\nHello, My Name is Ryoki and Welcome to my review of the Anime Brave 10. The review contains spoilers. If you dont like spoilers at all, please scroll away.\r\nThe scenery is settled in feudal japan, those of you who play or remember playing samurai warriors may be a little bit more familiar with this times. The anime practically throws you into anburning temple where you see a blue haired woman and a priest escape, then as they were stopped and attacked by the enemy - the priest then lets her escape once more through a trapdoor. This was a little bit confusing to myself as i had at least expected an considerable intro. But nonetheless the scene jumps further where you face our main male lead , Saizou Kirigakure.\\n\\n\r\nHe is suprised by seeing the woman in the woods and doesnt want to protect her, yet still does it when facing immediate danger, which is her pursuers. The girl insist him to go with her to the nearby Ueda Castle , where the famous Yukimura Sanada should live. Later then she tells him her Name, which would be Isanami and tells him nothing before their journey goes on to Ueda Castle.\\n\r\nOnce there, Yukimura decides to make them believe that he isnt interested in protecting them and when they were attacked at the way back - a mysterious orb began to expand from the girls' head. Yukimura sees the potential and decides to let them stay. \\n\\n\r\nAs I already said Saizou Kirigakure is our male lead , he is a young shinobi that is mostly known for his cold attitude and also because he refuses to serve anyone. You dont get to know much more about him as the anime tries to cramp in as much as it can from the manga.\\n\r\nIsanami on the other hand is our typical Damsel in Distress, sad/happy female lead. She is a priestess that lived in Izumo before a certain group of ninjas attacked and slaughtered everyone besides her. The twist with her is that she is the reincarnation of the death goddess and is only held back by her hairpin that was blessed by the gods. She pretty much is a big key point during the whole anime as they try to protect her from being taken away and to make her happy as strangely the trigger to summoning the darkness is - for her to be sad. This is something that you might like or not, that is to be left with you.\\n\r\nAlso if you dont like obvious stereotypical character, then this anime is definetly not for you. There is no clever packed in twist and you will be able to distinguish them from a mile away like ; ,,That's the bad guy!'' ,,That's the clumsy but too earnest guy.'' ,, That's the blood hungry guy.''\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is quite good, nothing that would be overestimatingly awesome, but the animation is fitting and sometimes, especially hard with a dancing scene for example (compare Isanamis graceful dance with the cg robot in blade and soul animation, it is quite opionated which one would fit better i think.) The fighting scenes are also very plain animated, dont understand me wrong - it is certainly well done but also here not exceptional. Unfortunately the sound cant keep much up as well, i have the opinion that if a fight comes up , you really have to feal tension - you have to feel epicness, you have to feel tension - that doesnt mean it has to be rock or a certain kind of genre - but something that keeps the viewers atention on the moves.  Unfortunately the op, is something that I wouldnt recommend anyone, maybe fitting to ninja movies but it sounds very annoying to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow then based on my personal opinion on story, arstyle, sound and characters and naturall also enjoyment - i issue Brave 10 a : 6 \\n\\n\r\nStream it, if you want to explore this certain universe. At the moment of this review Brave 10 wasn't yet licensed and thus isn't dubbed into english yet. So you will have to deal with subbed episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review could help you deciding if you want to take a look at Brave 10. See you next time.",

It's strange when you find an anime that is lacking in the most important areas but you still enjoy it regardless. That would be Brave 10 in a nutshell.\r\nThe story is too short and underdeveloped. The artwork is good but it is nothing special. The sound wasn't bad but there was nothing special about it either. Even most of the characters were underdeveloped.\r\nThankfully a couple main characters were developed pretty well, and with a good mix oflight comedy and decent action this really somehow worked in a weird sort of way. The characters were drowning in anime stereotypes, but the voice acting and the chemistry between the group were fun to follow. Scenes were rushed and dialogue was lacking, but it didn't bother me at all. I was entertained through all 12 episodes. That's all you can ever really hope for when dedicating time to a series.\\n\\n\r\nThat all aside, you can tell that this should have been great, but it was just good. Thankfully it's based on a manga series, so this anime has done it's job with me since I'll be reading that next.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't care about story (there is one, and it is just simply ok), and you want to see something that's a little fun, then this is worth a look. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's entertaining.",

Its not even entertaining to have a laugh at and i seriously contemplated strangling myself with my shoelace more than once while watching it.\r\nYou might be wondering \"oh Cravey, if it was so bad why did you bother sitting through however much you watched?\". I'll start by saying i would have dropped this like shit into the dunny but i am obligated to finish it for my anime watching challenge. Brave 10 at first glance seems like it has much to offer. It has some nice voices and alright art. I especiallywas tricked when i thought it had a Sengoku Basara historical vibe to it. Sadly, after getting into it you soon realise that that what you're stuck with is dogshit. You'd think that if they go out of their way to use historical figures for their characters they'd be able make some of them interesting, but frankly its insulting the way they turn these legends into angsty teenage bishies. Each of the characters suck, the worst being the main girl, who suffers from typical retarded heroine syndrome. WHY are you so dumb Isanami?! Seriously, they are written so bad that you might think an autistic gerbil with downs wrote this shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is dumb. It involves some lord trying to gather strong people for whatever reason, i didn't really care to follow, but it'll probably end with Isanami being retarded and screwing everyone over with her shit. Most of the screen time goes into long ass fights where they try desperately hard to try give each character some kind of interesting ability, kind of like some shit from Naruto or Bleach. I mean its OK if you're into that kind of shoneny stuff but most of the characters only ever get one fight so its kinda pointless. I mean in the first place there's too many characters. Why does the lord even have to get 10 people anyway? its not like its important to the story and it would probably be better if they just focused on a couple of characters. It like they decided 10 was a good number and made each of them have different powers so we wouldn't forget their names. The only character i remember is Isanami and that's not because she's memorable. Seriously i don't even remember the main characters name but its probably some generic ninja name like Hanzo or something\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is OK. The OP and ED and pretty interesting, but other than that there's nothing much memorable in the sound.\\n\\n\r\nDont watch this shit, you will lose braincells.",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nBrave 10 is too concerned with looking cool than telling a decent story. I understand this is derived from a manga franchise, but as a standalone, it's lacking. First, I don't understand any of the characters because they are so flat. Saizou is the typical angsty, loner archetype while Isanami is the perky, clingy priestess girl. Cool. Let's actually build on that and not leave them flatter than a steamrolled pancake. I will give some slack because it\u2019s probably hard to convey characters well in twelve episodes.\r\nI did like the actual significance of the Brave 10 a lot. It would have been too easy toassign clich\u00e9 roles to the characters. Ah, but darkness is not who you think it is. *wink*\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe way this show goes about introducing characters leaves a bit to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nSaizou is an ex-ninja, who is afraid to fight for someone. The ninja world has left him jaded so he\u2019s something like a ronin. He was okay but not much else than \u201ccool\u201d and a bit hotheaded.\\n\\n\r\nIsanami is bland, very bland. She\u2019s like a shoujo lead because she gets kidnapped a lot, loves the first boy she sees, and wishes her breast were bigger. For some reason, even though there is no real development, I like her and Saizou together. Sometimes, I like clich\u00e9 love. Still, I never felt a sense of urgency for her troubles.\\n\\n\r\nYukimura, I did not really get. There\u2019s more to him than what meets the eyes but I just did not really care. He\u2019s a great leader, fighter, and an all-around funny guy. \\n\\n\r\nBenmaru is a grating brat. Take your firebombs and go home, kid!\\n\\n\r\nAnatasia, who is super busty strictly for fanservice reasons, is one of the most interesting characters. Her backstory is over-the-top but she was somewhat cool.\\n\\n\r\nKamanosuke is annoying but very much wants to be loved.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Sasuke a lot. He is shy, a forest boy, and an animal-lover.\\n\\n\r\nJinpachi, I know too little about. He likes alcohol and women, and he\u2019s got some nice dreads. Pretty handsome for a pirate!\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe animation is so fluid that there aren't any wacky in-between shots. The fight scenes are cool but uncomfortably short and erratic. I find myself asking \u201cwhy is this person fighting that person?\u201d The characters\u2019 designs are not to my liking, but the art style is great. I wish some of the color schemes were more imaginative. I think the characters could have undergone one more draft to fine-tune the designs. Still, I'm not complaining because I like Brave 10's art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nIsanami's voice is annoying. The End.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nDid I like watching this show? Yeah, I did! But I had some disappointment such as how anticlimactic the final showdown was. I wasn\u2019t familiar with Brave 10 before this, so that might have left me a bit biased.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can put up with \u201cSAIZOU!\u201d an infinite amount of times, and a story focused more on visuals than plot, then this show is for you!\\n",

            "content": "I have just started watching Brave 10 and this is my review after watching up to episode 7. What got me into watching this was someone's review on it which only stated it was bad and only people who like Naruto or just lames would watch it. Now Naruto in my opinion is a great anime and manga so I might fit that group of Naruto lovers but the person never went into why the series is so bad. In my opinion from up to this point I'm enjoying it. It's better than Naruto with showing blood and a little fan service. The relationship betweenSaizo Kirigakure and Isanami is good because you can tell Saizo cares for her because he doesn't reject her when she hugs him or wants to be around him. It would make sense to why she would like him since he was the first person outside the temple that gave a damn about her. I think the female is cute how she acts and how she loves the male, wish she had a little breast but she probably get some when she turn 21. I know down the line they are going to mess it up because she looks like she just turned 18-19 while Saizo is maybe 2 years older but I bet when they show ages she will be 16 and him 25 I don't know why they do that tends to make the story look like the child molester and molested. They could have a 19 and 23 year old that wouldn't look bad but if they turn it into a speed grapher type thing I would be disgusted. By the way speed grapher was a great anime though but what they were doing to that girl in the beginning was just horrible. The only plot line they have right now is the fact that people are trying to get this hairpin form Isanami but no one really knows if she's the only one who can control it and exactly knows what it can do. I'm interested to see what will happen next in this story so I guess I'm a Narutoad.\\n\r\nOverall I give this story right now a 7/10 because the first part is not finished but I can see that it might turn out to be something good. It does have romance, action, ecchi, and comedy rolled all into it and not afraid to show violence so that's good. I do want it to open up and start talking more about the Brave 10 but I guess the first season is the gathering of the 10 then comes next the true villain.\\n\r\nThe art is not to bad so I give it a 8/10 I like Isanami so that might be why I give it a higher score but there's nothing I can say that was horrible about the characters that were drawn. The only thing I saw but liked was how big Isanami eyes were and the opening theme makes the ice ninja look kind of rough and ugly. In the series she doesn't look bad and it's funny how Sanada is trying to get in bed with her but I don't know why she don't like him. She might try and play that tsundere type for him; I bet he will like that the way he's been acting. Then again maybe she still has feelings for the Saizo.\\n\r\nI give the characters a 9/10 because all of them seemed pretty interesting and I would like to see how the author builds up the characters. Also Saizo is pretty cool not super arrogant and not super bitchy. I come to notice when the dude likes the girl to much it messes up the story and when he shows to less interest it makes the story boring this is just right but I want to see their relationship grow into something. I wouldn't be surprised if the red head turned out to be a female and the ice ninja starts flirting harder with Saizo that will make it into a basic anime for you.\\n\r\nThe sound I give a 8/10 because the voices where good but the opening and closing hasn't caught my ear yet so I can't say it got to me but also can't say it's horrible. Overall the enjoyment of the show I give a 9/10. I can't give it a perfect score because it can still turn out to be a horrible anime if the plot isn't good but from the way it's stating it might turn out to be a great anime. I have added this series to my common shows that I watch so I'm hoping that it doesn't disappoint me.\\n\r\n        So if you're into action, romance, comedy, violence, and ecchi I think you will like this. I guess you will be considered a lame by that person but who cares I like good shows and whatever is good in my eyes is something I'm going to watch. Oh yea and the only similarities I see in Naruto is that they are ninja and they use stuff that reminds me of jutsu in Naruto.\\n",

            "content": "Pleasant But Forgettable.......\r\nBrave 10 is a somewhat comedial interpretation of the historical Sanada Ten Braves folklore. It\u2019s not a bad anime but it\u2019s definitely not exceptional or great for that matter. While Brave 10 might never be considered a classic, it will still manage to entertain and please the anime viewer.\r\nStory: There\u2019s not really much to say about the story because the story of Brave 10 is weak and follows more or less in the same footsteps of many other similar anime, rarely displaying any form of originality. It follows the typical clich\u00e9 character archetypes one would expect from a shounen anime and never attemptsto keep viewers inclined to watch. The story has acceptable progression and can easily be understood and followed but offers nothing different or anything astonishing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This is one of the rather better aspects of Brave 10. The colors are vibrant and do an excellent job of bringing life to the anime. The colors are soft, light on the eyes and never has too much detail. The art direction is also somewhat acceptable. Characters are well designed and fit excellently to the humorous tone of the anime. The areas are also pleasing to look at. The action set pieces can seem a bit bland at times but the sequencing itself is excellent and easy to follow.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack fits the anime well but never tries to elevate it, making it quite forgettable. Seriously, you\u2019ll probably never remember Brave 10\u2019s soundtrack. The voices are done well but then again that\u2019s something we\u2019ve come to expect from an anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is Brave 10\u2019s biggest problem. There are too many characters that feel as if they weren\u2019t fleshed out enough and some feel as if they were given more development than others. The characters that were given more development are surprisingly developed quite well. The problem is that a 12 episode anime is nowhere long enough to allow acceptable development for so many characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Regardless of its flaws, Brave 10 will probably be enjoyed by many viewers. I found it at times enjoyable but it never possessed that \u201cwow\u201d factor. It\u2019s best to watch this anime with zero expectations to prevent a feeling of disappointment\\n\\n\r\nEncode: Excellent encode. Rarely saw any pixelation.\t\\n\\n\r\nTo Sum Up\\n\\n\r\nUps: Nice vibrant colors that fit the anime\u2019s tone, interesting fighting sequences, acceptable \\n\r\nstory progression, easy anime to follow, character development is good when it\u2019s there.\\n\\n\r\nDowns: Clich\u00e9 story, bland set pieces, forgettable soundtrack, character development leaves much to be desired\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Brave 10 isn\u2019t a bad anime but it will never be considered great either. Mixing so many different things into a shounen anime was a good idea but the execution of that idea was its failure.",

I see absolutely no plot line in anything; maybe I'm blind or just have a hard time processing everything that's happened in these 12 episodesbut from what I've got I'm just laughing because NOTHING MAKES SENSE. the character reaction to things are so random (i.e. when saizou touched yuri's head and then yuri flipped and ran off like what, WAHT WAS THAT?) I just oh my god, I don't GET IT. so they go around collecting all 10 braves but so far even so, it's just so unorganized and again, RANDOM. \\n\\n\r\ndsufakrgfjhsrv I'm literally choking i'm laughing so hysterically, this show is just so random it's amusing. I mean at first I didn't even want to watch this show because in my mind it showed too many similarities to naruto and since I'm weird and all i really care is naruto, all that went through my head was \"NOOOO!\" it was my friend lena who convinced to finally give it a go and first I was down but obviously as the episodes progressed I just wanted to jump off a cliff. hsdfbhjkgf like that one scene where sanada or someone is explaining the distribution of powers (isanami's hair pin is an example) was split amongst the reigning countries for equal power.. like come on, seriously, oh my god, NARUTO MUCH? I don't know man I guess I am just so over with this show that I don't even care, I don't see it going anywhere so I won't be surprised to see the outcome as so. but yeah, basically this show has become rubbish and I can't stop laughing, so that's that.",

It would recive a migh higher mark if it wasen't 12 episodes long. They were trying for something great and interesting but did not have the time leaving great build up with the worst kind of ending. The kind that dosen't end. Leaving the ending aside it is very fun to watch\r\nArt. 8\r\nBeautful art and Beautfulblood not unique but still interesting. enough said\\n\\n\r\nSound 3\\n\r\nHardly any sound i think there is some at points but unlike other anime you hardly notcie it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4\\n\r\nIf it was longer we may have more interesting characters but we didn't. The main character might be memerable to you as a pessimist bad ass. or maybe the female lead who is a comeplte annoyance. The only character who was memerable was the reverse trap who loved blood. sadistic and very amuseing. I paid more attention to him the most for his/her/it's orginality\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\r\nThe 9 is based on the fact i am not includeing the final episode. other then the final horrable episode it is quite enjoyable and a good watch while waiting for the other anime episodes to come out. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict 6 \\n\r\nThere is better and worse out there but this is just something to watch when you can't think of anything. just don't comapre it to other anime because remember it is short.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for spelling errors",

            "content": "If you ask me brave 10 is one of the most underrated anime out there I personally loved it, I mean there's so much to love about it if you are a lover of the action,  historical, adventure genre. The action I'm talking about is not some cheeky ball game or something epic less, I'm talking blood and ninja fights done so well you wouldn't be able to tell if you're watching it or not. Honestly I don't know why the popular opinion  about the anime is so bad. Because for me everything about the anime is top notch the story, the art,the soundtrack, the characters everything. \\n\r\nThe story talks about a female priestess on the run from ninjas trying to kill her after they had already killed everyone else in her temple she stumbled upon a ninja who doesn't have a master because he hates having one, now that might have been a problem for most ninjas at that time but not this guy, he loved being free. He saved the priestess from the ninjas and as they continued their journey they stumbled into the territory of a powerful man gathering ten skilled people from all around the world. That's just about what you'll get from me regarding the story if you  want to know more, read the synopsis on MAL or better still check it out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is wonderful the dark theme the anime had suited the story in fact you could tell that the amount of time and money put into the making of this anime doesn't deserve to be underrated in this manner. Despite the art not being brightly coloured, it's still a marvel how well the art matches the story. Beautifully designed action scenes, well drawn scenery, name it! \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think the soundtrack is one of the reason why the public opinion on the anime is not so good. I have always taught that a good soundtrack makes a good anime and while the soundtrack in the anime wasn't so bad it failed to bring to life those flashy scenes or failed to sound sad when it had to. Well apart from this complain, the soundtrack was awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime had really strong characters, like I said earlier a man was gathering 10 really strong people around the world. It had characters really intelligent, some good with gun to each their own field. There was no character development because everyone around is a master in what they do. Brave 10 focused on the priestess because she was the only one weak, she was the only one that needed to be protected. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think by now you already have an idea of how much I enjoyed brave 10 despite public opinion, for me the anime is ratted (9/10) I don't know how it'll be for you but it's not too late to find out. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I try to keep spoilers to a minimum with this review.\r\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching this. I enjoyed watching Sengoku Basara, and I had read that this anime had similarities to it (Sengoku period, fighting...). I didn't keep my hopes up too high though, since this is only 12 episodes, and much can't be put into that.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe beginning was boring to me, but the plot became interesting after the fourth episode or so, but not for the right reasons. I liked the plot for the parts when the characters weren't doing anything important main plot -wise. That's odd becauseI don't even like fillers. I think it might be because that was the only time when we could get time to get to know the characters a bit better. Personally, I think twelve episodes was way too short a time to introduce so many characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nEven though I liked Sengoku Basara, there's one visual thing I don't quite like about the recent sengoku period animes: the costumes. I don't think a rock star attire sits well with an ancient Japan environment, and it does even less so with this anime. The outfits are too flamboyant and they seem to be there to make up for the lack of depth to the characters. I did enjoy the backgrounds though, they were very atmospheric and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't that special. It did its job, but it could have been better. There were some sound effects that were a bit off to me (the sound of Date closing his fan sounded like a whip, for one), and some music that I felt was repeated too often. I didn't like the opening, it felt as if it didn't fit with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nThis should probably mean the character of the anime, but I'll talk about characters instead. The main character was quite generic, but he did develop somewhat, so I don't think he was that bad. At some point I think he did develop too fast though, I almost didn't recognize him (onsen-scene). The main female character was pathetic, because she was always whining, always tripping over something, and stopping others from fighting (come on, they're warriors! They're supposed to fight!), and she's a terrible Mary Sue. She wasn't fully annoying though, she did have some adorable and sweet moments, but she didn't develop at all throughout the episodes. The other characters were sadly left behind, only some of them getting some backstory.  I think it's because of the length of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nDespite being boring in the beginning and pretty predictable, I did enjoy watching this. I liked the \"filler\" episdoes the most, which is kinda sad, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

            "content": "I decided to watch this cause I've seen quite a big if gifs from it, and I liked the art. it looked pretty good\r\nStory: it was ok, could've been a lot better, but it was only 12 episodes, but I've definitely seen better anime that had more to it with the same amount. but they should've added a romance tag to this as well.\r\nArt: I liked it, I think they did a pretty good job on it, a lot of people are saying that there were 'to many bishies' but you can make an anime amazingly awesome with it having those 'bishies' to, itdoesnt matter how 'pretty' the chars look, it counts on what you do with them in the story. Also, blood doesn't spray that much when you get it a cut XD\\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the opening and ending themes, I cant really remember if there was any music playing during the fight scenes or any other random moment in the anime though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Isanami was cute, but she was the typical girl that always had to be saved and cried a lot when something bad happened. most of the other chars I dont so much as remember, saizo was ok I guess, but I really did enjoy kamanosuke, probably cause I really like those s&m goofy/crazy chars .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was ok, it wasn't horrendous, something to pass time with if your bored, Idk if I would rewatch it, but it was decent enough to be able to fnish, and got a few laughs from it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Again, I dont think I would rewatch it, but its something to pass the time with if your bored, not the best anime, but it's not the worst.",
