            "content": "There is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that a poorly researched work on a touchy subject can frustrate people off. The anime medium is infamous for blatantly using offensive stereotypes; One Piece is one of the weirdest examples out there for attacking racism and then, using racial stereotypes.\r\nThen, there\u2019s the animes that deal with the LGBT community.\r\nStereotyped as flamboyant creatures, the LGBT community suffers through insulting stereotypes and invectives. One of the least prominent group of the LGBT body is transgender community; there is so little focus on them. As far as most ignorant people are concerned, they are crossdressers. Nothing more.\r\nHourou Musuko, or WanderingSon, is a work, based on the bestselling manga, that focuses on crossdressers, puberty, and transgender issues. It serves to educate -- and entertain -- viewers about gender identity. What does it mean to be a boy or a girl? Why do people have so many problems with guys dressing up as girls? Are crossdressers \u201cweird\u201d? \\n\\n\r\nThe work tackles these questions through the eyes of Nitori Shuichi. He never like being a boy; he always feels he should have been a girl. Takatsuki Yoshino, a girl, wishes she is born as a boy. She hates wearing girly clothing. Both these main characters feel strangled over societal norms on gender issues and this anime adaptation does great justice in focusing their struggles. \\n\\n\r\nBecause this work starts in medias res, the drama immediately starts and that is one of its greatest strengths. It doesn\u2019t waddle on setting the work; the work has an inviting introduction that explains most of the events explained in the manga in the first episode. Personally, the first episode is one of my favorite first episodes out there; it is so impressive that I said, \u201cWow.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile it rests on the familiar tropes and archetypes, there is an engaging twist on everything. If you think love triangles are the most boring trope out there, Hourou Musuko will flabbergast you. Chiba Saori, a straight female character, falls in love with Nitori as a girl while Nitori has a crush on Takatsuki. The love triangle situation grows even more complex and captures the viewers\u2019 imagination. Dramatic and slice-of-life situations are there for a reason: to characterize. There is nothing redundant about them and everything feels well-placed. Interestingly enough, the work climaxes on the silly anime cliche: a play in a cultural festival; however, it is one of the best endings out there in anime. \\n\\n\r\nEverything about the characters feels realistic. Nitori and Takatsuki are definitely two of the best written LGBT characters out there; they act like people in real life facing actual dramatic situations. Except they have problems identifying themselves. Saori, while being a more unconventional -- and almost insane -- character, has a degree of believability. Ariga Makoto, Suehiro Anna, and Doi Shinpei -- despite their labels as supporting characters -- are strong characters that complement the drama in the work; it seems bizarre to call them supporting characters. While Sarashina Chizuru may vex viewers, her placement is a necessary evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe minimalist watercolor palette for its art is powerful. Bright colors and thin outlines almost feel like you are viewing a moving watercolor painting. Lush backgrounds have never been this interesting. The character designs look fantastic and dynamic. What can I say? Hourou Musuko\u2019s art style is unbelievably incredible.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cItsudatte\u201d by Daisuke is a charming acoustic piece for an OP: clear vocals, catchy acoustic pieces, fantastic lyrics. While I find it hilarious that the OP focuses on furniture and symbols, its symbolism is worthy of praise. It introduces the serious yet enchanting elements of this work. The ED, \u201cFor You\u201d by Rie Fu, is a soothing pop music, but loses its memorability quickly.\\n\\n\r\nFans argue that its noitaminA\u2019s position creates problems with this work. Its 11 episode structure has condensed the work quite significantly. Despite that, it is an excellent way to introduce viewers to the manga; its easygoingness gives little problems.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does Hourou Musuko compare to the likes of other slice-of-life works? Excellent. Its pleasant nature does not scare off viewers; rather, it educates them about the issues. The animation staff did not back off from the issues, no matter the consequences. That, to me, is admirable.",

            "content": "It's strange to think about the roles that we fall into based on our inborn qualities and the societies in which we live. The very existence of the term \u201ccross-dressing\u201d seems to rely on the assumption that there's a \u201cright\u201d way to anoint ourselves with clothes to wear based on our sex, and to do otherwise is to risk social exile. But what if a boy doesn't want to look like or act like a boy, and what if a girl doesn't want to develop into a woman? Do we have any freedom in this regard, or are we slaves to birth and societal convention?Wandering Son is a series which looks at the implications of these and other ideas by taking a peek into the life of a middle school student: The feminine boy, Nitori, who privately cross-dresses and begins to identify as a girl. Sometimes at odds with others, and always at odds with himself, he walks through some confusing years searching for the answers to countless complicated questions.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSimple, but effective\u201d is a phrase that could describe Wandering Son on a couple of levels, but it's most immediately noticeable in the artwork. The color scheme is warm, consisting mostly of pastel pinks and yellows. Backgrounds are reasonably detailed, and they fade into a sea of off-white around the edges, like a drawing on canvas. At the most basic level, you could call the character designs generic, but they're drawn with the same light, rounded watercolor touch that's applied to the backgrounds, and the result is a world that's appealing to the eyes, as inviting and agreeable as it is distinctive. Each scene looks like a moving painting, remarkably fluid, with no out-of-place elements or sharp contrasts to break the sense of consistency. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound share many of those same qualities. Short of some obligatory \u201clight and cheerful\u201d music for the more upbeat school scenes, the series mostly relies on a seemingly limitless series of piano melodies. Dramas can sometimes be guilty of leaning too heavily on the sound of the piano, but in this case there are a surprisingly large variety of tracks, and they run the tonal gamut from soft and somber to soaring and hopeful, so it didn't bother me in the least. What's more interesting is the show's willingness to use atmospheric noise in place of music. The soft ticking of a clock during a lull in conversation can become harsh and accusing, as can that normally-harmless loop of muzak playing in the karaoke place. In one heart-stopping scene, the shrill cry of cicadas and the beat of slow footsteps are all we can hear as an antagonistic classmate approaches the vulnerable main character behind a closed door, his motives unclear. In this regard, the series can produce an immense amount of tension and audience involvement from practically nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are both a blessing and a curse. Get ready to be completely and utterly lost as early as three minutes into the first episode: The cast is huge, and with the exception of two leads, Nitori and Takatsuki, none of the characters are explicitly introduced in any sort of depth. To make matters worse, in addition to their given name, every character is also referred to by several nicknames, so you can definitely expect to play a little who's-who early in the series. Many of the characters knew each other in past years, but this is touched on very briefly, and the series seems to take it for granted that we'll be able to grasp everyone's histories. To be fair, if you're paying close attention, you can do just that, but it's definitely a tasking introduction that might be a little more complicated than it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also falters a little when it comes to making the lead roles feel believable. It's difficult to write children with true accuracy, but this is an extreme case; within this series, there are at least three middle schoolers who, by all indications, are more mature and intelligent than most adults. Nitori and Takatsuki are both unflinchingly honest and up-front about their motivations and desires, and Saori, the third lead, is a little girl who has the steely composure and resolve of a professional hitman. In one scene, Saori's mother asks her what she plans to do with her life, and Saori sullenly responds that, if all else fails, she could \u201cjust be somebody's mistress.\u201d You'll pardon me for thinking that seems like an unlikely response from an eleven-year-old, and it's a drop in the bucket of unrealistic behavior exhibited by children throughout the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the characters are a flop, though. Nitori is a character in a state of internal turmoil, trying his best to make sense of himself and work through confusion that most people could only imagine. It all shows through in his tepid behavior, his shyness, his inability to truly feel comfortable amongst others. He's complex, and believable as a person, just not as a child. By and large, the supporting characters are put to good use\u2014as mentioned, they're many in number, so I can't dig into everyone, but some standouts include: Sarashina, a brazen and upbeat girl whose positive attitude and strong sense of identity make her a good role model for Nitori; Ariga, Nitori's friend and confidant who also has the desire to cross-dress; and Maho, Nitori's sister who, like true family, can somehow manage to be simultaneously spiteful and kind. The sense of realism isn't quite up to par, but there's definitely a lot of good chemistry between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEven by slice-of-life/drama standards, there really isn't much in the way of a conventional story here. Each episode is just a day or two in the life of Nitori as he faces numerous problems. In many ways, Nitori is the story\u2014numerous subplots raise meaningful inquiries about him and the way that he is going to live his life. He starts to undergo puberty, he finds himself attracted to his sister's friend, he is conflicted about whether or not he should cross-dress at school. These beg some questions; how will he handle it when he is too \u201cboyish\u201d to convincingly cross-dress? Will he be able to have a meaningful relationship with the opposite sex despite his own confused state? Will he live in secrecy, or be open about his desire to be a girl? The series is good at provoking these sorts of thoughts without ever being too explicit about them.\\n\\n\r\nIn that same vein, Wandering Son really does have something that's absent from most dramas, and that is a sense of emotional understatement. It generates tension the same way that tension is generated in real life. Awkward silences; sometimes words unspoken are worse than those that are. Simultaneous sidelong glances in which both parties drop their eyes; just returning the gaze of a person you no longer call \u201cfriend\u201d can be disquieting. A white flag offered by someone who has wronged you in the past; you want to let bygones be bygones, but you never can tell who's genuine and who isn't. Over time, Wandering Son collects all of these realities and more, hones them to their most disconcerting and incisive forms, and then uses them to great effect. The scene that I would consider to be the show's climax is so soft and unassuming, yet so full of visceral impact, that it's tough to even describe. Bad dramas default to artificially emotional screaming and crying. The good dramas are the ones that are built on the understanding that sometimes life is just so damn cold, silent, and uncomfortable that screaming and crying become a welcome change of pace, the finish line of an emotional gauntlet rather than the start. To that end, this series passes with flying colors. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ultimately ends up marring Wandering Son more than anything is its treatment of its themes. Don't think for a second that I won't commend the show for taking an idea that's often denigrated to the rank of a joke and bringing it up to center stage, because I will. It's daring, original, and respectful, and I respect that to no end. The series is great at  presenting insightful questions. But it cheapens itself a little bit when attempting to provide the answers. For all of the inner toiling, the complexity of the problems faced by the characters, the series ultimately ends up being permeated and diluted by the same overly simplistic \u201cjust be yourself and everything is gonna be okey-dokey\u201d message that seems to be omnipresent in all forms of media. My own cynicism notwithstanding, there's nothing terribly wrong with that message in and of itself, but in this context, it's little more than a cop-out, a juvenile thematic resolution crudely tacked onto an otherwise mature and involving experience. It turns Wandering Son into an inarticulate meditation on the topic at hand rather than a full-blown attempt to embrace it, and for lack of a better phrase, it's a crying shame.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, there's plenty to appreciate here, and if you lean at all towards the slice-of-life/drama genres, or if you're just intrigued by the idea but sitting on the fence about whether or not it's worth your time, this is an easy enough recommendation. It doesn't carry nearly as much weight as it might have, but it's still the kind of uniquely artistic and effective series that I wish was a little more prevalent in the entertainment landscape.",

            "content": "Let me get this straight, I usually don\u2019t watch gender-bender series or anything that is related to the genre. Actually, I don\u2019t recall one anime that I saw that the focus was with cross-dressing of any sort. That said, Wandering Son would actually be the first anime that I have seen that made usage of this trope. And to be honest, it came to be one of the best series of the winter 2011.  Wandering Son is a short and calm anime that was enjoyable for its simple, but thoughtful story.\r\nWandering Son starts off with an interesting structure. Instead of starting from an extremity,the beginning or the ending, the anime begins somewhere in the middle of the original story. Of course, it is assuming that either the viewer is familiar with the manga or is watching the series seriously. I\u2019m saying this because it is easy to get lost in the anime as it refers a lot to pass events and it is mostly through dialogue than flashbacks. Actually, I applaud the director for using such a direction, simply because that the story works on already constructed and broken relations rather than focusing on making some. However, where the story keeps its real strength is in the problematic itself. Of course, our main characters have an idea of cross-dressing and wanting to be the opposite sex, but such dilemma is never blatantly exposed in the anime, nor does it make it over-dramatic.  Instead, Wandering Son almost works as a slice of life. And by that I do not mean IT IS a slice of life, since it is absolutely not, but the story is found between the lines, between the dialogues and the actions of the characters. This way, the anime is helped by a correct blend between light moments and drama. While it is mostly a serious show, the happy moments are never actually forced and it sometimes it is not really sure if a scene was to be happy or sad. Ironically, the lack of focus in the story can also be a weak point for some, as it may get hard to get into a story that doesn\u2019t really shows itself. From this point, it is really a matter of preference. Personally, I think the calm development is the best way to go, since a direct focus would make it too dramatic for nothing. Of course, the story wouldn\u2019t matter without its cast, which exactly knows what it has to do.\\n\\n\r\nWandering Son has a relatively large cast. Only, it is clear that the anime only focus on the main characters rather than the supportive cast.  This way, the small amount of 11 episodes is enough for the viewer to learn about the characters that are really important to the show. As for the others, they play their supportive role very well and that is a big plus point in the series. What is really fascinating about the cast is really the way they are used as whole rather than individually. More precisely, the representation of the classroom can almost be taken as one big character. The chemistry of the students is something I\u2019ve rarely seen in the medium. Individually, the characters aren\u2019t bad at all, but there is a tad annoyance. Looking at characters such as Nitori, Takatsuki and Chiba, they are certainly well written characters. However, especially for Chiba, their way of thinking can often look too far away from the physical age. It\u2019s always hard to represent children or prepubescent teen correctly and realistically in anime and Wandering Son certainly doesn\u2019t have the best one of them all. Of course, I might be wrong on this one, but the characters really were too mature for their age. Though, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem since it works greatly with the story and the feeling of the anime. Childish characters wouldn\u2019t go well with subjects such as gender crisis and the fear of puberty.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack. While the opening song might be debatable, (I for myself wasn\u2019t a big fan of it) the series itself is helped by wonderful melodramatic piano compositions. A prime example is in the first episode where Claire de Lune is played at the end. Not only I respect them for the use of a very popular composition, but it was also completely fitting with the situation. The music is never poignant in Wandering Son. Instead, it is played gently and calmly in the background. You don\u2019t really pay attention, but you know it is well there. As for the voice acting, glad to know that it wasn\u2019t a typical high pitched voice you would often see with children.  For most of them, they did a really good job, and while Nitori had mostly a monotone voice, it went very well with its personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point that is easy to notice in Wandering Son is the artwork which is very similar to book art. I don\u2019t know the reason behind this, but I found it to be relieving. In contrast to the melancholy feeling of the series, the light pastel colors help the viewer to go through the whole series and take it as a lighter anime. The character design is meant to be normal in this show, and so it\u2019s usual for them to look like typical children. However, the artwork is enough to make them look different from the mass. I just can\u2019t say it enough; I simply fell in love with the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nTo fill it up completely, Wandering Son is simply a good anime that blends dramatics elements with lighter ones in the best way possible. Even though the style might not be your cup of tea, which is a valid point, I still recommend it to everyone who wants to try something serious once in a while. Really, it shows how the anime industry is still trying to give us original titles rather than the same formula over and over again.\\n",

That\u2019s what little boys are made of.\u201d \r\nThe third movement of Debussy\u2019s Bergasmasque Suite plays softly in the background as a strong gust blows hundreds of cherry blossoms in the night sky. It\u2019s a fitting piece not only for setting such a tranquil mood, but also referencing Paul Verdaine\u2019s poem, Clair de Lune, whose first stanza is a decently fitting representation of what may be one of the most beautifully written slice of life anime out there.\r\n\u201cYour soul is a chosen landscape\r\nWhere charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go\r\nPlaying the lute and dancing andalmost\\n\r\nSad beneath their fanciful disguises.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko is a story about Shuiichi Nitori, a boy who wants to be a girl, Yoshino Takatsuki, a girl who wants to be a boy, and a cast consisting of their friends and acquaintances as they navigate through the issues of puberty, transsexuality, and gender identity.\\n\\n\r\nI usually state in my reviews that the anime in question has a simple premise, but Hourou Musuko\u2019s is anything but that. The issues that the show tackles are complex and filled with varying perspectives and challenges. The show doesn\u2019t sugar coat the current state of people\u2019s views of the transgender community.  Yes, there are many who understand one\u2019s plight and predicament, but often times, he or she may be almost entirely alone, forced to don a set of clothes that may not echo with their true identity, and changing clothes when nobody is looking to feel more  like themselves. There are characters in this story that aren\u2019t very accepting, or uncomfortable, or have strange fetishes that just make things worse, or are confused and externalize their confusion into near bullying.  There are many people, even friends, family, and loved ones, who are certainly not ready to accept Nitori for the person he wants to be. Hourou Musuko doesn\u2019t offer a perfect world for our protagonists to live in and be happy. It\u2019s a confusing and trying time, with just the right amount of help from great role models to push our protagonists towards understanding themselves and the growth they\u2019re experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nIn this sense, it was brilliant to tackle them from the perspectives of children, who are not only innocent, but easily influenced, confused, and prone to unpredictable outbreaks of emotion and anger. I felt like such an angle gave a lot more depth, with the perspectives of children and their older peers and adults on Nitori\u2019s cross dressing a major motif in the story. The story\u2019s most powerful message is of personal acceptance and coming to terms with one\u2019s identity and physical changes that are taking place in one\u2019s body. I truly believe that taking the perspective of kids empowered this message, as it removes any potential fluff in high school dramas while pinpointing the most confusing time for some of us all: the beginning of puberty.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would imagine it\u2019s really hard to write children, and as we\u2019ve seen from many movies revolving around children (most recently the disaster known as Ender\u2019s Game), children can really suck if not done right. \\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko has no such problems, and while I have to fault them for having some children (predominantly Chiba Saori, ironically one of my favorite characters) that act way older than they really appear, at the end of the day Hourou Musuko is powered by a really strong cast of characters that each fit their own role in their story, no matter how small it is. It\u2019s really refreshing to see a cast that\u2019s so varied and each serving a variety of important purposes and aren\u2019t just lifeless plot devices.  \\n\\n\r\nNitori\u2019s best friend Mako is a fantastic foil character, bordering on the line of supporting his friend and envying him. The bombastic and tomboyish Sarashina serve as surprisingly good comic relief and sort of early role model for Tataksuki, who is interested in wearing more boyish clothes. The little girl Sasa is a mediator, trying to keep her friends together despite various conflicts, and she might be one of the characters a good portion of the audience might sympathize with. There are too many others for me to cover, but for such a short show, Hourou Musuko gives life to these characters and give them purpose, though it could be said that they needed to be a bit more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the three main characters, Nitori, Takatsuki, and Chiba Saori that get the most amount of development, and I think the three of them played such an interesting dynamic. I think Nitori and Takatsuki speak for themselves as the show\u2019s two main protagonists, but Saori is definitely one of the more complex characters in the show, and she played kind of an antagonistic role, always causing problems for her own selfish needs. She\u2019s blunt, and despite her brutal honesty to other people about her opinions she is least honest to herself. Her inability to externalize some of her deeper feelings and get along with people meshed her romantic feelings made her likable despite how mean she was to everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hourou Musuko has great characters, and I think despite the fact that many may act over their age level, I think that\u2019s a small and irrelevant point in the long run. While it\u2019s true that children should be portrayed realistically, the end goal is the thematic elements that are what makes the show really powerful. To that extent, the children are portrayed realistically. They may have lines that hint at more deep thought, but it\u2019s their quirks, confusion with feelings of love, innocence and inability to process between what is socially acceptable and what is not, and unpredictability that makes them children. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko is a really good looking show, and it\u2019s unique too. I must admit that the watercolor-ish look at the beginning seemed a bit too bright for me, but it really grew as the show went on. The character designs are also nice. I thought both Nitori and Takatsuki were drawn really well to demonstrate that they could look both like a boy or a girl. I think they changed Saori from her original appearance in the manga, but I think that only strengthened her presence in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there\u2019s nothing particularly spectacular about the animation. The art is where the main compliments are had, and ultimately the show is less about animation as it is about the writing, but I do think their use of facial expressions were really spot on. You could really tell people\u2019s attitude from how they were drawn, the look in their eyes, their smile or apathetic frown. I thought that attention to detail was really important.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not particularly impressed by most of Hourou Musuko\u2019s music, but I think that was intended since it was a kind of quiet piece that really didn\u2019t have a need for any kind of outstanding score. The soundtrack was mostly very forgettable outside of three pieces, which was their rendition of Clair de Lune, the opening, and the ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are composed mostly of a piano and a guitar, and I think that those make for quiet and peaceful tracks. They have melodies but are mostly unimpressive compared to the  quality of everything else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a great time watching Hourou Musuko. I haven\u2019t watched too much school based slice of life/drama/comedy (more than most people though), but Hourou Musuko takes the cake for the best and most powerful school/drama anime I have ever watched. Its messages are powerful, thought provoking, and long lasting. This is an instant recommendation to a lot of my friends who are looking for good slice of life, and all of my transgender friends have cried and have sung only praises for such a realistic portrayal of the struggles of the TG community.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show, while I may not directly relate to, are very interesting and multilayered. They all have their own qualities and I\u2019m sure many will be bound to find at least one character to really like and look forward to seeing.  The show has a great balance of comedy and drama too, without forcing melodramatic scenes down our throats at all. The writing and dialogue was great and demonstrated a mastery of narrative and storytelling. Sometimes Hourou Musuko even read almost like a poem, with beautiful passages short and expressive. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as the ending of this show came around, and the sound of applause began to echo in my ears, I could only clap along with everyone else. This seems like an overlooked gem in the anime community, and I sincerely hope you take my words and give this show a chance. I can only imagine which expression you may relate with when those final curtains rise on this magnificent performance.",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko starts with questioning what little girls and boys are made of. It illuminates the role of sex in the construction of \u201cnatural\u201d or coherent sexuality and gender, and the disheartening repercussions that the individuals, who fail to conform to what is socially accepted, experience. Further, the plotline sensibly uses the onset of puberty to intricately and realistically show that in this socially constructed world, we are bounded by to what has been \u201cnormalized\u201d\u2014boys must wear pants and girls must wear skirts. Together with the simple clean art and easy melodies, this series is crafted in a remarkably sensitive and moving way.\r\nNitori and Takatsukiare the two main characters, who both struggle with gender crisis. Nitori is feminine by nature but trapped in a male body, same with Takatsuki who is masculine by nature however ensnared in a female body. Both clearly demonstrate the challenges of having binary sex system or the society's practice of heterosexuality. The plot visibly shows that the supposed blatancy of sex as a natural biological fact indicates to how intensely its production in discourse is concealed. For instance, Takatsuki agonizes girlhood because no matter how hard she flattens her chest, she cannot avoid wearing a bra for she can never stop her breast from growing. Likewise with Nitori, he vacillates boyhood because as soon as his body hairs grow, it\u2019ll be harder for him to wear skirts and dresses. Moreover, the predicament of the storyline exists not just because of characters\u2019 inner conflicts, they are also suffering overtly from being alienated and discriminated because their desired sexed bodies and gender roles are beyond what is \u201cnaturalized\u201d by the society. In these scenarios, I like how these dilemmas are beautifully illustrated by the characters\u2019 portrayal of genuine human emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Hourou Musuko for those who want to see a simple storyline but yet complex depiction of transexualism, and question humanity. If you find this subject offending, then this is not for you. Also, when watching this anime, try to perceive as if you\u2019re sexless and genderless to fully discern how society materializes bodies to create boundaries and differentiate what is accepted from not.",

            "content": "I've been waiting since June to see this manga be made into an anime, and I wasn't disappointed. The anime starts when Nitori-san and Takatsuki-kun enter junior high school. It does accommodate the story of the manga before they entered junior high school, and I think it does a pretty good job of explaining to people new to the series the premise and what happened before this time.\r\nStory\r\nAs in the manga, the story shows an accurate view of what transsexual children/teenagers must face in their life. My only quip is that it doesn't show quite how depressing those feelings are in the manga or anime;however, if it did, the story wouldn't be very good because the main characters would be depressed all the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation was done very well; all the drawings are uniform in appearance, with nothing seeming out of place. The overall style of the anime still shows the very simple style of the manga, which really helped to make it feel right. The art itself is done in light, but very vibrant colors. It gives a very simple and beautiful appearance, which belays the depth of the issues in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't greatly impressed by the music, the simple piano tunes fit with the animation very well. There were a few pieces  that I really liked, and the rest wasn't too bad, either. Not my personal choice, but it fits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are still wonderful; showing depth in their issues and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is where I feel the need to put a \"Your mileage may vary\" warning. This anime is very beautiful to me, but to some, it might be boring or offensive, if you happen to have something against transsexuals (obviously, it's not meant for you, then). If you happen to be a transsexual like myself, or some other type of gender variant, than you will probably find this anime enjoyable just for being able to relate to it. If not, then you might just find it interesting. Either way, it's really a \"You'll enjoy it, or you won't\" kind of deal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI loved it, and would recommend it to anyone who I thought would like it. I would, of course, suggest reading the manga too. A resounding 10, for the beauty of the characters and the story, and for being able to portray such a difficult topic in an understandable way.",

            "content": "\"Roses are red, Violets are blue.\" The phrase is used as the subtitle of the first episode and sums up the conflict of the entire series.\r\nOne of the main ways we learn about the world is by being told. Told by those which we accept as our elders, an authority on the subject perhaps. They tell us how we should act, how we should be. They tell us what normal is, what's acceptable, and what is not. Roses are red, and violets are blue, boys are supposed to be one way and girls another. Anything that strays from those guidelines and doesn't fit into themould are regarded as deviants. They are treated with disgust, or perhaps pitied as though they were ill. All the while you wonder that if you don't fit that mould, does that make you something else. This flower is clearly a rose, but it isn't red.\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko deals with a group of middle school students, two of whom are just now wondering why things aren't the way they were supposed to be and how they are isolated and shunned because of it. They search for ways to cope, while wondering whats in store for them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to anyone who has the chance to watch it. The subject matter may be beyond the comfort zone for some, but really settles in with you once you give it a chance. While it focuses on a very specific manifestation of the problem, it highlights a fundamental flaw in our social systems which encompasses many different subjects. If you're looking for something which will tug on your heart strings and wonder about the world, this is it.",

            "content": "[Based on episodes 1-6 of the anime.]\r\nStory/Characters: 7/10 of 10\r\nIf you are in the market for a touching story with a lot of emotion and drama, this could be the show for you this season. If you are looking for action, fan service, or comedy, look elsewhere. (There are plenty of options!) For those of you familiar with the manga, you might want to know that the story appears to pick up in the middle. The manga starts when they are in 5th grade, but the anime starts on the first day of middle school. A lot of the history that is under the bridgefor our two protagonists is presented via flashback sequences that bring us up to speed on where the characters have been and how they got where they are today.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest knock on the show is that it doesn't really have any plot. It is completely slice-of-life drama. There is not anything to drive the story. It just brings you along to watch as these youngsters learn about themselves and the world around them. In my opinion, that is a minor flaw at best, as the writing and the pacing of the show is such that you really get a good emotional feel for the characters, and that is the real payoff in this show\\n\\n\r\nAnother possible complaint is that it is hard to follow. The show does not stop to explain anything to you about any of the characters, and there are a whole lot of them! (This can also be viewed as a strength, as it shows that the creators have enough respect for the viewer to let them figure out the story on their own without spoon-feeding it to them. Frankly, too much expository material can ruin slice-of-life stories, as they then turn into lectures and lose the natural feel that makes them enjoyable in the first place.) Frequently, I find myself uncertain of who is who early in an episode, but as the show has gone on, that happens less often. And that is a good thing, because the characters are one of the real strengths of the show! They are well-rounded, fully vibrant characters with quirks and nuances that make them come to life in your mind. The one thing that might strike some as false is the unnatural maturity of some of these middle school age kids, but being the father of a middle school boy who is active in things like scholastic bowl and orchestra, I can say that I don't find them that unnaturally mature. (In the event that he reads this review, I have to add that I am, of course, referring to his wonderfully mature friends, not him! LOL! ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of the series is the art. Looking like moving watercolor paintings, every detail is lovingly drawn to elicit the mood the story requires. The backgrounds and characters are exquisitely done. The only criticism I have is that some of the characters are a bit too similar to each other, but I think that is more of a problem with the lack of explanation of who is who than with the art. After a few episodes, I was able to distinguish the characters well enough, except when you aren't supposed to be able to! (There is a character that appears very differently than they had earlier in one of the episodes, and I think you are supposed to be a bit confused until their name is said.)\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the soft watercolors and washed-out backgrounds emulate the style of the manga, which has been referred to as \"minimalist\" in its artistic style. That carries through to the anime, with the art having wonderful detail, but no more or less than is absolutely needed. It never feels like there is too much to see to truly appreciate a scene, but at the same time, each scene is rich enough to convey its message without the viewer feeling there is anything missing. The emotional impact of the images themselves is considerable. The art is impressive!\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound Effects: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show (\"Itsudatte.\" by Daisuke) is strong, bringing the viewer into the story with just the right mood, but where the music really shines is the excellent ED (\"For You\" by Rie Fu). The song has the ability to elicit tears all on its own, with a keen sense of longing and devotion, yet an uplifting and optimistic feeling as the song progresses. The spartan animation, consisting of Sh\u016bichi walking along stoically on a blank background, then having his movement become more animated and girlish when the music returns to the chorus and the air is filled with cherry blossoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe music inside the episodes is very understated and well done. It knows when to emphasize the mood and when to remain in the background for support, but it also knows when to go away entirely and let the awkward silence or the natural background sounds fill the space, cementing the mood in that situation as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic show. It is heartfelt and warm, with great respect for its characters and the viewers ability to understand the story with minimal expository material. It may not be my favorite of the season, as there are shows that are more \"fun\" in the moment and more stimulating. However, in the long run I expect that it will rank among my favorite shows of all time and I will probably buy the BluRay and watch it time and again when I am in the mood for some deep character drama. There are many places to go to get a good romantic comedy or a nice suspenseful action show or even a raunchy, fan service laden ecchi fest. There are very few sources for exquisite art combined with rich character drama and deep emotion, and Wandering Son is one. (OK, any movie by Makoto Shinkai qualifies, and that is why I ordered the DVD of \"5 Centimeters Per Second\" the other day, but I digress\u2026)",

            "content": "[9.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWandering Son blew me away. A series that could've easily harbored so many of the negative qualities I associate romance anime with, such as an overabundance of melodrama, love triangles, and boring characterization was utterly subverted throughout this short, eleven episode run-time. So much so that I honestly felt surprised throughout most of my watch-through. While there is a love triangle, while there is melodrama, although thankfully it is reigned in, the characterization is far from boring and the writer(s) do an impeccable job with keeping you on your toes. This series doesn't go where I thought it would, as it spends it's run-time makingsure you experience a believable story, rather than a concise, palatable one. \\n\\n\r\nRelying on some beautiful, warm, watercolor art with expressive and shockingly exceptional animation, Wandering Son doesn't even skimp on its visuals, setting its tone immediately. This is further emphasized with slow, methodical editing that works symbiotically with equally slow and thoughtful direction. What initially looked somewhat generic slowly sprouted into visually acute, as the director cuts all music and lets scenes breath on their own, with a fair share of intentionally awkward pauses that emphasize the youth and confusion these characters are going through.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Wandering Son succeeds so vigorously at is the ability to tell a lose-fitting story in this confined, semi-contrived environment. A school, where we pull back layers behind characters and everyone in this expansive cast gets their moments of humanization. The bullies aren't bullies, the goofballs aren't goofy, and even the quietest characters get to roar every once in a while. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters & Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nWandering Son follows Shuuichi Nitori, a boy with a knack for cross-dressing, and Yoshino Takatsuki, a girl with a similar interest. What begins as a fascination with the other gender's aesthetic blossoms into curiosity, love, and eventually inner turmoil that there really isn't an answer to. Nitori struggles with the idea of being a boy, what it means to want to be a girl, and how he'd go about being accepted. This is as much as a study on the idea of cross-dressing as it is the concept of being transgender, and that's equally surprising.\\n\\n\r\nColor me cynical, but I was simply not expecting this kind of detail to be present in an anime. Especially not a television anime, a medium that I've constantly spoken against as pandering, sexist, and having an over-reliance on creating objects to sell rather than characters. Yet here I sit, in a medium that has a plethora of television shows all mocking the idea of cross-dressers, transgenders, or simply not even bothering to delve into it at all, letting them be and making them the butt of jokes. \"Traps\" and the like, being a huge cultural meme at this point. It was refreshing to see a take on it that not only examined the idea of being transgender, but doing it in literally the least exploitative way imaginable. That was, perhaps, the biggest subversion of all. \\n\\n\r\nNitori and Takatsuki meet a whole cast of different characters, a cast that is honestly somewhat confusing and vast at first. The first episode, while quite good, left me with a lot of questions and confusion simply due to how many people there were on screen and how different each one was. Each character felt well-placed, too, from the dramatic, soft-spoken, and vicious Chiba, to the totally love-able and goofy Sarashina and her almost parasitically latched-on friend, Shirai. What was so refreshing about this expansive cast is that each one had their list of flaws and positives, even the newer characters introduced at the mid-way point of the series after the new school year starts. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sarashina, a total goof and completely \"open\", in the best possible way, is initially incredibly divisive amongst this already established groups of friends as her abrasive and talkative nature lands her in hot water with Saori, who understandably doesn't appreciate hearing everything this girl has to say. But even Saori, who is, quite frankly, painted a lot like a villain at first in the show, is totally vicious and rude, yet that teen angst feels earned and actually well-established enough for you to see her side of things. Especially with the background we end up realizing she has with Takatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nIf i'm confusing you, then you know how I felt after the first few episodes, and this is only a fraction of the characters. Surprisingly, it all ends up falling in place. What first started as a somewhat obnoxious love-triangle between Nitori, Saori, and Takatsuki, where Nitori is in love with Takatsuki, Saori is in love with Nitori, and Takatsuki is just not romantically interested, ends up completely disintegrating into something significantly more interesting. Character and narrative-wise, the writer(s) take more than that extra needed step to make something as contrived and cliche as a love-triangle palatable, going so far as to totally subvert the notion and we end up in a position that is less romantic and more engaging on a narrative level.\\n\\n\r\nAs the venerable Dan Harmon said when asked on the concept of romance as a genre, \"Romance isn't a genre, it is a topping. Watching the romance genre is like going to a 'salt' restaurant.\" I agree, romance struggles to be compelling all the way through, which is why it is often paired with comedy and other genres to make it more palatable. Here, what initially feels like a romance is at the backdrop of the more important narrative, the identity crisis that a lot of these characters end up going through. \\n\\n\r\nSure, it is somewhat contrived to have one character be gay, two be transgender, and so on. Yet it works here because each one has a different approach. Each one is faces their own demons, and in some cases, no demons at all, as Nitori's good friend hardly struggles with the concept of being attracted to other men, which is so poignant to me as someone who is critical and often expecting every ounce of melodrama to be wrung out of an anime like this.  \\n\\n\r\nYet that never happens. In a way, Wandering son is very much like the anti-Your Lie in April, where I relentlessly criticized that series for having every single moment be this obnoxiously over-the-top emotional breakdown with sappy music and utterly incoherent philosophical babbling from supposed fourteen year olds. Wandering Son tones that down, instead of having kids remark on the nature of their situation with fake nuance, they instead speak to themselves bluntly, and you gain that nuance through the situations they are placed in and the way they react. Which is infinitely more clever and appealing to me. There are no huge, swelling musical pieces as the characters break down crying and confessing to one another. No. Wandering Son cuts the music, it lets you live in the moment as the characters are and experience what they are. Quite frankly, it's fucking awesome. \\n\\n\r\nEven the romance in Wandering Son is often treated like a kind of puppy-love, and while puppy love is real for the puppy, it is what it is. It isn't the end-all of the series because it is tackling a significantly more nuanced idea. Ultimately, the characters shine the brightest in Wandering Son, and while i'm sure there is much more story to tell, what with the looming threat of puberty changing the field once again, as slightly examined towards the end of this series, the way Wandering Son ended felt great in its own way. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Aesthetic]\\n\\n\r\nSo this show is pretty much perfect in its aesthetic, there is very little I would change. Apart from a few moments towards the middle that felt rushed through animation, Wandering Son actually had pretty exceptional animation throughout for a small-budget television anime. In fact, it looked much better than it had any right to. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a warm watercolor aesthetic, where the background was blown-out and the sides of the screen were constantly foggy and white, almost dreamy, it looked great. There were moments of great animation, too, especially with subtle character-driven movements. Animation in general can't nearly be as subtly expressive as live-action, as you often have to resort to tactics such as narration or overblown reactions, yet in this case they really do portray some genuinely subtle moments through only animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe director, Ei Aoki, is outstanding in this series, too. I initially thought the endless loop of piano melodies backing the majority of early episodes was somewhat frustrating, but that loop eventually mellowed out and the director cut a lot of the sound from certain moments, letting them be punctuated by silence, which is a great aesthetic choice as a director. Some scenes were only music, others were only dialogue with no backing track. This made all the difference with these potentially melodramatic scenes ringing incredibly true for these children. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nI think it is needless to say that I really loved this series. It is one of my favorites and it came out of nowhere for me. There are flaws, such as the contrived nature of the plot at first, as well as the initial groan-worthy love-triangle that thankfully blossoms into something engaging. It is also blunt with its symbolism on many occasions, as there are some subtle, nuanced, symbolic moments that are unfortunately back-ended by unneeded characters explaining exactly what just happened. \\n\\n\r\nWhere Wandering Son shines is in its believable characterization of its kids. Sure they address these heady topics perhaps ahead of their age, but the way they do so is so natural and impressive that I can't help but commend this series. It doesn't rely on stringing emotions along or even trying its best to make you cry, because that's not what Wandering Son wants to examine. Unlike something like Your Lie in April, where it constantly tries its best to shove melodramatic bullshit down your throat until you choke some tears out, Wandering Son reigns these emotions in and instead tells a character-driven story about finding yourself and truly accepting who you view yourself as.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aren't what they seem to be. As I said, bullies aren't bullies, even Nitori's sister, who is perhaps the most unlike-able character in this series due to her being \"the bratty sister\", gets some much needed, and surprisingly subtle characterization that made her believable. Not every character has to be someone you like or sympathize with, but as long as they fit the series and further establish your verisimilitude, you should appreciate their existence. \\n\\n\r\nLove doesn't go as planned. Not everything works out perfectly. That is shown constantly throughout Wandering Son. There is no perfect ending where everyone ends up happily together with the people they have crushes on, in fact, the show effortlessly skirts that idea by refraining from focusing on it. Nitori and Takatsuki's similar yet separate struggles are at the forefront here, not any kind of romance you might expect this a series as emotionally in-tune as this to focus on. \\n\\n\r\nWandering Son is exactly what I want from my emotionally powerful anime. Characters make the story, not the other way around, and this series succeeds in that regard with flying colors. Beautiful execution on almost all levels. If you are looking for an anime that is willfully detached from the character-driven cliches of so much romance and school-drama-oriented series', then Wandering Son is perfect for you. If you want anime that is daring, ambitious, well-directed, and ultimately, subtly rewarding, then Wandering Son is undoubtedly for you.",

            "content": "I was really interested in this series' premise, because it doesn't happen often that an anime decides to deal with gender identity disorders, but I was disappointed with the way the topic was developed.\r\nSometimes I have the feeling that, both in anime and manga, authors decide to discuss challenging topics but then don't have the courage to do it thoroughly. This is what I felt watching Hourou Musuko as well. Actually, I don't know if it's because they lack the courage, because they fear the fans' reaction or because they just don't know enough, I guess it depends on the case. In this story itfeels like they just wanted to use the idea because of its originality and not actually to discuss the topic realistically, though up to a certain point I used to think they were trying to be serious about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Nitori, is a middle school boy who likes to dress like a girl. Takatsuki is a girl who likes to dress like a boy. Nitori is presented as being in love with Takatsuki, though she doesn't seem to feel the same. The fact that the two might be in love could be seen as excessively coincidental, but I guess it makes sense that two people with the same \"issue\" are attracted to each other.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a topic, you cannot but wonder about one thing: do Nitori and Takatsuki really feel that they were born the wrong gender? In other words, are we talking about an actual gender identity disorder? At the beginning it looks like it is, since Nitori really seems to feel like a girl, and the topic of sex change surgery is also brought up once. However, as the story progresses, his feelings start to become ambiguous, to the point that he actually starts to date a girl, likes her, and is even portrayed as manly. This didn't sit right with me. What is the point of having him crossdress and behave like a girl, with all the social problems this involves (people thinking you are a weirdo, your parents having to come to terms with it, your own feelings about yourself), if then all this is completely reset? Was he just crossdressing randomly, without any deeper reason? I was quite disappointed with this.\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters of Takatsuki and Chiba more. Takatsuki is more coherent. She really seems to have an issue with her being a girl, and is also more determined when it comes to dressing like a boy. Like Nitori, she doesn't really seem to develop an interest in other people of her own gender, but we don't see her as much so we don't really delve deep into her head.\\n\r\nThe reason I like Chiba is that I find her very human. Her behavior seems excessively cold at first, but the way she feels about other characters and her reasoning are believable.\\n\r\nThe other characters were OK, though most of them we didn't see enough and we only knew them superficially.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple but fitting for the story. The music is also simple and doesn't stand out, but I guess it's fine in this kind of anime. The seiyuu were good. They chose a real boy to voice Nitori, and I think it makes sense. I don't really like it when crossdressing characters have a voice actor of the same gender they're crossdressing as (as in, crossdressing guys being voiced by women etc). It makes it \"too easy\", in a way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a lighthearted, enjoyable anime, but I wish they didn't just discard what seemed to be the main point of the story.",

            "content": "It is extremely rare to find an anime that approaches LGBTQ issues in any serious or in depth manner. The T in LGBTQ seems to get the least attention of all in the anime/manga world. This anime amazingly encompasses both MTF and FTM issues to an extent. It also does not approach it in an offensive or stereotypical way, as most animes that contain and trans character do. As someone who identifies as trans, this was extremely refreshing in an otherwise ignorant community.\r\nThe story was a little slow, but it is about growing up and that is how life can be. I was impressed thatthey incorporated so many little things that go along with dealing with puberty as someone questioning gender (things like feeling pressured to wear a bra or getting your period  or your voice changing actually came up). The pronouns could be an issue, but I would also tack that up to the characters being so young and still so unsure about their concrete genders. It was a very emotional watch for anyone who has to deal with these issues and can also be very triggering, as a bit of a warning. It is good at insinuating how ignorant and sexist/heterosexist society can be about things like relationships, gender behavior, and clothing (particularly school uniforms). Nitorin faces insults like freak and tranny (even the slur \"fag\" comes up) which are very harsh and hurtful words. Nitorin also has to deal with a family who doesn't understand and a sister who bullies \"him\" about his \"cross dressing habit.\" On top of that, Nitorin is dealing with a school system that shames \"his\" behavior and has \"him\" sent home for wearing a girl's uniform (although female characters wearing a boy's uniform are not). Afterwards, he is completely alienated by his class and his supposed friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime asks important questions like \"Why is it wrong to wear the clothes you want to wear?\" They also present relationships in a non-stereotypical way. Nitorin may identify as female, but he still dates a cisgender female in the series. Usually transgenders are viewed as very specifically heterosexual. I think it could be very educational for people who don't understand trans issues or gender fluidity... and especially for those who would label this a \"gender bender\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically character driven. It is all about these character's lives and how they are dealing with these complicated issues. It is about discovering their true selves and learning to cope with that and how society will treat them. Nitorin represents the MTF of the trans community, while Takatsuki is the FTM. The way I see it, Chiba-san is often the bully and transphobic towards both of them. She asks cruel questions in order to hurt them, knowing that their gender identities are a weak spot. She seems to represent the average person pushing their own gender ideals on her friends, regardless of their feelings. This gets more and more evident towards the end of the show. There are a variety of characters, that range from understanding and accepting to very transphobic and ignorant. There was a problem with vagueness regarding more minor characters however. There was no real explanation of the background of Yuki, the transsexual female mentor Nitorin and Takatsuki are friends with. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series because it was something I could relate to, which is extremely rare in the anime community. However, it was triggering and managed to make me very depressed on occasion. Overall, it handled the issue with extreme care, which is rare and very encouraging. I think we need more anime like this. There is very little LGBTQ inclusion in the anime world, after all. It didn't have much of a concrete ending, though, since they were just beginning to delve into bodily changes of puberty when the series ends. I hope they decide to continue the anime as the manga progresses.",

            "content": "This anime, I can't quite put my finger on it.. It's really great and I love this anime, but yet it's not exactly a favourite yet. I do intend to read the manga eventually but for now, I have to say, it's one of those anime that you would end up loving because of the feeling it gives you.\r\nStory: 9 Great\r\nI loved the story. It's a pretty simple concept. A boy who wants to be a girl. Yet, it's such a sensitive and difficult situation. It does let the watcher understand that there's really not much of a difference for a guy to want tobe a girl, from a normal guy or a girl who wants to be a guy. End of the day, they are all humans and have feelings and wishes for things that everyone else wishes for. They just want to be accepted for who they are. It's pretty touching at points especially as you watch him grow up and slowly start to change yet staying true to what he had always believed in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nReally love the art! Seriously, it's the art that made me decide to give this anime a go. I really loved the soft pastel colors and the watercolor and pencils look. It makes it seem a lot more gentle which fits really well with the story. They are after all still kids too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nI really! LOVED the soundtrack. I loved both the starting song and the ending song. The starting song reminds me of school days. :) Like a sunny day dawning in a classroom, or a trip to the beach and happy days spent with friends. I thought it fits the anime pretty well since there is a tight knit of friends and family and how they learn to stick together and accept one another. The ending song seems more personal. It's seems to fit more to Nitori's self, how he feels and thinks. It's almost like I can imagine Nitori rising his head under the bright sun and walking on with everyone accepting him the way he is. The chorus would be when all his friends joins him and they all have a good time together. Both of these songs gives me goosebumps when I listen to them. As for the background music, I could listen to them all on it's own. It's got very nice melodies, some with violins and pianos and at times can be pretty touching or happy light feeling. The songs are what makes me miss the anime whenever I listen to them. Makes me feel sad it's ended and I can't see them move and come to life anymore. I can only continue the story and finding out more about the characters through the manga pages.:(\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is REALLY good. For most characters, I like their personalities. Even the ones I hated at first ends up being not that bad after all. Each character, you get to watch them develop and \"grow up\" and watch how their relationships with each other develop. Nitori is the main character so of course, you will watch him grow the most and feel for him the most. But the supporting characters do play some influence in his growth. It's an anime where you learn to like and feel for the different characters. In the end, you will wish they all find their happiness. :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nReally enjoyed this anime, if not I would not have bothered to write a review for it. There's nothing you won't enjoy about. Except maybe a character in this anime may irritate you but other than that, everything about it is lovely, the music, the theme songs, the characters, the feelings you get with all these combined together. Just listening to the soundtrack right now & it makes me miss this anime very much. :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nI considered it as a 9 instead of a 10 because, as much as I love this anime, it doesn't really end up as one of my top 10 favourite anime. Or maybe it will some day, but it doesn't give me the feeling that I want to re-watch this anime. It's lovely definately!, that's why it's almost got a perfect 10, it's just that I'm not too sure if I'll love it enough to the point that I'll want to rewatch it again in the future. :)",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko's subject matter is rarely dealt with in anime: it explores the issues of gender identity and societal perception of gender roles through the lens of 5th graders, a particular age where puberty is becoming a thing, and clueless kids are changing into romantically involved teenagers. It's a time when kids become more aware of their surroundings, more conscious of their changing feelings; it's the perfect stage to explore how one may feel being an LGBT (lesbian-gay-bi-trans). \r\nNeedless to say, this subject is particularly sensitive given modern society's ambivalence towards LGBT, and anime typically dodges the bullet by giving LGBT characters ridiculously comedic rolesin stories. Not here. For Hourou Musuko, the awareness, exploration, and acceptance of different gender pursuits is handled with great tact and sincerity, as the characters struggle to come to terms with themselves and their judgmental surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Hourou Musuko is its exceptionally understated presentation. There's no dramatization, no really emotional music, no big crying scene\u2026heck, there doesn't seem to be any climactic scene at all. Characters are handled with stringent neutrality, and the scenes are given exactly as they would be, without any particular touch-up. It's as if we're given camera videos following real people as they go on about with their lives. This may seem like a flaw to some, as it's not the most emotionally engaging or exciting way of going about things, but considering the maturity level required for the subject, I find the presentation completely justified, optimal even. \\n\\n\r\nThis issue extends to the characters, as the 5th graders of Hourou Musuko are oftentimes more honest, brave, and mature than most adults could ever be. Never once in the story did I ever consider these characters to be grade schoolers, as they are definitely college+ in spirit with the straight-faced way they handle each other. This begs the question: is it considered a flaw that these characters are not realistic for their age? Personally, I don't think that's the point. While this story does base itself off the feelings of discovery people would experience at the onset of puberty, its core themes of acceptance and coming-to-terms are universal in nature. Essentially, the story is about 5th graders, but is meant to reflect on the LGBT subject for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the realism issue, the character writing itself is absolutely no slouch. Every character is written not to fulfill a certain role or device within the plot, but to be a full-fledged human being with emotions, doubts, and conflicts. That is not to say that the story uses a lot of internal monologues to present these characterizations; in fact, Hourou Musuko might as well be the poster child for the \"show, don't tell\" principle. We are never flat out given what a character is feeling; instead, we evaluate it through their expressions, their body language, and their dialogues. Don't feel like you've been given enough information? Don't get why a character acted a certain way? Go back and rewatch the scenes, or use something called analysis and interpretation (in other words, your brain). Ridiculous, I know. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word I can use to sum up this series, it's mature. Hourou Musuko treats its themes with respect, its characters with respect, and most exceptionally, it treats its audience with respect. We are expected to keep an open mind, to try to understand what the characters are going through, and to use our brain once in a while. We're expected to be mature, to take the subject seriously, and to embrace the themes of acceptance wholeheartedly. That may be setting too high a standard for most people, but heck, I sure wish more anime would follow this example.",

What is it trying to do? It clearly doesn't want to tell a complete, perfectly rounded story, seeing as it begins around volume five of the manga its based, and doesn't end where its source material does. If that's the case, then it's not the best manga promo as well, you aren't getting a good enough grip on the source material after all. So the question remains...\r\nWell, Wandering Son feels like it was crafted to become a documentaryinstead of an adaptation. Beginning at the start of junior high, it closely follows a group of friends, all with complicated relationships and confusing lives. The main character - Nitori - is a transgender girl that's been dressing up as one for a while. He already met the pain and suffering that acting so differently brings, but thanks to Tatsumaki (a transgender boy who she has a crush on), Mako (who's also been trying to be seen as a girl), Chiba (a girl who has a crush on Nitori) and Kanaba (everyone's friend), he managed to get through. Towards the end of primary school, they get into a huge fight, as Nitori confesses her love to Tatsumaki and gets rejected, which also pushes Chiba and Tatsumaki into a conflict.\\n\\n\r\nWith this setup, episode one starts. We see this normal, uninterrupted flow of what appears to be Nitori's and Tatsumaki's daily life, as well as their first day in junior high. While someone like the viewer, looking from the outside, wouldn't call this day particularly normal, seeing as a girl in their class comes in wearing a boy's uniform and we get to see Nitori dress up as a girl and walk around town, it definitely feels like an ordinary day to those kids. The episode flows through beautifully, jumping from scene to scene, place to place, eventually ending up in Nitori's house. After his sister and her model friends leave, Nitori is left all alone in his room.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a beautiful, pink dress hanging on the wall.\\n\\n\r\nWithout much hesitation, Nitori dresses up. A relaxing, charming track begins to play as we see her happily looking at herself. Just another day...\\n\\n\r\nThe music cuts off in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nNitori's sister enters the room.\\n\\n\r\nShe starts ripping the dress off of her, screaming.\\n\\n\r\nNitori pushes her onto the table\\n\\n\r\nShe runs out, wearing nothing but boxers and a tank top.\\n\\n\r\nRunning through the middle of the street, she thinks about how she must look to all those people.\\n\\n\r\nNitori isn't cute in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNitori surely isn't pretty in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNitori definitely isn't a girl in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode one of Wandering son is powerful. It takes you from heaven to hell in an instant. Seeing broken Nitori run through the dimly lit streets left me stunned. But then, just like that, he runs past Tatsumaki who stops him, and they start talking again, him just wanting to help her by covering her with his jacket. And we end up in Nitori's house again, her smiling, going to sleep, as if nothing ever happened. Truly, what we know as normal, isn't normal to her.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, we get to see more and more of what's \"normal\" to Nitori, we see her blushing when someone says she's cute or girly, and the same thing goes for Mako and Tatsumaki. While they're both more secretive about the whole idea, they identify as a different gender already, they want that to be something normal for them. That's their end goal. At the same time, Chiba wants Nitori to be a \"normal boy\", and does see him as such even at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of Wandering Son is very novel, and it works out in the series' favor. This exploration of normality for people that some of us see as weirdness proves rather effective, thanks to the mix of some well put together, typical slice of life elements and the awkwardness and tension during the moments when the scenes handling that topic are presented. It's paced well enough so that I got both of those in measures that satisfied my interests and need for progression while keeping the steady flow of character exposition at all times.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems arise in another department. Simply put, the show feels like a big, emotional dump. Its style ends up being on this feeling of melancholy and overwhelming sadness. And it never leaves. Ever. Even when something silly happens, the voice actors explicitly keep talking or even screaming quietly. It almost feels unnatural at points, tends to take away from the actual emotional scenes, seeing as they all feel the same, monotonous, and it's incredibly draining to watch on top of all that. I understand that a style is a style, but it's not just the fault of the script.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals are what truly makes the whole package too hard to handle. Let me describe the feeling of watching Wandering Son:\\n\r\nImagine a beautifully crafted piano, and someone playing a nice, but rather boring tune on it. Then imagine you being inside that piano, but with headphones.\\n\r\nSure the tune is nice, it isn't loud and the inside of the piano looks marvelous, but at the same time it's really overwhelming to know that you're trapped inside it, and you can feel a pressure over something that surely was never meant to be digested this way. On top of that this song keeps on playing for who knows how long, feeling samey, with only occasional bursts of freshness that end up being a prelude to the monotonous melody once again.\\n\r\nHow do I know that the show isn't supposed to make you feel like this?\\n\r\nWell, maybe because Ei Aoki stated in an interview, that he \"didn't want to put the major focus on transgender as an issue, but more as a way to draw out these characters\". Do you think making the whole show look and feel sad doesn't seem like it puts it as an issue? The color pallet makes the show feel like an oil painting, but the character designs are very dark and don't correlate well if they were going for a natural-feeling look, creating an even more depressing and hard-hitting picture. Someone screwed up, it feels like the director and the artists didn't follow each other's intentions at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this grating feeling persists throughout every second of it, the sheer strength of the writing and the novelty of its idea makes Wandering Son quite a nice journey, highlighting some of the most interesting takes on the topic of transgender people growing up, especially during puberty. Things like self-realization, romantic relationships, personal growth, developing social abilities, planning out the future and understanding adolescence become completely new talking points when viewed from the eyes of such a person.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it isn't a particularly pleasant experience all around, Wandering Son is certainly an unique and interesting piece of art, worth indulging in for numerous reasons, primary one being understanding the world around us more in a interesting way, by indulging in an interesting work that makes you want to see it to the end (just in small doses). Well worth a recommendation, there surely will be many people who will find more to like, or perhaps more to grab onto, than I ever could.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, I recommend you to develop your own.",

The motion is fluent and there're a lot of subtle details,like cherry blossoms falling down, in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST didn't include that many tracks but the tracks that were there really helped to support the mood of the story and the OP and ED were also very well sung. None of the voice actors were bad, but there were also none that really stood out to me, and I guess they were just alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of this anime surely must have been the characters, as I watched the show, I could relate a lot to nearly every character, even the ones who seemed to be rude without any reasons to do so. All of the characters felt very real, with their quirks, flaws and little twists to them. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, as its art and characters really captivated me and would like to stress that this story is one that can be enjoyed by people who have no affinity with anything that's to do with gender or sexuality, and also by people who do.\\n",

            "content": "Now, as a person who comes into contact with the field of sociology every now and then, and by extension discussions on gender and sexuality, the description of this show instantly drew my attention towards it. Sitting down to watch, and spurred on by other reviews, I was expecting to sit down to a deep and interesting series that put a spotlight on gender issues (helped by the title of the first episode \"What Are Little Girls Made of?\"). I...had a bit of a lukewarm reaction to the series.\r\nBefore I get to that though, I want to start off with what I think this seriesdid right. The most important is that this series decided to try and look at the issue seriously. There is little to none anime antics in this series, which is great because the idea of crossdressing characters normally gets played for laughs and serves as an excuse to make a joke. It also didn\u2019t go the other way in terms of temptations by making this a giant angst fest and overdramatic. Instead, it took itself seriously while still keeping an atmosphere of realism and normality (well, it is a slice-of-life series in part..) The character\u2019s don\u2019t feel like clich\u00e9s, and you can get a sense of the awkwardness they are going through during the series, even with some of the issue in the storyline I think exist (which I\u2019m going to get to in a minute). I had some trouble keeping track of who was who sometimes since, instead of going the route of giving people unrealistic hair colors to make more variety, they went with keeping it at more realistic browns and blacks. And sometimes it almost felt like characters came out of nowhere, with just a passing flashback occurring to satisfy the curiosity. Once things get going it\u2019s better though and easier to tell who is who.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest positive I can give though is the animation; it is by far one of the best looking animes I have ever seen. The watercolor style of the series is wonderful. From some other reviews of the series I\u2019ve seen it apparently gives a sense of adolescence and all that, but sadly I\u2019m usually not that perceptive on the relationship between animation styles and storylines so I can\u2019t offer an opinion. All I can say is that it looks good, and I hope to find more series with a similar art style. I think it works great for this kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the negatives, and I'll start with the simplest issue of Takatsuki's side of the story; it kind of got buried under Nitori's, and I'm disappointed that it really didn't get as much attention as it probably should have. However, I can be fair and state an alternate view on this; Takatsuki's story doesn't get as much attention as Nitori's simply because society is more accepting of \"girl wanting to be a boy\" than \"boy wanting to be a girl\" and so less potential for dramatic storytelling. This comes to a head in one of my favorite episodes of the series, and is briefly discussed in character, but still, for being the other main lead I feel Takatsuki's story didn't get the depth that Nitori's did and so it suffers from only getting a few scenes here and there that expand on her internal conflicts. Again though, it may just be because society accepts boyish girls more than girlish boys and so it\u2019s an easier problem for her.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I also have an issue with Nitori's storyline, and that issue is that by the end I feel like we really didn't get anywhere with it. Let me explain. Throughout the series I was waiting for some kind of moment, some kind of discussion on why Nitori wants to be a girl with some level of passion on Nitori's part. Instead, all I got was everyone saying he looked cute, putting him in dresses, and Nitori just kind of accepting it (minus one scene later on, but he gets kind of passive again afterwards). I just really feel like Nitori's wanting to be a girl was TOLD to us more than SHOWN (outside of crossdressing, but cross-dresser=/=transgender), and with all the comments about how 'cute' he was seeming to be the only real reason given for crossdressing, it seemed more like he was wanting to be a girl just to conform to what everyone else wants and what society says is appropriate (guys are handsome and tough, girls are cute and dainty).\\n\\n\r\nAnd so overall, by the end of the series, I almost felt like nothing was that accomplished in terms of the major storylines. I should note this opinion is only relevant to the anime; I have yet to take a look at the manga, and I am tempted to because what I do know of it seems like it may fix some of the issues I'm discussing here. Therefore, it may be safe to say my issues here deal more with the shortness of the series (11 episodes) than an inherent flaw of the premise itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo my final word on this series would be this: if you're interested in a series that has a deep, detailed discussion of gender and sexuality, this is about the best you're going to get. While it could have been handled better, it doesn't do a bad job, and I appreciate the serious look at the topic instead of falling to prey to the more 'comedic' or \u2018angst\u2019 potential of \"gender bending\".",

            "content": "Anime Review No.6\r\nJust finished watching Hourou Musuko and I say this is one great anime. The anime is well made and the production studio didn't failed to portray what is the series all about. Another best slice of life anime I watched this 2015.\r\nReview: The content may contain \"SPOILERS\"\r\nPlot (9/10) \r\nThe story revolves around 3 characters Nitori, Shuuichi, Chiba, Saori and Takatsuki, Yoshino. They are young teens struggling to adapt the new life of  being a middle school student while undergoing the changes in puberty. Suppose to be your typical school life and slice of life anime series but it isn't. Unlike many genericschool life series \"Hourou Musuko\" or \"Wandering Son\" have something that stand out among the rest. The plot discuss the topic of \"transsexualism\" in a way people can learn something about this topic without disgust and hating the show. The anime give great importance how critical the beginning of puberty in developing one's identity and how growing up greatly affect's our goals in life. I like the setting the story took place \"Middle school\" is the perfect place to portray puberty for this where the teenagers start question who they are and what will they become as time goes by. Yes this is the slice of life anime I wanted to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime matched the premise of the plot and the mood of the story. The water color style is nice. The studio really did their best to make the anime background unique and the character design is very well made among other slice of life anime series which uses the same art style for their character design which is pretty boring seeing the same faces over and over again but in this anime you won't see any resemblance as far I see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nI didn't like the Opening of the series which made me think the series is another used slice of life and school life show but men how wrong I was when I watched the series. The background music of the show is a strong point cause the sound made the atmosphere serious while at the same time heart warming. The series did a good job in setting the mood right and ending it properly. I'll shall say the series did well in making it's audience cherish every single moment of the important scenario and this is why how fundamental the background music suppose to be because it's all about building the mood of the plot and especially it's characters. The Ending song \"For You\" by Rie Fu is definitely going to go in my song list. The ending music made the show bright and colorful while at the time you are wondering what will happen next in the following episode. Nice Ending and Nice background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nIn all the school life anime I have watched this year this anime series pull out what those series lack and that is the personality of the characters acting and reacting as real people. You won't be seeing overused tsunderes, danderes and all the deres you can think of in this series and personally I am really annoyed when every time a school life anime is made there always this copy paste personalities you get tired off. The parents and adults in the series made a great contribution in building up the characters in this series and supporting them at times of need. The adults actions proves to be important in guiding the young one's in handling their problems in life which other anime series ignores. The supporting characters here is not just your average \"simple characters\" which work as plot devices to make you feel the story have people in the background while our main characters make dialogues NO! They serve as a great fundamental factor influencing, and shaping our main characters and also they are all likable for each characters for they have genuine personality. In my next preview of an anime series I will do my best to give brief information about each character why they are special and how they are not robots that have copy paste personality from previous show. This show did an amazing job in \"Fleshing Out\" it's every character and this is what characterization is all about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI didn't even notice the time when I finished this series. Every moment is good and interesting. I don't recall I ever get bored in every scene and even most of the time they are just talking to each other I really didn't get bored but instead I get hyped in every word the characters delivered to each other and they deliver great ideas that further build what the series is all about and this why even if this anime is just a simple show about simple people with simple conflicts I have learn to love and Appreciate it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is inspirational for it give you brighter view point about life. Simplicity is true beauty I always say. You don't need mind blowing dialogues, elaborated plot mechanics and over the top budget animation to make a masterpiece or an inspirational show. Hourou Musuko proves that. I highly recommend this series for open minded people about simple aspect of life. Another hidden gem which the masses ignore just because the anime is a \"seemingly generic slice of life and school life show\". They don't know what they are missing. Trust me.",

            "content": "I read the manga since about chapter 3, and at first, admittedly, I was disappointed that the anime made the decision to skip ahead.\r\nBut then I realized -- it sucked you into the story further, because the characters were telling /you/ the story.\r\nHourou Musuko is a tale about two elementary school children who are transgender. Nitori Shuichi wants to become a girl, and Yoshino wishes to be a boy. They become friends and they go on \"dates\" -- where Yoshino dresses as a boy, and Shuichi dresses as a girl. \r\nThe story is quite simple, yet very complex. The way it goes about it islike how the children are experiencing it -- bit by bit. They don't really understand why their desire to be the other gender is wrong. That, and the way Nitori's sister disapproves and thinks he is disgusting is very much how a family member might react. I believe that every character is realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by the way, the transgender thing is /not/ a convenient, or sexual, plot device.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're searching for a heartwarming story about the struggles of two transgender children growing up, then definitely watch this. If you are an idiot who wants a comedy and doesn't understand deep storylines, avoid it. But in my case, this is definitely one of my favorite anime of the year and I'm looking forward to what kind of ending the anime will show. \\n\\n\r\nI think the water color-like art is beautiful and it fits the series very well. The music is soft, and the music they play during the emotional scenes brings the story to life even better. I love the voices, too -- Nitori sounds boyish, but also quite feminine, like a boy who hasn't quite yet hit puberty should sound.",

            "content": "Within the first couple seconds, I knew Hourou Musuko would be unlike anything I had ever watched before. For those who are too lazy to look above, Hourou Musuko is the story of two friends: a boy (Sh\u016bichi Nitori) who wants to be a girl and a girl (Yoshino Takatsuki) who wants to be a boy. As one can infer, the anime has a lot of themes relating to sexuality (cross-dressing, gender identity, puberty, etc.) That being said, it is definitely not for everyone, like if you have a problem with gays, lesbians, cross-dressers, etc. or if you don't like to think too hard aboutyour anime. But for the rest of us, Horou Musuko may very well be one of the best anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAnd you thought being a teenager was awkward for you...\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Hourou Musuko shows the everyday trials and tribulations of middle schoolers, straight, cross-dressing, gay, whatever. The themes of sexuality are a big part of this so this makes it especially good for those of us who are or know someone who is LGBT. While I, myself, am not LGBT, many of my close friends and family are. This anime really accuratley portrayed the struggles of sexuality and finding one's self. The story is really (for lack of better terms) refreshing and wonderful however it can be somewhat confusing, especially in the first episode. Those who have read the manga say that it doesn't make much sense to those who haven't read it but I (having not read the manga) was able to make sense of it. A suggestion to those who are planning to watch: have a list of characters so you can match up faces with names. It really does help. But the story, to put it another way, is simply beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWhen watching Hourou Musuko, one might compare it to walking through a watercolor painting. The art is lovely and evokes just the right amount of nostalgia. The art style is not the anime stereotype with large eyes and a rainbow of hair colors. It's fittingly realistic and the animation is right on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nIn keeping with the theme, the music and acting in Hourou Musuko is really something. Simple yet tender piano melodies make up most of the score while there are some pieces that fit right in with comic scenes. The voice actors do their jobs and do them well. The cast has many new faces (er, well, voices) like Asami Seto who debuts as Takatsuki. They really give the anime that feeling of reality and make it seem plausible. Thumbs up for newbies!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAlthough it's hard to keep track of who's who (especially in the first episode), all the characters are really unique and unforgettable. Their feelings really come across and not in an overly dramatic way, either. No one's the bad guy and there are no losers; rather, everyone is able to tell their side of the story and justify their actions. The relationships are remarkably real and really do stir up that feeling of nostalgia (first love, friendships lost, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nReally, it's a high nine so more like 9.7 or something (I'm very hesitant to give out 10s!)\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, Hourou Musuko is an amazingly realistic story that is somewhat sad and definitely will leave you feeling nostalgic. The art and music are both gorgeous and add to the overall feeling of the story. The voices actors are effective in their parts in getting the characters' feelings across and the characters themselves are each unique. Their awkward teenage relationships make the story something that I (and hopefully you) won't forget anytime soon. \\n",

            "content": "There is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that a poorly researched work on a touchy subject can frustrate people off. The anime medium is infamous for blatantly using offensive stereotypes; One Piece is one of the weirdest examples out there for attacking racism and then, using racial stereotypes.\r\nThen, there\u2019s the animes that deal with the LGBT community.\r\nStereotyped as flamboyant creatures, the LGBT community suffers through insulting stereotypes and invectives. One of the least prominent group of the LGBT body is transgender community; there is so little focus on them. As far as most ignorant people are concerned, they are crossdressers. Nothing more.\r\nHourou Musuko, or WanderingSon, is a work, based on the bestselling manga, that focuses on crossdressers, puberty, and transgender issues. It serves to educate -- and entertain -- viewers about gender identity. What does it mean to be a boy or a girl? Why do people have so many problems with guys dressing up as girls? Are crossdressers \u201cweird\u201d? \\n\\n\r\nThe work tackles these questions through the eyes of Nitori Shuichi. He never like being a boy; he always feels he should have been a girl. Takatsuki Yoshino, a girl, wishes she is born as a boy. She hates wearing girly clothing. Both these main characters feel strangled over societal norms on gender issues and this anime adaptation does great justice in focusing their struggles. \\n\\n\r\nBecause this work starts in medias res, the drama immediately starts and that is one of its greatest strengths. It doesn\u2019t waddle on setting the work; the work has an inviting introduction that explains most of the events explained in the manga in the first episode. Personally, the first episode is one of my favorite first episodes out there; it is so impressive that I said, \u201cWow.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile it rests on the familiar tropes and archetypes, there is an engaging twist on everything. If you think love triangles are the most boring trope out there, Hourou Musuko will flabbergast you. Chiba Saori, a straight female character, falls in love with Nitori as a girl while Nitori has a crush on Takatsuki. The love triangle situation grows even more complex and captures the viewers\u2019 imagination. Dramatic and slice-of-life situations are there for a reason: to characterize. There is nothing redundant about them and everything feels well-placed. Interestingly enough, the work climaxes on the silly anime cliche: a play in a cultural festival; however, it is one of the best endings out there in anime. \\n\\n\r\nEverything about the characters feels realistic. Nitori and Takatsuki are definitely two of the best written LGBT characters out there; they act like people in real life facing actual dramatic situations. Except they have problems identifying themselves. Saori, while being a more unconventional -- and almost insane -- character, has a degree of believability. Ariga Makoto, Suehiro Anna, and Doi Shinpei -- despite their labels as supporting characters -- are strong characters that complement the drama in the work; it seems bizarre to call them supporting characters. While Sarashina Chizuru may vex viewers, her placement is a necessary evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe minimalist watercolor palette for its art is powerful. Bright colors and thin outlines almost feel like you are viewing a moving watercolor painting. Lush backgrounds have never been this interesting. The character designs look fantastic and dynamic. What can I say? Hourou Musuko\u2019s art style is unbelievably incredible.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cItsudatte\u201d by Daisuke is a charming acoustic piece for an OP: clear vocals, catchy acoustic pieces, fantastic lyrics. While I find it hilarious that the OP focuses on furniture and symbols, its symbolism is worthy of praise. It introduces the serious yet enchanting elements of this work. The ED, \u201cFor You\u201d by Rie Fu, is a soothing pop music, but loses its memorability quickly.\\n\\n\r\nFans argue that its noitaminA\u2019s position creates problems with this work. Its 11 episode structure has condensed the work quite significantly. Despite that, it is an excellent way to introduce viewers to the manga; its easygoingness gives little problems.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does Hourou Musuko compare to the likes of other slice-of-life works? Excellent. Its pleasant nature does not scare off viewers; rather, it educates them about the issues. The animation staff did not back off from the issues, no matter the consequences. That, to me, is admirable.",

            "content": "It's strange to think about the roles that we fall into based on our inborn qualities and the societies in which we live. The very existence of the term \u201ccross-dressing\u201d seems to rely on the assumption that there's a \u201cright\u201d way to anoint ourselves with clothes to wear based on our sex, and to do otherwise is to risk social exile. But what if a boy doesn't want to look like or act like a boy, and what if a girl doesn't want to develop into a woman? Do we have any freedom in this regard, or are we slaves to birth and societal convention?Wandering Son is a series which looks at the implications of these and other ideas by taking a peek into the life of a middle school student: The feminine boy, Nitori, who privately cross-dresses and begins to identify as a girl. Sometimes at odds with others, and always at odds with himself, he walks through some confusing years searching for the answers to countless complicated questions.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSimple, but effective\u201d is a phrase that could describe Wandering Son on a couple of levels, but it's most immediately noticeable in the artwork. The color scheme is warm, consisting mostly of pastel pinks and yellows. Backgrounds are reasonably detailed, and they fade into a sea of off-white around the edges, like a drawing on canvas. At the most basic level, you could call the character designs generic, but they're drawn with the same light, rounded watercolor touch that's applied to the backgrounds, and the result is a world that's appealing to the eyes, as inviting and agreeable as it is distinctive. Each scene looks like a moving painting, remarkably fluid, with no out-of-place elements or sharp contrasts to break the sense of consistency. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound share many of those same qualities. Short of some obligatory \u201clight and cheerful\u201d music for the more upbeat school scenes, the series mostly relies on a seemingly limitless series of piano melodies. Dramas can sometimes be guilty of leaning too heavily on the sound of the piano, but in this case there are a surprisingly large variety of tracks, and they run the tonal gamut from soft and somber to soaring and hopeful, so it didn't bother me in the least. What's more interesting is the show's willingness to use atmospheric noise in place of music. The soft ticking of a clock during a lull in conversation can become harsh and accusing, as can that normally-harmless loop of muzak playing in the karaoke place. In one heart-stopping scene, the shrill cry of cicadas and the beat of slow footsteps are all we can hear as an antagonistic classmate approaches the vulnerable main character behind a closed door, his motives unclear. In this regard, the series can produce an immense amount of tension and audience involvement from practically nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are both a blessing and a curse. Get ready to be completely and utterly lost as early as three minutes into the first episode: The cast is huge, and with the exception of two leads, Nitori and Takatsuki, none of the characters are explicitly introduced in any sort of depth. To make matters worse, in addition to their given name, every character is also referred to by several nicknames, so you can definitely expect to play a little who's-who early in the series. Many of the characters knew each other in past years, but this is touched on very briefly, and the series seems to take it for granted that we'll be able to grasp everyone's histories. To be fair, if you're paying close attention, you can do just that, but it's definitely a tasking introduction that might be a little more complicated than it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also falters a little when it comes to making the lead roles feel believable. It's difficult to write children with true accuracy, but this is an extreme case; within this series, there are at least three middle schoolers who, by all indications, are more mature and intelligent than most adults. Nitori and Takatsuki are both unflinchingly honest and up-front about their motivations and desires, and Saori, the third lead, is a little girl who has the steely composure and resolve of a professional hitman. In one scene, Saori's mother asks her what she plans to do with her life, and Saori sullenly responds that, if all else fails, she could \u201cjust be somebody's mistress.\u201d You'll pardon me for thinking that seems like an unlikely response from an eleven-year-old, and it's a drop in the bucket of unrealistic behavior exhibited by children throughout the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the characters are a flop, though. Nitori is a character in a state of internal turmoil, trying his best to make sense of himself and work through confusion that most people could only imagine. It all shows through in his tepid behavior, his shyness, his inability to truly feel comfortable amongst others. He's complex, and believable as a person, just not as a child. By and large, the supporting characters are put to good use\u2014as mentioned, they're many in number, so I can't dig into everyone, but some standouts include: Sarashina, a brazen and upbeat girl whose positive attitude and strong sense of identity make her a good role model for Nitori; Ariga, Nitori's friend and confidant who also has the desire to cross-dress; and Maho, Nitori's sister who, like true family, can somehow manage to be simultaneously spiteful and kind. The sense of realism isn't quite up to par, but there's definitely a lot of good chemistry between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEven by slice-of-life/drama standards, there really isn't much in the way of a conventional story here. Each episode is just a day or two in the life of Nitori as he faces numerous problems. In many ways, Nitori is the story\u2014numerous subplots raise meaningful inquiries about him and the way that he is going to live his life. He starts to undergo puberty, he finds himself attracted to his sister's friend, he is conflicted about whether or not he should cross-dress at school. These beg some questions; how will he handle it when he is too \u201cboyish\u201d to convincingly cross-dress? Will he be able to have a meaningful relationship with the opposite sex despite his own confused state? Will he live in secrecy, or be open about his desire to be a girl? The series is good at provoking these sorts of thoughts without ever being too explicit about them.\\n\\n\r\nIn that same vein, Wandering Son really does have something that's absent from most dramas, and that is a sense of emotional understatement. It generates tension the same way that tension is generated in real life. Awkward silences; sometimes words unspoken are worse than those that are. Simultaneous sidelong glances in which both parties drop their eyes; just returning the gaze of a person you no longer call \u201cfriend\u201d can be disquieting. A white flag offered by someone who has wronged you in the past; you want to let bygones be bygones, but you never can tell who's genuine and who isn't. Over time, Wandering Son collects all of these realities and more, hones them to their most disconcerting and incisive forms, and then uses them to great effect. The scene that I would consider to be the show's climax is so soft and unassuming, yet so full of visceral impact, that it's tough to even describe. Bad dramas default to artificially emotional screaming and crying. The good dramas are the ones that are built on the understanding that sometimes life is just so damn cold, silent, and uncomfortable that screaming and crying become a welcome change of pace, the finish line of an emotional gauntlet rather than the start. To that end, this series passes with flying colors. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ultimately ends up marring Wandering Son more than anything is its treatment of its themes. Don't think for a second that I won't commend the show for taking an idea that's often denigrated to the rank of a joke and bringing it up to center stage, because I will. It's daring, original, and respectful, and I respect that to no end. The series is great at  presenting insightful questions. But it cheapens itself a little bit when attempting to provide the answers. For all of the inner toiling, the complexity of the problems faced by the characters, the series ultimately ends up being permeated and diluted by the same overly simplistic \u201cjust be yourself and everything is gonna be okey-dokey\u201d message that seems to be omnipresent in all forms of media. My own cynicism notwithstanding, there's nothing terribly wrong with that message in and of itself, but in this context, it's little more than a cop-out, a juvenile thematic resolution crudely tacked onto an otherwise mature and involving experience. It turns Wandering Son into an inarticulate meditation on the topic at hand rather than a full-blown attempt to embrace it, and for lack of a better phrase, it's a crying shame.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, there's plenty to appreciate here, and if you lean at all towards the slice-of-life/drama genres, or if you're just intrigued by the idea but sitting on the fence about whether or not it's worth your time, this is an easy enough recommendation. It doesn't carry nearly as much weight as it might have, but it's still the kind of uniquely artistic and effective series that I wish was a little more prevalent in the entertainment landscape.",

            "content": "Let me get this straight, I usually don\u2019t watch gender-bender series or anything that is related to the genre. Actually, I don\u2019t recall one anime that I saw that the focus was with cross-dressing of any sort. That said, Wandering Son would actually be the first anime that I have seen that made usage of this trope. And to be honest, it came to be one of the best series of the winter 2011.  Wandering Son is a short and calm anime that was enjoyable for its simple, but thoughtful story.\r\nWandering Son starts off with an interesting structure. Instead of starting from an extremity,the beginning or the ending, the anime begins somewhere in the middle of the original story. Of course, it is assuming that either the viewer is familiar with the manga or is watching the series seriously. I\u2019m saying this because it is easy to get lost in the anime as it refers a lot to pass events and it is mostly through dialogue than flashbacks. Actually, I applaud the director for using such a direction, simply because that the story works on already constructed and broken relations rather than focusing on making some. However, where the story keeps its real strength is in the problematic itself. Of course, our main characters have an idea of cross-dressing and wanting to be the opposite sex, but such dilemma is never blatantly exposed in the anime, nor does it make it over-dramatic.  Instead, Wandering Son almost works as a slice of life. And by that I do not mean IT IS a slice of life, since it is absolutely not, but the story is found between the lines, between the dialogues and the actions of the characters. This way, the anime is helped by a correct blend between light moments and drama. While it is mostly a serious show, the happy moments are never actually forced and it sometimes it is not really sure if a scene was to be happy or sad. Ironically, the lack of focus in the story can also be a weak point for some, as it may get hard to get into a story that doesn\u2019t really shows itself. From this point, it is really a matter of preference. Personally, I think the calm development is the best way to go, since a direct focus would make it too dramatic for nothing. Of course, the story wouldn\u2019t matter without its cast, which exactly knows what it has to do.\\n\\n\r\nWandering Son has a relatively large cast. Only, it is clear that the anime only focus on the main characters rather than the supportive cast.  This way, the small amount of 11 episodes is enough for the viewer to learn about the characters that are really important to the show. As for the others, they play their supportive role very well and that is a big plus point in the series. What is really fascinating about the cast is really the way they are used as whole rather than individually. More precisely, the representation of the classroom can almost be taken as one big character. The chemistry of the students is something I\u2019ve rarely seen in the medium. Individually, the characters aren\u2019t bad at all, but there is a tad annoyance. Looking at characters such as Nitori, Takatsuki and Chiba, they are certainly well written characters. However, especially for Chiba, their way of thinking can often look too far away from the physical age. It\u2019s always hard to represent children or prepubescent teen correctly and realistically in anime and Wandering Son certainly doesn\u2019t have the best one of them all. Of course, I might be wrong on this one, but the characters really were too mature for their age. Though, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem since it works greatly with the story and the feeling of the anime. Childish characters wouldn\u2019t go well with subjects such as gender crisis and the fear of puberty.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack. While the opening song might be debatable, (I for myself wasn\u2019t a big fan of it) the series itself is helped by wonderful melodramatic piano compositions. A prime example is in the first episode where Claire de Lune is played at the end. Not only I respect them for the use of a very popular composition, but it was also completely fitting with the situation. The music is never poignant in Wandering Son. Instead, it is played gently and calmly in the background. You don\u2019t really pay attention, but you know it is well there. As for the voice acting, glad to know that it wasn\u2019t a typical high pitched voice you would often see with children.  For most of them, they did a really good job, and while Nitori had mostly a monotone voice, it went very well with its personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point that is easy to notice in Wandering Son is the artwork which is very similar to book art. I don\u2019t know the reason behind this, but I found it to be relieving. In contrast to the melancholy feeling of the series, the light pastel colors help the viewer to go through the whole series and take it as a lighter anime. The character design is meant to be normal in this show, and so it\u2019s usual for them to look like typical children. However, the artwork is enough to make them look different from the mass. I just can\u2019t say it enough; I simply fell in love with the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nTo fill it up completely, Wandering Son is simply a good anime that blends dramatics elements with lighter ones in the best way possible. Even though the style might not be your cup of tea, which is a valid point, I still recommend it to everyone who wants to try something serious once in a while. Really, it shows how the anime industry is still trying to give us original titles rather than the same formula over and over again.\\n",

That\u2019s what little boys are made of.\u201d \r\nThe third movement of Debussy\u2019s Bergasmasque Suite plays softly in the background as a strong gust blows hundreds of cherry blossoms in the night sky. It\u2019s a fitting piece not only for setting such a tranquil mood, but also referencing Paul Verdaine\u2019s poem, Clair de Lune, whose first stanza is a decently fitting representation of what may be one of the most beautifully written slice of life anime out there.\r\n\u201cYour soul is a chosen landscape\r\nWhere charming masqueraders and bergamaskers go\r\nPlaying the lute and dancing andalmost\\n\r\nSad beneath their fanciful disguises.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko is a story about Shuiichi Nitori, a boy who wants to be a girl, Yoshino Takatsuki, a girl who wants to be a boy, and a cast consisting of their friends and acquaintances as they navigate through the issues of puberty, transsexuality, and gender identity.\\n\\n\r\nI usually state in my reviews that the anime in question has a simple premise, but Hourou Musuko\u2019s is anything but that. The issues that the show tackles are complex and filled with varying perspectives and challenges. The show doesn\u2019t sugar coat the current state of people\u2019s views of the transgender community.  Yes, there are many who understand one\u2019s plight and predicament, but often times, he or she may be almost entirely alone, forced to don a set of clothes that may not echo with their true identity, and changing clothes when nobody is looking to feel more  like themselves. There are characters in this story that aren\u2019t very accepting, or uncomfortable, or have strange fetishes that just make things worse, or are confused and externalize their confusion into near bullying.  There are many people, even friends, family, and loved ones, who are certainly not ready to accept Nitori for the person he wants to be. Hourou Musuko doesn\u2019t offer a perfect world for our protagonists to live in and be happy. It\u2019s a confusing and trying time, with just the right amount of help from great role models to push our protagonists towards understanding themselves and the growth they\u2019re experiencing.\\n\\n\r\nIn this sense, it was brilliant to tackle them from the perspectives of children, who are not only innocent, but easily influenced, confused, and prone to unpredictable outbreaks of emotion and anger. I felt like such an angle gave a lot more depth, with the perspectives of children and their older peers and adults on Nitori\u2019s cross dressing a major motif in the story. The story\u2019s most powerful message is of personal acceptance and coming to terms with one\u2019s identity and physical changes that are taking place in one\u2019s body. I truly believe that taking the perspective of kids empowered this message, as it removes any potential fluff in high school dramas while pinpointing the most confusing time for some of us all: the beginning of puberty.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would imagine it\u2019s really hard to write children, and as we\u2019ve seen from many movies revolving around children (most recently the disaster known as Ender\u2019s Game), children can really suck if not done right. \\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko has no such problems, and while I have to fault them for having some children (predominantly Chiba Saori, ironically one of my favorite characters) that act way older than they really appear, at the end of the day Hourou Musuko is powered by a really strong cast of characters that each fit their own role in their story, no matter how small it is. It\u2019s really refreshing to see a cast that\u2019s so varied and each serving a variety of important purposes and aren\u2019t just lifeless plot devices.  \\n\\n\r\nNitori\u2019s best friend Mako is a fantastic foil character, bordering on the line of supporting his friend and envying him. The bombastic and tomboyish Sarashina serve as surprisingly good comic relief and sort of early role model for Tataksuki, who is interested in wearing more boyish clothes. The little girl Sasa is a mediator, trying to keep her friends together despite various conflicts, and she might be one of the characters a good portion of the audience might sympathize with. There are too many others for me to cover, but for such a short show, Hourou Musuko gives life to these characters and give them purpose, though it could be said that they needed to be a bit more fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the three main characters, Nitori, Takatsuki, and Chiba Saori that get the most amount of development, and I think the three of them played such an interesting dynamic. I think Nitori and Takatsuki speak for themselves as the show\u2019s two main protagonists, but Saori is definitely one of the more complex characters in the show, and she played kind of an antagonistic role, always causing problems for her own selfish needs. She\u2019s blunt, and despite her brutal honesty to other people about her opinions she is least honest to herself. Her inability to externalize some of her deeper feelings and get along with people meshed her romantic feelings made her likable despite how mean she was to everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hourou Musuko has great characters, and I think despite the fact that many may act over their age level, I think that\u2019s a small and irrelevant point in the long run. While it\u2019s true that children should be portrayed realistically, the end goal is the thematic elements that are what makes the show really powerful. To that extent, the children are portrayed realistically. They may have lines that hint at more deep thought, but it\u2019s their quirks, confusion with feelings of love, innocence and inability to process between what is socially acceptable and what is not, and unpredictability that makes them children. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko is a really good looking show, and it\u2019s unique too. I must admit that the watercolor-ish look at the beginning seemed a bit too bright for me, but it really grew as the show went on. The character designs are also nice. I thought both Nitori and Takatsuki were drawn really well to demonstrate that they could look both like a boy or a girl. I think they changed Saori from her original appearance in the manga, but I think that only strengthened her presence in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there\u2019s nothing particularly spectacular about the animation. The art is where the main compliments are had, and ultimately the show is less about animation as it is about the writing, but I do think their use of facial expressions were really spot on. You could really tell people\u2019s attitude from how they were drawn, the look in their eyes, their smile or apathetic frown. I thought that attention to detail was really important.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not particularly impressed by most of Hourou Musuko\u2019s music, but I think that was intended since it was a kind of quiet piece that really didn\u2019t have a need for any kind of outstanding score. The soundtrack was mostly very forgettable outside of three pieces, which was their rendition of Clair de Lune, the opening, and the ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are composed mostly of a piano and a guitar, and I think that those make for quiet and peaceful tracks. They have melodies but are mostly unimpressive compared to the  quality of everything else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a great time watching Hourou Musuko. I haven\u2019t watched too much school based slice of life/drama/comedy (more than most people though), but Hourou Musuko takes the cake for the best and most powerful school/drama anime I have ever watched. Its messages are powerful, thought provoking, and long lasting. This is an instant recommendation to a lot of my friends who are looking for good slice of life, and all of my transgender friends have cried and have sung only praises for such a realistic portrayal of the struggles of the TG community.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show, while I may not directly relate to, are very interesting and multilayered. They all have their own qualities and I\u2019m sure many will be bound to find at least one character to really like and look forward to seeing.  The show has a great balance of comedy and drama too, without forcing melodramatic scenes down our throats at all. The writing and dialogue was great and demonstrated a mastery of narrative and storytelling. Sometimes Hourou Musuko even read almost like a poem, with beautiful passages short and expressive. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as the ending of this show came around, and the sound of applause began to echo in my ears, I could only clap along with everyone else. This seems like an overlooked gem in the anime community, and I sincerely hope you take my words and give this show a chance. I can only imagine which expression you may relate with when those final curtains rise on this magnificent performance.",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko starts with questioning what little girls and boys are made of. It illuminates the role of sex in the construction of \u201cnatural\u201d or coherent sexuality and gender, and the disheartening repercussions that the individuals, who fail to conform to what is socially accepted, experience. Further, the plotline sensibly uses the onset of puberty to intricately and realistically show that in this socially constructed world, we are bounded by to what has been \u201cnormalized\u201d\u2014boys must wear pants and girls must wear skirts. Together with the simple clean art and easy melodies, this series is crafted in a remarkably sensitive and moving way.\r\nNitori and Takatsukiare the two main characters, who both struggle with gender crisis. Nitori is feminine by nature but trapped in a male body, same with Takatsuki who is masculine by nature however ensnared in a female body. Both clearly demonstrate the challenges of having binary sex system or the society's practice of heterosexuality. The plot visibly shows that the supposed blatancy of sex as a natural biological fact indicates to how intensely its production in discourse is concealed. For instance, Takatsuki agonizes girlhood because no matter how hard she flattens her chest, she cannot avoid wearing a bra for she can never stop her breast from growing. Likewise with Nitori, he vacillates boyhood because as soon as his body hairs grow, it\u2019ll be harder for him to wear skirts and dresses. Moreover, the predicament of the storyline exists not just because of characters\u2019 inner conflicts, they are also suffering overtly from being alienated and discriminated because their desired sexed bodies and gender roles are beyond what is \u201cnaturalized\u201d by the society. In these scenarios, I like how these dilemmas are beautifully illustrated by the characters\u2019 portrayal of genuine human emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Hourou Musuko for those who want to see a simple storyline but yet complex depiction of transexualism, and question humanity. If you find this subject offending, then this is not for you. Also, when watching this anime, try to perceive as if you\u2019re sexless and genderless to fully discern how society materializes bodies to create boundaries and differentiate what is accepted from not.",

            "content": "I've been waiting since June to see this manga be made into an anime, and I wasn't disappointed. The anime starts when Nitori-san and Takatsuki-kun enter junior high school. It does accommodate the story of the manga before they entered junior high school, and I think it does a pretty good job of explaining to people new to the series the premise and what happened before this time.\r\nStory\r\nAs in the manga, the story shows an accurate view of what transsexual children/teenagers must face in their life. My only quip is that it doesn't show quite how depressing those feelings are in the manga or anime;however, if it did, the story wouldn't be very good because the main characters would be depressed all the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation was done very well; all the drawings are uniform in appearance, with nothing seeming out of place. The overall style of the anime still shows the very simple style of the manga, which really helped to make it feel right. The art itself is done in light, but very vibrant colors. It gives a very simple and beautiful appearance, which belays the depth of the issues in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't greatly impressed by the music, the simple piano tunes fit with the animation very well. There were a few pieces  that I really liked, and the rest wasn't too bad, either. Not my personal choice, but it fits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are still wonderful; showing depth in their issues and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is where I feel the need to put a \"Your mileage may vary\" warning. This anime is very beautiful to me, but to some, it might be boring or offensive, if you happen to have something against transsexuals (obviously, it's not meant for you, then). If you happen to be a transsexual like myself, or some other type of gender variant, than you will probably find this anime enjoyable just for being able to relate to it. If not, then you might just find it interesting. Either way, it's really a \"You'll enjoy it, or you won't\" kind of deal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI loved it, and would recommend it to anyone who I thought would like it. I would, of course, suggest reading the manga too. A resounding 10, for the beauty of the characters and the story, and for being able to portray such a difficult topic in an understandable way.",

            "content": "\"Roses are red, Violets are blue.\" The phrase is used as the subtitle of the first episode and sums up the conflict of the entire series.\r\nOne of the main ways we learn about the world is by being told. Told by those which we accept as our elders, an authority on the subject perhaps. They tell us how we should act, how we should be. They tell us what normal is, what's acceptable, and what is not. Roses are red, and violets are blue, boys are supposed to be one way and girls another. Anything that strays from those guidelines and doesn't fit into themould are regarded as deviants. They are treated with disgust, or perhaps pitied as though they were ill. All the while you wonder that if you don't fit that mould, does that make you something else. This flower is clearly a rose, but it isn't red.\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko deals with a group of middle school students, two of whom are just now wondering why things aren't the way they were supposed to be and how they are isolated and shunned because of it. They search for ways to cope, while wondering whats in store for them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this to anyone who has the chance to watch it. The subject matter may be beyond the comfort zone for some, but really settles in with you once you give it a chance. While it focuses on a very specific manifestation of the problem, it highlights a fundamental flaw in our social systems which encompasses many different subjects. If you're looking for something which will tug on your heart strings and wonder about the world, this is it.",

            "content": "[Based on episodes 1-6 of the anime.]\r\nStory/Characters: 7/10 of 10\r\nIf you are in the market for a touching story with a lot of emotion and drama, this could be the show for you this season. If you are looking for action, fan service, or comedy, look elsewhere. (There are plenty of options!) For those of you familiar with the manga, you might want to know that the story appears to pick up in the middle. The manga starts when they are in 5th grade, but the anime starts on the first day of middle school. A lot of the history that is under the bridgefor our two protagonists is presented via flashback sequences that bring us up to speed on where the characters have been and how they got where they are today.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest knock on the show is that it doesn't really have any plot. It is completely slice-of-life drama. There is not anything to drive the story. It just brings you along to watch as these youngsters learn about themselves and the world around them. In my opinion, that is a minor flaw at best, as the writing and the pacing of the show is such that you really get a good emotional feel for the characters, and that is the real payoff in this show\\n\\n\r\nAnother possible complaint is that it is hard to follow. The show does not stop to explain anything to you about any of the characters, and there are a whole lot of them! (This can also be viewed as a strength, as it shows that the creators have enough respect for the viewer to let them figure out the story on their own without spoon-feeding it to them. Frankly, too much expository material can ruin slice-of-life stories, as they then turn into lectures and lose the natural feel that makes them enjoyable in the first place.) Frequently, I find myself uncertain of who is who early in an episode, but as the show has gone on, that happens less often. And that is a good thing, because the characters are one of the real strengths of the show! They are well-rounded, fully vibrant characters with quirks and nuances that make them come to life in your mind. The one thing that might strike some as false is the unnatural maturity of some of these middle school age kids, but being the father of a middle school boy who is active in things like scholastic bowl and orchestra, I can say that I don't find them that unnaturally mature. (In the event that he reads this review, I have to add that I am, of course, referring to his wonderfully mature friends, not him! LOL! ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength of the series is the art. Looking like moving watercolor paintings, every detail is lovingly drawn to elicit the mood the story requires. The backgrounds and characters are exquisitely done. The only criticism I have is that some of the characters are a bit too similar to each other, but I think that is more of a problem with the lack of explanation of who is who than with the art. After a few episodes, I was able to distinguish the characters well enough, except when you aren't supposed to be able to! (There is a character that appears very differently than they had earlier in one of the episodes, and I think you are supposed to be a bit confused until their name is said.)\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the soft watercolors and washed-out backgrounds emulate the style of the manga, which has been referred to as \"minimalist\" in its artistic style. That carries through to the anime, with the art having wonderful detail, but no more or less than is absolutely needed. It never feels like there is too much to see to truly appreciate a scene, but at the same time, each scene is rich enough to convey its message without the viewer feeling there is anything missing. The emotional impact of the images themselves is considerable. The art is impressive!\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound Effects: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show (\"Itsudatte.\" by Daisuke) is strong, bringing the viewer into the story with just the right mood, but where the music really shines is the excellent ED (\"For You\" by Rie Fu). The song has the ability to elicit tears all on its own, with a keen sense of longing and devotion, yet an uplifting and optimistic feeling as the song progresses. The spartan animation, consisting of Sh\u016bichi walking along stoically on a blank background, then having his movement become more animated and girlish when the music returns to the chorus and the air is filled with cherry blossoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe music inside the episodes is very understated and well done. It knows when to emphasize the mood and when to remain in the background for support, but it also knows when to go away entirely and let the awkward silence or the natural background sounds fill the space, cementing the mood in that situation as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic show. It is heartfelt and warm, with great respect for its characters and the viewers ability to understand the story with minimal expository material. It may not be my favorite of the season, as there are shows that are more \"fun\" in the moment and more stimulating. However, in the long run I expect that it will rank among my favorite shows of all time and I will probably buy the BluRay and watch it time and again when I am in the mood for some deep character drama. There are many places to go to get a good romantic comedy or a nice suspenseful action show or even a raunchy, fan service laden ecchi fest. There are very few sources for exquisite art combined with rich character drama and deep emotion, and Wandering Son is one. (OK, any movie by Makoto Shinkai qualifies, and that is why I ordered the DVD of \"5 Centimeters Per Second\" the other day, but I digress\u2026)",

            "content": "[9.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWandering Son blew me away. A series that could've easily harbored so many of the negative qualities I associate romance anime with, such as an overabundance of melodrama, love triangles, and boring characterization was utterly subverted throughout this short, eleven episode run-time. So much so that I honestly felt surprised throughout most of my watch-through. While there is a love triangle, while there is melodrama, although thankfully it is reigned in, the characterization is far from boring and the writer(s) do an impeccable job with keeping you on your toes. This series doesn't go where I thought it would, as it spends it's run-time makingsure you experience a believable story, rather than a concise, palatable one. \\n\\n\r\nRelying on some beautiful, warm, watercolor art with expressive and shockingly exceptional animation, Wandering Son doesn't even skimp on its visuals, setting its tone immediately. This is further emphasized with slow, methodical editing that works symbiotically with equally slow and thoughtful direction. What initially looked somewhat generic slowly sprouted into visually acute, as the director cuts all music and lets scenes breath on their own, with a fair share of intentionally awkward pauses that emphasize the youth and confusion these characters are going through.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Wandering Son succeeds so vigorously at is the ability to tell a lose-fitting story in this confined, semi-contrived environment. A school, where we pull back layers behind characters and everyone in this expansive cast gets their moments of humanization. The bullies aren't bullies, the goofballs aren't goofy, and even the quietest characters get to roar every once in a while. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters & Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nWandering Son follows Shuuichi Nitori, a boy with a knack for cross-dressing, and Yoshino Takatsuki, a girl with a similar interest. What begins as a fascination with the other gender's aesthetic blossoms into curiosity, love, and eventually inner turmoil that there really isn't an answer to. Nitori struggles with the idea of being a boy, what it means to want to be a girl, and how he'd go about being accepted. This is as much as a study on the idea of cross-dressing as it is the concept of being transgender, and that's equally surprising.\\n\\n\r\nColor me cynical, but I was simply not expecting this kind of detail to be present in an anime. Especially not a television anime, a medium that I've constantly spoken against as pandering, sexist, and having an over-reliance on creating objects to sell rather than characters. Yet here I sit, in a medium that has a plethora of television shows all mocking the idea of cross-dressers, transgenders, or simply not even bothering to delve into it at all, letting them be and making them the butt of jokes. \"Traps\" and the like, being a huge cultural meme at this point. It was refreshing to see a take on it that not only examined the idea of being transgender, but doing it in literally the least exploitative way imaginable. That was, perhaps, the biggest subversion of all. \\n\\n\r\nNitori and Takatsuki meet a whole cast of different characters, a cast that is honestly somewhat confusing and vast at first. The first episode, while quite good, left me with a lot of questions and confusion simply due to how many people there were on screen and how different each one was. Each character felt well-placed, too, from the dramatic, soft-spoken, and vicious Chiba, to the totally love-able and goofy Sarashina and her almost parasitically latched-on friend, Shirai. What was so refreshing about this expansive cast is that each one had their list of flaws and positives, even the newer characters introduced at the mid-way point of the series after the new school year starts. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Sarashina, a total goof and completely \"open\", in the best possible way, is initially incredibly divisive amongst this already established groups of friends as her abrasive and talkative nature lands her in hot water with Saori, who understandably doesn't appreciate hearing everything this girl has to say. But even Saori, who is, quite frankly, painted a lot like a villain at first in the show, is totally vicious and rude, yet that teen angst feels earned and actually well-established enough for you to see her side of things. Especially with the background we end up realizing she has with Takatsuki.\\n\\n\r\nIf i'm confusing you, then you know how I felt after the first few episodes, and this is only a fraction of the characters. Surprisingly, it all ends up falling in place. What first started as a somewhat obnoxious love-triangle between Nitori, Saori, and Takatsuki, where Nitori is in love with Takatsuki, Saori is in love with Nitori, and Takatsuki is just not romantically interested, ends up completely disintegrating into something significantly more interesting. Character and narrative-wise, the writer(s) take more than that extra needed step to make something as contrived and cliche as a love-triangle palatable, going so far as to totally subvert the notion and we end up in a position that is less romantic and more engaging on a narrative level.\\n\\n\r\nAs the venerable Dan Harmon said when asked on the concept of romance as a genre, \"Romance isn't a genre, it is a topping. Watching the romance genre is like going to a 'salt' restaurant.\" I agree, romance struggles to be compelling all the way through, which is why it is often paired with comedy and other genres to make it more palatable. Here, what initially feels like a romance is at the backdrop of the more important narrative, the identity crisis that a lot of these characters end up going through. \\n\\n\r\nSure, it is somewhat contrived to have one character be gay, two be transgender, and so on. Yet it works here because each one has a different approach. Each one is faces their own demons, and in some cases, no demons at all, as Nitori's good friend hardly struggles with the concept of being attracted to other men, which is so poignant to me as someone who is critical and often expecting every ounce of melodrama to be wrung out of an anime like this.  \\n\\n\r\nYet that never happens. In a way, Wandering son is very much like the anti-Your Lie in April, where I relentlessly criticized that series for having every single moment be this obnoxiously over-the-top emotional breakdown with sappy music and utterly incoherent philosophical babbling from supposed fourteen year olds. Wandering Son tones that down, instead of having kids remark on the nature of their situation with fake nuance, they instead speak to themselves bluntly, and you gain that nuance through the situations they are placed in and the way they react. Which is infinitely more clever and appealing to me. There are no huge, swelling musical pieces as the characters break down crying and confessing to one another. No. Wandering Son cuts the music, it lets you live in the moment as the characters are and experience what they are. Quite frankly, it's fucking awesome. \\n\\n\r\nEven the romance in Wandering Son is often treated like a kind of puppy-love, and while puppy love is real for the puppy, it is what it is. It isn't the end-all of the series because it is tackling a significantly more nuanced idea. Ultimately, the characters shine the brightest in Wandering Son, and while i'm sure there is much more story to tell, what with the looming threat of puberty changing the field once again, as slightly examined towards the end of this series, the way Wandering Son ended felt great in its own way. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Aesthetic]\\n\\n\r\nSo this show is pretty much perfect in its aesthetic, there is very little I would change. Apart from a few moments towards the middle that felt rushed through animation, Wandering Son actually had pretty exceptional animation throughout for a small-budget television anime. In fact, it looked much better than it had any right to. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a warm watercolor aesthetic, where the background was blown-out and the sides of the screen were constantly foggy and white, almost dreamy, it looked great. There were moments of great animation, too, especially with subtle character-driven movements. Animation in general can't nearly be as subtly expressive as live-action, as you often have to resort to tactics such as narration or overblown reactions, yet in this case they really do portray some genuinely subtle moments through only animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe director, Ei Aoki, is outstanding in this series, too. I initially thought the endless loop of piano melodies backing the majority of early episodes was somewhat frustrating, but that loop eventually mellowed out and the director cut a lot of the sound from certain moments, letting them be punctuated by silence, which is a great aesthetic choice as a director. Some scenes were only music, others were only dialogue with no backing track. This made all the difference with these potentially melodramatic scenes ringing incredibly true for these children. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nI think it is needless to say that I really loved this series. It is one of my favorites and it came out of nowhere for me. There are flaws, such as the contrived nature of the plot at first, as well as the initial groan-worthy love-triangle that thankfully blossoms into something engaging. It is also blunt with its symbolism on many occasions, as there are some subtle, nuanced, symbolic moments that are unfortunately back-ended by unneeded characters explaining exactly what just happened. \\n\\n\r\nWhere Wandering Son shines is in its believable characterization of its kids. Sure they address these heady topics perhaps ahead of their age, but the way they do so is so natural and impressive that I can't help but commend this series. It doesn't rely on stringing emotions along or even trying its best to make you cry, because that's not what Wandering Son wants to examine. Unlike something like Your Lie in April, where it constantly tries its best to shove melodramatic bullshit down your throat until you choke some tears out, Wandering Son reigns these emotions in and instead tells a character-driven story about finding yourself and truly accepting who you view yourself as.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aren't what they seem to be. As I said, bullies aren't bullies, even Nitori's sister, who is perhaps the most unlike-able character in this series due to her being \"the bratty sister\", gets some much needed, and surprisingly subtle characterization that made her believable. Not every character has to be someone you like or sympathize with, but as long as they fit the series and further establish your verisimilitude, you should appreciate their existence. \\n\\n\r\nLove doesn't go as planned. Not everything works out perfectly. That is shown constantly throughout Wandering Son. There is no perfect ending where everyone ends up happily together with the people they have crushes on, in fact, the show effortlessly skirts that idea by refraining from focusing on it. Nitori and Takatsuki's similar yet separate struggles are at the forefront here, not any kind of romance you might expect this a series as emotionally in-tune as this to focus on. \\n\\n\r\nWandering Son is exactly what I want from my emotionally powerful anime. Characters make the story, not the other way around, and this series succeeds in that regard with flying colors. Beautiful execution on almost all levels. If you are looking for an anime that is willfully detached from the character-driven cliches of so much romance and school-drama-oriented series', then Wandering Son is perfect for you. If you want anime that is daring, ambitious, well-directed, and ultimately, subtly rewarding, then Wandering Son is undoubtedly for you.",

            "content": "I was really interested in this series' premise, because it doesn't happen often that an anime decides to deal with gender identity disorders, but I was disappointed with the way the topic was developed.\r\nSometimes I have the feeling that, both in anime and manga, authors decide to discuss challenging topics but then don't have the courage to do it thoroughly. This is what I felt watching Hourou Musuko as well. Actually, I don't know if it's because they lack the courage, because they fear the fans' reaction or because they just don't know enough, I guess it depends on the case. In this story itfeels like they just wanted to use the idea because of its originality and not actually to discuss the topic realistically, though up to a certain point I used to think they were trying to be serious about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Nitori, is a middle school boy who likes to dress like a girl. Takatsuki is a girl who likes to dress like a boy. Nitori is presented as being in love with Takatsuki, though she doesn't seem to feel the same. The fact that the two might be in love could be seen as excessively coincidental, but I guess it makes sense that two people with the same \"issue\" are attracted to each other.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a topic, you cannot but wonder about one thing: do Nitori and Takatsuki really feel that they were born the wrong gender? In other words, are we talking about an actual gender identity disorder? At the beginning it looks like it is, since Nitori really seems to feel like a girl, and the topic of sex change surgery is also brought up once. However, as the story progresses, his feelings start to become ambiguous, to the point that he actually starts to date a girl, likes her, and is even portrayed as manly. This didn't sit right with me. What is the point of having him crossdress and behave like a girl, with all the social problems this involves (people thinking you are a weirdo, your parents having to come to terms with it, your own feelings about yourself), if then all this is completely reset? Was he just crossdressing randomly, without any deeper reason? I was quite disappointed with this.\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters of Takatsuki and Chiba more. Takatsuki is more coherent. She really seems to have an issue with her being a girl, and is also more determined when it comes to dressing like a boy. Like Nitori, she doesn't really seem to develop an interest in other people of her own gender, but we don't see her as much so we don't really delve deep into her head.\\n\r\nThe reason I like Chiba is that I find her very human. Her behavior seems excessively cold at first, but the way she feels about other characters and her reasoning are believable.\\n\r\nThe other characters were OK, though most of them we didn't see enough and we only knew them superficially.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple but fitting for the story. The music is also simple and doesn't stand out, but I guess it's fine in this kind of anime. The seiyuu were good. They chose a real boy to voice Nitori, and I think it makes sense. I don't really like it when crossdressing characters have a voice actor of the same gender they're crossdressing as (as in, crossdressing guys being voiced by women etc). It makes it \"too easy\", in a way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a lighthearted, enjoyable anime, but I wish they didn't just discard what seemed to be the main point of the story.",

            "content": "It is extremely rare to find an anime that approaches LGBTQ issues in any serious or in depth manner. The T in LGBTQ seems to get the least attention of all in the anime/manga world. This anime amazingly encompasses both MTF and FTM issues to an extent. It also does not approach it in an offensive or stereotypical way, as most animes that contain and trans character do. As someone who identifies as trans, this was extremely refreshing in an otherwise ignorant community.\r\nThe story was a little slow, but it is about growing up and that is how life can be. I was impressed thatthey incorporated so many little things that go along with dealing with puberty as someone questioning gender (things like feeling pressured to wear a bra or getting your period  or your voice changing actually came up). The pronouns could be an issue, but I would also tack that up to the characters being so young and still so unsure about their concrete genders. It was a very emotional watch for anyone who has to deal with these issues and can also be very triggering, as a bit of a warning. It is good at insinuating how ignorant and sexist/heterosexist society can be about things like relationships, gender behavior, and clothing (particularly school uniforms). Nitorin faces insults like freak and tranny (even the slur \"fag\" comes up) which are very harsh and hurtful words. Nitorin also has to deal with a family who doesn't understand and a sister who bullies \"him\" about his \"cross dressing habit.\" On top of that, Nitorin is dealing with a school system that shames \"his\" behavior and has \"him\" sent home for wearing a girl's uniform (although female characters wearing a boy's uniform are not). Afterwards, he is completely alienated by his class and his supposed friends. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime asks important questions like \"Why is it wrong to wear the clothes you want to wear?\" They also present relationships in a non-stereotypical way. Nitorin may identify as female, but he still dates a cisgender female in the series. Usually transgenders are viewed as very specifically heterosexual. I think it could be very educational for people who don't understand trans issues or gender fluidity... and especially for those who would label this a \"gender bender\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically character driven. It is all about these character's lives and how they are dealing with these complicated issues. It is about discovering their true selves and learning to cope with that and how society will treat them. Nitorin represents the MTF of the trans community, while Takatsuki is the FTM. The way I see it, Chiba-san is often the bully and transphobic towards both of them. She asks cruel questions in order to hurt them, knowing that their gender identities are a weak spot. She seems to represent the average person pushing their own gender ideals on her friends, regardless of their feelings. This gets more and more evident towards the end of the show. There are a variety of characters, that range from understanding and accepting to very transphobic and ignorant. There was a problem with vagueness regarding more minor characters however. There was no real explanation of the background of Yuki, the transsexual female mentor Nitorin and Takatsuki are friends with. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series because it was something I could relate to, which is extremely rare in the anime community. However, it was triggering and managed to make me very depressed on occasion. Overall, it handled the issue with extreme care, which is rare and very encouraging. I think we need more anime like this. There is very little LGBTQ inclusion in the anime world, after all. It didn't have much of a concrete ending, though, since they were just beginning to delve into bodily changes of puberty when the series ends. I hope they decide to continue the anime as the manga progresses.",

            "content": "This anime, I can't quite put my finger on it.. It's really great and I love this anime, but yet it's not exactly a favourite yet. I do intend to read the manga eventually but for now, I have to say, it's one of those anime that you would end up loving because of the feeling it gives you.\r\nStory: 9 Great\r\nI loved the story. It's a pretty simple concept. A boy who wants to be a girl. Yet, it's such a sensitive and difficult situation. It does let the watcher understand that there's really not much of a difference for a guy to want tobe a girl, from a normal guy or a girl who wants to be a guy. End of the day, they are all humans and have feelings and wishes for things that everyone else wishes for. They just want to be accepted for who they are. It's pretty touching at points especially as you watch him grow up and slowly start to change yet staying true to what he had always believed in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nReally love the art! Seriously, it's the art that made me decide to give this anime a go. I really loved the soft pastel colors and the watercolor and pencils look. It makes it seem a lot more gentle which fits really well with the story. They are after all still kids too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nI really! LOVED the soundtrack. I loved both the starting song and the ending song. The starting song reminds me of school days. :) Like a sunny day dawning in a classroom, or a trip to the beach and happy days spent with friends. I thought it fits the anime pretty well since there is a tight knit of friends and family and how they learn to stick together and accept one another. The ending song seems more personal. It's seems to fit more to Nitori's self, how he feels and thinks. It's almost like I can imagine Nitori rising his head under the bright sun and walking on with everyone accepting him the way he is. The chorus would be when all his friends joins him and they all have a good time together. Both of these songs gives me goosebumps when I listen to them. As for the background music, I could listen to them all on it's own. It's got very nice melodies, some with violins and pianos and at times can be pretty touching or happy light feeling. The songs are what makes me miss the anime whenever I listen to them. Makes me feel sad it's ended and I can't see them move and come to life anymore. I can only continue the story and finding out more about the characters through the manga pages.:(\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is REALLY good. For most characters, I like their personalities. Even the ones I hated at first ends up being not that bad after all. Each character, you get to watch them develop and \"grow up\" and watch how their relationships with each other develop. Nitori is the main character so of course, you will watch him grow the most and feel for him the most. But the supporting characters do play some influence in his growth. It's an anime where you learn to like and feel for the different characters. In the end, you will wish they all find their happiness. :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nReally enjoyed this anime, if not I would not have bothered to write a review for it. There's nothing you won't enjoy about. Except maybe a character in this anime may irritate you but other than that, everything about it is lovely, the music, the theme songs, the characters, the feelings you get with all these combined together. Just listening to the soundtrack right now & it makes me miss this anime very much. :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 Great\\n\\n\r\nI considered it as a 9 instead of a 10 because, as much as I love this anime, it doesn't really end up as one of my top 10 favourite anime. Or maybe it will some day, but it doesn't give me the feeling that I want to re-watch this anime. It's lovely definately!, that's why it's almost got a perfect 10, it's just that I'm not too sure if I'll love it enough to the point that I'll want to rewatch it again in the future. :)",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko's subject matter is rarely dealt with in anime: it explores the issues of gender identity and societal perception of gender roles through the lens of 5th graders, a particular age where puberty is becoming a thing, and clueless kids are changing into romantically involved teenagers. It's a time when kids become more aware of their surroundings, more conscious of their changing feelings; it's the perfect stage to explore how one may feel being an LGBT (lesbian-gay-bi-trans). \r\nNeedless to say, this subject is particularly sensitive given modern society's ambivalence towards LGBT, and anime typically dodges the bullet by giving LGBT characters ridiculously comedic rolesin stories. Not here. For Hourou Musuko, the awareness, exploration, and acceptance of different gender pursuits is handled with great tact and sincerity, as the characters struggle to come to terms with themselves and their judgmental surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Hourou Musuko is its exceptionally understated presentation. There's no dramatization, no really emotional music, no big crying scene\u2026heck, there doesn't seem to be any climactic scene at all. Characters are handled with stringent neutrality, and the scenes are given exactly as they would be, without any particular touch-up. It's as if we're given camera videos following real people as they go on about with their lives. This may seem like a flaw to some, as it's not the most emotionally engaging or exciting way of going about things, but considering the maturity level required for the subject, I find the presentation completely justified, optimal even. \\n\\n\r\nThis issue extends to the characters, as the 5th graders of Hourou Musuko are oftentimes more honest, brave, and mature than most adults could ever be. Never once in the story did I ever consider these characters to be grade schoolers, as they are definitely college+ in spirit with the straight-faced way they handle each other. This begs the question: is it considered a flaw that these characters are not realistic for their age? Personally, I don't think that's the point. While this story does base itself off the feelings of discovery people would experience at the onset of puberty, its core themes of acceptance and coming-to-terms are universal in nature. Essentially, the story is about 5th graders, but is meant to reflect on the LGBT subject for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the realism issue, the character writing itself is absolutely no slouch. Every character is written not to fulfill a certain role or device within the plot, but to be a full-fledged human being with emotions, doubts, and conflicts. That is not to say that the story uses a lot of internal monologues to present these characterizations; in fact, Hourou Musuko might as well be the poster child for the \"show, don't tell\" principle. We are never flat out given what a character is feeling; instead, we evaluate it through their expressions, their body language, and their dialogues. Don't feel like you've been given enough information? Don't get why a character acted a certain way? Go back and rewatch the scenes, or use something called analysis and interpretation (in other words, your brain). Ridiculous, I know. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word I can use to sum up this series, it's mature. Hourou Musuko treats its themes with respect, its characters with respect, and most exceptionally, it treats its audience with respect. We are expected to keep an open mind, to try to understand what the characters are going through, and to use our brain once in a while. We're expected to be mature, to take the subject seriously, and to embrace the themes of acceptance wholeheartedly. That may be setting too high a standard for most people, but heck, I sure wish more anime would follow this example.",

            "content": "*For this review, I'll be referring to the Nitori, Mako and Yuki as she, and Takatsuki as he*\r\n*Spoilers for the first episode*\r\nWhat's the point of Wandering Son? What is it trying to do? It clearly doesn't want to tell a complete, perfectly rounded story, seeing as it begins around volume five of the manga its based, and doesn't end where its source material does. If that's the case, then it's not the best manga promo as well, you aren't getting a good enough grip on the source material after all. So the question remains...\r\nWell, Wandering Son feels like it was crafted to become a documentaryinstead of an adaptation. Beginning at the start of junior high, it closely follows a group of friends, all with complicated relationships and confusing lives. The main character - Nitori - is a transgender girl that's been dressing up as one for a while. He already met the pain and suffering that acting so differently brings, but thanks to Tatsumaki (a transgender boy who she has a crush on), Mako (who's also been trying to be seen as a girl), Chiba (a girl who has a crush on Nitori) and Kanaba (everyone's friend), he managed to get through. Towards the end of primary school, they get into a huge fight, as Nitori confesses her love to Tatsumaki and gets rejected, which also pushes Chiba and Tatsumaki into a conflict.\\n\\n\r\nWith this setup, episode one starts. We see this normal, uninterrupted flow of what appears to be Nitori's and Tatsumaki's daily life, as well as their first day in junior high. While someone like the viewer, looking from the outside, wouldn't call this day particularly normal, seeing as a girl in their class comes in wearing a boy's uniform and we get to see Nitori dress up as a girl and walk around town, it definitely feels like an ordinary day to those kids. The episode flows through beautifully, jumping from scene to scene, place to place, eventually ending up in Nitori's house. After his sister and her model friends leave, Nitori is left all alone in his room.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a beautiful, pink dress hanging on the wall.\\n\\n\r\nWithout much hesitation, Nitori dresses up. A relaxing, charming track begins to play as we see her happily looking at herself. Just another day...\\n\\n\r\nThe music cuts off in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nNitori's sister enters the room.\\n\\n\r\nShe starts ripping the dress off of her, screaming.\\n\\n\r\nNitori pushes her onto the table\\n\\n\r\nShe runs out, wearing nothing but boxers and a tank top.\\n\\n\r\nRunning through the middle of the street, she thinks about how she must look to all those people.\\n\\n\r\nNitori isn't cute in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNitori surely isn't pretty in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNitori definitely isn't a girl in their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode one of Wandering son is powerful. It takes you from heaven to hell in an instant. Seeing broken Nitori run through the dimly lit streets left me stunned. But then, just like that, he runs past Tatsumaki who stops him, and they start talking again, him just wanting to help her by covering her with his jacket. And we end up in Nitori's house again, her smiling, going to sleep, as if nothing ever happened. Truly, what we know as normal, isn't normal to her.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, we get to see more and more of what's \"normal\" to Nitori, we see her blushing when someone says she's cute or girly, and the same thing goes for Mako and Tatsumaki. While they're both more secretive about the whole idea, they identify as a different gender already, they want that to be something normal for them. That's their end goal. At the same time, Chiba wants Nitori to be a \"normal boy\", and does see him as such even at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of Wandering Son is very novel, and it works out in the series' favor. This exploration of normality for people that some of us see as weirdness proves rather effective, thanks to the mix of some well put together, typical slice of life elements and the awkwardness and tension during the moments when the scenes handling that topic are presented. It's paced well enough so that I got both of those in measures that satisfied my interests and need for progression while keeping the steady flow of character exposition at all times.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems arise in another department. Simply put, the show feels like a big, emotional dump. Its style ends up being on this feeling of melancholy and overwhelming sadness. And it never leaves. Ever. Even when something silly happens, the voice actors explicitly keep talking or even screaming quietly. It almost feels unnatural at points, tends to take away from the actual emotional scenes, seeing as they all feel the same, monotonous, and it's incredibly draining to watch on top of all that. I understand that a style is a style, but it's not just the fault of the script.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals are what truly makes the whole package too hard to handle. Let me describe the feeling of watching Wandering Son:\\n\r\nImagine a beautifully crafted piano, and someone playing a nice, but rather boring tune on it. Then imagine you being inside that piano, but with headphones.\\n\r\nSure the tune is nice, it isn't loud and the inside of the piano looks marvelous, but at the same time it's really overwhelming to know that you're trapped inside it, and you can feel a pressure over something that surely was never meant to be digested this way. On top of that this song keeps on playing for who knows how long, feeling samey, with only occasional bursts of freshness that end up being a prelude to the monotonous melody once again.\\n\r\nHow do I know that the show isn't supposed to make you feel like this?\\n\r\nWell, maybe because Ei Aoki stated in an interview, that he \"didn't want to put the major focus on transgender as an issue, but more as a way to draw out these characters\". Do you think making the whole show look and feel sad doesn't seem like it puts it as an issue? The color pallet makes the show feel like an oil painting, but the character designs are very dark and don't correlate well if they were going for a natural-feeling look, creating an even more depressing and hard-hitting picture. Someone screwed up, it feels like the director and the artists didn't follow each other's intentions at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this grating feeling persists throughout every second of it, the sheer strength of the writing and the novelty of its idea makes Wandering Son quite a nice journey, highlighting some of the most interesting takes on the topic of transgender people growing up, especially during puberty. Things like self-realization, romantic relationships, personal growth, developing social abilities, planning out the future and understanding adolescence become completely new talking points when viewed from the eyes of such a person.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it isn't a particularly pleasant experience all around, Wandering Son is certainly an unique and interesting piece of art, worth indulging in for numerous reasons, primary one being understanding the world around us more in a interesting way, by indulging in an interesting work that makes you want to see it to the end (just in small doses). Well worth a recommendation, there surely will be many people who will find more to like, or perhaps more to grab onto, than I ever could.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, I recommend you to develop your own.",

The motion is fluent and there're a lot of subtle details,like cherry blossoms falling down, in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST didn't include that many tracks but the tracks that were there really helped to support the mood of the story and the OP and ED were also very well sung. None of the voice actors were bad, but there were also none that really stood out to me, and I guess they were just alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of this anime surely must have been the characters, as I watched the show, I could relate a lot to nearly every character, even the ones who seemed to be rude without any reasons to do so. All of the characters felt very real, with their quirks, flaws and little twists to them. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, as its art and characters really captivated me and would like to stress that this story is one that can be enjoyed by people who have no affinity with anything that's to do with gender or sexuality, and also by people who do.\\n",

            "content": "Now, as a person who comes into contact with the field of sociology every now and then, and by extension discussions on gender and sexuality, the description of this show instantly drew my attention towards it. Sitting down to watch, and spurred on by other reviews, I was expecting to sit down to a deep and interesting series that put a spotlight on gender issues (helped by the title of the first episode \"What Are Little Girls Made of?\"). I...had a bit of a lukewarm reaction to the series.\r\nBefore I get to that though, I want to start off with what I think this seriesdid right. The most important is that this series decided to try and look at the issue seriously. There is little to none anime antics in this series, which is great because the idea of crossdressing characters normally gets played for laughs and serves as an excuse to make a joke. It also didn\u2019t go the other way in terms of temptations by making this a giant angst fest and overdramatic. Instead, it took itself seriously while still keeping an atmosphere of realism and normality (well, it is a slice-of-life series in part..) The character\u2019s don\u2019t feel like clich\u00e9s, and you can get a sense of the awkwardness they are going through during the series, even with some of the issue in the storyline I think exist (which I\u2019m going to get to in a minute). I had some trouble keeping track of who was who sometimes since, instead of going the route of giving people unrealistic hair colors to make more variety, they went with keeping it at more realistic browns and blacks. And sometimes it almost felt like characters came out of nowhere, with just a passing flashback occurring to satisfy the curiosity. Once things get going it\u2019s better though and easier to tell who is who.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest positive I can give though is the animation; it is by far one of the best looking animes I have ever seen. The watercolor style of the series is wonderful. From some other reviews of the series I\u2019ve seen it apparently gives a sense of adolescence and all that, but sadly I\u2019m usually not that perceptive on the relationship between animation styles and storylines so I can\u2019t offer an opinion. All I can say is that it looks good, and I hope to find more series with a similar art style. I think it works great for this kind of story.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the negatives, and I'll start with the simplest issue of Takatsuki's side of the story; it kind of got buried under Nitori's, and I'm disappointed that it really didn't get as much attention as it probably should have. However, I can be fair and state an alternate view on this; Takatsuki's story doesn't get as much attention as Nitori's simply because society is more accepting of \"girl wanting to be a boy\" than \"boy wanting to be a girl\" and so less potential for dramatic storytelling. This comes to a head in one of my favorite episodes of the series, and is briefly discussed in character, but still, for being the other main lead I feel Takatsuki's story didn't get the depth that Nitori's did and so it suffers from only getting a few scenes here and there that expand on her internal conflicts. Again though, it may just be because society accepts boyish girls more than girlish boys and so it\u2019s an easier problem for her.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I also have an issue with Nitori's storyline, and that issue is that by the end I feel like we really didn't get anywhere with it. Let me explain. Throughout the series I was waiting for some kind of moment, some kind of discussion on why Nitori wants to be a girl with some level of passion on Nitori's part. Instead, all I got was everyone saying he looked cute, putting him in dresses, and Nitori just kind of accepting it (minus one scene later on, but he gets kind of passive again afterwards). I just really feel like Nitori's wanting to be a girl was TOLD to us more than SHOWN (outside of crossdressing, but cross-dresser=/=transgender), and with all the comments about how 'cute' he was seeming to be the only real reason given for crossdressing, it seemed more like he was wanting to be a girl just to conform to what everyone else wants and what society says is appropriate (guys are handsome and tough, girls are cute and dainty).\\n\\n\r\nAnd so overall, by the end of the series, I almost felt like nothing was that accomplished in terms of the major storylines. I should note this opinion is only relevant to the anime; I have yet to take a look at the manga, and I am tempted to because what I do know of it seems like it may fix some of the issues I'm discussing here. Therefore, it may be safe to say my issues here deal more with the shortness of the series (11 episodes) than an inherent flaw of the premise itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo my final word on this series would be this: if you're interested in a series that has a deep, detailed discussion of gender and sexuality, this is about the best you're going to get. While it could have been handled better, it doesn't do a bad job, and I appreciate the serious look at the topic instead of falling to prey to the more 'comedic' or \u2018angst\u2019 potential of \"gender bending\".",

            "content": "Anime Review No.6\r\nJust finished watching Hourou Musuko and I say this is one great anime. The anime is well made and the production studio didn't failed to portray what is the series all about. Another best slice of life anime I watched this 2015.\r\nReview: The content may contain \"SPOILERS\"\r\nPlot (9/10) \r\nThe story revolves around 3 characters Nitori, Shuuichi, Chiba, Saori and Takatsuki, Yoshino. They are young teens struggling to adapt the new life of  being a middle school student while undergoing the changes in puberty. Suppose to be your typical school life and slice of life anime series but it isn't. Unlike many genericschool life series \"Hourou Musuko\" or \"Wandering Son\" have something that stand out among the rest. The plot discuss the topic of \"transsexualism\" in a way people can learn something about this topic without disgust and hating the show. The anime give great importance how critical the beginning of puberty in developing one's identity and how growing up greatly affect's our goals in life. I like the setting the story took place \"Middle school\" is the perfect place to portray puberty for this where the teenagers start question who they are and what will they become as time goes by. Yes this is the slice of life anime I wanted to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime matched the premise of the plot and the mood of the story. The water color style is nice. The studio really did their best to make the anime background unique and the character design is very well made among other slice of life anime series which uses the same art style for their character design which is pretty boring seeing the same faces over and over again but in this anime you won't see any resemblance as far I see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nI didn't like the Opening of the series which made me think the series is another used slice of life and school life show but men how wrong I was when I watched the series. The background music of the show is a strong point cause the sound made the atmosphere serious while at the same time heart warming. The series did a good job in setting the mood right and ending it properly. I'll shall say the series did well in making it's audience cherish every single moment of the important scenario and this is why how fundamental the background music suppose to be because it's all about building the mood of the plot and especially it's characters. The Ending song \"For You\" by Rie Fu is definitely going to go in my song list. The ending music made the show bright and colorful while at the time you are wondering what will happen next in the following episode. Nice Ending and Nice background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nIn all the school life anime I have watched this year this anime series pull out what those series lack and that is the personality of the characters acting and reacting as real people. You won't be seeing overused tsunderes, danderes and all the deres you can think of in this series and personally I am really annoyed when every time a school life anime is made there always this copy paste personalities you get tired off. The parents and adults in the series made a great contribution in building up the characters in this series and supporting them at times of need. The adults actions proves to be important in guiding the young one's in handling their problems in life which other anime series ignores. The supporting characters here is not just your average \"simple characters\" which work as plot devices to make you feel the story have people in the background while our main characters make dialogues NO! They serve as a great fundamental factor influencing, and shaping our main characters and also they are all likable for each characters for they have genuine personality. In my next preview of an anime series I will do my best to give brief information about each character why they are special and how they are not robots that have copy paste personality from previous show. This show did an amazing job in \"Fleshing Out\" it's every character and this is what characterization is all about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI didn't even notice the time when I finished this series. Every moment is good and interesting. I don't recall I ever get bored in every scene and even most of the time they are just talking to each other I really didn't get bored but instead I get hyped in every word the characters delivered to each other and they deliver great ideas that further build what the series is all about and this why even if this anime is just a simple show about simple people with simple conflicts I have learn to love and Appreciate it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is inspirational for it give you brighter view point about life. Simplicity is true beauty I always say. You don't need mind blowing dialogues, elaborated plot mechanics and over the top budget animation to make a masterpiece or an inspirational show. Hourou Musuko proves that. I highly recommend this series for open minded people about simple aspect of life. Another hidden gem which the masses ignore just because the anime is a \"seemingly generic slice of life and school life show\". They don't know what they are missing. Trust me.",

            "content": "I read the manga since about chapter 3, and at first, admittedly, I was disappointed that the anime made the decision to skip ahead.\r\nBut then I realized -- it sucked you into the story further, because the characters were telling /you/ the story.\r\nHourou Musuko is a tale about two elementary school children who are transgender. Nitori Shuichi wants to become a girl, and Yoshino wishes to be a boy. They become friends and they go on \"dates\" -- where Yoshino dresses as a boy, and Shuichi dresses as a girl. \r\nThe story is quite simple, yet very complex. The way it goes about it islike how the children are experiencing it -- bit by bit. They don't really understand why their desire to be the other gender is wrong. That, and the way Nitori's sister disapproves and thinks he is disgusting is very much how a family member might react. I believe that every character is realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by the way, the transgender thing is /not/ a convenient, or sexual, plot device.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're searching for a heartwarming story about the struggles of two transgender children growing up, then definitely watch this. If you are an idiot who wants a comedy and doesn't understand deep storylines, avoid it. But in my case, this is definitely one of my favorite anime of the year and I'm looking forward to what kind of ending the anime will show. \\n\\n\r\nI think the water color-like art is beautiful and it fits the series very well. The music is soft, and the music they play during the emotional scenes brings the story to life even better. I love the voices, too -- Nitori sounds boyish, but also quite feminine, like a boy who hasn't quite yet hit puberty should sound.",

            "content": "Within the first couple seconds, I knew Hourou Musuko would be unlike anything I had ever watched before. For those who are too lazy to look above, Hourou Musuko is the story of two friends: a boy (Sh\u016bichi Nitori) who wants to be a girl and a girl (Yoshino Takatsuki) who wants to be a boy. As one can infer, the anime has a lot of themes relating to sexuality (cross-dressing, gender identity, puberty, etc.) That being said, it is definitely not for everyone, like if you have a problem with gays, lesbians, cross-dressers, etc. or if you don't like to think too hard aboutyour anime. But for the rest of us, Horou Musuko may very well be one of the best anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAnd you thought being a teenager was awkward for you...\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Hourou Musuko shows the everyday trials and tribulations of middle schoolers, straight, cross-dressing, gay, whatever. The themes of sexuality are a big part of this so this makes it especially good for those of us who are or know someone who is LGBT. While I, myself, am not LGBT, many of my close friends and family are. This anime really accuratley portrayed the struggles of sexuality and finding one's self. The story is really (for lack of better terms) refreshing and wonderful however it can be somewhat confusing, especially in the first episode. Those who have read the manga say that it doesn't make much sense to those who haven't read it but I (having not read the manga) was able to make sense of it. A suggestion to those who are planning to watch: have a list of characters so you can match up faces with names. It really does help. But the story, to put it another way, is simply beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWhen watching Hourou Musuko, one might compare it to walking through a watercolor painting. The art is lovely and evokes just the right amount of nostalgia. The art style is not the anime stereotype with large eyes and a rainbow of hair colors. It's fittingly realistic and the animation is right on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nIn keeping with the theme, the music and acting in Hourou Musuko is really something. Simple yet tender piano melodies make up most of the score while there are some pieces that fit right in with comic scenes. The voice actors do their jobs and do them well. The cast has many new faces (er, well, voices) like Asami Seto who debuts as Takatsuki. They really give the anime that feeling of reality and make it seem plausible. Thumbs up for newbies!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAlthough it's hard to keep track of who's who (especially in the first episode), all the characters are really unique and unforgettable. Their feelings really come across and not in an overly dramatic way, either. No one's the bad guy and there are no losers; rather, everyone is able to tell their side of the story and justify their actions. The relationships are remarkably real and really do stir up that feeling of nostalgia (first love, friendships lost, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nReally, it's a high nine so more like 9.7 or something (I'm very hesitant to give out 10s!)\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, Hourou Musuko is an amazingly realistic story that is somewhat sad and definitely will leave you feeling nostalgic. The art and music are both gorgeous and add to the overall feeling of the story. The voices actors are effective in their parts in getting the characters' feelings across and the characters themselves are each unique. Their awkward teenage relationships make the story something that I (and hopefully you) won't forget anytime soon. \\n",

            "content": "As a trans woman myself, I am excited every time I see trans people in media being represented without being misserable creatures that can only suffer, be a joke, or fulfill a sexual fetish.\r\nUntil now I have watched dozens of anime, and I only found 2 good trans characters from 2 different shows. Hurou Musuko isn't one of those.\r\nTo be fair, trans kids are very rare in media, even more than trans adults. Seeing young people struggling with their identity is pretty common in media, but is very uncommon to see that applied to LGBT kids. I like seeing the same issues I have todeal with being portrayed in a show that sees me and my community as normal people that has been built different.\\n\\n\r\nMy problem comes when... that's it. That's the whole point of the anime. Watching a trans boy and a trans girl struggling with trans problems. This felt totally alien to me, and I have experienced pretty much the same as the main characters. I felt completely disconnected to them because they aren't complete humans. All the life of each trans character in this anime is dedicated to suffer from being trans or thinking about being trans, they aren't allowed to do anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIf they were background characters with 1-2 episodes, this wouldn't be such a problem, but they are the main protagonists and all they do is experience trauma or fear for their identity in loop the whole series. They need aspirations, hobbys, goofy moments, problems that have nothing to do with them but they have to deal with, etc. Instead, all the plot comes from what they are, and not who they are.\\n\\n\r\nThis kids are not characters that happen to be trans, they are just trans characters.",

            "content": "I, like most people on this planet like things.\r\nThings that I like come in many shapes and forms, one of which being anime and manga. One such anime / manga I like is Wandering Son. A character driven narrative that follows the lives of a handful of middle school children as they grow through puberty and the issues that they come up against. All in all this is a pretty standard setting and premise for an anime or manga, all it really needs is me adding on the words \u2018fan service\u2019 and \u2018fighting power\u2019 and really this description could be about 90% of any animeout there.\\n\\n\r\nIn actuality, the themes and overall feel of Wandering Son is something that I\u2019ve found to be pretty unique in the medium. The series, and manga, may differ but some things that are shared between them, given that I have read the first four volumes of the manga and watched the entire anime twice, is that they both gently deal with issues of transgenderism, relationships, and gender roles. I say gently because there is really nothing forceful about what is shown. Every character is treated as a human, as a person. There is no \u2018role\u2019. For any single character in the show I would have to use multiple archetypes and at least one or two paragraphs of extra text to even get close to summarising them. I can\u2019t just say \u201cThere\u2019s the tsundere bad ass pilot\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s the na\u00efve gold hearted moe.\u201d. Instead I\u2019m forced to describe them as people, though of course their relationships towards one and other is another way to point out who is who to those who struggle to tell the characters apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the manga is very minimalistic, a childish aesthetic without actually being badly drawn. This is no Oyasumi Pun-Pun when it comes to art. But, from my aesthetically inclined perspective, the art style matches the feel of the manga perfectly. Utterly capturing childish innocence with maturity. But, the characters can be hard to make out. I haven\u2019t really had that issue except in panels showing the classroom, but Shimura Takako has had letters about that issue from fans of the manga so us Westerners aren\u2019t just being stupid. The anime has this to a greater effect, in that in your first viewing you probably won\u2019t know who is who half the time until around episode four. But, you get gorgeous looking water colours and pretty fluid animation. So it isn\u2019t bad at all, and probably could be argued is due to the nature of most anime to have very distinctive characters aka: Pink haired girl, brown haired guy, that dude with the eye patch, rather than the more authentic colourings and hair styles of Wandering Son.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real over arching storyline in either the anime or manga, at least up to volume four of the manga. And that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Given that this is a mature journey like narrative. These are real fictional people. And you care about them. There is no villain, sure Nitori\u2019s sister may bully him at times, but she genuinely cares for him. The bully at school has much more going on for him in a non-antagonistic way than bully characters normally do. Anna on her introduction is initially shown to be strict and cold hearted, even though she\u2019s a really conscientious and caring character. This narrative is about, driven by, and made beautiful by the characters, and as I\u2019ve already expressed about them they are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as amazing as I find this series, as much love and affection I may lather onto it, that might mean absolutely nothing to you. You ain\u2019t me? So why should or shouldn\u2019t you watch or read this? If you\u2019re looking for some brain dead, happy go lucky, or witty moe, this ain\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re after brutal murder, nope. If you really want to stay away from shows that delve into issues with gender and sexuality in a meaningful fashion, you probably should watch this, but I say that in a \u201cEveryone should experience this.\u201d way, as opposed to \u201cThis show doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d when it clearly does. If on the otherhand you want a gentle, meaningful, and thought provoking look at growing up \u2018the wrong sex\u2019 or just growing up in the real world with real personal development issues. This could be for you. I have never felt such horror for someone having a wet dream before reading this. Understandably that didn\u2019t get into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this was a thing I liked.",

            "content": "According to the Internet, ANIME HAS BEEN SAVED!!!!\r\nHourou Musuko is currently trudging along on its journey of SAVING ANIME! Ever since it first surprised the world with the \"so bad it's good\" movie, Inferno Cop, and the young animator project, Little Witch Academia, Hourou Musuko has been hailed as a savior in the anime community. It made its TV debut with a bang with the highly acclaimed and outrageous Kill La Kill, a show so dumb yet \"profound\" that even the saltiest of salty elitists couldn't help but give it a high score! It then surprised the world by teaching us how to NOT SAVEANIME with Ninja Slayer from Animation, a show whose animation can be matched by me if I tried hard enough. But Hourou Musuko didn't let this show burden itself forever, for they came back this Spring 2016 with a genuinely interesting thriller series, Kiznaiver! Hourou Musuko is a studio bursting with potential and I can't wait to see what else this derpy studio has for us in the future!\\n\\n\r\nHow is Hourou Musuko saving anime? Because it's TRIGGER-ing.\\n\\n\r\n...................................... Did you laugh? No? Ok....\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Hourou Musuko! Also known as Wandering Son, it's a show that despite my huge failure of an attempt to make a pun, has no connection to Studio Trigger. It's a slice of life drama that deals with one of the most sensitive subjects ever to grace Tumblr and other social media: Transsexuality. Did I call this show triggering? I did, for it had a crap ton of something that literally makes me cringe and cry and want to punch a wall: Transphobia. Hourou Musuko explored the overwhelming drama surrounding transphobia so deeply and profoundly that I was legit Eren-tier angry during some scenes. A show doesn't need to have a legendary OST or pretty colors to express it's themes. Hourou Musuko manages to touch on the joys and sorrows of transsexuality incredibly accurately (well... somewhat accurately), as well as the effects of rumors and bullying in a school setting.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that a lil nerd like me knows about too well. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- This show will make you feel stuff. Sadness, anger, joy, that stuff.\\n\r\n- Very nice and dreamlike, but not flashy or fancy art. It's like watercolor!\\n\r\n- A simple yet beautiful OST.\\n\r\n- Incredible main characters, full of insecurities and doubts, but also full of determination. They will make you love them at times and hate them at times.\\n\r\n- Incredibly impactful portrayal of its themes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The portrayals of bullying and transphobia, although triggering and powerful, are kind of overdone and inaccurate at times. I mean, these bullies literally know ZERO SUBTLETY. Thus, some bullies are completely one dimensional.\\n\r\n- Cast of characters is pretty gigantic. Prepare yourself to be overwhelmed early on!\\n\r\n- While the characters are great, they aren't exactly accurate as well. Some of them are way too mature, while others are way too immature.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is a down to earth slice of life about the everyday lives of Nitori and Takatsuki. They simply live their lives as they tackle on the problems and struggles that the public opinion of transsexuals force upon them. The story tackles a lot of themes about transsexuality that actually have popped into my mind during my life. For example, it asks about the difference between wanting to look like a girl and wanting to be a girl. There is the ever provoking question of why it's more acceptable for a girl to wear male clothing than it is for a boy to wear female clothing. Hourou Musuko dives into the nooks and crannies of transsexuality, and while it may not always have accurate character decisions and whatnot, it still executes these themes in an incredibly powerful way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI see a lot of people calling the art \"simple, but effective,\" and I wholeheartedly agree. The art of Hourou Musuko is indeed simple, yet it still manages to give off its own unique and engaging vibe that really supported the mood of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music is also fairly simple, consisting of a lot of piano music that I really like. The OST fits the mood of each scene very well, and adds on to the vibe of the show. The voice acting is also incredible, especially since Nitori was actually voiced by a young boy. The seiyuus did an amazing job voicing the emotions and insecurities of each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI wanna hug some of these characters. I wanna beat the absolute shit out of some of these characters. Never has a character cast made me feel such conflicting emotions. Nitori and Takatsuki are an amazing duo of protagonists, and while they may not be the most relatable to most (since transsexuality is a touchy subject), they are still very respectable and emotionally attachable characters. As for the other characters, they are either incredibly lovable due to their support (Anna, Makoto, Kanako, Yuki, Seya, etc), or absolutely detestable due to their lack of respect (Dem bullies, Momoko, Fumiya, etc). While this may make the character cast seem to average out to a 5, I can appreciate the fact that the character cast is very impactful.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the character cast does have flaws, the main one being how freaking huge it is, or how some characters, like Chiba, are way too mature and blunt for their age, while others, like Momoko, are just utter children. Doesn't take away from the how powerful the cast is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIs anger considered enjoyment? Well, it's an emotion that this show gave to me, and it did it so well, so why not?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nHourou Musuko is hella underrated! Any show that can take a sensitive subject and express it in a mature and serious way as well as Hourou Musuko did is an amazing show.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nRoses are Red,\\n\r\nViolets are Blue.\\n\r\nBut sometimes Violets\\n\r\nwant to be Red too.",

            "content": "The Winter 2011 season ushered in the worst ratings for Noitamina (a prestigious timeblock dedicated to short, quality anime such as Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile, and Eden of the East) yet. While I can understand the ratings declining because Noitamina\u2019s action offering Fractale is, to put bluntly, complete fail, its dramatic offering, Hourou Musuko, is incredibly good. Admittedly, it's not the best of the timeslot, but it can stand comfortably with most of Noitamina's higher quality shows. At any rate, it makes Fractale even more of a joke.\r\nStory\r\nHourou Musuko the original manga nears a hundred chapters, most of which are around twenty pages long.Hourou Musuko the anime reviewed here takes these hundred chapters and condenses them into a compact and coherent eleven-episode story. According to manga readers, some things are lost along the way, but as an anime-viewer only, I found the story really complete.\\n\\n\r\nToo often one-cour manga adaptations become advertisements for their source material. For example, while Kuragehime (a Fall 2010 show from Noitamina) has top-notch direction and execution, its open-ended finale practically commands the viewer to read the manga to see what happens next. Hourou Musuko, in contrast, finishes with a very appropriate degree of closure. The protagonist comes to terms, best he can for his age, with the themes of the series, and relationships are realistically resolved.\\n\\n\r\nStill, while the pacing and structure of the story are textbook perfect, I\u2019m a little ambivalent on the content. Since I don\u2019t share Nitori\u2019s issues, I\u2019m in no place to comment on the accuracy of the show\u2019s depiction of transgendered triumphs and tribulations. But I will say that I saw this show more as an \u201cartsy, touching young adult anime drama\u201d (it\u2019s a surprisingly broad category) with transgendered as a background theme. I\u2019m sure I missed many of the nuances, but I feel the show is pretty light on social commentary. Ultimately, I ended up more invested in the relationships between the cast than the issue that much of cast is born into the wrong sex.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of cast,\u00a0Hourou Musuko does a really excellent job at both developing and illustrating its characters. Shuichi Nitori and Yoshino Takatsuki are really well-developed and likable leads. Nitori has many sides, and it\u2019s interesting to watch those conflict both regarding his gender issues and his interactions with his peers. And Takatsuki\u2019s earnestness and loyalty set her apart as a unique and lovable female character.\\n\\n\r\nBut while the characterization of a select few is great, the overall characterization is far from flawless. Although Hourou Musuko makes good use of its time regarding its characters\u2013a single scene can reveal a lot about their personalities\u2013it still doesn\u2019t dedicate enough time to the main cast. Nitori's closet friends all get gypped on time in favor Anna and Doi who have romance and rivalry respectively with Nitori. And too much time is spent on a Chiba, a typical (though admittedly well-executed) yandere-tsundere mix as well.\\n\\n\r\nStyle\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it\u2019s not as flashy as action shows, Hourou Musuko is a visual feast. It\u2019s easy to admire well-drawn action sequences, but drama is a genre that requires really subtle animation and incredible attention to detail. Hourou Musuko does this and more.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the style is really unique. I was initially put-off by the shininess, but the water-color technique is really stunning in motion, and it\u2019s impressive how consistent it is. Secondly, although the characters look distinguishably anime, almost everything else appears very realistic. Not only are backgrounds surprisingly full of detail and movement, but the show does not sacrifice verisimilitude for sparkly backdrops and whatnot typical of anime drama. Flowers don\u2019t sprout upon a character\u2019s introduction; bubbles don\u2019t cascade when a character smiles. When artistic metaphors are used correctly, it can add a lot to the scene, but Hourou Musuko\u2019s avoidance of the trope better suits its soft and serious tone. In short, Hourou Musuko\u2019s art is as solid as its story if not better.\\n\\n\r\nAudio\\n\\n\r\nSound isn\u2019t a component that usually can make or break a series. There are exceptions, but the sound of Hourou Musuko is not one of these exceptions. It\u2019s very passable, but there\u2019re only a few flashes of brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the background music is always appropriate (very pretty and soft, just like the rest of the series), but it\u2019s not particularly memorable. Admittedly, the opening and ending songs are catchy, but they\u2019re not catchy enough to keep my attention during their staid sequences.\\n\\n\r\nBut I do have to give props to some of the voice-actors. Voice-acting is really important as many of the characters fight against nature to express who they really are. Both Nitori and Takatsuki, the two characters with the toughest job, have newcomers voice them, and the risk really pays off.\u00a0Asami Seto makes an excellent debut as Takatsuki, balancing Takatsuki\u2019s biological sex with her mental gender. Kousuke Hatakeyama is not quite as good as Nitori, but I\u2019m thrilled they picked a boy around Nitori\u2019s age to play him. Additionally, his subtle deepening of Nitori\u2019s voice as the series progresses is really well done.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hourou Musuko is a really excellent series. I have a sinking feeling it\u2019ll be quickly forgotten (or at worst, only remembered as the Noitamina show that aired at the same time as that godawful Fractale), but it\u2019s definitely worthy of the timeblock it aired on. For me, Hourou Musuko stands as the perfect example of how to condense a long slice-of-life-esque manga into a short, stunning, and very enjoyable anime. Highly recommended to those who enjoy bittersweet drama with well-written and realistic characters.",

            "content": "Story: 4/10 \r\nI wanted to watch this because of the promising premise of the anime delving in transgender issues, which is something one rarely sees, inside of anime and outside of it as well. When this anime was brought to my attention, I was very hopeful. When I watched it, I simply ended up being very disappointed. \r\nWhile the anime does attempt to show transgender issues and the struggles that people with Gender Dysphoria go through, especially during the critical stage of puberty, it vitally comes shorts of its goal. Instead of  really delving into the issues trans people go through, everything is glossedover and watered down. \\n\\n\r\nAt points it takes itself seriously and tries to show the issues. At other points it leaves you stretching your head with how confusing the characters are. I understand they are struggling, but the way they presented it was utterly unbelievable to me. I felt that while this anime tried to do a service to transgender individuals, but it only succeeded in making people more confused about it and leaving several horrible, unforgivable misunderstandings about transgender, which I'll get to later in this review. \\n\\n\r\nI think what hurt this anime most was a lack of direction. It didn't know what to do with itself. One episode, they are transgender teens. The next, they are simply cross-dressers. The next it's just your below-par romance / slice-of-life anime where the underlying issue is barely touched on or mentioned at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime lacked any real depth to it and fell flat when trying to add any depth. Overall, the story wasn't very well done and didn't accurately portray the premise. That said, I don't think that the story was bad per se, I just think it was disappointing and left a lot to be desired. If you want a story with depth about transgender people, this anime isn't it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I didn't like the art. I also didn't think that the art was appropriate to the tone of the anime - if it even had a tone. At this point, I'm not sure if it did. It was too bright and very...childlike, for lack of a better word. I haven't read the manga, and after watching the anime, I don't intend to, but the style would make sense if this is how the manga looks. Still, the art only left me with a feeling of disconnect. There were also a lot of still shots and many scenes where nothing happened. It just wasn't impressive and instilled nothing in me. The entire look was innocent cuteness, and I feel that did a disservice to the underlying issue of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the strong people of the anime. While I didn't like the music, I found the lyrics to be heartwarming and very emotional. In fact the songs at the beginning of the anime and the end of it where the only things to elicit any sort of true emotion from me while watching this anime. The voice acting was top notch and each VA did an outstanding job of portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were by far the weakest point of this anime. Again, it lacked direction and the characters couldn't seem to make up their minds about who they really were. That was more than evident with Nitori. I think the show has the potential to confuse because with his character. Is (s)he transgender or just a cross-dresser? I honestly can't tell. In some episodes, she's transgender. In other episodes he is just a cross-dresser. \\n\\n\r\nS/He's constantly going back and forth with it. Sometimes the anime makes it seem like it's a phase Nitori's going through, while other episodes make it seem like Nitori's truly struggling because (s)he wants to be a girl. I couldn't make heads or tails of it. \\n\\n\r\nI also felt they did a huge disservice to the transgender community by insinuating that a person will want to change genders if other people force them to dress as the opposite sex. Scientific research has proven this is be unfounded. In fact, there is only one case that I am aware of in which this is true (18 children were thought to be female at birth. When they hit puberty they're anatomy corrected itself and it was proven that they were all biologically male. 2 of 18 decided to continue cross-dressing but still identified as male, while one underwent gender reassignment surgery. All the other switched easily, and happily, into their correct gender. Please see Dominican Republic Syndrome for more information). \\n\\n\r\nTo assume that Nitori wants to be girl (or that his mentor wanted to be a girl) because others thought it was cute and it changed his/her/their opinions of their gender is too much for me to shallow in light of the seriousness of the premise which they were trying to go for. \\n\\n\r\nNitori also seemed to flip-flop with his sexuality. Now sexuality can get pretty damn confusing for transgender people. Are you gay, straight, bisexual, etc...? these questions are hard to answered when confused about your gender, but the way this anime went about it was wrong in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nAt first he likes a girl who wants to be a boy and is in love with the boy that she believes she is (which would make Nitori a straight woman if Nitori is trans). Then this changes and he's attracted to women (making Nitori a lesbian if Nitori is trans). Or is he simply bisexual or pans or something? Honestly, I don't know. It's too ambiguous and glosses over all of these issues to the point it might have been better had this problems not been touched on at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime tried to touch on sensitive subjects and failed miserably. The characters, while I understand were in a confused age, weren't believable. In scientific studies, it is shown that many transgender individuals know what their real gender is by the ages of 4-7, sometimes sooner, sometimes later. By the age they are in this anime, it's not likely that they wouldn't know. Yes, they'd probably be confused, but this anime went more than them just being confused. It made transgender struggles less than what they truly are. It...romanticized it in a way when it shouldn't be romanticized. \\n\\n\r\nThe only ones truly believable where those who bullied Nitori and Nitori's sister, and even that was downplayed to an alarming level. The characters took these issues too lightly. I can't blame the voice actors for this. I can only blame the script and the people who made it. The characters were shallow and didn't accurately represent the transgender community. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause of all the problems with this anime, I found it hard to enjoy. The pacing was too slow and everything was shallow and watered down. Maybe it's because I've studied this topic extensively, but I just couldn't find much enjoyment from it. If the anime had delved deeper into the struggles and hardships and confusion and hopelessness that trans people often face, I would have enjoyed it more. But it didn't, so I couldn't. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't a bad anime, it just wasn't very well done either. I don't think it should be watched without prior understanding of transgender or else it can leave you confused. On the positive, it also has the potential to cause people to research transgender, which is always a good thing. To me, this anime lacked direction so it wasn't a very good anime, but it wasn't bad either. It was fine. Nothing more, nothing less. There was nothing terribly wrong with it, nor was there anything that I found to be exceptional. It wasn't ground breaking and left misconceptions, but it did try and I do respect this anime for trying. Fir this, I give it a 6 out of 10. \\n",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko is the sentimental anime block noitaminA launch in January, sharing space with fractale. Its director is Ei Aoki (Ga-King and Fate / Zero), and the animation is Aniplex. Manga is relesead by Comic Bean and your mangaka is Takako Shimura, the same Aoi Hana. The group of voice actors is well mixed between young and experienced.\r\n            The story portrays the life of Shuichi tor and his two friends and Saori Chiba Yoshino Takatsuki. Tor is a boy who has a hobby of cross-dressing girl, and tries to make something of his usualstandard in the eyes of society. His two friends are his Saori Chiba, an eccentric girl who is passionate about tor, and Yoshino Takatsuki, girl who is also unhappy with the sex they were born and who rejected tor. The story unfolds with the inclusion of new characters and progress of the school life of the three.\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Cast:\\n\\n\r\n         The list Hourou Musuko is great and extremely important. After the three main characters are properly introduced, new students, relatives and friends will appear. The main supporting characters are as follows:\\n\\n\r\n            Makoto Ariga: A childhood friend of tor who knows the secret of the boy and comes from the same school as the main characters. Is of fundamental importance in the play school, where he plays Juliet\\n\\n\r\n            Shinpei Doi: A boy who was studying with tor at his old school, where he became a rival of the boy and his friends. Doi represents the eyes of society to transvestism and sex changes. Doi does not conform to how a man can become so beautiful when a sex change.\\n\\n\r\n            Maho: Maho's sister Shuichi. She is the kind of sister who does not show like your brother, but really loves the kid and worry with it.\\n\\n\r\n            Sarashima Chizuru: It is an outrageous girl and very lively. They are always trying to make the environment pleasant for his friends. I may be wrong, but it seems to be the false representation of debauchery. Saeko Chiba orders well in dubbing\\n\\n\r\n            Suehiro Anna: I consider this my favorite character in the series. Maho's friend and famous model. In the beginning it is only a minor character, but after a while, she approaches tor, and apparently, ends up as his girlfriend. Yui Horie is going very well in the dubbing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Opinion:\\n\\n\r\n         Just because it's already Hourou Musuko noitaminA is recommended. But the series has a differential in relation to other anime, it looks so simple and subtle as heavy a topic as sexuality. Opening and closing are all really cool and the soundtrack is good (mainly because of the songs inserted). The animation is good and the trace of the characters goes well with the rhythm of history. The anime has one of the best casts of the year, and each one has its due importance and can represent in a very realistic society. Development is typically normal series of its kind, quiet and peaceful, with the main events in the play \"Romeo and Juliet\", the beginning of the courtship of Anna with Shuichi and the final episode.\\n\r\n            What makes Hour Musuko being good is not action, comedy or romance, but the subtlety with which the series is worked because even using a theme as heavy as transvestism, can be pure and rational, not using any form of the Gutter Girls people who identified with the main character. At a time when we see the world (Western and Eastern) ridicule minorities and those who escape the rules imposed by society, Musuko Hour is one of anime's most important year because it was the most human of all, true. Remember the famous kit gay? Perhaps the schools were to use this series instead of him. It would be nice a director of soap operas here in Brazil to watch the anime, so that they stop humiliate the GLS.\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Note: 85/100. It's good but not spectacular. Lacked courage in the end.\\n\\n\r\n            Similar: I can not think of anything, but say it like Aoi Hana.",

I might have had too high of expectations for the anime, but if I have a main grievance, it is the fact that they started the anime 20-30 chapters into the manga, and tried to make up for the loss of character development and plot, by having flash backs. I felt that with such limited time, (12 episodes) they weren't able to do such a beautiful manga justice. At all. \r\nTl;DR-I was severely disappointed with the anime, but I love the manga.",

            "content": "Okay, first things first: I am a straight man, reviewing Hourou Musuko.\r\nI'm quite open to these topics because they are interesting to talk about sometimes. Anyways:\r\nThis show boggled my mind; \r\nWe have a boy who likes to dress as a girl (and be one), \r\nand a girl who likes to dress as a boy (and be one).\r\nThen, we have a friend of the boy who is gay, and a girl who has a big crush on the boy (and she also knows he crossdresses).\r\nAlso how dafaq did he get these friends in the first place??\r\nWhat got me confused was the questions I was asking myselfwhile watching, that kept me entertained:\\n\r\nif he has a crush on a girl who wants to be a boy and dresses like one, does that make him gay? Which version does he like more, the fact that it is a GIRL dressing up as a boy or JUST as a boy?\\n\\n\r\nIf the boy who dresses like a girl, has a crush on a girl, that makes him straight right? Not lesbian? Even though he wants to be a girl?\\n\r\nThe characters in the show don't ignore these questions, they answer them later, which I'm quite glad about because it would drive me nuts if they didn't bring it up.\\n\\n\r\nGender can't really be put into categories such as gay and lesbian or bi, and this is what the show was trying to get across. \\n\r\nEquality? Yeah sure, the fact that girls can wear boy clothe and get away with it, but if a boy even THINKS about wearing a skirt, he is dead to society. Girls can stream cleavage and get $1000 worth of donations, pretty cool huh.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll have you know that the boy is a swag master, he has like 3 chicks or whatever that likes him, and he is only in middle school (one including a model). Like WTF? And they all know he cross-dresses! This boy is swag on another level, like if I knew I could get these kinda chicks like this, i'd cross dress in a heart beat! Just kidding, or am I.. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the show is slow-paced, but actually I didn't mind it because it just makes all those cringe-worthy awkward moments so much better. There weren't so many cringe scenes, but the awkwardness was so real. It was fun watching some character's reactions, and there is a bit of suspense when you try to figure out how they would act like if they ever found out. This boy is brave, and as a character who likes girly things, this boy is a trooper. Always speaks his mind, and is chill about anything that might have ruined his life. \\n\\n\r\nThe bullying in this show wasn't accurate enough, this was child's play compared to reality. Just wanted to point that out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe boy's friends are really interesting. If anyone is being open to everything, his friends definitely are. He picked the right friends!\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, it is all water-colory, reminds me exactly of Usagi Drop.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty generic, it has that generic chime and what not. I don't remember the music ever standing out. Just average joe to me. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to watch this show, you'd watch it for the character interactions and the real awkward moments. Also relationship/love interest are relevant too.\\n\\n\r\nI rate it 8 out of 10 genderly confused people.\\n\\n\r\n---Tiny spoliers--\\n\\n\r\nI wish the ending didn't stop there, I wanted to see the struggles of his teenager years, such as voice changing and growing beards, does he get surgery, etc. Also my best girl that I was rooting for technically won, I think..\\n\r\nI found out the anime show stops half way through the manga so I will start reading! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The synopsis does a pretty good job of describing what it is and I must say that the show was excellently executed.\r\nStory/ Characters:\r\nWith these kind of shows the story is centered around the characters and their emotions, their daily struggles of being different from society's expectations and them trying to fit in in an unknown world. It took only the 1st episode to get me hooked andthe way the characters developed throughout the show was pretty awesome. The whole show felt really realistic and the way the other characters treat the protagonists is usually what would happen in real life. I only wish that the side characters had been developed a bit more (as done in the manga) but as it is it is pretty good.(9/10)\\n\r\nArt/Music:\\n\r\nThe music was good enough and the op and the ed were fabulous and got me hooked. The art was great too, although I tend not to look at art while reviewing stuff, I should say that the animation was fluid.(8.5/10) \\n\r\n(Overall: 9.5)\\n\r\nI should point it out that after watching this my respect towards the LGBT community was increased. Not ever watched something which really relays towards that community I was deeply attached. I am a straight man and I must note on how this anime touches such a sensitive subject and yet succeeds on keeping me thoughtfully invested throughout. If anyone wants to see anime like this I am really sorry to say that there are none and I definitely recommend the manga. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Genderqueer anime characters are commonly subjected to transphobic jokes and taunted as a freakish \"other\" who dares to exhibit behaviors away from the norms of their sex. This is very much a reflection of the societal bigotry towards those who do not subscribe to the roles assigned to them by birth and dare choose to exercise their right to live according to their own desires.\r\nWandering Son is a refreshing counter to the queer phobic norms of it's medium, providing an authentic account of young teenagers trying to make their outer appearance reflect what they feel inside, at the protest of peer outrage and their ownhormonal changes. \\n\\n\r\nTatsuki and Nitori are both experiencing gender dysphoria - an intense feeling of unease from identifying with the opposite sex and not being comfortable with one\u2019s assigned sex. They cross dress as a means of finding a way to express what they feel instead of suppressing their desires to conform to the expectations of others. They do not understand why exactly they are different from their peers. They do not understand why a piece of cloth and a change of hairstyle is the cause of mass hysteria in a social setting. They do not have the answers to what will make them feel comfortable with their bodies. They are constantly questioning the meaning of gender roles and the stigmas faced by those who defy them, and in turn cause the viewer to also question why is it that we place so much importance on a person exhibiting the behaviors of their sex. Ultimately, their one true solace is in establishing relationships with those who will look past their appearance and love them for who they are internally, rather than focusing on who they are externally.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is tagged as a romantic narrative, but it would be much more appropriate to call it a platonic love story between adolescents who are defined as \"weird\" is some way socially and find acceptance in one another. One of the more powerful scenes of this anime, and this not a spoiler, is when Nitori's friends take it upon themselves to visit him at home and see if he's okay. This sounds customary for friends to do, but takes on powerful meaning when applied to a trans girl who is a social pariah because of her taste in clothing. But Nitori's friends do not care. They love her for who she is rather than how she looks and are unconcerned with the opinions of bigots who cannot see past an outer appearance.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest testament to how much attention to detail went into the development of Wandering son is in the differing treatment of Tatsuki (Female-Male) and Nitori (Male- Female). Genderquerness is not treated the same universally; trans-women are statistically subjected to more violence and social isolation than trans-men, a consequence of the belittlement of femininity as a \"weak\" trait in comparison to the \"dominant\" masculinity. Even some feminist groups who advocate for gender equality will push women towards masculine ideals of independency and power while admonishing femininities association with emotion and compassion. This is all reflected in the narrative where Tatsuki is increasingly welcomed for embracing masculinity while Nitori faces relentless harassment and interrogation from peers and teachers alike. I can hardly tell that this is a fictional narrative. \\n\\n\r\nWandering son is the most socially relevant anime of the era as far as I'm concerned. Anyone remotely interested in gender. Watch it. Anyone remotely interested in deeply intertwined relationships that extend beyond the exterior. Watch it. Anyone. Watch it.",

            "content": "When the theme of gender identity and transgender oppression is taken up in cinema or television, it is very rarely well executed. In the west, with a few exceptions, these works tend to be almost exclusively political, relying on somewhat shallow stock characters to focus on the political component of the topic at the expense of deep characterization and the personal nature of gender identity. At its worst, western writers use trans folks as tokens to prove how politically correct they are or, even more offensively, as a shallow form of comic relief. In Japanese anime, LGBT issues are often poorly handled as well. ThoughJapanese anime tends to not get as overly political as western treatments of the issue, they more often than not treat LGBT characters as some sort of spectacle, like in most bad shounen-ai, or worse yet, as a comic relief through the use of offensive stereotypes (eg., Ryuka in Steins;Gate). Issues of gender identity have been, on occasion, well-explored in anime, most obviously in Shotashi Kon\u2019s brilliant Tokyo Godfathers but also less obviously in the Ghost in the Shell movies from the perspective of transhumanist feminism a la Donna Haraway.\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko (known in English as Wandering Son), on the other hand, is something of a milestone in cinema and film on this touchy subject. This 2012 series is about Shuuchi Nitori, a shy middle school biological male who identifies girl, and Yoshino Takatsuki, a tall and lanky, though attractive, tomboy who identifies as male. Nitori struggles with personal as well as social acceptance of her gender identity throughout the series as she deals with the hardships of romantic relationships and retaining childhood friendships while growing up as a transsexual. \\n\\n\r\nThe show deals with the topic of gender identity in a decidedly serious tone that avoids almost all the problems that plague similar works. Unlike western attempts, Hourou Musuko does not over-politicize itself and develops the personality and individuality of Nitori and Takatsuki far beyond their struggles with gender identity. This more personal focus adds an element of depth to the social and political commentary that the most overly politicized western attempts could never hope for. After all, humans are political animals and issues of personal individuality and identity are never separable from the social and political context in which we exist. This fact is perhaps best typified by the issue of gender identity, a controversial political issue that is explicitly about personal individual expression. By focusing far more on the trans gender characters personally as individuals rather than as transgender in a transphobic political context, Hourou Musoko achieves a level of political depth both because the audience personally sympathizes more deeply with Nitori and Takatsuki, adding to its value as sentimental education, and because it is able to better deal with the complexity of humans as social animals.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also deals with the issue from a far deeper, more obscure and academic perspective that rarely gets discussed in popular media. This perspective (and the perspective I sympathize with the most) on gender is known in queer theory as gender performativity. Gender performativity is most closely associated with the work of poststructuralist feminist Judith Butler, who throughout her work (though most specifically in her book Gender Trouble) has argued that gender may be likened to acting in a theatrical work. In practice, our gender performance has the effect of reifying gender into something one can only have one \u201ctrue\u201d expression of, obscuring the unstable and complex nature of an individual\u2019s gender act. \\n\\n\r\nGender performativity is most obviously hinted at through the continuous motif of Nitori\u2019s work on theatrical performances in school, particularly \u201cgender bender\u201d plays in which the girls play the boys and the boys play the girl. At one point in the series, Nitori co-writes a version of Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo would rather become Juliet and Juliet would rather become Romeo, which acts as an expression of his and Takatsuki\u2019s relationship. The whole series basically references itself through this play, very obviously emphasizing the performative nature of gender. The famous line \u201cWherefore art thou Romeo?\u201d repeated several times throughout the series (though mistranslated in the English subtitles as \u201cWhy are you Romeo?\u201d) becomes an expression of Nitori\u2019s anxieties over her gender identity. The choice of Shakespearean theater as a vehicle for this motif is particularly interesting; after all, Shakespeare is a cultural legend in one of the most heteronormative and transphobic cultures around, yet the nature of theater in his time notoriously underminds traditional gender roles as all actors in female roles were male. \\n\\n\r\nThough I could go on and on about this aspect of the series\u2019 theme and I would like to write a more thorough analysis of gender performativity in this anime, that is outside the scope of this review and I am far from an expert on Judith Butler or feminist theory. Gender identity is not the only theme that is conveyed through this very simple, yet effective, plot. Also dealt with are typical fare in anime such as growing up, balancing individuality with healthy conformity to social expectations (an especially difficult topic in modern Japan as its historically collectivist culture has been challenged by interactions with western individualism since World War II), homosexuality, and the follies of youthful romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs intellectually engaging as Hourou Musuko\u2019s plot is, it is not without its issues. The pacing is a little fast and uneven in certain places, particularly at the beginning where we are faced with an onslaught of new characters who are referred to by several different names, creating a difficulty in knowing who\u2019s who. The dialogue is occasionally contrived and some of the social situations are a bit rushed into to the point of being unbelievable (particularly Nitori\u2019s interactions with Doi near the end). However, over all the story is reasonably well-executed and is both deeply touching and intellectually challenging.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is arguably its best feature. Nitori and Takatsuki are adorable and likable characters who are also very deep. Both are dynamic and well-written protagonists with a variety of very complex motivations and struggles who act as compelling foils to each other. The supporting cast of characters is equally well-written. Even when characters, at least the major ones, come off as cruel and transphobic to the protagonists, there is usually a deeper reason for their actions beyond simple transphobia: whether it\u2019s Nitori\u2019s sister (an aspiring model who wants to become the picture of feminine beauty who struggles with her own masculine traits and is envious of  Nitori\u2019s feminine beauty), Chiba (who is in love with Nitori and jealous of her relationship with Takatsuki so acts somewhat cruelly towards Takatsuki,) or Doi (who, it is strongly hinted, may be struggling with homosexuality). Not only are nearly all the characters engaging, believable, and well-written, their relationships with each other strengthen the depth of the show; a number of characters act as in Takatsuki\u2019s circle of friends act as parallel characters to Nitori\u2019s, and there are numerous foils throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Hourou Musoko excels far beyond your typical anime. The animation struck me as odd at first with its high brightness, background sets that look like water colors, minimalistic character designs, and heavy use of pastel colors. However, it works with the simple and sweet nature of the story and adds to the aesthetic atmosphere of the anime. The directing style is comparable with most of Makoto Shinkai\u2019s wonderful films such as 5 Centimeters per Second or Mamoru\u2019s Hasoda\u2019s brilliant Wolf Children. There is an attention to detail in transition sequences, pillow shots, and camera angles that is rarely achieved in any style of film. Often, the focus will be on some minor detail that serves as a symbolic motif (such as Anna\u2019s cell phone charm) during scenes of dialogue. It creates the relatable and charming vibe of a really good slice-of-life anime while having far more depth than most works of that genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, like most of the other features of this anime, is very simple yet highly effective. In very similar fashion to Tenomon\u2019s work in Shinkai films, it mostly consistent of elegant, simple, and melancholy piano melodies that matches the emotion and atmosphere of the relevant scenes. The soundtrack accomplishes more, perhaps, in what it doesn\u2019t do than what it does; there are extensive periods of silence or nothing but dialogue which remain intensely emotional. Even the lyrics and atmosphere of the closing song, with uber-kawaii matching animations of Nitori, contribute to the series. The voice acting is good but nothing to write home about as occasionally, especially in the case of Chiba and Mako, the parts are under-acted. Nonetheless, Asami Seto\u2019s work as Takatsuki Kuosuko Hatakeyma as Nitori, and Yui Horie as Anna are very good performances and the voice acting overall is more than adequate.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line: Huroru Musoko is a deep, heartwarming, and phenomenally directed take on gender identity that should be viewed not only by anime fans, but anyone interested in LGBT rights as a thought-provoking work of art, anyone struggling with gender identity in their personal lives as a therapeutic and relatable story, or anyone who is opposed to trans rights as a work of sentimental education. It is particularly relevant here in America where recent issues of bathroom bills and transsexual discrimination laws have dominated political discourse. I do not know how anyone could come out of this wonderful series without their perspective on gender identity deepened or changed. I now consider it my second favorite anime ever made and would recommend it to almost anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nPlot: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n",

But with Hourou Musuko, I had to make an exception.\r\nThis review is written after watching 11 episodes.\r\nI have seen many animes that touch on the idea of gender benders and opposite gender plays but never have I seen an entire anime dedicated to portraying the life of a teenage boy with his own gender identification crisis. The story takes you long with Nitori, our main character, who sets out to discover how he really feels about himself (or herself).\r\nWe are able to put ourselves intoNitori's shoes and witness and understand how he feels about himself in everyday convesations, activities, and his own urges. How he approaches and handles each situation is completely realistic and awe-inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nI highly commend AIC for producing such a wonderful anime on a matter such as gender identity. This anime really helps you understand how people going through the same situations feel. With that said, if I could, I would have given this anime a 13/10. But unfortunately, we're left with a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n*Note* Do not come into this anime with a judgmental mindset. It will only ruin the message and the delivery of it if you do.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, real quick before I leave, the OST of this anime is simply awesome. Enough said.",

Two things I think could have been done differently is the artwork and the storytelling. \r\nThough the story is ingrained in reality, the artwork is vague and dream-like, a style that would better be used for more escapist animes. Animation like ToraDora would suit the Hourou Musuko more because of ToraDora's attention to shadows and detail, which would thus further ingrain a realistic nature in Hourou Musuko.\r\nTelling this story from when they entered middle school is a difficult task, and only a master could help newcomerscatch on with the story from there. This show did it's best to welcome the newcomer, but did not succeed completely because of a fast-paced beginning.\\n\\n\r\nHourou Musuko's story is amazing as it is deeply character-driven, and that each character has special attributes. It's themes of insecurity, growing up, and inner pain is something escapists will absolutely hate (bitter) and what analysts will find interesting (complex). But what all notice from its bitter complexities is that Hourou Musuko is unique, a wine ready to be smelt and sipped. Mature as the show is, it will appeal to those who yearn for something unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy Hourou Musuko a lot, and I'm always looking forward to the next episode. Cheers",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko is a wonderful tale about growing up and maturing, but also of those minorities that society typically shuns. A face paced adaption, yet only 11 episodes, it is hard to follow especially when the female lead Takatsuki dresses like a man, and the art is very realistic (except everyone and everything is VERY shiny). A mix of puberty, romance, and morals hourou musuko is a watch that is enjoyable but also has a meaningful message.\r\nThe first thing you want to do is be able to recognize characters and fast. We start partially way into the story, where there is anxiety between Takatsuki, Nitori,and Chiba. Takatsuki (female) likes to dress like a man and Nitori (male) likes to dress like a girl. This doesn't necessarily mean they want to be the other gender, but they just feel that way. Obviously, while it is easier for Takatsuki to open to the public, only these two girls are in on Nitori's secret. Close friends before the school year started, there is romantic feelings looming after this trio had a falling out.\\n\\n\r\nChiba becomes the cold hearted girl who never backs down on her opinions, and fights with everyone else. Rebellious, she can be awesome at times but there are also a few people that found her annoying. Nitori has one more friend who is in on his secret, Makoto. He is understanding of Nitori because he is interested in the opposite gender romantically. Mako-chan is a great support for the cast. There are many other kids like the comedian Chizuru, who is incredibly courageous as she is loud and silly, and the bully Doi, who picked on Nitori in the past.\\n\\n\r\nIn all every character has something that makes them noticeable. As Chiba says in the last episode, \"[Nitori] isn't that special.\" / \"No, we are all just special.\" The plot is wholeheartedly devoted to character development and little else. While there is a lot of changes in the characters, the unfortunate part is that due to the time constraints we don't get to see just how special most of the characters are, and sometimes we never really learn the background. Take the transsexual couple that Nitori and Makoto seem to know. They appear three times and act as parent figures to the boys, yet their appearance and role is slightly confusing and unexplained. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show emphasizes the maturing of these special youths, we find that there is plenty of love going around on the sidelines. Nitori finds himself as a target of affection, but in the end this skirt wearing boy has more balls than almost any male lead I can think of. If you watch a lot of anime eventually you get used to the frustrating step of confessing. Thankfully in this realistic tale, of these unusual kids, we are given a successful relationship that fits reality. Of course, the result is odd a little bit but nevertheless it is an enjoyable one.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is odd. That's the point though, to show you that there is nothing wrong with crossdressing or having affections for the same sex, that sometimes people close themselves off from people, that doing what you want to do sometimes works out. There's a bit of comedy, and a bit of romance, yet foremost it is the character themselves that give the show life. Of course, if you have a strong dislike of these minorities you will never like the characters, and that life that they give off.",

            "content": "Very different from the usual anime, not sure whether I can say it is the only one of it's kind, but I have at least never seen anything like it. Of course there is tons of gender bender series out there, as well as plenty of lesbian and gay series. But those series are mostly unrealistic and for entertainment only, while Hourou Musuko creates a very real story, that could very well be happening somewhere right now. \r\nIt starts off very vague, and while it is clear that the series has gender issues as a subject, it's not clear who has what issue etc., thoughthis adds to the realism (it does get cleared up tho). \\n\r\nThe series emphasizes on the fact that not everything is black and white, that a girl can prefer wearing boy's clothes but doesn't want to actually be male. But the series captures the fact that it takes a lot of trying and doubting before one knows, or does one ever really know? This is probably why they chose the delicate period in everyone's life known as puberty, where things like gender issues become far more apparent because of body changes, and the mind is continuously in turmoil.\\n\r\nIn the end they leave the issues as they are, we have seen the characters progress, but none of them really 'know' yet. Nitori's voice is changing, even though he still loves to dress in girl's clothes, and he is fine with that for now. The show does not really end like most shows, because is there really an end to doubts about certain subjects? It is merely a portrayal of how teenagers struggle with their gender identity, and a fine one at that. \\n\r\nI did have some mild issues with the anime. The character design bothered me a bit the first few episodes, because of the excessive hair shine right on top of everyone's hair, it looked as if they all had snow on their heads. Another thing is, that I'm not sure whether anime is the right medium for this story. I would love to see it as a live action series, though I can imagine it would be hard to find a boy that looks like a cute girl to play Nitori. I might seek out the manga someday, because I feel that some of the characters (Doi!) still have very interesting stories to tell.",

            "content": "Gender identity and puberty: two topics that are usually avoided in anime, but in this one appear as the main focus. Hourou Musauko is a story mainly focusing on one character: A male who identifies as a female. One of his friends happens to be a female who identifies as a male- acting as a sort of inspiration for our central character. \r\nAcceptance is a major theme of this work. Both accepting yourself and to be accepted by others. Being comfortable with yourself, even when you are around others. The story features both happy and sad moments for our character as he faces many obstaclesas he carries on his journey to finding himself and to fully accept who he really is. \\n\\n\r\nFor such an underwatched series the production value really is great. Sound/Music is pretty amazing and the opening song is the type of anime song you watch on your own separate time just because its that good. The visuals are very appealing to the eye and fit well with this anime- though my one main gripe with the show are the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several characters who happen to look exactly like another character and it wasn't until a few episodes in that I felt comfortable distinguishing the characters from one another. Some of the characters felt underdeveloped and I would have loved to see more screen time of them- but as this anime focuses on gender identity the main star of this show are, of course, the two transgender characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat are little girls made of? What are little boys made of? This anime does a great job exploring the issue of gender identity from the perspective of middle school students. Middle school is, of course, a time where you fully examine who you are and what your identity entails. I think the innocence of the students in the anime, as well as the mean-spirited vibe from some middle schoolers, made for a great anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. A great series that felt short on some minor things and didn't have too much to make you go \"wow this anime is special\". Though, it does cover a topic frequently ignored by other anime and for that I give it props. Pacing was off in the beginning but when the anime picked up, I didn't want to stop watching. I definitely recommend this series, especially if you're looking for something unique.",

First it goes on about a play involving gender change.\r\nThe theme about wanting to be a girl is treated pretty seriously. It is not only a story about a boy who wants to be a girl, but about a person who is different from the rest and in a certain way, better than them too. Obviously it is not excerpt of problems. Most of them come from the prejudice thatsays than women becoming men gain something, but men becoming women lost something instead of gaining it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not shallow, they just behave as young people. This is a problem with such a mature setting. On the other hand, it's a great choice to focus on the protagonist's friends and left mostly out all the scum that cannot accept him. In fact, when they are took into account, the story decays a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nDrawing is interesting and appealing to the eye, and goes along well with the theme. It seems to me that it makes the anime more delicate.\\n\\n\r\nBut the story despite having a so powerful premise, begins to falter as it comes to a conclusion. There's not a lot of drama here: involving friendship, love triangle, cross-dressing, bullying... and everybody stays so calm! Characters do not seem to change, face problems or evolve. The series ends as it could have ended on the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhy accept this challenging theme if you don't want to beat the crap out of reality? It reminds me of Oreimo's second season. If you want to do it, do it. If you don't want, make another shonen with special attacks.\\n\\n\r\nWell, perhaps in the future someone will work on the second step forward.\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\nOriginal and brave premise.\\n\r\nCharacters are not stereotypes, they're pleople.\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\nCharacters, despite it's interest, are very young and this does not work very well.\\n\r\nAlmost no drama.\\n\r\nThere is not an ending, just a pretty shy conclusion.",

            "content": "This review contain minor spoilers.\r\nIf you've been on the internet for any amount of time, particularly in the past few years, you'd know gender identity and transsexualism are hotly debated topics. Especially if you frequent anonymous image boards, you\u2019ll come across a lot of people trying to paint these issues in a black or white, us and them mentality. The difference between these posts and Wandering Son beyond Wandering Son not being a cynical tryhard, is that Wandering Son understands how complex these issues are and portrays them in a somewhat realistic scenario. I think the reason why so little media has tackled these themesis because a lot of creatives don\u2019t really understand them and are self aware enough to know that. I am not one to give points to a work just for the subject matter it attempts to portray however, but thankfully Wandering Son does not need any charity points and even stands out among similar media that handles these subjects. While shows such as Revolutionary Girl Utena and Steven Universe obscure the subject matter through a lot of allegory and metaphors, Wandering Son tackles the subject literally and is the entire focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike most things that aren't Ping Pong, Wandering Son has problems. The show starts out more than a bit confusing. The adaptation starts at about volume 5 of the manga. As a result you miss out on a lot of character establishment that the anime handles far less gracefully than its subject matter. I found it really confusing attaching names and personalities to faces without the help of Wikipedia filling me in on the backstory to all these kids. On the subject of kids, Wandering Son wants to have its cake and eat it too with having a realistic depiction of its characters. It wants these kids to be mature enough to understand their situation and be pretty intelligent but also wants them to be young enough that they're about to hit puberty, which for Nitori means they\u2019re about to get a deep voice and grow a lot of hair and that Takatsuki's breasts are going to get so big she's gonna need to wear a bra or something. Both of these are all fine and dandy on their own but together they almost broke my suspension of disbelief and could certainly break it for a viewer not willing to give the show the high amount of slack I did. Now I'm going to give somewhat of an excuse for what I think the author is going for by doing this. I think these kids, for the most part, act on a maturity level similar to someone in high school. If the kids were old enough to be in high school, not only would we skip the crucial stage in their development that is puberty but the crossdressing would be a bit less believable. Whether or not these trades in believability of the world were worth it or not is going to depend on your suspension of disbelief which is broken by different things for different people but for me the rest of the shows strengths were good enough to make me overlook these problems which I do consider to be minor.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a perfect representation of children struggling with their gender identity? Nah. Is it accurate enough to portray the themes and character dynamics of this show? Absolutely. Despite my previous complaints these characters feel like real people. More impressively, none of the drama feels forced. Conflicts arise not because of silly misunderstandings but fundamental differences between a character's ideas being at odds with another character's or society's ideas. Sometimes these characters are selfish or just mean spirited. Particularly Nitori I found to be an endearing character, who for the most part I was on their side when it came to conflict, had a few moments where they\u2019re just kinda selfish without realizing it. A scene of Nitori wanting to wear their sister\u2019s dress while the sister tried to pull it off went a long way to humanizing Nitori and showing just how shitty their situation is. Another moment that struck me as extremely well done is when Takatsuki revealed that Nitori was dating someone while in the restroom to Saorin. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I feel it\u2019s an inert wanting to know that other people are just as frustrated with a situation as you are. It was such a fantastic, small moment that me love the character that much more. All characters display this selfishness to some extent, but none as much as Saori. While I found her to be a dislikeable character, she's probably my favorite addition to the cast as she represents a much more conflicted and complex angle than you'll find in some pretentious twitter post. Even if she can come off as a huge bitch that only throws tantrums when things don't go her way, even when her unhappiness is only caused by the world not catering to her specifically, it's always somewhat justified and consistent with her character. However she does change as a character later in the series as she begins to talk to other characters and understand herself more. And this kind of adversity is at the heart of most of Wandering Son's complex characters, they aren't satisfied with the world around them or themselves and how they deal with it is what makes them interesting. I should mention that their problems don\u2019t start and end with gender identity and sexuality. There\u2019s a lot of stuff these characters go through besides those issues they go through. The main thing being these love polygons that keep getting bigger between the main cast I\u2019d usually be groaning at in almost any other anime. The relationships depicted here, while I felt were a bit unrealistic, all fit in with the general theme of these kids being confused in terms of what they want. I think it\u2019s impressive how subtly the show portrays how shitty this world is for these characters from everyone\u2019s point of view. How well this is done is directly proportionate to how much screen time they get, so Nitori gets a little more bias when exploring this aspect of his character. But because they get this bias their conflicts are given the most attention. One of the most powerful moments in the series is the day after he goes to school as a girl. At first I thought it was silly how cartoonishly evil the kids were but a few seconds later it hit me how actually realistic that situation was. What's more is that it's an issue that doesn't just go away for Nitori, it's a huge part of the show for its remaining duration, as short as that is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point I should mention exactly how \"slice of life\" this show is, I'm not that familiar with these types of shows and I'm not too sure how well Wandering Son fits into that genre, but this show is very much characters going through their everyday life. There's hardly any dramatic arc or plot to be discussed. The writing for the most part is engaging and was good enough to keep me interested in something as dumb as a middle school play, even though plot wise it can hardly be called a dramatic arc. This is a show entirely held up by its characters and dialogue. As such this show has virtually no pacing and if that is something you know you're not into I would not recommend picking up this show. That being said I have a very short fuse when it comes to my attention span during an anime which makes me happy to say I was never bored during Wandering Son. The dialogue and characters were strong enough for me and I never felt like I was just waiting for something to happen or wasting time. Even if it was wasting time plot wise, character wise it never misses an opportunity or line of dialogue to develop or humanize the people in this world. There are a few odd moments and while they aren't nearly enough to spoil the whole package, they definitely made me back up and watch the scene again for how bizarre it was. The most striking example to me was in the first few episodes where Nitori's friend, out of nowhere, states that their teacher is cool and wonders if he likes boys. The lines of dialogue right before and after these lines have very awkward transitions that just don\u2019t flow naturally. This is probably the most prominent example, and the fact that it came so early made the later disconnects in dialogue a bit more natural in comparison. But like I said these moments are far and few between. However if you can't get over the barrier of middle school kids being a bit more mature than they should you might feel this way for the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nI hesitate to bring up things like animation or audio because I'm not confident in discussing them properly like I am other aspects of media, and I don't have any meaningful criticisms of the animation and audio. That being said, I hated both of these aspects of the show. The glossy look of the characters and unconventional instruments gave the setting kind of a nostalgic or childish feel that I absolutely couldn't get behind. The backgrounds were generally gorgeous and very understated. An effect I saw used on a lot of the background is a lack of borders, with the background itself fading into some kind of white void. It gave a surreal effect on the environment while never conflicting with the realistic tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn this genre, it\u2019s important that your characters aren\u2019t stereotypes. And in Wandering Son none of them can be described in a sentence or two. These are complex people more than anything, except for maybe the girl who follows Chizuru around who was so superfluous I forgot her name. And these characters were so complex and interesting I was rarely bored while watching a show with a plot that\u2019s almost non existent. It\u2019s a struggle to find any real complaints with this series, but to warn some viewers one potential problem is that the characters at the end of the show are still pretty conflicted with very messy and undefined roles in society. They aren\u2019t completely ok with themselves and still have a lot of work to do before they can be satisfied with themselves. Mostly because this adaptation does not cover much of the manga. While some people may see this as a problem, I was more than satisfied with how the show ends and where all the characters end up.",

It really does go into, as I read another reviewer say, as to how males and females are classified in this world. But its more than that, yes, while the situation is rather different, this series screams childhood. No, I do not mean that it is made for children, but rather to remind us who are no longer children of childhood. Never have I been able to relate to a series like I relate to this one, even though goodness knows I have never questioned my gender orsexuality. But, from its slow piano music, to its soft laughter, to its beautiful water-colour style art, this show is sweetly nostalgic, reminding us of not just of how our childhood was to others, but of our feelings at that time.\\n\r\nI highly reccomend it, its not action filled, but as each series ends with its wonderful theme, 'For You' by Rie Fu, you cant help but smile :)\\n",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko (Wandering Son) is pretty much grounded in reality and is a believable display of transgender life. It manages to incorporate both support and discrimination of the lifestyle in a very subtle fashion that almost seems natural - a definite plus. I initially thought that the show was going to focus on cross-dressing only (since up to episode 3, that was the only transgender topic put in the spotlight), but as I watched more episodes, eventually they touched on more and more topics and it felt more complete that way. My gripe with the story lies with the lack of any true antagonist forthe transgender view aside from the student body. If there is no true antagonist to the main character's point of view, then where is the conflict? I guess this is one of those instances wherein relying on reality (in this case, commonfolk being repulsed at non-normative ways of living) too much hinders the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe character ensemble is pretty much okay; they aren't really outstanding for me but they serve their purposes in the anime well. I feel, however, that the main cast act way too maturely for their age and it honestly is a hindrance when it comes to immersion. There are barely any tears shed in the show, and the severe lack of emotional outbursts - which I felt the show sorely needed - I have to attribute to the ill-placed maturity of the whole main cast. This is not to say that the main characters are horrible - since they act and think maturely for their age, they serve as respectable representatives of the transgender experience for the viewer. Some of the supporting cast that I thought wouldn't serve major roles are actually surprisingly relevant to both plot and character development of the main cast; so I have to give a plus for that, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values for the show are a bit shaky. Art style-wise, the choice of pastel shades for the color template was a nice touch as I think the show wanted the viewers to subconsciously associate the show with their childhood. The background art isn't offensive either. The VA work was a bit shoddy, however. As one of the characters is supposedly undergoing puberty, I could barely notice the voice change except in one scene. Also, probably one of the few emotional outbursts in the show (I think it was the end of Episode 3) ended up being ruined by bad VA work and I ended up laughing - definitely not the show's intention. As for the sound, I appreciate that the show was able to create tension out of nothingness and/or background noise, but the show often falls into this formula and as a result, some dramatic scenes fall flat experience-wise.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I give this show a 6/10. It's definitely a decent, inoffensive portrayal of transgender issues - a sensitive topic to cover at that - but it definitely isn't outstanding either, all things being considered.",

            "content": "Hourou Musuko is a special type of show. It goes beyond the traditional, over the top drama that is almost always presented in most 'slice of life' shows and instead chooses to portray a very accurate depiction of the struggle of things like puberty, school, family, and friends when dealing with transgender individuals.\r\nThe best thing, by far, would have to be the characters. As stated above, this anime takes a realistic approach to its genre, and it certainly pays off, the characters' conversations, behaviors, and actions feel realistic and genuine in every scenario they're placed into, whether it be an emotion packed scene or asimple lighthearted conversation, and the voice talents do extremely well in conveying whatever emotion is called for.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also outstanding. The artists used a pastel like palette, and makes excellent use of Shadows, lights and darkness to set the mood of certain scenes, along with small touches, like reflections bending in a curved mirror or the slight reflection of a character in a window.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is simultaneously a weak and strong point of the series. The soundtrack is comprised of both original and pre-existing musical works, such as \"Claire de Lune\" by Claude Debussy. Most of the original music drifts into the generic zone, though this isn't necessarily a bad thing. This isn't really a series that needs the most original music ever, and the light style of it helps with the more simple scenes where conveying a lot of feeling isn't required.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is definitely an area of conflict for me. On one hand, I really enjoy the existing levity of the plot, though on the other hand, the series doesn't really go anywhere with a lot of things, and many more things are left dishearteningly vague for those who haven't read the manga. With that said, the story, overall, is good. It does rely a bit on existing tropes for the slice of life and drama genres, but it's what's done with these tropes that really help Hourou Musuko shine.",

            "content": "Story (7/10):\r\nDespite indulging in what some people might call a \"controversial\" topic the story of the anime was really quite the standard i mean if you actually remove the whole cross-dressing thing from the plot you will get exactly same plot as many other Drama anime out there.\r\nOne positive thing about the show is how it handled past event where hints or conversations gives and idea of what took place before instead of actually showing you what happened. This method was actually really well executed. Story telling and flashback are still there though\r\nThe romance followed the formula of a love trian.... well i am notreally sure you can call it a triangle. Let's just say that there is alot of relationships were the MC is at the center off. Still the romance was not really a focus of the show in anyway, telling the \"controversial\" was the main thing with the romance there to do it's role. Let's just say that there was no intensity about the relationships\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nCharacters growth was by far the best part about this anime as you can see how by every episode the characters understood more about them selves and about each other. by the end when you see how the two main characters gradually see the real reason behind their actions (which they themselves didn't quite understand) you will get a really satisfying feeling\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animations (8/10):\\n\r\nThe art style had this tuned down warm colored feel to it. It helped set the mood and the general setting pretty well\\n\r\nAs for animations it was well made. really high attention to details such as hair and facial expressions was shown and it was really good\\n\\n\r\nMusic (7/10):\\n\r\nMaybe i was not paying attention but the music didn't stand out much for me. The Op and ED were really suiting the feel of the show\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nThe show was more lighthearted than one would expect from an anime discussing such topics. there was no edge to it. It was clearly shown by the amount of character who were really supporting and helpful to the two MCs i mean it was not realistic at all not even 10% hell even the people who didn't approve were more like \"oh creepy\" but that is it. it really took away from the impact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5):\\n\r\nAt it's heart Hourou Musuko is really a simple Drama/slice of life anime with a \"controversial\" topic put in it to give it an edge but that edge was dulled by being too peaceful and if removed you will get just another Drama (although a really good one)\\n\r\nA more realistic approach to the subject matter would have given it a lot more impact IMO and would have made the anime as a whole at least twice as good",

            "content": "This was a show I decided to watch on a whim on a day where I didn't have much to do\u2026 it turned out to be a very good decision. It left a good impression on me, and after the second episode I just had to keep watching it straight through because it kept you wandering what would happen next, even if you knew the possibilities. I've read a few bl's here and there where a guy wants to be a girl and all kinds of drama unfolds. To be honest that's what attracted me to this show, but the reverse about the girl wantingto be a boy was also pretty interesting. I don't quite relate to her (Yoshino), but I've been around similar people so it's not strange to me at all. Personally, I think this is one of those \"before its time\" kind of series, where it might take a while for people to catch onto it and it's messages, like how these days people are generally becoming more aware and acceptable of lgbt people (I'm not one for labels and such so don't feel offended\u2026I get offended myself when people rely on them too much). \\n\\n\r\nSince the main characters are middle schoolers, I feel like this could be a do or don't for some people. I agree it could have been more relatable if they were high schoolers, but it's all the more interesting because of the \"tender age\" they're at and they become aware of how the world really thinks. Some characters are static, and a bit unaccepting of the themes and such represent how the world really is. ///on a side note, I relate fairly well to boys that want to \"pretty\" themselves, the ones that want to become girlish and such. I'm a bit of a girly girl who likes to see cute things and wants to be cute at the same time (my rock-bottom sense of confidence might say otherwise lol). The trials of Shuuichi emulate this, so he kind of became my favorite in this show ~u~\" /// I'm also a bit of a thinker who wonders about all sorts of things\u2026\"gender\" is merely just another word to me, a concept created and idea stuck in our heads that most of us do not want to get rid of because it keeps \"order\" in \"society\" and such\u2026 in the beginning of this show, they ask questions like \"what are little girls made of\" and \"what are little boys made of\"\u2026 the way this show explores the gender ideal and the boundaries we place on it really make it interesting and somewhat deep. \\n\\n\r\nI found the art somewhat average. The pale-watercolor style just oozes innocence, which is good but if you don't take to the story within the first few episodes it might just straight up annoy you\u2026 The music is also average but I enjoyed it. The op grew on me and the ed has a special place in my heart now because I love the way Rie fu sings and I was surprised that she did the song (currently not in the info for the show :| )\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite me watching it in one day, I really enjoyed the complexity (yet predictability) of the characters and the story that surrounds them. I totally recommend this to anyone who just wants something different to watch and has nothing to do! You might even have a few pairing ships to set sail (although it doesn't look like mine will T\u2014T\\ ~~ \\n\\n\r\n---review no.5 (^-^)/",

            "content": "Most people would understand what teenagers go through in their puberty but not everyone would truly understand what a teenager having identity crisis goes through. So it is very good thing that there is an actual series which tackles this kind of issue.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nLet me explain why it is simple and rare and how it made this series an amazing one. It is simple because unlike your everyday story with explosive plots or heart-pounding revelations in the storylines, this series tackles one of the most common issues in our society. And because the plot is simple it becomes a lotmore realistic and some can truly relate or understand the story. The drama becomes natural and not over the top because it is realistic and simple. While the plot is a very common issue in real life, it is very rare for manga or anime to have this kind of plot. It becomes a breath of fresh air from your typical series. But what I love about it is the chosen rare plot of it about gender identity crisis. For homosexuals or transsexuals, there\u2019s nothing harder than the first stage of their realizations and that is during the time of their puberty. This is the stage where a lot of manifestations of being a girl or boy occur in our body. And there\u2019s nothing more horrifying for someone having gender issues to experience changes in their body which literally shows their gender.  It\u2019s like biologically, their body is literally telling them their reality. And it is the worst time for teenagers because they\u2019re in a very young world where people around them are not mature enough to understand what they\u2019ve been going through. I think it is even harder for transsexuals particularly boys. I strongly believe that this kind of issue is something that literally can never be granted. Some can dress up, change sex, or even try so hard to look like a boy or a girl but literally they can never become what they truly desire. I can only imagine what that feels like. To want something so bad and yet nature literally can never give it to them. And even for someone like me who have gay friends, I won\u2019t be able to genuinely understand what they\u2019ve been through or still going through. The drama that comes with this kind of plot is really inspiring and touching. It is definitely great that there is series like this.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters are very inspiring. And because the plot is simple and realistic, the characters are someone that anyone can truly relate to. Each of their stories and how they handle their issues are really inspiring even for someone who doesn\u2019t have this kind of story. I believe compared to the other protagonist, Nitorin\u2019s character struggle more on the issue or manifested gender identity crisis a lot more. Setting aside dressing up, he even falls in love not once but twice with the opposite sex. Plus, it is so weird that despite almost all his friends knows that he loves cross-dressing and yet three girls actually like him. Though, I just want to mention that oddly enough, Saorin\u2019s character is the weirdest of all. As much as it is common for me issues like gender identity crisis, her issue is the most complicating one. I mean, still falling involve with a tyranny and even help him dress up. Seriously, that\u2019s weirder I think.  \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation is quite different from the typical animation of today. It even feels like old but somehow it is still great. The sounds match well with the drama of the story. It gives a final touch to the greatness of the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nMore than a breath of fresh air, it is a very inspiring series. One that very rarely seen. If not relate to, at least understand a little bit of their world. \\n",

It was really refreshing, since it is sweet and innocent, but not juvenile and filled with slapstick, like other anime portraying schoolchildren.\r\nStory: 3/10 The story really drew me in, and it isn't a bad story per se, just not really executed well. Here's the thing. The pacing is slow...very slow....but starts in the middle and makes lurching jumps in time. Dropping stuff from manga is OK with me, but not when characters bring those other story-lines up with no explanation of where they came from. I don't need to be spoon-fed, all I'm saying is that this animeisn't a coherent whole. There's always that niggling thought that \"Maybe that made sense in the manga, or in the bonus scenes\" But as far as I'm concerned, that really detracted from my overall experience. Also, repetitive plot arcs. In only 13 episodes. Hghnngn\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 This is where Hourou really shines. The characters in the middle school all have such interesting relationships, and so much awkward sexual tension ^^(Cute!). I like how they're just trying to live their lives, not bare their souls through exposition. It's really hard to figure the characters out. Most of the time, they really can't figure themselves out, but their growth feels realistic and plausible. (At least where the plot holes don't get in the way- this happens quite a bit with secondary characters. I felt myself asking, 'Who the heck is that and why should I care about them?' I feel like many secondary characters could have been cut)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 VERY cute. I didn't get tired of the characters cute round faces or the muted color palette. It felt like I was watching something new and unique, but the art style wasn't so brash that it was distracting from the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 The voice acting is really nice. They seemed to fit really well. I guess I don't have too much to say about it. I didn't notice the sound effects and music much, so that's good, isn't it? The opening and closing themes really grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 I really liked this anime because I was in the mood for it. Get ready to put on your serious face about transgender issues.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 As far as great visuals, character-driven story, and intellectual interest, this was great. It hit the nail right on the head for me. The plot holes were just too much for me to ignore, though. I feel like they could have made the story tighter and eliminated some of those loose ends.",

The story itself is very slow phased, and not much happens every episode. The story isn't very difficult to understand, but there are some twist's and turns here and there, that you may not seen coming.\r\nThe characters are very realistic, they aren't perfect and all of them deals with different kind of problem's, somemore serious than other's. Since the story revolves so much on the characters it's hard not to care about most of them, and you really begin to synthesize how hard Nitori and Takatsuki are going through. It's not a easy life their livin', but it's the only life they have and they have to make the best of it!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful in this anime! It's a little traditionally and the colors and design are very unique in my eyes.

But if your a boy and act, and your wear girl clothing then your treated as a pervert by everyone.

            "content": "Transsexualism is a topic that never gets attention in western TV, radio or any other medium. For the most time it gets branded as gross and that those people are somewhat weird. For me personally it stands at the same point as Homosexuality, being a part of the society, we have to accept the people as they are and not see them as anything less than we are (that is only my opinion though and I can\u2019t force that on anyone!). The Anime that I want to talk about today, is an Anime that deals with exactly that topic, but in a way that mostother shows don\u2019t. It does it in a way, that neither supports random fanservice, nor any inappropriate humor about the transsexuals themselves, but in a very mature way and leaves behind a quite bitter taste about what exactly those kids have to encounter. Hourou Musuko, adapted from the Manga by Shimura Takako, the same author that  wrote Aoi Hana, is an Anime that is able to portrait the feelings of a minority in a beautiful way and really makes you think about such a difficult topic.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is not much story to this show, as it has no overarching plotline whatsoever, with it being pure Slice of Life, but rather shows how kids deal with different situations and most important puberty.\\n\r\nThe basic plot revolves around Nitori Shuuichi, a shy boy, that wants to be a girl and likes to dress up as such and Takatsuki Yoshino, a boyish girl, that wants to be a boy and likes to dress as such either. They get to know each other in 5th grade (elementary school), as Nitori transfers to that school and they get friends quickly. Not only them though, as others get to know Nitori well too, but only Takatsuki and another girl, Chiba Sayori, know his secret of being transgender. As they get into middle school, they are in the same class again and meet many other girls and boys that they get friends with. From here on we have all the Slice of Life stuff going on and it basically depicts Nitori and his friends going through a bunch of stuff.\\n\r\nAs I said, the plot is really simple and nothing outstanding at all. While we have quite some things going on, most noticeable a love triangle which pretty much must be one of the best that I have seen up to date, but still it stays rather simple. In my opinion though, this is what helps the show a lot to get it\u2019s message across and while the story is simple that in no way means it is bad, it is just not the driving force for this Anime.\\n\r\n7.2\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in in Hourou Musuko are to keep it short, fantastic.\\n\r\nThe first character I want to talk about is our main protagonist, Nitori Shuuichi. He is a shy boy, that actually wants to become a girl and from the first episode on he is a really likeable character. He has to go through a lot and even though he is something that after normal standards is labeled as weird, the viewer doesn\u2019t think so in any way (at least I didn\u2019t)\\n\r\nThe second character is Takatsuki Yoshino, a boyish girl that actually wishes she was born as a boy. She hates everything about cute clothes and things that are similar to that. She also acts a lot more boyish than Nitori does.\\n\r\nThe last main character is Chiba Sayorin, a really quite girl, that at first doesn\u2019t seem to have any feelings at all, except her love for Nitori that she confesses quite early and which is the reason for a lot of tension between some of the characters. She is the one that is mostly the least relateable to at first but becomes a lot better character later on.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of the show might be one of the strongest I have seen so far. It features many character archetypes, but done in ways that make them really interesting and I loved more than one character in there.\\n\r\nYou might have realized that I left further characterization out for now, that is due to the point that I can actually say things about the whole cast. Every single character in this show is relatealble! No kidding! I myself am not transgender and I could perfectly feel for either Takatsuki and Nitori as they went through there struggles and could perfectly feel for everyone, as they slowly start to realize that puberty is coming. Along to that, everyone in the cast acts a lot more realistic than in other Anime and Manga and even though the author seems to be a bit idealistic at times with some of the characters accepting things really fast, he shows that this is not the case in other scenes. I really thought that the whole cast of main AND supporting characters was just amazingly well done. I loved every single interaction, loved to see how they acted and was interested in every single development and character type the show presented. That is a sign of a truly great character cast and I only know few shows that made me feel that way. Huge praise for this show\u2019s characters as it stands to me as one of the stronger Anime Casts out there, if not one of the best.\\n\r\n9.2\\n\\n\r\nArt: The Art of Hourou Musuko is a little different from other Anime, as it is drawn in a style that resembles watercoloring. Seeing that artstyle, put me off at first, but later really compliments the story. The show was animated by AIC, which are also responsible for shows like Acchi Kocchi, and from an Animation standpoint, it looks quite good. The Animation is pretty fluent and the coloring and lighting looks pretty good. While this will not give you eyegasms or blind you by it\u2019s sheer beauty, what it does is complement the show a lot and while I have seen better things in this regard, it certainly is above average. The character designs are nothing out of the ordinary as they look quite typical for an Anime while using a little bit of moe but not making it overkill.\\n\r\n7.9\\n\\n\r\nSound: The show\u2019s Soundtrack was composed by Kosaki Satoru who also did the music for shows like the Monogatari Series, the Haruhi Shows and OreImo. The Soundtrack is for the most part really quite, using a lot of piano. This quite parts resembles the show\u2019s feel really well as it is for the most part not a happy go lucky show, but quite often asks about deep questions and shows that being transgender is not easy. The Opening is something that is a bit of a downside to the music, as it doesn\u2019t fit the show really well. While the music scores quite good, the visuals for this one are rather poor and have almost no animation. The ending theme on the other hand though, fits the show amazingly well and while the visuals are only a running style thing, this is almost unskippable as it fits so perfectly that I fell in love with the song only by watching this Anime.\\n\r\n8.5\\n\\n\r\nIn total, this Anime that may not please everyone, due to the topic presented, but if you plan on leaving this aside just due to the Crossdressing and Transsexualism portrayed in this Anime, than I beg you to think it over again. This Anime does not only portray those themes, but also shows the going through puberty that everyone goes through once in his life. You could say that this is not an Anime about Crossdressing and Transsexualism only, but rather an Anime about acceptance. Acceptance for those who aren\u2019t exactly \u201cnormal\u201d to the standards of today\u2019s society. Hourou Musuko portrays all this in a way that is simply beautiful, featuring one of the strongest character casts that I have seen so far and making people think about this topic. That is what makes this Anime as good as it is and that\u2019s why it really should not be missed!\\n\r\nAs I calculated all the Scores that I gave this Anime (Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal enjoyment), I got to a score of 8.44/10.\\n\r\nRight now this Anime has been licensed in America by Aniplex and is available to buy there. The Manga also has been brought over there by Fantagraphic Books. It is available for legal Streaming on Crunchyroll, if you happen to live in a country from which it is accessible.\\n\r\nWith that I hope I could help you and I\u2019ll see you next time!",

            "content": "The show starts out with the main character, Shuichi Nitori, moving to a new school with you not expecting anything. But if you read the summary for the show already, you know that he is a boy that wants to be a girl.\r\nThis show focuses on a topic that a lot of people are scared of because they're so unfamiliar with it. Just a few years ago, I started to question my sexuality and gender so I am part of the LGBTQ community and as someone part of the community, I think this anime does a great job at showing how it really is fora transsexual person.\\n\\n\r\nI may not have personal experience with this but I think it shows the struggles they go through and how society looks at them. Society doesn't exactly approve of anything that has to do with the LGBTQ community so they tend to say they hate it. But to me, this show meant a lot to me. I cried throughout the series because of how much trouble the main character went through. I've been through things similar to that and I understand how he feels. Although I am a girl, not a boy, I am able to just go out and wear pants which is easier for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was pretty interesting. I mean, how many animes out there have 2 transsexual characters in them? None, really except for Wandering Son. At least of what I know. But I thought that the fact they focused this show on the topic of transsexuality was a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nI can easily give this a 10 out of 10 because I can relate so much to it. I would also recommend this to anyone, so if you haven't watched it yet, I suggest you watch it now!",
