            "content": "I really love all of the crazy implausible story concepts anime is capable of delivering us.  K\u00e4mpfer is no exception, as it combines many time honored and tested themes of mahou shoujo-esque transformations, girls fighting each other, gender confusion, and lesbianism.  Mix in plenty of service and a clich\u00e9d harem of the usual personality types and you have an anime that basically been made a hundred times before.  And a lot better too.  Even though, I still found myself inexorability drawn to this title because of its fabulous seiyuu cast.\r\nThe premise for K\u00e4mpfer is a bit unique.  While it sharesmany of the same themes as shows like Ikkitousen and Sekirei, K\u00e4mpfer deviates by essentially making the male lead one of his own harem by forcing him to transform into a girl in order to participate in the battles.  The girls are divided into factions, red and blue, and must battle each other to the death (apparently) at the behest of a mysterious and sinister sounding faction known as the Moderators. From the start we seem to be set for a series chalk full of exciting action and ecchi gender bending comedy.  By mid series we have our completed harem all vying for the affections of our clueless nondescript leading man (more on him later).  Initially I found K\u00e4mpfer had a lot of potential for delivering some interesting action and some really entertaining comedy.  Unfortunately it doesn't take too long for things to start to unravel.  Mainly because the series makes the mistakes many others have made before, trying to be and do too many things instead of just keeping things simple.  It was also a bit creepy the matter-of-fact way the lead accepted his fate of becoming a girl and his constantly flip flopping back and forth between masculinity and femininity.  This element always tends to bother me a bit in gender bending stories and its rare that it actually really works.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that appeared to be about action and fighting there is a shocking lack of any real fighting in it.  Very little about why the girls are fighting is even explained adequately and the ending to the series is in a word: pathetic.  Additionally even the ecchi is inadequate with even the supposed \"uncensored\" version of the show lacking anything all that arousing.  The comedy which at times is pretty good is not good enough, enough of the time to really be very pleasing in that aspect either.  While normally I would scoff at the mention of any kind of serious romance or drama coming out of a harem anime, the series does try to deliver some of this as well.  Some of it works but the characters are so uninteresting and lifeless that the impact is really lost.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the mediocre nature of all of the shows elements it\u2019s unlikely to appeal to fans of any of these genres.  Those who like action or romance will not be satisfied and neither will fans of ecchi since all of the service is pretty tame and pedestrian by current standards.  Combining that with the terrible ending that fails to resolve neither the main plot or any of it's subplots and we have almost total across the board fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really bare the blunt of the blame for K\u00e4mpfer being so uninspired.  This is nowhere more evident than with our harems leading man, er woman, Natsuru.  Now this is nothing new to anyone who has watched any harems.  Typically it\u2019s the girls who always shine brightest in these sorts of shows with the guy being a typically plain and indecisive proxy for the fantasies of the intended, mostly male audience.  The only difference here is that the guy is in fact one of the girls too.  Though other than being hot and combined the stereotypical guy in a girls body humor there is absolutely nothing interesting about \"her\" either.  Maybe the most memorable thing about Natsuru though is he is without a doubt the most clueless and colossally stupid man in the history of the universe.  Really dude, buy a fucking clue!  I wanted to reach through the TV and slap him myself.  I actually almost felt sorry for those girls.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls they unfortunately don\u2019t fair much better.  They meet all the usual harem standards by combining a tomboyish childhood friend, moe oujosama, tsundere meganekko, and cool aloof student council president.  They are about as exciting as their descriptions too.  Perhaps the only exception is Akane, the bespectacled tsundere.  Though this may only have been because of my affinity for the character type and that she was voiced by Yue Horie then out of any real quality.  The supporting cast is equally as clich\u00e9d and unmemorable.  So much so that I doubt I could even remember any of their names without looking at the cast list first.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing to come out of the cast is clearly the talking stuffed \"Entrails Animals\" that serve as companions for each of the K\u00e4mpfer.  The fact that they were all voiced by very well known seiyuu was a big part of it but they were really the only characters who were actually funny.  You know a series is in a lot of trouble when the highlight of the show is the preview of the next episode and the summary before the episode starts (all coincidently voiced by these characters).  I felt that a huge opportunity was missed in not making these characters more involved in the episodes dialogue and comedy bits.  I felt there was a lot of untapped potential left behind.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically K\u00e4mpfer is solid but unspectacular.  The girls are cute and have nice figures and our leading man is at least somewhat manly in at least appearance.  I thought the breasts were pretty silly looking though, a bit too torpedoish looking.  Kind of a peeve of mine that if you\u2019re going to show me these girls tits all the time that they don\u2019t even look natural.  Even if they are usually obscured by the usual convenient steam and light beams.  The action scenes are also not that spectacular either, which is even more disappointing considering how few their actually are.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is the best and only real bright spot of the anime.  A real all star lineup of acting talent is on display but unfortunately they all had very little to work with.  The musical performances were fair.  I was a little disappointed at who they actually had perform the OP/ED songs considering the talent they had available.\\n\\n\r\nOverall there is nothing for me to recommend about this anime.  It fails as a action, harem, or even ecchi comedy.  While it does have its moments at times there is not enough of any one thing to really appeal to fans of any of these genres.  Stay clear, you can do a lot better than this one.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Kampfer. The Anime with big-breasted girls fighting for no reason. Here's what I think after completing Kampfer. I will not write spoilers so don't worry.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nStory? Hmm. Kampfer actually has no story. It's basically just a guy turning into a girl that goes to a school in which boys and girls are separated. Just throw a few random fights out there, and ta-dah, you get Kampfer. They basically don't know why they're fighting until the very end, in which came out as a sci-fi thing.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI loved the art of Kampfer. It was outstanding. The details are very well drawn and animated, and ofcourse,the breasts. Perfect 32 dds are perfect. It looked clean, and the fight scenes were also good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nDidn't really stand out that much, but it was still good. You get your typical sound in Kampfer. Nothing really stood out in this one, althought the OP song was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nTypical harem show. Everyone likes the main protagonist. You also get different types of characters, like tsundere, moe, etc, in this show, which is typical. Although you will notice right away who the enemy is going to be, the characters were all good. I mean, a guy turning into a girl? Good, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nSure, there were few good episodes in Kampfer, but some were bad, and some were so-so. I did enjoy watching it. Had some good laughs in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthought it was kind of predictable, cliche, and the ending was a turn off, it was still good. If you like Harem, Ecchi, with a little bit of action, then Kampfer is for you!",

            "content": "\u201cThat was pretty stupid.\u201d \u2013 Sangou Shizuku\r\nGender bending not your cup of tea? Harem is too redundant in the anime industry lately? Well then perhaps having one more of such show might not hurt too much. As the saying goes \u201cthere\u2019s always an exception to everything\u201d, and Kampfer might just be that one exception for you! Blessed with nice animation and huge plot twists (for better or for worse), Kampfer sure surprised many viewers towards the end of the show...in a negative way. \r\nLet us start with something that is very lacking in Kampfer, the plot. Excluding the plot twists that contributed to some muchneeded \u201cexcitements\u201d, the story was pretty non-existent. Viewers first find themselves thrown into the mist of a pre-planned battle between the red Kampfers and blue Kampfers, staged by some mysterious force only known as the \u201cmoderators\u201d. Part way through the anime, any hint of potential story will be replaced by random fan service. Not only was the ending poorly made, but the lack of conclusion also made Kampfer not very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial emphasis should be placed on Shizuku, the student council president and the only character with a brain in the group of Kampfers. She almost single-handedly saved the character category from total destruction in my eyes. In fact, recently there have been comparisons made between Shizuku and Hitagi Senjougahara (a very well liked character among otaku) from Bakemonogatari due to their tsundere nature. Another note worthy character is Akane. She can be seen as a masochist, but due to her transformation as a Kampfer, one can also argue that she somewhat a tsundere character as well. These two characters showed the most growth and seem to be the most developed out of all the main characters. In fact, they are like two bright candles lit in a dark room.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are some likable characters, the overall characters development/growth for the majority of the casts is very minimal. They start and end the show practically the same way. It seems like they did not learn a single thing during their little \u201cadventure\u201d. What hurts the anime most is perhaps the lack of uniqueness from our gender flopping protagonist. He/she does have the looks, but at the end of show the one that will likely have the most impact on you will not be him/her.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I am giving a little too much credit to Nomad, the studio that produced Kampfer, but the designs on the characters (ie. their looks, their facial expressions, their Kampfer transformation, et cetera) were quite nicely animated. The animation quality also seems to be rather consistent (which is always a plus). They could have obviously improved on the details of the characters and the backgrounds, but for an ecchi/harem type show I strongly believe having your \u201cmerchandise\u201d (ie. girl) looks good is way more crucial than anything else. And in that respect, Nomad was profoundly efficient.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department in Kampfer is average in many ways. The OP may require some time to get accustom to, but the ED will surely get you hooked. However the BGM within the episodes were nothing outstanding. They may suite certain scene or event relatively well most of the time, but they never gave me the feeling that they are amplifying the scene through my ears. Sometimes BGM can make you feel all hyped up or ready to cry a river, but the music in Kampfer did not deliver to that level.\\n\\n\r\nKampfer fails as a romance anime. Kampfer fails as an action anime. Kampfer, however, delivers ecchiness and harem in a moderate level. Nothing too extreme and nothing too exciting. Its selling points are without a doubt the good and consistent animation quality, and interesting characters like Shizuku and Akane. Overall depending on what you are seeking for enjoyment, Kampfer can be a great source of entertainment or a total waste of time. Personally I liked Shizuku so much that I can ignore all the glaring faults from the show, but that is just my preference. By the way, did anyone tell you Kampfer is a show for Christmas with a story about Santa Claus?\\n\\n\r\n*edit* 2nd Revision",

            "content": "Kampfer is an anime series I randomly picked while I was a bit bored and it wasn\u2019t half bad. If you like perverted anime series this one might be pretty suitable for you. What I thought it was kind of unique and somewhat interesting was the gender switch that happens to a rather unlucky, ordinary student, as he tries to find out the meaning behind the changes.\r\nApparently, the reason of the sudden transformation was the existence of the female warriors called Kampfer, as the protagonist  was chosen to become one. Although their existence is not really explained, one thing is certain, that these mysteriouswarriors need to fight against each other for absolutely no reason (actually, in the anime it is stated something like : \u201cYou are born to fight!\u201d, although apparently no kampfer knows the meaning behind these conflicts).\\n\\n\r\nSo, after an amazing start in the first episode, with intense action and pretty promising story, I actually thought that this show had the potential to be an amazing experience, though in the end it hadn\u2019t met my expectations. The show flows at a normal pace, although it has very few intense moments,  as it tends to step closer in the slice of life kind of genre following the main character\u2019s life and his interactions with the other kampfer out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could be promising, but the writers preferred not to concentrate their attention into developing the plot, instead, they decided to mess with new ideas to show in every episode, as the events that happen in the episodes are hardly related to each other. Every episode is some kind of filler, containing ridiculous embarrassing situations that the characters are put in without affecting the plot, though some of them were pretty comical at times. I found the main concept of the gender changing to be a rather good idea, although all the meaningless fights among the kampfer as they seem to be controlled by this entity called \u201cthe Moderators\u201d are pretty stupid and ridiculous. Also, there is no apparent villain or evil mind. One thing that just annoyed me was the absolutely lame and unoriginal ending, that probably dropped this show\u2019s score by half, but that may be just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there isn\u2019t much to talk about the plot, the characters are the ones that keep the show alive (mostly). They are indeed unoriginal or just plain, as you can hardly even remember their names, but overall they are not that bad. The main character is pretty dumb, and has absolutely no personality at all, the only thing that you can notice is his obsessive love for one of the female characters and the difficulty in understanding people\u2019s feelings. As his male self, he isn\u2019t really noticeable, but his female self is the one that is in the center of attention almost all the time. Some comical situations may occur, especially when the other students abuse her good looking body. The cast is not that amazing, but you have your creepy set of characters such as a lesbian (unfortunately there is such a thing), a fool-mouthed red haired chick that threatens everyone with her handgun, a rather smart \u201cPrez\u201d that likes teasing the main character, a shy and innocent girl that seems to be in love with the protagonist and so forth. Overall, the characters are not that bad, although they are poorly developed, as I actually had a hard time finding myself a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average, the characters look decent, but occasionally there can be found some animation errors, such as a completely mistaken reflection in a mirror, although they are rather hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is fair, it is nothing amazing, it is just right, as well as the voice acting which mostly suited the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many flaws in character and plot development, I found this show quite enjoyable, maybe because I somewhat liked the concept ..I\u2019m not very sure myself.\\n\\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you like ecchi style of anime with nice looking characters (mostly female with huge boobs) with a slice of life touch to it, almost inexistent story, average art, poor character development, you might give Kampfer a try, although don\u2019t watch it if you have high expectations as you will probably be disappointed. Overall it\u2019s a good time killer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review on MAL, I hope you find it helpful. Although I\u2019ve been really careful while writing this review, I apologize for  any potential grammar errors. Stay safe!\\n",

The \"story\" revolves around Natsuru Seno, a normal boy who wakes up one morning as a girl. We learn through his stuffed tiger that talks (and also has it's stuffed guts hanging out of his stomach) that this change was because he was chosen to be a \"Kampfer,\" a female fighter, and he continues going back and forth between girl and guy to participate in fights with other Kampfer. Why? We are never told. They never give a real reason forthis. Anyway, it's filled with yuri and awkward moments as the protagonist tries to get his dream girl to fall in love with his male side as more and more girls fall for the female him. The stories tend to fall flat on their face and I ended up shrugging it off as another weird Japan fanservice show. If you like that then by all means watch away. If you actually want a real story, watch something like Blue Exorcist and stay away from this.",

            "content": "After Watching the 11 first episodes.\r\nIn short, this series is basicly BUILT on service. In each episode it\u00b4s owerflowing. Wich in this case actualy is a good thing. Believe it or not.\r\nSenou Natsuru is a normal boy, he goes to school, has friends (kinda). And has a fairly normal life. Untill the fated day. The day he becomes a K\u00e4mpfer, his life is turned as upside down as it\u00b4s possible to get it. As K\u00e4mpfer, his appearance is changed a lot, he\u00b4s completely turned into a female beuty and is forced to fight against other K\u00e4mpfers, but for what reason is he fighting?\r\nThe story inthe series is almost non-existent. As this series focus greatly on fanservice. The whole plot of the \"K\u00e4mpfers\" seems as it is created only to have a reason to turn Natsuru into a hot gal. And with twelve episodes, the story doesn\u00b4t get much time to expand. Wich is sad, because it realy had potential. But to put that thing aside, the story isn\u00b4t realy THAT important in this series. K\u00e4mpfer is mainly about enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is verry stylish. Iv\u00b4e kinda seen it before, but i like it. The girls are cute, basicly because it\u00b4s almost just girls in the entire series, and it is therefore a huge lack of boys. Natsuru and his friend, and some random guys is about the only males in the series. And i feel that Natsuru is the only boy that the character designers put their hearth and soul into creating.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is of a pretty good quality. Basicly it\u00b4s mostly moaning that is the sound you\u00b4ll hear the most, but aside from that, the sound is pretty good. The soundtrack also got to me, and i liked some of the songs wery good. The OP and ED is pretty standard, it\u00b4s catchy but it\u00b4s not the types of songs that\u00b4ll stick to your brains for pretty long.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in K\u00e4mpfer is in short terms verry variated. Some of them you like the moment you see them, and the others you\u00b4ll detest as soon as you see them. The main characters is well done, but as we don\u00b4t get to know them that well during the eleven episodes it gets pretty frustrating at the end when you realice that, that\u00b4s it. The main protoganist of the series, Senou Natsuru is probably the one character that you\u00b4ll like the most, as he is damn hot in his girl form, and classicly clumsy in he\u00b4s a boy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI realy enjoyed watching this series, with good animations, catchy soundtrack and hot girls, what is there not to like? Well there is something, but it\u00b4s realy just small stuff. Overall this series is absolute worth watching, if you like fanservice that is. And if you watch it, you\u00b4ll probably watch it one or more times just to see the funny scenes one more time. Because the scenes that are funny, realy are hillarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

The end itself was totally open and with a really stupid Great Revelation, and nothing is really resolved, and the reaction of the really really baka main protagonist was simply ... stupid. \r\nSay, how much stupid it can get: The villain is using the main male character, doesnot like men and tried to make him kill his friends by controlling his actions, disregarding his will and seeing him as a tool, actually using his feelings towards her to her own wishes...and after the \"hero\" discovers it he does what?

            "content": "Kampfer, Kampfer, Kampfer.\r\nA somewhat difficult anime to review.\r\nDespite its shortcomings as an obviously stereotypical ecchi love-comedy jam-packed with your staple assortment of embarrassing, should-be-censored scenes, Kampfer surprisingly hit me with something I wasn't expecting: A cast of characters that are somewhat unique, but most of all, lovable in some way, and a very over-the-top sense of humor.\r\nIf you have seen a lot of different love comedies, you will still most likely enjoy this anime, but personally having seen a variety of these types of shows, the humor in Kampfer sometimes literally made me laugh out loud, which is something I do not do so oftenwhen watching anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that although I found Kampfer immensely entertaining, its plot hardly differs from that of your average harem: NONEXISTANT. As I was not looking for or expecting a plot in particular, I found no incredible lacks in this department. While there is fanservice, increasingly so over the series, the beginning actually does not have too much, which I found to be refreshing and made the humor the focus as the story wound up.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to conclude that although Kampfer is indeed shallow and without a plot, the fact that it offers a humor that makes fun of other ecchi love comedies (maybe not intentionally) is a great added bonus. Also, the harem \"mob\" of girls is not so mindless that they follow the man for no reason. They each have their own reasons for liking him, and while it may seem shallow at first, some character's love seems to go deeper than your average ecchi love-comedy, which is also nice, seeing as I didn't expect that either :D\\n\\n\r\nIt seems I am getting to the conclusion first... Let's jump into the categories, shall we?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA boy named Senou Natsuru one day becomes a Kampfer, which is essentially a battle girl. Everyone must transform to go into their \"Kampfer mode\" but because Natsuru is a male, he must switch genders when he transforms into his Kampfer form. This creates all sorts of nonsense, as you can imagine. More and more Kampfer show up, and I will be sure to not spoil the rest of this \"intricate\" plotline.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the story line is not one of Kampfer's strong assets. If you do end up watching this show, keep very low expectations as far as the story goes. You may end up enjoying the show as much as I did.\\n\r\nBy the way, I choose to ignore the ending fight. It really is one of the strangest \"wtf\" moments I've seen in an anime. You won't like it, I can almost guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one thing that I think particularly shines about Kampfer. If you know me, I am very picky on eye styles. Once I saw them, I couldn't get my eyes off them (har dee har har).\\n\r\nAll lame jokes aside, I really do love the way everything is animated in this show. The main characters are very well done and never look like they were lazily drawn. There is one exception to this: At times, character's eyes or fingers might look incredibly lopsided or crooked. While this is a shame and looks fairly weird, I found it somewhat rare and passable under the rest of the art, which I very much liked.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly memorable in this department. The OP and ED were OK, just your standard ecchi love comedy themes. Music during the anime flowed well, but again, was not as memorable as something like that from Clannad. That is a very high standard of comparison, but I did not find Kampfers music bad either. The songs fit the emotions, and did not stick out awkwardly in any place I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Kampfer elevates itself over other ecchi love-comedies. Most animes with obvious levels of sexual bombardment ignore the character development part of the roadmap. Kampfer manages to delve into the characters more than most ecchi love-comedies, and I found this to be a great change. While it is not much more, it is noticable when compared to other ecchi anime. Please note that the 9/10 rating is in comparison to other character development in the same genre.\\n\r\nAaand what I just said was partially a lie. The characters are also very lovable. There's a character for everyone to love, and the art combined with the character's personalities makes for a charming anime in this respect.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I shamelessly enjoyed every second of this anime. The ecchi, the characters, the corny not-so-well-thought-out battle scenes, the awkwardness with the \"bishoujo\" element of this anime, the over-the-top humor... It was all great. And I don't regret a single second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this anime will just differ completely depending on who looks at it. With virtually no story, this anime is fairly flat and predictable in its dimensions. If you aren't looking for a good story and just something you can veg out to, this is a great watch. I suggest watching the first 2 episodes, and if you don't like it by then, quit. If you're interested in the genre though, I highly suggest you give it a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nToday I review Kampfer, perhaps the least original anime ever made! It fails as a romance, it fails as action, it fails as a comedy. Kampfer is entirely comprised of fail! Instead of \"Kampfer\", which is German for \"fighter\" , the series should have been called Schei\u00dfe !\r\nRemember how in Ranma 1/2 there was a subplot where a boy would turn into a girl and it would create awkward moments of sexual tension and comedy? That was pretty funny in the early 1990s and it felt new at the time. However, like all Rumiko Takahashi series it ran a LONG time and the premise nowfeels worn out and tired. Kampfer takes this tired joke and absolutely beats the shit out of a dead horse! You can't have a fucking comedy series based on a 1 joke premise that isn't even fresh! Why do you think the Geico Cavemen TV show was cancelled in 1 season?\\n\\n\r\nTo give Kamper some credit, it doesn't JUST do a horrible job ripping off the humor of Ranma 1/2 and other slapstick harem anime of the 1990s like Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo. Kampfer also decided to be the 8 billionth anime to feature a battle royale tournament in which contestants are forced by some mysterious greater power to battle each other until 1 is left. Each \"kampfer\" is a girl with magical abilities and each has her own doll. Sort of like Rozen Maiden, the much better show about magic dolls that must battle each other to claim the ultimate prize. This type of anime tends to be really popular, so I suppose you can't blame the Kampfer creator for trying to cash in. Anime like Future Diary, Btooom!, and Fate Stay Night are some of the highest rated and most popular anime on MAL. The first huge problem with Kampfer is that it brings NOTHING new to the audience. It simply uses and abuses popular cliches in order to make a quick buck off Otaku that the Kampfer creator clearly thinks are idiots. The second problem is that it it isn't even an entertaining ripoff or mockbuster! The Asylum movies are better than Kampfer! Probably the most creative thing kampfer did was the obnoxious series of grotesque dolls called the entrails animals. Although, even those just seem like a cheap ripoff of the Garbage Pail Kids from the 1980s!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but nothing great. Kampfer isn't one of those anime that is entertainingly bad due to technical issues like laughably bad animation, a terrible dub, or a horrendous soundtrack. Kampfer is the worst kind of bad. Uninspired and BORING! If Kampfer was entertainingly bad like Angel Cop or Mad Bull 34 it would at least have SOME reason for people to watch it.",

WTF? Sorry, but no amount of overly-sexualized high school anime girls will make your series \"good\". And how many times did we have to see Natsuru writhe in agony as a hot girl tried to seduce him? Awww, poor guy! o.O\r\nIf the girls had not been so obviously in love with Natsuru(they were actually physically fighting over him while he stood there confused!), and if the White Kampfers had shown up earlier (and been an actual threat) then this series might have been good. As it was, they had to make Natsuru an idiot so that it didn't turn into outright Hentai. Not a reasonable character choice! And the sudden \"it was aliens\" ending was pretty bad, too.\\n\\n\r\nNice art. Nice premise. Horrible plot. Dumb, dumb main character. I only finished it because it was short.",

            "content": "Kampfer... A series that everybody could've expected to be generic and full of fanservice right from the poster art. And it is exactly that. A show full of nothing but flaming lesbians attempting to battle it out against each other and greater beings called Moderators. Did they actually beat these said Moderators? No. Absolutely not. Barely anything happened, if anything actually did happen.\r\nStory [5]: The story stars Senou Natsuru, your typical loser of a main character who is in love with a girl named Sakura Kaede. One day, Natsuru receives a stuffed doll and magically transforms into a girl. Natsuru then runs into the othercharacters of the show and what actually ensues? Fanservice... some more fanservice... some lesbian antics. That's pretty much all that really happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe series promises some kind of plot where Sangou Shizuku, another Kampfer, claims they will fight the Moderators and get to the bottom of this ridiculous Red vs Blue war. Does that actually happen? Not really. The pacing is ridiculously horrible. Most of the episodes just has all these different girls fighting over Natsuru. Only towards the end do we get some minor plot movement... some very minor plot movement. So minor, that the series closes without any real questions answered. Even if it is adapted from an on-going manga, you'd think they'll at least put in some filler ending for closure unless they plan on dealing out a second season, which will probably end just as badly as this.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8]: The only thing this show has going for it is the animation. Adapted from the manga, the character designs are nice to look at but nothing too spectacular. There are plenty of shredded clothing, plenty of bare chests, and plenty of fog covering those bare chests. The show does certainly pull out a few risque moves with all the full frontal censored nudity and groping that goes on throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7]: The characters are all voiced by top class seiyuus ranging from Inoue Marina voicing both Natsurus to Horie Yui voicing two completely different and distinct personalities. The soundtrack however, is nothing to rave about. Chippy happy music runs through most of the show. Nothing too serious or dramatic in its pieces.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [6]: Natsuru is dumb. Plain and simple. He is as dense as main characters can be. His head? Hard as a rock. He's busy being infatuated with one girl while completely oblivious to the fact that he has three other girls fawning over him. Mikoto is the generic childhood friend, and Akane is some generic bookworm girl who turns into a mildly hilarious violent psycho gun wielding redhead. Then we have the annoyingly selfish flaming lesbian Kaede. All she does is fawn over female Natsuru constantly and bitches at whoever inches too close to her. The only character really worth mentioning is Shizuku. Not only is she awesomely manipulative, she is one of the few girls in any anime to be bold enough to make moves on the man. Her antics make this show slightly bearable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the character development going on this show is pretty much non-existant. Everybody sticks to their archetypes and barely nudges. There's like only one character in whole that develops a bit, but saying anything more would be spoilering. Natsuru is too dense to think of anything by himself, Kaede is too busy being a complete lesbian over female Natsuru, Akane is too busy giggling or shooting stuff, Mikoto is pretty much non-existant, and Shizuku, as awesome as her devious plans are, develops the generic harem love for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall [6/5]: Shizuku pretty much makes the show watchable. Other than that, it's just a complete waste of time to watch the girls constantly bicker over each other like little girls over their favorite Barbie doll. The show's pacing is so terrible that the actual plot ends prematurely and the last episode ends up being a completely useless filler episode about body switching. Even if they ended it on an open note so they can continue onto a second season, that will probably fail just as much as the first season.",

            "content": "Oh Lord, where should I begin. K\u00e4mpfer is probably the strangest anime I've watched this summer. Let's just say this isn't your average harem, unless you even consider this a harem at all. Boy wakes up one day to find he's transformed into a girl, stuffed lion with intestines falling out tells him that he's a K\u00e4mpfer and has powers now, that's only the beginning of the weirdness. He somehow get's transferred into the girls only part of the school, and to make it better, I'm pretty convinced everyone in that school might be a lesbian. Why, you ask? They're all trying to \"get toknow her\". And when I say that, watch episode 3 and you'll catch my drift. On top of that, she gets attacked constantly by other K\u00e4mpfers, so that pretty much ties it all up.\\n\\n\r\nStory... what can I say, there isn't really a story at all. I mean, it all revolves around the fact that he can transform into a girl. I think the last 3 episodes are when the slightest bit of a story even occurs.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork... Like most animes I guess, now a days, the newer animes all seem to look the same to me. For those of you who watch a bunch of that kind of animes, you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSound was probably the best thing in the show. I liked the voice actors and actresses in the show, liked them from previous shows before this one, and they are kind of what made me continue watching the show. If they hadn't gotten good actors, I might have stopped watching halfway through. MIGHT have, depends on who the other voice actors would have been.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are somewhat unique in their own way. I mean, the main character is the only person I know who can transform into a girl and back to a boy. Him and the chick from Ranma 1/2. Other characters were all fairly similar to those I've seen in other animes, and the fricking intestine animals were just too annoying. I literally wanted to punch my TV whenever they opened their mouths.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of it, there were some parts where I was like \"OK what did I just watch?\" (again, referring to episode 3), but it was an interesting show overall. I know a lot of people who gave this like 9's and 10's, and there are plenty of people at my school who loved it, but this is all my opinion. If you don't like my opinion, go with others. Hopefully this review helped some of you.",

            "content": "* this review is in my perspective, things may seem better/worse in others opinions. *\r\nK\u00e4mpfer is a anime thats really based on echhi, And i recomend to not watch it if you dislike echhi. Eventough the rest seems good to you, like super powers and action. This anime is based on a percentage system what it will show.\r\n50% echhi and romance\r\n25% superpower and action\r\n25% comedy.\r\nMake sure the look at these numbers because thats what you will get watching this anime.\r\nrecap (what's the story about,) -SPOILER FREE-\r\nNatsuru is a normal student at a school thats split up in two sides, boys side and girls side. Whenhe wakes up the next morning he has a bracelet thats blue, and he is a girl. A stuffed tiger wich support him with being a k\u00e4mpfer tells him that he became a girl because all k\u00e4mfers are girl,  and he has to slay the red side because he is blue side. He finds out that there are 3 tipes of k\u00e4mpfers. Shooters, mages, fighters. He is the mage. he randomly transforms to a girl and has to survive against the other k\u00e4mfers.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much all i can say without spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is bad because there is no story, everything will be explained it later episodes so it's kinda hard to say if there even is a story. What seems like the story is kinda shitty, lack of explaination and its not really exciting. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is not really bad but it could be way better. the background are worked out badly and moving is kinda the same move its not really anything special happends. But altough is decent and it's not a thing to be hated.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is kinda the same story as the art. Things that are not directly linked to the thing thats happening falls of or is faded away. Eventough things like songs troughout voices and things that are directly attached to the things that are happening are good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are made shitty. Only the main characters are fine with design and voice. But the main characters are worked out so well its kinda lifting up the bad character work on the side characters that are bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is where i look at first when watching an anime, is it fun to watch or not.\\n\r\nBecause the main reason you watch anime is for fun. i think this anime was extremly nice in terms of enjoyment. I liked it a lot and give it a nice mark. But this is for everyone really personal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\ni would say that K\u00e4mpfer is a great echhi anime, in terms of action i would say it is not what makes this anime good. Eventough the story and art/sound isn't that great i think that the fun you'll have is more of value then anything else. That's why this anime deserves a:\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n* this review is in my perspective, things may seem better/worse in others opinions.*",

Now said, it is not for everyone.\r\nFor me, interesting and different Gender bend is fun. And if it can raise REALLY goodquestion, it has some merit to it - question being \"Is lesbian lesbian if other of the lesbian pair is not in fact a lesbian girl but straight man?\" - Yeah, I am still thinking of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not looking at anime with serious face on, want some random laughs and something quite different in similar pack, There is love, there is girl in man, fould mouthed aggressive tsundere inside shy adorable small girl, There is friend inside enemy (friendenmy?) - There is straight love in Yuri love, and small disturbing talking stuffed animal dolls with guts spilled.\\n\\n\r\nHow can you NOT find it somewhat wrapped, warped, and somehow forcing you to see what is going to happen next?",

            "content": "This part is what people usually read expecting you to tell watch it or not worth it but that's impossible. People have different tastes. Kampfer is full of fan service. If you want an anime where you get to see cute, big breasted girls fight for no particular reason then go ahead and watch kampfer. If you want to see a harem where everybody likes the boy and seduce him 24/7 then go ahead. If you are looking for an anime with a good plot, good action and good romance, please reconsider if you decide to watch it.\r\nStory:\r\nThere is absolutely nothing to it. If Icould change the title I would name it \"The Life Of Natsuru Senou\". At first you could tolerate it. Tolerate seeing girls fight with each other for no particular reason but then a few episodes through and you are wondering, \"What the hell?\".  It makes no sense at all! Though there are some clues that tell you that there is something a lot more deep to the girls fighting each other but then there is nothing.\\n\r\nBacking up my previous statement on changing the title to \"The Life Of Natsuru Senou\". There isn't decent romance in it but most of the time when the girls are not fighting they are seducing Natsuru. That's where it was enjoyable. Seeing big breasted girls fighting over a boy. XD!\\n\r\nSo we have established that the plot is only about a boy getting seduce by cute girls(Oh! He can change into a girl for some reason they never cared to mention) but there is actually no romance and there is mindless fighting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is one good point in this anime. The quality is fantastic and the art is outstanding. It's enjoyable to watch. I didn't really look out for animation but I just know that the characters are well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is fair. it is not corny but not particularly excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nMaybe they had too many characters but you never really saw them to the fullest. The main character was like an insignificant toy(then again there would be cute girls without him). You didn't see much of the other characters either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFinally, it was very enjoyable. There were laughs. The art was good. Just another typical harem that hardly makes sense.",

            "content": "Kampfer, well......\r\nJust when i start to type my comment on this anime, i still thinking like: what does Kampfer really attach to me? The gender-swapping? The seiyuu? maybe the odd but interesting story element in it? And ya, i have a good sense of why it might attach to the other guys mostly: Service.Service.Service.Service.Service.Service.Service. (just follow the Service tone form Hayate 2nd Season episode 0 OVA).\r\nEven i don't know why, but i just give what i think of it so far. (It will be update when is over)\r\nKampfer from what i say did have to do service. But here is the basis:\r\nIn one morning, SenouNatsuru (a guy) discover that he has become a she by some cute but has it stomach cut out talking tiger doll and told her (him) that she (he) is a Kampfer, a magical girl who has to fight on something. It still haven't reveal what it is but maybe later. As soon she finally revert back to him, he was throw into a sudden battle/meeting Mishima Akane, his later allies; but end up his childhood friend he like, Sakura Kaede, is in love in his female self.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the episode i see so far where i like to call 'random service' plot. The anime or the director doesn't take the plot seriously, just give us random stuff; but only have a small portion of Kampfer plot. Nothing new or anything big to scope out the real thing. Oh ya, speaking the real thing; you get to see Natsuru getting her (him) self to be like some kind of service tool on the series and to other character.\\n\\n\r\nAll the character here i would say useless. Natsuru is a guys and he (she) is helpless with a bunch of girls around him, and they happen (smartly) to use him (her) popular to earn $$$. Akane suppose to help him but couldn't help herself and might be like him (her). And Kaicho-san (Sangou Shizuku), enough flirting with Natsuru or other and start tell us what going on and what you know.\\n\\n\r\nFor what i have write and think of the episode i watch so far, this is more like a yuri anime! X_X\\n\\n\r\nSure, the animation is well done, and the color in the anime is bright color. This was one of the place Kampfer have won.\\n\\n\r\nThe other were the seiyuu. Inoue Marina, Horie Yui, Nakajima Megumi, Noto Mamiko, Mizuki Nana, Tamura Yukari and to name a few. All top notch seiyuu doing kawaii voices on 'kawaii' anime, with service. Another won by Kampfer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the funny thing is that they even throw themselve in it, mostly by name but Tamura Yukari-san happen to throw her image in it on episode 1, in anime style. Again, they won.\\n\\n\r\n(The other seiyuu that also throw her image in it from what i heard are a seiyuu voice Shizuka on Doraemon, don't who that is but she is old and voice the tiger in this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP of the anime just doesn't not suit my taste, but ED does suit my taste with the closing done by none the other Inoue Marina and Nakajima Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nWell that how it is so far, even there is still a lot of bad point on it, but it just keeps me watching! (Maybe i am the type of guy who want to finish to the end) I write a full review on this anime when is over, and hopefully they will able to live up everyone (not everyone) expectation. \\n",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n(At Nomad Studios)\r\nDirector [sighing]: Creativity is dying in the anime industry.  Specifically, in the harem genre, we already have harems that involve twins, monster girls, cans transforming into girls, girls from outer space, girls with magical powers, etc. The list goes on. Is there anything we haven\u2019t done?\r\nProducer: H\u2019m\u2026oh, I believe there\u2019s one light novel that we haven\u2019t adapted. And it\u2019s unique.\r\nDirector [looks at producer]: Well, what is it? What\u2019s the title?\r\nProducer [pulling the light novel from his bag]: It\u2019s titled, \u201cKampfer.\"\r\nDirector [confused]: Kampfer? Why is the title in German?\r\nProducer [shrugging his shoulders]: I don\u2019t know. But, I know the authorused many German words. Maybe, he was a fan of the German language? Or its culture? But, who cares.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Okay, so what\u2019s it about?\\n\\n\r\nProducer [reading the back cover of the light novel]: It\u2019s about a boy named Natsuru Senou, who wakes up one day, and discovers that he\u2019s a girl. A stuffed tiger, in his room, comes to life and informs him that he\u2019s become a Kampfer, a female fighter. Moreover, all Kampfers must fight other Kampfers, and so begins the story of Natsuru as a female fighter.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Wait. Is it similar to TSF Monogatari? I mean, does the protagonist like both girls and guys?\\n\\n\r\nProducer [shocked]: Definitely not! Natsuru only likes girls, both in his male and female forms.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: I see. No\u2026wait a minute. If Natsuru is in his female form, and Natsuru only likes females, regardless of his gender, doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s a lesbian?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Well\u2026technically that\u2019s correct. But, I\u2019m pretty sure, the male viewers would not mind, girl on girl action. Even if, one of the girls is technically a guy.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [nodding]: Okay. So, about the girls, do they like Natsuru in both his male and female forms? And if so, wouldn\u2019t that make them bisexual?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Unfortunately, none of the main and side girls are bisexual. Although, all of the girls, including the boys, love Natsuru\u2019s female form to the point of being called a \u201cSchool Beauty.\u201d There\u2019s one main girl, I believe her name is Kaede Sakura, who is a lesbian and falls in love with Natsuru\u2019s female form. Now, the other main girls (i.e. childhood friend, student council president, and glasses girl) fall in love with Natsuru in his male form. Quite typical, really.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shaking his head]: Damn it! That would have been awesome and unique. A lesbian main character hooking up with a bunch bisexual girls, I wouldn\u2019t even complain! [Sighing.] Oh, well\u2026let me read the first couple of light novels and I\u2019ll tell you how I feel.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Sure. [He hands the Director the first four novels for Kampfer.]\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Thanks. I\u2019ll read them, thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\n[One week later]\\n\\n\r\nProducer: So, how was it?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: It was good\u2026at first. There were many action scenes, and they were cool. I mean, red kampfers vs. blue kampfers. Guns, swords, and magic. And tons of explosions. [Sighing.] But, then it turned into a romantic comedy filled with typical events, such as the cultural festival, pools, maid cafe, beauty contest, and summer festival. Besides, those events, what\u2019s up with the protagonist and suggestive clothing, he has worn: school swimsuits, bunny suit, nurse, bloomers, maid, and a naked apron. Doesn\u2019t he care about his current appearances?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: I\u2019m sure, our protagonist does care about his appearance, but the girls and mostly the situations he\u2019s in, force him to dress in women\u2019s clothing.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Well, I understand his situation, but it just seems all forced, like it was mainly for fanservice. And speaking of fanservice\u2026there\u2019s a lot of ripped clothes, nudity, suggestive collisions, and boob and ass moments.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Pandering to the readers, and, of course, to our future viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shrugging]: Well, fanservice is fanservice, although there is one thing that irks me. \\n\\n\r\nProducer: And, what is that?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Why are the red and blue kampfers fighting each other? I understand many characters throughout the story ask the messengers this question, but they always dodge or ignore it entirely. But, it isn\u2019t just that question, but also, \"who makes them fight\", and \"why did Natsuru and the girls get their abilities.\" This makes each fight seem random and pointless.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: I understand your frustration, and I\u2019m sure the author will answer those questions. \\n\\n\r\nDirector: Speaking of questions\u2026how many light novels in this series has the author written?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: The author has written nine light novel for this series, and is preparing for more in the future.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shaking his head]: That\u2019s not good. If what you said is correct, then there isn\u2019t a conclusive ending, which means\u2026\\n\\n\r\nProducer: That Natsuru hasn\u2019t chosen a girl, yet. Shit! What are we going to do? What type of ending should we go for?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: We could go with, \u201cThe Story Continues\u201d, or \u201cNo Romantic Resolution\u201d or \u201cHarem Ending\u201d, but all these endings will piss off some portion of the audience. [Thinking. Suddenly, he snaps his fingers.] I got it! Since, this series is getting 12 episodes max, and the final episode ends one week before Christmas. Let\u2019s make a Christmas Episode.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Brilliant Idea! But, let\u2019s not produce your typical Christmas Episode, but one with a twist.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: H\u2019m\u2026I like it. Let\u2019s go with it.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Okay. I\u2019ll begin production, right away.\\n\\n\r\nThe End",

            "content": "I really love all of the crazy implausible story concepts anime is capable of delivering us.  K\u00e4mpfer is no exception, as it combines many time honored and tested themes of mahou shoujo-esque transformations, girls fighting each other, gender confusion, and lesbianism.  Mix in plenty of service and a clich\u00e9d harem of the usual personality types and you have an anime that basically been made a hundred times before.  And a lot better too.  Even though, I still found myself inexorability drawn to this title because of its fabulous seiyuu cast.\r\nThe premise for K\u00e4mpfer is a bit unique.  While it sharesmany of the same themes as shows like Ikkitousen and Sekirei, K\u00e4mpfer deviates by essentially making the male lead one of his own harem by forcing him to transform into a girl in order to participate in the battles.  The girls are divided into factions, red and blue, and must battle each other to the death (apparently) at the behest of a mysterious and sinister sounding faction known as the Moderators. From the start we seem to be set for a series chalk full of exciting action and ecchi gender bending comedy.  By mid series we have our completed harem all vying for the affections of our clueless nondescript leading man (more on him later).  Initially I found K\u00e4mpfer had a lot of potential for delivering some interesting action and some really entertaining comedy.  Unfortunately it doesn't take too long for things to start to unravel.  Mainly because the series makes the mistakes many others have made before, trying to be and do too many things instead of just keeping things simple.  It was also a bit creepy the matter-of-fact way the lead accepted his fate of becoming a girl and his constantly flip flopping back and forth between masculinity and femininity.  This element always tends to bother me a bit in gender bending stories and its rare that it actually really works.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that appeared to be about action and fighting there is a shocking lack of any real fighting in it.  Very little about why the girls are fighting is even explained adequately and the ending to the series is in a word: pathetic.  Additionally even the ecchi is inadequate with even the supposed \"uncensored\" version of the show lacking anything all that arousing.  The comedy which at times is pretty good is not good enough, enough of the time to really be very pleasing in that aspect either.  While normally I would scoff at the mention of any kind of serious romance or drama coming out of a harem anime, the series does try to deliver some of this as well.  Some of it works but the characters are so uninteresting and lifeless that the impact is really lost.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the mediocre nature of all of the shows elements it\u2019s unlikely to appeal to fans of any of these genres.  Those who like action or romance will not be satisfied and neither will fans of ecchi since all of the service is pretty tame and pedestrian by current standards.  Combining that with the terrible ending that fails to resolve neither the main plot or any of it's subplots and we have almost total across the board fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really bare the blunt of the blame for K\u00e4mpfer being so uninspired.  This is nowhere more evident than with our harems leading man, er woman, Natsuru.  Now this is nothing new to anyone who has watched any harems.  Typically it\u2019s the girls who always shine brightest in these sorts of shows with the guy being a typically plain and indecisive proxy for the fantasies of the intended, mostly male audience.  The only difference here is that the guy is in fact one of the girls too.  Though other than being hot and combined the stereotypical guy in a girls body humor there is absolutely nothing interesting about \"her\" either.  Maybe the most memorable thing about Natsuru though is he is without a doubt the most clueless and colossally stupid man in the history of the universe.  Really dude, buy a fucking clue!  I wanted to reach through the TV and slap him myself.  I actually almost felt sorry for those girls.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls they unfortunately don\u2019t fair much better.  They meet all the usual harem standards by combining a tomboyish childhood friend, moe oujosama, tsundere meganekko, and cool aloof student council president.  They are about as exciting as their descriptions too.  Perhaps the only exception is Akane, the bespectacled tsundere.  Though this may only have been because of my affinity for the character type and that she was voiced by Yue Horie then out of any real quality.  The supporting cast is equally as clich\u00e9d and unmemorable.  So much so that I doubt I could even remember any of their names without looking at the cast list first.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing to come out of the cast is clearly the talking stuffed \"Entrails Animals\" that serve as companions for each of the K\u00e4mpfer.  The fact that they were all voiced by very well known seiyuu was a big part of it but they were really the only characters who were actually funny.  You know a series is in a lot of trouble when the highlight of the show is the preview of the next episode and the summary before the episode starts (all coincidently voiced by these characters).  I felt that a huge opportunity was missed in not making these characters more involved in the episodes dialogue and comedy bits.  I felt there was a lot of untapped potential left behind.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically K\u00e4mpfer is solid but unspectacular.  The girls are cute and have nice figures and our leading man is at least somewhat manly in at least appearance.  I thought the breasts were pretty silly looking though, a bit too torpedoish looking.  Kind of a peeve of mine that if you\u2019re going to show me these girls tits all the time that they don\u2019t even look natural.  Even if they are usually obscured by the usual convenient steam and light beams.  The action scenes are also not that spectacular either, which is even more disappointing considering how few their actually are.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is the best and only real bright spot of the anime.  A real all star lineup of acting talent is on display but unfortunately they all had very little to work with.  The musical performances were fair.  I was a little disappointed at who they actually had perform the OP/ED songs considering the talent they had available.\\n\\n\r\nOverall there is nothing for me to recommend about this anime.  It fails as a action, harem, or even ecchi comedy.  While it does have its moments at times there is not enough of any one thing to really appeal to fans of any of these genres.  Stay clear, you can do a lot better than this one.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Kampfer. The Anime with big-breasted girls fighting for no reason. Here's what I think after completing Kampfer. I will not write spoilers so don't worry.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nStory? Hmm. Kampfer actually has no story. It's basically just a guy turning into a girl that goes to a school in which boys and girls are separated. Just throw a few random fights out there, and ta-dah, you get Kampfer. They basically don't know why they're fighting until the very end, in which came out as a sci-fi thing.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI loved the art of Kampfer. It was outstanding. The details are very well drawn and animated, and ofcourse,the breasts. Perfect 32 dds are perfect. It looked clean, and the fight scenes were also good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nDidn't really stand out that much, but it was still good. You get your typical sound in Kampfer. Nothing really stood out in this one, althought the OP song was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nTypical harem show. Everyone likes the main protagonist. You also get different types of characters, like tsundere, moe, etc, in this show, which is typical. Although you will notice right away who the enemy is going to be, the characters were all good. I mean, a guy turning into a girl? Good, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nSure, there were few good episodes in Kampfer, but some were bad, and some were so-so. I did enjoy watching it. Had some good laughs in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthought it was kind of predictable, cliche, and the ending was a turn off, it was still good. If you like Harem, Ecchi, with a little bit of action, then Kampfer is for you!",

            "content": "\u201cThat was pretty stupid.\u201d \u2013 Sangou Shizuku\r\nGender bending not your cup of tea? Harem is too redundant in the anime industry lately? Well then perhaps having one more of such show might not hurt too much. As the saying goes \u201cthere\u2019s always an exception to everything\u201d, and Kampfer might just be that one exception for you! Blessed with nice animation and huge plot twists (for better or for worse), Kampfer sure surprised many viewers towards the end of the show...in a negative way. \r\nLet us start with something that is very lacking in Kampfer, the plot. Excluding the plot twists that contributed to some muchneeded \u201cexcitements\u201d, the story was pretty non-existent. Viewers first find themselves thrown into the mist of a pre-planned battle between the red Kampfers and blue Kampfers, staged by some mysterious force only known as the \u201cmoderators\u201d. Part way through the anime, any hint of potential story will be replaced by random fan service. Not only was the ending poorly made, but the lack of conclusion also made Kampfer not very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial emphasis should be placed on Shizuku, the student council president and the only character with a brain in the group of Kampfers. She almost single-handedly saved the character category from total destruction in my eyes. In fact, recently there have been comparisons made between Shizuku and Hitagi Senjougahara (a very well liked character among otaku) from Bakemonogatari due to their tsundere nature. Another note worthy character is Akane. She can be seen as a masochist, but due to her transformation as a Kampfer, one can also argue that she somewhat a tsundere character as well. These two characters showed the most growth and seem to be the most developed out of all the main characters. In fact, they are like two bright candles lit in a dark room.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are some likable characters, the overall characters development/growth for the majority of the casts is very minimal. They start and end the show practically the same way. It seems like they did not learn a single thing during their little \u201cadventure\u201d. What hurts the anime most is perhaps the lack of uniqueness from our gender flopping protagonist. He/she does have the looks, but at the end of show the one that will likely have the most impact on you will not be him/her.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I am giving a little too much credit to Nomad, the studio that produced Kampfer, but the designs on the characters (ie. their looks, their facial expressions, their Kampfer transformation, et cetera) were quite nicely animated. The animation quality also seems to be rather consistent (which is always a plus). They could have obviously improved on the details of the characters and the backgrounds, but for an ecchi/harem type show I strongly believe having your \u201cmerchandise\u201d (ie. girl) looks good is way more crucial than anything else. And in that respect, Nomad was profoundly efficient.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department in Kampfer is average in many ways. The OP may require some time to get accustom to, but the ED will surely get you hooked. However the BGM within the episodes were nothing outstanding. They may suite certain scene or event relatively well most of the time, but they never gave me the feeling that they are amplifying the scene through my ears. Sometimes BGM can make you feel all hyped up or ready to cry a river, but the music in Kampfer did not deliver to that level.\\n\\n\r\nKampfer fails as a romance anime. Kampfer fails as an action anime. Kampfer, however, delivers ecchiness and harem in a moderate level. Nothing too extreme and nothing too exciting. Its selling points are without a doubt the good and consistent animation quality, and interesting characters like Shizuku and Akane. Overall depending on what you are seeking for enjoyment, Kampfer can be a great source of entertainment or a total waste of time. Personally I liked Shizuku so much that I can ignore all the glaring faults from the show, but that is just my preference. By the way, did anyone tell you Kampfer is a show for Christmas with a story about Santa Claus?\\n\\n\r\n*edit* 2nd Revision",

            "content": "Kampfer is an anime series I randomly picked while I was a bit bored and it wasn\u2019t half bad. If you like perverted anime series this one might be pretty suitable for you. What I thought it was kind of unique and somewhat interesting was the gender switch that happens to a rather unlucky, ordinary student, as he tries to find out the meaning behind the changes.\r\nApparently, the reason of the sudden transformation was the existence of the female warriors called Kampfer, as the protagonist  was chosen to become one. Although their existence is not really explained, one thing is certain, that these mysteriouswarriors need to fight against each other for absolutely no reason (actually, in the anime it is stated something like : \u201cYou are born to fight!\u201d, although apparently no kampfer knows the meaning behind these conflicts).\\n\\n\r\nSo, after an amazing start in the first episode, with intense action and pretty promising story, I actually thought that this show had the potential to be an amazing experience, though in the end it hadn\u2019t met my expectations. The show flows at a normal pace, although it has very few intense moments,  as it tends to step closer in the slice of life kind of genre following the main character\u2019s life and his interactions with the other kampfer out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story could be promising, but the writers preferred not to concentrate their attention into developing the plot, instead, they decided to mess with new ideas to show in every episode, as the events that happen in the episodes are hardly related to each other. Every episode is some kind of filler, containing ridiculous embarrassing situations that the characters are put in without affecting the plot, though some of them were pretty comical at times. I found the main concept of the gender changing to be a rather good idea, although all the meaningless fights among the kampfer as they seem to be controlled by this entity called \u201cthe Moderators\u201d are pretty stupid and ridiculous. Also, there is no apparent villain or evil mind. One thing that just annoyed me was the absolutely lame and unoriginal ending, that probably dropped this show\u2019s score by half, but that may be just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there isn\u2019t much to talk about the plot, the characters are the ones that keep the show alive (mostly). They are indeed unoriginal or just plain, as you can hardly even remember their names, but overall they are not that bad. The main character is pretty dumb, and has absolutely no personality at all, the only thing that you can notice is his obsessive love for one of the female characters and the difficulty in understanding people\u2019s feelings. As his male self, he isn\u2019t really noticeable, but his female self is the one that is in the center of attention almost all the time. Some comical situations may occur, especially when the other students abuse her good looking body. The cast is not that amazing, but you have your creepy set of characters such as a lesbian (unfortunately there is such a thing), a fool-mouthed red haired chick that threatens everyone with her handgun, a rather smart \u201cPrez\u201d that likes teasing the main character, a shy and innocent girl that seems to be in love with the protagonist and so forth. Overall, the characters are not that bad, although they are poorly developed, as I actually had a hard time finding myself a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average, the characters look decent, but occasionally there can be found some animation errors, such as a completely mistaken reflection in a mirror, although they are rather hardly noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is fair, it is nothing amazing, it is just right, as well as the voice acting which mostly suited the characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many flaws in character and plot development, I found this show quite enjoyable, maybe because I somewhat liked the concept ..I\u2019m not very sure myself.\\n\\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you like ecchi style of anime with nice looking characters (mostly female with huge boobs) with a slice of life touch to it, almost inexistent story, average art, poor character development, you might give Kampfer a try, although don\u2019t watch it if you have high expectations as you will probably be disappointed. Overall it\u2019s a good time killer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review on MAL, I hope you find it helpful. Although I\u2019ve been really careful while writing this review, I apologize for  any potential grammar errors. Stay safe!\\n",

His stuffed tiger explains the basics of his situation with no real detail simply that when his bracelet glows he will turn in to a female and likely run into a fight.\\n\\n\r\nWhen turned in to K\u00e4mpfer deep personality traits are more exaggerated physical ability it increased  and you gain a weapon. There are three weapon types mentioned at this point. To keep it simple either your a sword user, a gun user, or like our main character a magic user.\\n\\n\r\nstory:8 \\n\r\nhaving to pick based off the first episode i can see it turning into a good story, 2 chicks dig him so far and more are sure to come\\n\\n\r\nart:8\\n\r\nlove the school uniforms color is good and frame rate isnt anything to be disappointed about \\n\\n\r\nsound:7\\n\r\nsure good enough guy could be a bit more many but then again it adds to him meek personality almost makes him seem...\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:8\\n\r\nquicky defined in the first episode i already feel like i know them well with the transformations draging out the most deep desires of the kampfer we can see just who's who right off the bat \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:7\\n\r\nworth the 20 mins so far\\n\r\nand expecting more the first 2 epsisodes make up a nice chunck of the manga so im hoping for some good new action \\n",

            "content": "I still have no idea why I even bothered to finish this anime. The whole thing is just random, boring and full of fanservice. The \"story\" revolves around Natsuru Seno, a normal boy who wakes up one morning as a girl. We learn through his stuffed tiger that talks (and also has it's stuffed guts hanging out of his stomach) that this change was because he was chosen to be a \"Kampfer,\" a female fighter, and he continues going back and forth between girl and guy to participate in fights with other Kampfer. Why? We are never told. They never give a real reason forthis. Anyway, it's filled with yuri and awkward moments as the protagonist tries to get his dream girl to fall in love with his male side as more and more girls fall for the female him. The stories tend to fall flat on their face and I ended up shrugging it off as another weird Japan fanservice show. If you like that then by all means watch away. If you actually want a real story, watch something like Blue Exorcist and stay away from this.",

            "content": "After Watching the 11 first episodes.\r\nIn short, this series is basicly BUILT on service. In each episode it\u00b4s owerflowing. Wich in this case actualy is a good thing. Believe it or not.\r\nSenou Natsuru is a normal boy, he goes to school, has friends (kinda). And has a fairly normal life. Untill the fated day. The day he becomes a K\u00e4mpfer, his life is turned as upside down as it\u00b4s possible to get it. As K\u00e4mpfer, his appearance is changed a lot, he\u00b4s completely turned into a female beuty and is forced to fight against other K\u00e4mpfers, but for what reason is he fighting?\r\nThe story inthe series is almost non-existent. As this series focus greatly on fanservice. The whole plot of the \"K\u00e4mpfers\" seems as it is created only to have a reason to turn Natsuru into a hot gal. And with twelve episodes, the story doesn\u00b4t get much time to expand. Wich is sad, because it realy had potential. But to put that thing aside, the story isn\u00b4t realy THAT important in this series. K\u00e4mpfer is mainly about enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is verry stylish. Iv\u00b4e kinda seen it before, but i like it. The girls are cute, basicly because it\u00b4s almost just girls in the entire series, and it is therefore a huge lack of boys. Natsuru and his friend, and some random guys is about the only males in the series. And i feel that Natsuru is the only boy that the character designers put their hearth and soul into creating.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is of a pretty good quality. Basicly it\u00b4s mostly moaning that is the sound you\u00b4ll hear the most, but aside from that, the sound is pretty good. The soundtrack also got to me, and i liked some of the songs wery good. The OP and ED is pretty standard, it\u00b4s catchy but it\u00b4s not the types of songs that\u00b4ll stick to your brains for pretty long.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in K\u00e4mpfer is in short terms verry variated. Some of them you like the moment you see them, and the others you\u00b4ll detest as soon as you see them. The main characters is well done, but as we don\u00b4t get to know them that well during the eleven episodes it gets pretty frustrating at the end when you realice that, that\u00b4s it. The main protoganist of the series, Senou Natsuru is probably the one character that you\u00b4ll like the most, as he is damn hot in his girl form, and classicly clumsy in he\u00b4s a boy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI realy enjoyed watching this series, with good animations, catchy soundtrack and hot girls, what is there not to like? Well there is something, but it\u00b4s realy just small stuff. Overall this series is absolute worth watching, if you like fanservice that is. And if you watch it, you\u00b4ll probably watch it one or more times just to see the funny scenes one more time. Because the scenes that are funny, realy are hillarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

The end itself was totally open and with a really stupid Great Revelation, and nothing is really resolved, and the reaction of the really really baka main protagonist was simply ... stupid. \r\nSay, how much stupid it can get: The villain is using the main male character, doesnot like men and tried to make him kill his friends by controlling his actions, disregarding his will and seeing him as a tool, actually using his feelings towards her to her own wishes...and after the \"hero\" discovers it he does what?

            "content": "Kampfer, Kampfer, Kampfer.\r\nA somewhat difficult anime to review.\r\nDespite its shortcomings as an obviously stereotypical ecchi love-comedy jam-packed with your staple assortment of embarrassing, should-be-censored scenes, Kampfer surprisingly hit me with something I wasn't expecting: A cast of characters that are somewhat unique, but most of all, lovable in some way, and a very over-the-top sense of humor.\r\nIf you have seen a lot of different love comedies, you will still most likely enjoy this anime, but personally having seen a variety of these types of shows, the humor in Kampfer sometimes literally made me laugh out loud, which is something I do not do so oftenwhen watching anime alone.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that although I found Kampfer immensely entertaining, its plot hardly differs from that of your average harem: NONEXISTANT. As I was not looking for or expecting a plot in particular, I found no incredible lacks in this department. While there is fanservice, increasingly so over the series, the beginning actually does not have too much, which I found to be refreshing and made the humor the focus as the story wound up.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to conclude that although Kampfer is indeed shallow and without a plot, the fact that it offers a humor that makes fun of other ecchi love comedies (maybe not intentionally) is a great added bonus. Also, the harem \"mob\" of girls is not so mindless that they follow the man for no reason. They each have their own reasons for liking him, and while it may seem shallow at first, some character's love seems to go deeper than your average ecchi love-comedy, which is also nice, seeing as I didn't expect that either :D\\n\\n\r\nIt seems I am getting to the conclusion first... Let's jump into the categories, shall we?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA boy named Senou Natsuru one day becomes a Kampfer, which is essentially a battle girl. Everyone must transform to go into their \"Kampfer mode\" but because Natsuru is a male, he must switch genders when he transforms into his Kampfer form. This creates all sorts of nonsense, as you can imagine. More and more Kampfer show up, and I will be sure to not spoil the rest of this \"intricate\" plotline.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the story line is not one of Kampfer's strong assets. If you do end up watching this show, keep very low expectations as far as the story goes. You may end up enjoying the show as much as I did.\\n\r\nBy the way, I choose to ignore the ending fight. It really is one of the strangest \"wtf\" moments I've seen in an anime. You won't like it, I can almost guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one thing that I think particularly shines about Kampfer. If you know me, I am very picky on eye styles. Once I saw them, I couldn't get my eyes off them (har dee har har).\\n\r\nAll lame jokes aside, I really do love the way everything is animated in this show. The main characters are very well done and never look like they were lazily drawn. There is one exception to this: At times, character's eyes or fingers might look incredibly lopsided or crooked. While this is a shame and looks fairly weird, I found it somewhat rare and passable under the rest of the art, which I very much liked.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly memorable in this department. The OP and ED were OK, just your standard ecchi love comedy themes. Music during the anime flowed well, but again, was not as memorable as something like that from Clannad. That is a very high standard of comparison, but I did not find Kampfers music bad either. The songs fit the emotions, and did not stick out awkwardly in any place I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Kampfer elevates itself over other ecchi love-comedies. Most animes with obvious levels of sexual bombardment ignore the character development part of the roadmap. Kampfer manages to delve into the characters more than most ecchi love-comedies, and I found this to be a great change. While it is not much more, it is noticable when compared to other ecchi anime. Please note that the 9/10 rating is in comparison to other character development in the same genre.\\n\r\nAaand what I just said was partially a lie. The characters are also very lovable. There's a character for everyone to love, and the art combined with the character's personalities makes for a charming anime in this respect.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I shamelessly enjoyed every second of this anime. The ecchi, the characters, the corny not-so-well-thought-out battle scenes, the awkwardness with the \"bishoujo\" element of this anime, the over-the-top humor... It was all great. And I don't regret a single second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this anime will just differ completely depending on who looks at it. With virtually no story, this anime is fairly flat and predictable in its dimensions. If you aren't looking for a good story and just something you can veg out to, this is a great watch. I suggest watching the first 2 episodes, and if you don't like it by then, quit. If you're interested in the genre though, I highly suggest you give it a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nToday I review Kampfer, perhaps the least original anime ever made! It fails as a romance, it fails as action, it fails as a comedy. Kampfer is entirely comprised of fail! Instead of \"Kampfer\", which is German for \"fighter\" , the series should have been called Schei\u00dfe !\r\nRemember how in Ranma 1/2 there was a subplot where a boy would turn into a girl and it would create awkward moments of sexual tension and comedy? That was pretty funny in the early 1990s and it felt new at the time. However, like all Rumiko Takahashi series it ran a LONG time and the premise nowfeels worn out and tired. Kampfer takes this tired joke and absolutely beats the shit out of a dead horse! You can't have a fucking comedy series based on a 1 joke premise that isn't even fresh! Why do you think the Geico Cavemen TV show was cancelled in 1 season?\\n\\n\r\nTo give Kamper some credit, it doesn't JUST do a horrible job ripping off the humor of Ranma 1/2 and other slapstick harem anime of the 1990s like Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo. Kampfer also decided to be the 8 billionth anime to feature a battle royale tournament in which contestants are forced by some mysterious greater power to battle each other until 1 is left. Each \"kampfer\" is a girl with magical abilities and each has her own doll. Sort of like Rozen Maiden, the much better show about magic dolls that must battle each other to claim the ultimate prize. This type of anime tends to be really popular, so I suppose you can't blame the Kampfer creator for trying to cash in. Anime like Future Diary, Btooom!, and Fate Stay Night are some of the highest rated and most popular anime on MAL. The first huge problem with Kampfer is that it brings NOTHING new to the audience. It simply uses and abuses popular cliches in order to make a quick buck off Otaku that the Kampfer creator clearly thinks are idiots. The second problem is that it it isn't even an entertaining ripoff or mockbuster! The Asylum movies are better than Kampfer! Probably the most creative thing kampfer did was the obnoxious series of grotesque dolls called the entrails animals. Although, even those just seem like a cheap ripoff of the Garbage Pail Kids from the 1980s!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but nothing great. Kampfer isn't one of those anime that is entertainingly bad due to technical issues like laughably bad animation, a terrible dub, or a horrendous soundtrack. Kampfer is the worst kind of bad. Uninspired and BORING! If Kampfer was entertainingly bad like Angel Cop or Mad Bull 34 it would at least have SOME reason for people to watch it.",

Awww, poor guy! o.O\r\nIf the girls had not been so obviously in love with Natsuru(they were actually physically fighting over him while he stood there confused!), and if the White Kampfers had shown up earlier (and been an actual threat) then this series might have been good. As it was, they had to make Natsuru an idiot so that it didn't turn into outright Hentai. Not a reasonable character choice! And the sudden \"it was aliens\" ending was pretty bad, too.\\n\\n\r\nNice art. Nice premise. Horrible plot. Dumb, dumb main character. I only finished it because it was short.",

            "content": "Kampfer... A series that everybody could've expected to be generic and full of fanservice right from the poster art. And it is exactly that. A show full of nothing but flaming lesbians attempting to battle it out against each other and greater beings called Moderators. Did they actually beat these said Moderators? No. Absolutely not. Barely anything happened, if anything actually did happen.\r\nStory [5]: The story stars Senou Natsuru, your typical loser of a main character who is in love with a girl named Sakura Kaede. One day, Natsuru receives a stuffed doll and magically transforms into a girl. Natsuru then runs into the othercharacters of the show and what actually ensues? Fanservice... some more fanservice... some lesbian antics. That's pretty much all that really happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe series promises some kind of plot where Sangou Shizuku, another Kampfer, claims they will fight the Moderators and get to the bottom of this ridiculous Red vs Blue war. Does that actually happen? Not really. The pacing is ridiculously horrible. Most of the episodes just has all these different girls fighting over Natsuru. Only towards the end do we get some minor plot movement... some very minor plot movement. So minor, that the series closes without any real questions answered. Even if it is adapted from an on-going manga, you'd think they'll at least put in some filler ending for closure unless they plan on dealing out a second season, which will probably end just as badly as this.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8]: The only thing this show has going for it is the animation. Adapted from the manga, the character designs are nice to look at but nothing too spectacular. There are plenty of shredded clothing, plenty of bare chests, and plenty of fog covering those bare chests. The show does certainly pull out a few risque moves with all the full frontal censored nudity and groping that goes on throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7]: The characters are all voiced by top class seiyuus ranging from Inoue Marina voicing both Natsurus to Horie Yui voicing two completely different and distinct personalities. The soundtrack however, is nothing to rave about. Chippy happy music runs through most of the show. Nothing too serious or dramatic in its pieces.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [6]: Natsuru is dumb. Plain and simple. He is as dense as main characters can be. His head? Hard as a rock. He's busy being infatuated with one girl while completely oblivious to the fact that he has three other girls fawning over him. Mikoto is the generic childhood friend, and Akane is some generic bookworm girl who turns into a mildly hilarious violent psycho gun wielding redhead. Then we have the annoyingly selfish flaming lesbian Kaede. All she does is fawn over female Natsuru constantly and bitches at whoever inches too close to her. The only character really worth mentioning is Shizuku. Not only is she awesomely manipulative, she is one of the few girls in any anime to be bold enough to make moves on the man. Her antics make this show slightly bearable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the character development going on this show is pretty much non-existant. Everybody sticks to their archetypes and barely nudges. There's like only one character in whole that develops a bit, but saying anything more would be spoilering. Natsuru is too dense to think of anything by himself, Kaede is too busy being a complete lesbian over female Natsuru, Akane is too busy giggling or shooting stuff, Mikoto is pretty much non-existant, and Shizuku, as awesome as her devious plans are, develops the generic harem love for the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall [6/5]: Shizuku pretty much makes the show watchable. Other than that, it's just a complete waste of time to watch the girls constantly bicker over each other like little girls over their favorite Barbie doll. The show's pacing is so terrible that the actual plot ends prematurely and the last episode ends up being a completely useless filler episode about body switching. Even if they ended it on an open note so they can continue onto a second season, that will probably fail just as much as the first season.",

            "content": "Oh Lord, where should I begin. K\u00e4mpfer is probably the strangest anime I've watched this summer. Let's just say this isn't your average harem, unless you even consider this a harem at all. Boy wakes up one day to find he's transformed into a girl, stuffed lion with intestines falling out tells him that he's a K\u00e4mpfer and has powers now, that's only the beginning of the weirdness. He somehow get's transferred into the girls only part of the school, and to make it better, I'm pretty convinced everyone in that school might be a lesbian. Why, you ask? They're all trying to \"get toknow her\". And when I say that, watch episode 3 and you'll catch my drift. On top of that, she gets attacked constantly by other K\u00e4mpfers, so that pretty much ties it all up.\\n\\n\r\nStory... what can I say, there isn't really a story at all. I mean, it all revolves around the fact that he can transform into a girl. I think the last 3 episodes are when the slightest bit of a story even occurs.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork... Like most animes I guess, now a days, the newer animes all seem to look the same to me. For those of you who watch a bunch of that kind of animes, you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSound was probably the best thing in the show. I liked the voice actors and actresses in the show, liked them from previous shows before this one, and they are kind of what made me continue watching the show. If they hadn't gotten good actors, I might have stopped watching halfway through. MIGHT have, depends on who the other voice actors would have been.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are somewhat unique in their own way. I mean, the main character is the only person I know who can transform into a girl and back to a boy. Him and the chick from Ranma 1/2. Other characters were all fairly similar to those I've seen in other animes, and the fricking intestine animals were just too annoying. I literally wanted to punch my TV whenever they opened their mouths.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of it, there were some parts where I was like \"OK what did I just watch?\" (again, referring to episode 3), but it was an interesting show overall. I know a lot of people who gave this like 9's and 10's, and there are plenty of people at my school who loved it, but this is all my opinion. If you don't like my opinion, go with others. Hopefully this review helped some of you.",

            "content": "* this review is in my perspective, things may seem better/worse in others opinions. *\r\nK\u00e4mpfer is a anime thats really based on echhi, And i recomend to not watch it if you dislike echhi. Eventough the rest seems good to you, like super powers and action. This anime is based on a percentage system what it will show.\r\n50% echhi and romance\r\n25% superpower and action\r\n25% comedy.\r\nMake sure the look at these numbers because thats what you will get watching this anime.\r\nrecap (what's the story about,) -SPOILER FREE-\r\nNatsuru is a normal student at a school thats split up in two sides, boys side and girls side. Whenhe wakes up the next morning he has a bracelet thats blue, and he is a girl. A stuffed tiger wich support him with being a k\u00e4mpfer tells him that he became a girl because all k\u00e4mfers are girl,  and he has to slay the red side because he is blue side. He finds out that there are 3 tipes of k\u00e4mpfers. Shooters, mages, fighters. He is the mage. he randomly transforms to a girl and has to survive against the other k\u00e4mfers.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much all i can say without spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is bad because there is no story, everything will be explained it later episodes so it's kinda hard to say if there even is a story. What seems like the story is kinda shitty, lack of explaination and its not really exciting. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is not really bad but it could be way better. the background are worked out badly and moving is kinda the same move its not really anything special happends. But altough is decent and it's not a thing to be hated.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is kinda the same story as the art. Things that are not directly linked to the thing thats happening falls of or is faded away. Eventough things like songs troughout voices and things that are directly attached to the things that are happening are good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are made shitty. Only the main characters are fine with design and voice. But the main characters are worked out so well its kinda lifting up the bad character work on the side characters that are bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is where i look at first when watching an anime, is it fun to watch or not.\\n\r\nBecause the main reason you watch anime is for fun. i think this anime was extremly nice in terms of enjoyment. I liked it a lot and give it a nice mark. But this is for everyone really personal.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\ni would say that K\u00e4mpfer is a great echhi anime, in terms of action i would say it is not what makes this anime good. Eventough the story and art/sound isn't that great i think that the fun you'll have is more of value then anything else. That's why this anime deserves a:\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n* this review is in my perspective, things may seem better/worse in others opinions.*",

            "content": "This part is what people usually read expecting you to tell watch it or not worth it but that's impossible. People have different tastes. Kampfer is full of fan service. If you want an anime where you get to see cute, big breasted girls fight for no particular reason then go ahead and watch kampfer. If you want to see a harem where everybody likes the boy and seduce him 24/7 then go ahead. If you are looking for an anime with a good plot, good action and good romance, please reconsider if you decide to watch it.\r\nStory:\r\nThere is absolutely nothing to it. If Icould change the title I would name it \"The Life Of Natsuru Senou\". At first you could tolerate it. Tolerate seeing girls fight with each other for no particular reason but then a few episodes through and you are wondering, \"What the hell?\".  It makes no sense at all! Though there are some clues that tell you that there is something a lot more deep to the girls fighting each other but then there is nothing.\\n\r\nBacking up my previous statement on changing the title to \"The Life Of Natsuru Senou\". There isn't decent romance in it but most of the time when the girls are not fighting they are seducing Natsuru. That's where it was enjoyable. Seeing big breasted girls fighting over a boy. XD!\\n\r\nSo we have established that the plot is only about a boy getting seduce by cute girls(Oh! He can change into a girl for some reason they never cared to mention) but there is actually no romance and there is mindless fighting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is one good point in this anime. The quality is fantastic and the art is outstanding. It's enjoyable to watch. I didn't really look out for animation but I just know that the characters are well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is fair. it is not corny but not particularly excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nMaybe they had too many characters but you never really saw them to the fullest. The main character was like an insignificant toy(then again there would be cute girls without him). You didn't see much of the other characters either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFinally, it was very enjoyable. There were laughs. The art was good.

            "content": "Kampfer, well......\r\nJust when i start to type my comment on this anime, i still thinking like: what does Kampfer really attach to me? The gender-swapping? The seiyuu? maybe the odd but interesting story element in it? And ya, i have a good sense of why it might attach to the other guys mostly: Service.Service.Service.Service.Service.Service.Service. (just follow the Service tone form Hayate 2nd Season episode 0 OVA).\r\nEven i don't know why, but i just give what i think of it so far. (It will be update when is over)\r\nKampfer from what i say did have to do service. But here is the basis:\r\nIn one morning, SenouNatsuru (a guy) discover that he has become a she by some cute but has it stomach cut out talking tiger doll and told her (him) that she (he) is a Kampfer, a magical girl who has to fight on something. It still haven't reveal what it is but maybe later. As soon she finally revert back to him, he was throw into a sudden battle/meeting Mishima Akane, his later allies; but end up his childhood friend he like, Sakura Kaede, is in love in his female self.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the episode i see so far where i like to call 'random service' plot. The anime or the director doesn't take the plot seriously, just give us random stuff; but only have a small portion of Kampfer plot. Nothing new or anything big to scope out the real thing. Oh ya, speaking the real thing; you get to see Natsuru getting her (him) self to be like some kind of service tool on the series and to other character.\\n\\n\r\nAll the character here i would say useless. Natsuru is a guys and he (she) is helpless with a bunch of girls around him, and they happen (smartly) to use him (her) popular to earn $$$. Akane suppose to help him but couldn't help herself and might be like him (her). And Kaicho-san (Sangou Shizuku), enough flirting with Natsuru or other and start tell us what going on and what you know.\\n\\n\r\nFor what i have write and think of the episode i watch so far, this is more like a yuri anime! X_X\\n\\n\r\nSure, the animation is well done, and the color in the anime is bright color. This was one of the place Kampfer have won.\\n\\n\r\nThe other were the seiyuu. Inoue Marina, Horie Yui, Nakajima Megumi, Noto Mamiko, Mizuki Nana, Tamura Yukari and to name a few. All top notch seiyuu doing kawaii voices on 'kawaii' anime, with service. Another won by Kampfer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the funny thing is that they even throw themselve in it, mostly by name but Tamura Yukari-san happen to throw her image in it on episode 1, in anime style. Again, they won.\\n\\n\r\n(The other seiyuu that also throw her image in it from what i heard are a seiyuu voice Shizuka on Doraemon, don't who that is but she is old and voice the tiger in this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP of the anime just doesn't not suit my taste, but ED does suit my taste with the closing done by none the other Inoue Marina and Nakajima Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nWell that how it is so far, even there is still a lot of bad point on it, but it just keeps me watching! (Maybe i am the type of guy who want to finish to the end) I write a full review on this anime when is over, and hopefully they will able to live up everyone (not everyone) expectation. \\n",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n(At Nomad Studios)\r\nDirector [sighing]: Creativity is dying in the anime industry.  Specifically, in the harem genre, we already have harems that involve twins, monster girls, cans transforming into girls, girls from outer space, girls with magical powers, etc. The list goes on. Is there anything we haven\u2019t done?\r\nProducer: H\u2019m\u2026oh, I believe there\u2019s one light novel that we haven\u2019t adapted. And it\u2019s unique.\r\nDirector [looks at producer]: Well, what is it? What\u2019s the title?\r\nProducer [pulling the light novel from his bag]: It\u2019s titled, \u201cKampfer.\"\r\nDirector [confused]: Kampfer? Why is the title in German?\r\nProducer [shrugging his shoulders]: I don\u2019t know. But, I know the authorused many German words. Maybe, he was a fan of the German language? Or its culture? But, who cares.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Okay, so what\u2019s it about?\\n\\n\r\nProducer [reading the back cover of the light novel]: It\u2019s about a boy named Natsuru Senou, who wakes up one day, and discovers that he\u2019s a girl. A stuffed tiger, in his room, comes to life and informs him that he\u2019s become a Kampfer, a female fighter. Moreover, all Kampfers must fight other Kampfers, and so begins the story of Natsuru as a female fighter.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Wait. Is it similar to TSF Monogatari? I mean, does the protagonist like both girls and guys?\\n\\n\r\nProducer [shocked]: Definitely not! Natsuru only likes girls, both in his male and female forms.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: I see. No\u2026wait a minute. If Natsuru is in his female form, and Natsuru only likes females, regardless of his gender, doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s a lesbian?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Well\u2026technically that\u2019s correct. But, I\u2019m pretty sure, the male viewers would not mind, girl on girl action. Even if, one of the girls is technically a guy.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [nodding]: Okay. So, about the girls, do they like Natsuru in both his male and female forms? And if so, wouldn\u2019t that make them bisexual?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Unfortunately, none of the main and side girls are bisexual. Although, all of the girls, including the boys, love Natsuru\u2019s female form to the point of being called a \u201cSchool Beauty.\u201d There\u2019s one main girl, I believe her name is Kaede Sakura, who is a lesbian and falls in love with Natsuru\u2019s female form. Now, the other main girls (i.e. childhood friend, student council president, and glasses girl) fall in love with Natsuru in his male form. Quite typical, really.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shaking his head]: Damn it! That would have been awesome and unique. A lesbian main character hooking up with a bunch bisexual girls, I wouldn\u2019t even complain! [Sighing.] Oh, well\u2026let me read the first couple of light novels and I\u2019ll tell you how I feel.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Sure. [He hands the Director the first four novels for Kampfer.]\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Thanks. I\u2019ll read them, thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\n[One week later]\\n\\n\r\nProducer: So, how was it?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: It was good\u2026at first. There were many action scenes, and they were cool. I mean, red kampfers vs. blue kampfers. Guns, swords, and magic. And tons of explosions. [Sighing.] But, then it turned into a romantic comedy filled with typical events, such as the cultural festival, pools, maid cafe, beauty contest, and summer festival. Besides, those events, what\u2019s up with the protagonist and suggestive clothing, he has worn: school swimsuits, bunny suit, nurse, bloomers, maid, and a naked apron. Doesn\u2019t he care about his current appearances?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: I\u2019m sure, our protagonist does care about his appearance, but the girls and mostly the situations he\u2019s in, force him to dress in women\u2019s clothing.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Well, I understand his situation, but it just seems all forced, like it was mainly for fanservice. And speaking of fanservice\u2026there\u2019s a lot of ripped clothes, nudity, suggestive collisions, and boob and ass moments.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Pandering to the readers, and, of course, to our future viewers.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shrugging]: Well, fanservice is fanservice, although there is one thing that irks me. \\n\\n\r\nProducer: And, what is that?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: Why are the red and blue kampfers fighting each other? I understand many characters throughout the story ask the messengers this question, but they always dodge or ignore it entirely. But, it isn\u2019t just that question, but also, \"who makes them fight\", and \"why did Natsuru and the girls get their abilities.\" This makes each fight seem random and pointless.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: I understand your frustration, and I\u2019m sure the author will answer those questions. \\n\\n\r\nDirector: Speaking of questions\u2026how many light novels in this series has the author written?\\n\\n\r\nProducer: The author has written nine light novel for this series, and is preparing for more in the future.\\n\\n\r\nDirector [shaking his head]: That\u2019s not good. If what you said is correct, then there isn\u2019t a conclusive ending, which means\u2026\\n\\n\r\nProducer: That Natsuru hasn\u2019t chosen a girl, yet. Shit! What are we going to do? What type of ending should we go for?\\n\\n\r\nDirector: We could go with, \u201cThe Story Continues\u201d, or \u201cNo Romantic Resolution\u201d or \u201cHarem Ending\u201d, but all these endings will piss off some portion of the audience. [Thinking. Suddenly, he snaps his fingers.] I got it! Since, this series is getting 12 episodes max, and the final episode ends one week before Christmas. Let\u2019s make a Christmas Episode.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Brilliant Idea! But, let\u2019s not produce your typical Christmas Episode, but one with a twist.\\n\\n\r\nDirector: H\u2019m\u2026I like it. Let\u2019s go with it.\\n\\n\r\nProducer: Okay. I\u2019ll begin production, right away.\\n\\n\r\nThe End",

            "content": "Kampfer: The story of a boy who discovers he has gained the ability to transform into a fireball-throwing female warrior.\r\nI didn't expect anything from the first episode to be honest. I was ready for a poor anime from the start. Thankfully, it managed to improve a little bit in my eyes before it wrapped up at episode 11 (12? Don't ask...).\r\nStory-It has an interesting premise: random people with bizarre bracelets have the power to transform into either sword-flinging, gun-slinging or fireball-blasting amazons. These amazons, split up into the classic Red vs. Blue style team battle, are fighting for unknown reasons, only by the whim ofmysterious figures known as \"Moderators.\"\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn't really fulfill that idea. Only a few action scenes, and they tend to be short-lived. There really isn't an epic fight that managed to grab my attention throughout the whole show. Also, it seemed that this story was only an excuse for the excessive ecchi elements of this show: nothing better than a bunch of large-chest women duking it out in school uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nA bigger point of the story are the romantic elements, although these weren't exactly spectacular either. Without revealing anything in the show, there was very little development in whatever psuedo-relationship this show tried to pull, and most of these relationships again seemed to be excuses for more ecchi content by appealing to numerous interests.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also doesn't do a good job of wrapping up details. At least right now it appears unlikely that there will be a second season, and if so Kampfer failed to address many of the questions I had for it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall the story seemed original, but it wasn't very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound-Visually pleasing. There is nothing outstanding or groundbreaking, but there's nothing to complain about. Soundwise, they did a decent job too, a little bit more than I expected.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Some of the characters in this anime do have their good points. One warrior upon transformation completely flips, which I found amusing watching the contrast and wondering if it really was the same person. It was also good fun to watch the main star's issues as he tried to adjust to having a woman's body.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't get better than that for the humans, however. All the rest of them are actually quite shallow with very little personality.  Sure, they all have their \"role,\" but they go no further. They all have a very clear objective from start to finish, and nothing's changing anytime soon. There are a couple of personality shifts, but they are hardly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another set of characters that are probably the biggest reason I kept watching this: each of these warriors get an animal doll with some sort of physical obscenity; usually it's the intestines sticking out. These things are animated, however, and they do not take this whole Red vs. Blue thing seriously at all. They were tons of fun in my opinion, and they managed to make the show a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Alright, with all the crud I said about this show, I admit I didn't hate every single minute of it. I was disappointed as I learned that it was not going uphill, but at the same time it wasn't all downhill either. I had fun watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-I doubt I'll be watching this again, and I don't think I'll be bothered by looking for the second season. I probably won't recommend this to anyone I know.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is good for the ecchi, and it does have its moments. But overall this is something I won't be remembering.\\n\\n\r\n6/10-Fair",

            "content": "Natsuru is a normal high school boy, aside from the fact that one day he wakes up as a big-breasted girl. An Entrails Animal in the shape of a plush tiger with its intestines hanging out, named Harakiri Tora (Disemboweled Tiger), informs Natsuru that he has become a K\u00e4mpfer and must now fight against other K\u00e4mpfers for what initially seems like no reason.\r\nThe first episode starts off with a bang; K\u00e4mpfer seems like a nice comedy/action series with a little bit of gender bending and even a love story between Natsuru and a soft-spoken girl named Kaede tossed in.\r\nEverything great about this series quickly degenerates,though, so soon as episode 3, when it becomes a yuri love-fest \u2013\u2013 male Natsuru, trapped in his female K\u00e4mpfer body, stuck between it all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that basically sums up most of the series. K\u00e4mpfer, to some fans\u2019 delight, started out looking like another Sekirei, but instead resorted to perverted jokes and fan service \u00e0 la Rosario + Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nK\u00e4mpfer, for the most part, has no story, unless you count the yuri love triangle \u2013\u2013 er, square \u2013\u2013 that persists every episode, which the anime makes no attempt to underplay. What few battle scenes there are only last a minute at most and are definitely not worth the weeks of waiting that it took to get there. I\u2019m glad I held out and marathoned the last 5 episodes. In my opinion, the most interesting twist occurs at episode 7. Unfortunately, the series ended quite open-endedly, which only hints that we\u2019re doomed to get a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nThe art quality from K\u00e4mpfer is inconsistent from time to time. The animation can be sharp and glowly during the more dramatic and intense scenes \u2013\u2013 I especially like the depth of field effect when a character is near the foreground \u2013\u2013 while sometimes there are obvious mistakes in subtle places that  people too focused on the fan service may not notice. For example, in one infamous scene, a chair in the bathroom has no reflection in the mirror. These failures in quality control may come as no surprise, though, since this anime is produced by Nomad, who got caught putting six fingers on Suigintou in Rozen Maiden.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nThe sound was okay at best and annoying at worst. Natsuru\u2019s male voice was especially ear-wrenching \u2013\u2013 makes sense, since he is voiced by female voice actress Marina Inoue (also known for Chiri Kitsu in Zetsubou Sensei). I\u2019ll admit, though, that Natsuru in female form sounded really cute. You may be ecstatic to hear that K\u00e4mpfer hosts a plethora of talented voice actresses, mainly coming in the form of the small Entrails Animals. We have the voice actresses of Kotomi Ichinose and Mei Sunohara from Clannad, and my personal favorite, Yui Horie, plays the role of Natsuru\u2019s friend, Akane Mishima. It\u2019s just too bad that all that talent had to go to waste on a series that most people won\u2019t care about a year from now. The OP and ED theme are pretty good, assuming you like bubbly J-pop music. I found the ED theme quite addicting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nThe characters in K\u00e4mpfer are blatantly generic; you would almost think the producers did it on purpose. Akane is a shy and cute meganekko who transforms into a sour-mouthed K\u00e4mpfer with no sympathy whatsoever. Shizuku Sangou is president of the Student Council and, despite her harsh demeanor, has deep passion for Natsuru. Kaede Sakura is the most annoying, in my opinion. I hated her from beginning to end. It\u2019s her selfish personality that really bothered me. She only likes the female version of Natsuru, despite male Natsuru\u2019s love for her.  Natsuru\u2019s expressions are cute and funny when he\u2019s a K\u00e4mpfer, although he still gets embarrassed a lot, even in his male form.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nYou\u2019re enjoyment will depend on how much you like gender bending, fan service, and especially yuri. There is a lot of kissing and groping in this anime, but not so much that it would be considered borderline hentai like Kanokon. If you\u2019re looking for action in this series, you\u2019re going to be quite frustrated by the lack of it. I guess the only way you could enjoy this show is if you have a tolerance for the all the awkward situations Natsuru falls in with his female friends and classmates flocking to get their hands on his/her busty body. I\u2019ll give you a fair warning and say that K\u00e4mpfer comes no where near the quality of Rozen Maiden \u2013\u2013 one of Nomad\u2019s other anime. In fact, I would say I liked K\u00e4mpfer only slightly better than Akikan! because of its gender bendingness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nK\u00e4mpfer doesn\u2019t break any molds or tries to reinvent the genre. Sure, a guy stuck in a girl\u2019s body is an interesting scenario, but the anime fails to do anything with it, besides having other females literally fight over him\u2026I mean, her. The Entrails Animals were humorous, arguably more than their K\u00e4mpers, but we don\u2019t get much of an insight into their personality \u2013\u2013 aside from a few one-liners \u2013\u2013 until the final episode, which has no relevance to the rest of the series. K\u00e4mpfer isn\u2019t necessarily an awful series \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s definitely unique from the other forgetful ecchi series out there. The reason it fails is because the first two episodes promise so much potential, but the series totally ends up denying the audience\u2019s expectations, in the end. K\u00e4mpfer brings a whole new meaning to the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t judge an anime by its first episode.\u201d",

However he\u00b4s been chosen to be a Kampfer, who\u00b4s objective consists on fighting other Kampfer with either guns, swords or magic, however, there\u00b4s catch; first you can\u00b4t chose if you\u00b4re a Kampfer or not, and second, you must have the body of a girl to use your powers.\r\nPlot:\r\n\u201cWhether or not you want to be a Kampfer is irrelevant, you are chosen and have to fight. Lastly, to use your abilities as a Kampfer, you must have a girl\u2019s body.\u201d These are all rules that were thrust upon a poor high school student named Natsuru Senou. Asthe days go by, his life complicates even further as he is forced to live a life as a girl and try to figure out why everyone around him is turning out to be a die hard lesbian!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNatsuru Senou \u2013 the protagonist of the anime. He woke one day in a girl\u2019s body and on his way to school was attacked by a mysterious girl with a gun where he transformed into his female self once again.. His long time crush, Sakura Kaede, falls in love with his female self and this starts a wheel of unfortunate events for our hero(ine). Natsuru wears a blue Kampfer bracelet and wields Zauber type battle capabilities based on fire.\\n\r\nAkane Mishima \u2013 the mysterious girl that attacked Natsuru on the day of his Kampfer-ing. She is usually very kind but when in her Kampfer form, she becomes very foul mouthed and proceeds to shoot first and ask questions later. She is a Gewehr type Kampfer who uses a semiautomatic handgun.\\n\r\nSakura Kaede \u2013 Natsuru\u2019s childhood friend. She falls in love with his Kampfer form and begins a relentless pursuit of his love. Also, she has a fondness for the Entrails Animals series of stuffed animals and gives them out as gifts. Strangely enough, everyone to receive an Entrails Animal from her becomes a Kampfer\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound & Graphics:\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is very upbeat keeping with the entire all-girl cast. The music utilises artists such as Minami Kuribayashi and Megumi Nakajima in the OP and ED respectively. The seiyuu are all also all stars with voices like Nana Mizuki, Yui Horie and Yukari Tamura. The animation in itself uses bright colours again keeping with the feminine aspect and the characters all have their kawaii appearances and the transformation scenes (when shown remind you of the old time scenes from Sailor Moon).\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment & Replay Value:\\n\r\nReally one of the anime that I wait for with my fangirl squeal each week. I can\u2019t wait for the episodes to come out and when they do, I can\u2019t wait to watch them. There are times that I ask myself if this is an action anime because the action isn\u2019t so prominent but when fights come around, they please the audience. Also, since this revolves around mainly female characters, there is obviously a heavy dose of yuri here. Shoujo and yuri fans will be greatly entertained\\n\\n",

Kampfer has 12 episodes and 2 ovas. \r\nHere are the reasons for my 5 rating.\r\nCons - \r\nThe main character is just plain annoying with a really annoying voice. The fact that hes dumber than a box of rocks just frustrates me more.\r\nThe plot.....I think I'm still trying to find it. This was nothing but a poorly done fan service. Oh and if you want something with a conclusion this is not it.\r\nThe Animals made no sense to me. What was the point of the animals with the entrailshanging out? Was it to have some kind of creepy factor?\\n\\n\r\nPros -\\n\r\nI like the Pres and the childhood friend. They at least made the show bearable for me to watch.\\n\\n\r\nYa, that was all the pros sadly. I'd save time and avoid this one unless you got nothing better to watch and like fan service. I do like a bit of fan service and the sound was also ok so I gave it the 5 rating.",

            "content": "Opening Thoughts: Kampfer are girls with big breasts that fight against each other for no reason whatsoever, except that someone called \"The Moderators\" have chosen them to particpate in the fight between each which are relayed in messages by stuffed animals. A rather ridiculous concept isn't it? If you couldn't tell already, this is a ecchi/harem anime, that pretty much takes everything from the harem manual, with sterotypes of pretty much every kind of character you can think of.\r\nPlot: The plot isn't the strong side of the show, considering that the plot was pretty much nonexsistent until episode 9, and by then, everyone was justexpecting more random comical fanservice like in the previous 6 episodes. But I will tell you what little of the plot there is anyways, Big-breasted babes are chosen by the moderators to fight against each other in teams of red vs blue, with no alterior motive, later on the motive is revealed to be a continuation of a fight from a distant galaxy, which no one knows what started the war nor care, and to settle this they decided to continue the fight on earth, while under the watch of the moderators. But in my opinion is just an excuse for the main character, Natsuru to transform into a girl and perform other ecchi related content. The only other premise of the episodes are natsuru trying to win his crush, Sakura to fall head over heels for his boy side, but since she is obviously lesbian, that will never happen, while he also has 3 hot babes just waiting to fuck with him on his male side but is too stupid to notice. SPOILER ALERT: The final plot twist of the series (excuse me, the only one) is that his lesbian companion, Sakura is actually working for the moderators, and she wants Natsuru to join the moderators on his female side and kill the other supporting characters. The ending was a bit dissapointing, as no one died and the action was little to none. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The character development of Kampfer wasn't that fantastic, but all of the characters were absouletly comical and all of which participated in fanservice of some kind. The characters were very sterotypical harem anime characters, but It was quite amusing watching one of the supporting characters, Akane, missing every shot she fired with her pistol throughout the entire series, which brings me to the characters transformations into kampfers themselves, Akane, a nerdy shy girl with glasses, turns into a total bitch that threatens everyone around her with her pistol and most of the time scaring the living crap out of natsuru, other stereotypical characters include, Mikoto a childhood freind, and Shizuku, a hot student council president who happens to be in love with Natsuru. Another thing about shizuku is, when she transforms the only thing that change is that her inner hair gets white, very dissapointing but other than the actual character development itself, all of the characters throughout the show were dropdead funny, and is impossible not to laugh at them. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment Value: The entertainment level of kampfer is so good, it almost covers up all of the epically fail mistakes and nonexsitent plot within the show, the level of ecchi this show has is top notch, and pretty much is the only thing you are going to get, along with natsuru's ignorance to 3 sexy bitches trying to get with him and other comical gags within the show. If you like anime with deep intellectual conversation, millions of plot twists and an actual plot, this anime isnt for you. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation of Kampfer is superb, not having any animation errors in the show, all of the characters, backgrounds and ecchi are all drawn well. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was a bit unbelieveable at times (battle sound effects) but overall the voice actors were excellent and the music was fine aswell. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: While the anime itself was extremely amusing, some things just didn't make any sense whatsoever, such as characters slicing through fire, gender transformations and talking stuffed animals, it honestly made the anime very engrossing to watch, While this anime is far from perfect it deserves some props for being very entertaining, and bringing a high level of ecchi onto the table, making it a very good choice for any one who needs a good laugh, but for the lack of plot I sadly will have to take off some major points , but this is one heck of an anime. 7/10",

Basically, it's just full slice of life with stereotypical, bland characters and stupid as shit interactions. I have never seen worse characters ever. The story is there just to bait people, so they can show off what they can do with that R+ rating. Overall, if you're ecchi, fanservice, harem fan who likes protagonists that are stupid as fuck and constantly get pushed around, then this anime is for you, otherwise I don't recommend it. I could only bear it until episode 6-7 and stopped there, it'snot worth going through even if the second part is better.",

            "content": "This anime, although nicely drawn, lacks many aspects that pull the watcher into its world. The sudden start and end of the anime without development gives viewers the impression of trying to write an essay on a book that they are only allowed to read one page from.  It seem to me that the producers tried to fit in too many aspects in only 12 episodes and ended up achieving little.\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nThe story is the biggest letdown in the anime. Although it starts out with a good hook, it does not keep up with the expectations viewers have for it. The story revolves aroundNatsuru, a boy who fell in an almost worshipping love for Sakura Kaede. The story starts out with Natsuru waking up as a Kampfer, a girl (such classic Japanese ideas) wearing a blue bracelet, participating in battles against blue bracelet Kampfers for some unknown reason. Along the way, he makes friends and accidentally gets Sakura to fall in love with his female self. At the near end of the series, during a mere time span of 5 minutes, viewers are spurned with some distorted tale of why the Kampfers fight. To me, this reflects inadequate plot development and planning. The producers did not articulate the story and the elements that were introduced and left in the cold. In addition, the ending was so abrupt and pointless that when I asked myself \"What did I get from watching these 12 episodes?\", my obvious reply was \"Nothing.\" The story incorporates an action part that is sporadically displayed and abruptly ended, making me think that the producers probably ran out of money to continue.\\n\r\nThe very last episode certainly left me and probably will leave you wondering \"wtf just happened?\" \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10)\\n\r\nThe second biggest letdown is the characters. Although some people like the humorous characters that exhibit a hint of stupidity for comical effects, Natsuru transcends those expectations past the boundary of enjoyment. He is so incredibly dense and intellectually impaired that I could not help facepalming throughout the story. Not only does everyone play him for sucker, he is willing to do almost anything for Sakura out of pure infatuation. Futhermore, all of the other characters also constantly have times where better decisions could have been made. An avid viewer would continually say \"Why didn't they do that? It would have avoided ___\" throughout the entire story. Although the unpredictable plot is fitting for comedy animes, it does not fit well into the atmosphere of Kampfer. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe best thing about Kampfer is its art. The characters are drawn very beautifully and very anime-like. In addition, the contrast between art of the same characters at different stages of the story caught my attention and induced me to learn from the art style.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kampfer is a mediocre display of anime. The great art was what kept me watching, certainly not the plot. In the series, many aspects of school life, love, and are embedded in these 12 episodes. This is also the reason why this anime is not as widely acclaimed as it could have been. Should the producers instead fit that in 24 episodes, Kampfer certainly could have been a better anime. If you're someone who just enjoys an anime with some lol, love, humor,action and has no exceptional emphasis on the presence of a developed plot, this anime might not be bad for you. However, if you're someone who only watches anime with a story and intricate characters, your time could be better spent elsewhere.",

            "content": "THE LOWDOWN:\r\nLesbian Anime Highlander is... just kidding. Kampfer is no Highlander. Being disappointed is not an accurate enough description to describe my thoughts for Kampfer, a show that might actually have some promise story-wise, if properly delivered. The story has roughly 10 minutes of airtime in the total 12 episodes. Nobody really fights anything for long, and nothing happens. There is never only One, and there is no facemelter.\r\nIt might be possible to use the characters in a slice-of-life comedy, though. It should be considered.\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\nThe art. The style looks great, and is well animated... and I'm not necessarily talking ecchi. Weapons, when actually involved,are well-designed and portrayed. Locales are well-represented. And the in-show soundtrack is pretty cool, but I'm not particularly fond of either the OP or ED, which is generally surprising.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\nEven the smart characters are generally oblivious to everything in existence, and it's horribly stupid and kind of insulting. I would, honestly, be a bit suspicious of a talking doll, no matter how cute its intestines are, or which popular VA voiced it.\\n\\n\r\nTHE UGLY:\\n\r\nThe story. It kind of ends abruptly as if they ran out of ideas or money, though obviously it's waiting for Season 2. Cue Poochie going back to space.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER CHOICES:\\n\r\nKampfer gives you lots of females in bikinis to make note of, but only one regularly-seen male, who isn't always a male, and is a big idiot. Sorry, female fans.\\n\r\nI don't think there's a single one in the show that won't sway to vaginas, so it keeps it open for fans who don't like closures of any kind. The maturity of Shizuku, the immaturity (in both forms) of Akane, or the zaniness of Mikoto should at least appeal to one person. Sakura has no real character design because you're not supposed to like her, but rather see her as an obnoxious obstacle.\\n\r\nMy top character choice is Shizuku. Sexy maturity, is capable of doing stuff, and is pretty smart. Additionally, she kisses like a prostar.\\n\r\nIf not Shizuku, Akane is fun. She's cute and smart, then turns into a massive badass with a terrible case of potty-mouth, and the aim of a Stormtrooper.\\n\r\nAnother favorite of mine is the lesser-seen Masumi, because she's got a cute screw loose. But she basically has no role in the show beyond winking hearts everywhere.",

            "content": "(edited 9/24/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another of Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always I assume you have read the synopsis and don't need me to detail what is going on in a general sense with this anime. I'm also sure you've seen the 'overall' number, and are just dying for me to elaborate. Well lets get to it! I came into this anime with very high hopes, as I'm a fan of 'magical girl' type shows, action anime and romances. In fact there isn't much I don't enjoy when done right. Sad to say, Kampfer left me feeling flat andirritated. Pretty obvious Kampfer isn't going to make the incredibly RTLR wall, also there's a note to be had about the manga. Many people who have read it say that the story isn't as atrocious as the anime. Perhaps so, but as a non-reader, I have to judge the show purely for what is presented in the anime. Let's get to why this show left me so unfilled. \\n\\n\r\n*POSSIBLE SPOILERS even though I try to keep them to a minimum*\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nI love a zany premise as much as anyone, and was hopeful at the idea of a boy that becomes a girl. I mean, how can that NOT lead to all kinds of awesome moments? Well it immediately begins to come apart with the 'female' version's choice of name. I understand being put on the spot, but that was beyond ridiculous. Moving to the main thrust of the story, we have the proxy war supposedly being fought between these galactic powers, but we are never told why these two supposedly superpowers decided that the proxy war between human Kampfers would even matter. We are never even introduced to anyone from these warring states, if you don't assume the possessed dolls are from them, which there is no reason to make that assumption. We are told that the Red Kampfers are the mortal enemies of the Blue Kampfers (of which our main guy/girl is a reluctant member) but yet other than a couple of intro fights with no clear winners, we have no battling between the groups at all. Another Kampfer color appears as a villain set later, and they are never explained at ALL. Are they from either the Red or Blue empires? Are they a new player in the Empire war? I believe the manga gets into who the new coalition of Kampfers are, but that information is basically omitted from the anime. Why are this new faction controlled by a character who is not a traditional Kampfer as she has no bracelet which until that point of the story means she should not be aware of the Kampfer world whatsoever. The story never explains who she is, why she is evil, and what her dastardly plan really is. It's not even explained who she's representing. It is a plot twist purely for the twist sake, and is groan inducing when it hits.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI LOVED the art in Kampfer, the attention to detail and really nice execution. When the characters do a 'magical girl' transformation scene (which only happens a few times, frustratingly) it is done remarkably well, and looks very good. The quality art just makes the failures even more saddening. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI liked the sound. The battles sounded properly, the voice of the guy/girl sounded appropriate to me in each gender, and the foul mouthed Kampfer was a welcome comedic relief with her angry curse-riddled shouting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nHere we fall on our face. Our boy/girl and his/her unfortunate mistake of naming his female self leads less to shenanigans and more into wondering if everyone in the show are idiots. Also no one seems to question why the new girl just shows up, begins attending class, and living a normal life without one teacher/admin asking her who she is and where she comes from. On the opposite hand, the longer the show goes on, the more time she spends in female form, and no one seems one bit concerned their male friend has apparently disappeared. Sure maybe he didn't have many guy friends, but someone just up and disappearing garners attention, liked or not. The lead red Kampfer also happens to be the student council president (aren't they always?) and instead of busting up the new boy/girl blue Kampfer, she basically falls in love with him/her. The other red follows suit. The other blue also falls a bit, as is expected as the main character is supposed to be her Kampfer partner. We also have weird possessed dolls that serve no purpose at all it would seem, except for mentioning Moderators once or twice, who are of course not explained in any form whatsoever in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nWe have a show starting with the promise of the awkwardness of gender swapping combined with rocking action fights. We get basically none of this. The main seems almost immediately comfortable in his female form, and the tired old trope of 'where's the boy' leading to him running and swapping genders, then being asked where the girl is and running back again is trotted out as a 'comedy' bit. We've been seeing that kind of thing forever and a day, in Hollywood, anime, tv, and just about everything else. Shoot, Superman's favorite shtick is Clark Kent always missing on out Superman. A few battles happen, but ultimately our gender bending ass kicker anime devolves into to a lesbian harem with confusing convenient villains who are convenient. The magical girl style animations which would fit so well are barely used, and the ending left me stretching my head wondering exactly what I had just seen, and why the story ended in such an unfulfilling way. \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, no matter how cool Kampfer looks, the last half of the series seems like the writers ran out of ideas and started slinging everything they could at the wall hoping something would stick. Nothing did, including any pictures on the RTLR wall. Pass, trust me.",

            "content": "Hello everybody, this is my review for Kampfer! This is my first review, so please be considerate!\r\nKampfer is an anime based on the main protagonist, Natsuru Senou.Natsuru wakes up as a Kampfer, which are girls that have special abilities that are made to fight other Kampfers, depending on the color of their bracelets.He is in love with Sakura Kaede, but she has barely even noticed him.  Natsuru turns into a girl randomly and is attack by another Kampfer, Akane. Natsuru saves Sakura from Akane, and Sakura falls in love with the girl Natsuru. The story really turns when Natsuru realizes that he is gonnabe on the same team as Akane. But, when he goes to school, he gets attacked by Shizuku. Shizuku is a red Kampfer, but they make a truce and try to reveal the people pulling the strings, the Moderators.\\n\r\nAlright, now after that brief summary, The story now!\\n\r\n=====================Story========================\\n\r\nFor the story, I'd give it a 7. The anime is really interesting if you are into the whole ecchi/harem thing. But, it lacks in a lot of ways. The main story is supposed to be based on the Kampfer and how they have to fight each other, but really the action that the anime seems to entail lacks alot. The anime really falls off later, becoming more focused on the romance aspects instead of the fighting aspects. But, the story  makes that up well with good art, characters, and sound. The ending was decent I guess, definitely not anything heart warming or moving. The last episode however, was almost like a bonus episode. It seemed like it should've been an OVA, and had no place really being an official episode and to me who was really excited at the idea of another episode, it let me down. \\n\r\n=====================Art=======================\\n\r\nFor the art in Kampfer, it's really well done. The art really holds a nice balance with the style of the anime, and personally as an art snob I have to say it met the requirements it takes for me to enjoy an anime. The art flowed well with the action of the anime.\\n\r\n======================Sound=====================\\n\r\nI believe the voice actors really nailed it on this one. All except, Natsuru's. Natsuru's voice actor sounds like a really whinny  boy, while his girl sounded fine. I really disliked that fact, because Natsuru really seemed way to young to me for the situation, but maybe that's just me. The rest was fine though.\\n\r\n==================Character======================\\n\r\nCharacters now! For the characters, I enjoyed all of them pretty evenly! I really can't complain, asides Sakura who really segwayed mysteriously throughout the anime. Again though, the main hit to me is Natsuru. Of course, in these animes it requires the protagonists to be the densest person in the world. But, Natsuru was so focused on one girl the entire anime, it really drew away from everything else. I personally loved Shizuku the most, her snarky personality, mysteriousness, power, elegance, everything about her was perfect. But since it's a harem, the main protagonist of course is the biggest idiot in town and then someone who's perfect like her ends up falling for him.\\n\r\n================Enjoyment!=======================\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, although the negative reviews really didn't give it much credit. The anime supplied tons of humor in multiple ways, along with keeping the main aspect of the Kampfers almost as a side plot. Which to me was alright, but I really wish they would've went into it more\\n\r\n================Overall==========================\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give this an 8. The enjoyment, art, and characters were wonderful, but the story took alot away from that. The story really didn't focus on the Kampfers, and it kind of destroyed alot for the series. Though, good is to be said for the anime because it really pulled through with the romance and comedy. This anime was really made for people who only enjoy these kind of things though, there really isn't much action involved, so it's better if you preffer harems such as these over that. I really hope this gets a season 2, because if it does, the action is gonna be amazing and everything can come together to finally make sense! :D",

Well unique as a focus, It's only really a lightly touched point in the pile of things parodied in Twintails. \r\nBasically, Your regular, underachieving (I'm amazed how they made THAT seem normal), male MC has a nightmare where he is transformed into a girl, and wakes to find the bracelet from his dream on his wrist, with no method of removal. (Again, Someone in these two shows is referencing the other...) Sure enough, the braceletglows and his gender is switched in a Mahou Shojou-style transformation animation.\\n\\n\r\nPity that their explanation for WHY this is happening, and the details and reason behind the death game, really sucks. Seriously, as soon as they start explaining it, switch off until the comedy or fight scenes come back, because THOSE are where this anime shines. Fortunately, though rather heavy on the ecchi at times (What were you expecting) the jokes are normally really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime only trips twice, and by that i mean a normal stumble in the middle and the inclusion of a twelfth episode comprised of absolutely none of what makes this anime good. Unless you share the main antagonist's weird love of the entrails animals, that is.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want deep, meaningful ANYTHING, stay away. If you want a bit of fun that'll inspire a disturbingly strong curiosity in you, then you're in for a treat.",

But when you go deeper the anime somewhat gets serious: AKA plot twists. Most of the time though I just think for the most part it's just plain hilarious and you can never get enough. 9 because this anime is very hilarious and I am a pervert but sometimes it just goes wee bit overboard.\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nWho wouldn't give this one a ten? I really think that the way they drew really made the characters HOT and the way they draw them REALLY fits the persona of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAs far as the OP and END themes are ok on the side but I don't really like them I just think theyre OK.

I started watching it because of another gender bender anime and I thought it would be insanely \r\nterrible. But it was a show worth continuing and watching.\r\nStory:8 \r\nI think the storyline was great! At the beginning of the show anyways. As the series was coming to an end, I was like \"oh my gosh, I am honestly so excited to see what happens next\" But they didn't really close the show/story, in my opinion. They pretty much wasteda great storyline. The worst part is, there isn't even a season 2!\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful because it had that new, clean anime look to it that most anime don't have.\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nI was kind of sad that this anime didn't have a dub, just the subs.

I love sexual humor, and these scenes did not disappoint, although this is to be expected in a harem anime. Isit harem or shoujo ai? Or both?\\n\\n\r\nArt style is fresh and clear so no complaints there. Character development is basically non-existent. Nothing stood out for me in terms of soundtrack it was a basic generic soundtrack, but I will not fault an anime for a below-average soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story line, I found it slow and anti-climatic. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a good, all-rounder anime, this is not one I recommend.

Ranma was great and its animation, setting and general demeanour is a bit dated now.\r\nK\u00e4mpfer means Gladiator in German and the entire reason for the boy/girl transformation is based around this however so far this \u2019main plot\u2019 element seems to very much be taking a backseat to what would normally be the sub-plot of the relationships between the characters.\r\nMaybe this will actually come into play at alater date but meh, its fun enough as things are.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of non-stop innuendo and general jokes of a sexual nature without actually going out there and being blatantly sexual. The fan service at the half time break is a bit pathetic but watching the programme as a whole...its almost like its mocking the genre. Probally not intentionally but there you go.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not a serious thing to sit down and watch and get all deep about.

            "content": "Th-This is a parody right?...LA isn't the only one that think this right?...ok.\r\nKampfer or Fighter in English for LA really feels like (and LA hopes LA isn't the only one) is a parody of the typical dense main protagonist with a \"battle\" harem with all the cliches it goes with it (LA just hopes nobody takes Kampfer seriously, otherwise, your watching it for the wrong reasons), the catch?...the main male protagonist Natsuru Senou voiced by Marina Inoue and Marina Inoue is forced to change at will to a girl and has to fight and we have no idea why there fighting...\"yay\" , harem lesbianhijinks ensues.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the characters, well Natsuru is as LA said above your typical dense as a brick main male protagonist who has the hots for Kaede Sakura voiced by Megumi Nakajima, however she likes the \"female\" side of Natsuru more and the male Natsuru is completely oblivious to the other girls in his harems affections...again typical, but it's where his female side things start to get weird as his harem still wants that crotch in girl form as well and Natsuru being Natsuru is STILL completely oblivious to the blatant flirting that this harem wants him..her...whatever. The one benefit Natsuru has outside the typical main male protagonist is his female side, if not Natsuru (both) could easily rank up there with Ichika Orimura from Infinite Stratos as one of the densest main male protagonist and that is saying something. So what about the harem members?...well we got Kaede the \"main love interest\" for Natsuru, she's your typical \"perfect girl\" with a really weird hobby of collecting Entrail Animal plushies and is completely obsessed with the female Natsuru, but she gets a bit more to the plot, not as a typical love interest but something a bit more atypical shown in a typical harem anime. Akane Mishima voiced by Yui Horie, is your typical shy girl (being a librarian further encases her as this), but misunderstands things said to her in a more sexual ways at times, but her Kampfer side is the complete opposite with her being more brash, vindictive and more gun crazy, Akane's Kampfer form was LA's favourite character as Akane's normal form of her shy girl doesn't exactly suit LA. Shizuku Sangou voiced by Kaori Nazuka, the stoic student council president comes in a close second (nearly first...her teasing does cross the line sometimes) for LA in terms of characters as she gets the most development and relationship boost to her and even though her Kampfer side really doesn't change much of her in terms of personality and appearance, her \"presence\" in the \"plot\" does move the plot forward for her own and as a side effect Natsuru's benefit as to her questions as to why they are fighting in the first place and by all means Shizuku was probably the only semblance of sense throughout the plot as much a tease she was. Finally rounding up our harem is the childhood friend Mikoto Kondou voiced by Kana Asumi and really she's your typical childhood friend archetype with all the problems that go along with her, sure her quirk is that she rather \"physical\" with Natsuru and loves curry, but for LA, she came rather late as LA was already vying (either) Natsuru to be with either with Akane or Shizuku by this point. It's also obvious that aside from Kaede, all the other members go BOTH ways for Natsuru. Aside from the main harem casts, there are the talking Entrail Animals who are sorta proxy audience surrogate spectator characters as they are most of them are \"meta\" mainly with their own characters seiyuu's, likes the crack jokes at Natsuru's expense (and denseness) and really their presences further solidifies Kampfer as a parody and at the same time how useless the Entrails Animal were throughout the plot. LA's favourtie plushy?...Seppuku Kuro Usagi voiced by Yukari Tamura because Yukari Tamura.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kaede Sakura, well she's got some secrets of her own by the final episodes of the anime and the anime CLEARLY and BLATANTLY gives hints to this if your weren't paying attention and really, seeing this, LA actually kinda liked it, sure it digs the \"serious tone\" and even though  it's more of a tonal whiplash considering all the lesbian harem antics Kampfer gave us in-between all the fighting, but seeing the \"bare-boned plot\" go into \"trying to be playfully serious\" is actually kinda refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nYes...there is MULTIPLE times fanservice occurs in this anime, this anime doesn't have \"ecchi\" and \"shoujo ai\" in it's genre pool for no reason and yes, for you yuri fans out there (me included), lavish the fanservice and then be remind constantly that he's a he, but for LA the TRUE fanservice comes in Shizuku x Akane and it's hinted at multiple times in the anime as well albeit teasing on Shizuku's part, misunderstood in Akane's part. Aside from that, yeah expect the girls to be in skimpy outfits and boob-touching for fanservice. Nonetheless the fanservice is either typically overblown and cliche, or yuri as hell.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Nomad, the animation is essentially decent throughout but nothing too much to say about, the character designs are candy-colored as ever and the battles are half-way decent for as much \"fighting\" they do. The animation isn't lackluster due to it's backgrounding as it's color palette on the characters and *ahem* fanservice helps the animation to be at \"least\" decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, due to the Kampfer forms, essentially the majority of the cast have dual roles (Shizuku's Kampfer being an exception as her tone doesn't change like Akane or Mikoto does) but having the same voice actor, because of this, this voice cast is AMAZING, sure it's typical of Marina Inoue to voice young boys and Natsuru is no exception, but for LA's favourite voice actor it goes easily to Yui Horie because of Akane's two extreme spectrums of shy girl to boisterous \"shoot now\" personality became an easy win to Yui Horie. The only other surprise to LA was Megumi Nakajima as Kaede.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, well for one the REAL ending is at episode 11, not 12, that episode is a non sequitur, the ending really didn't tell much about why the Kampfers are fighting as well as the \"major villain's plans\" and the ending ultimately was just left there on a typical \"harem ending\" and LA by the end of it was left with MORE questions than answers with this ending and as atypical the \"major villain is\", the presences that left with the ending left just the same as how the major villains retreated by the end of it. Just...\"is that it?!?!?!?!?!?\"...so yeah LA was more confused than angry at this baffling ending of Kampfer and that final episode (12) didn't help much either.\\n\\n\r\n*Note - LA finished watching \"f\u00fcr die Liebe\" special episodes and not even those episodes helped as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what Kampfer tries but doesn't care to do is CONTEXT, we do get some semblance of a major villain and harem hijinks and \"relationship points\" but if you question ANYTHING outside the little bit of plot it has like WHY they are still fighting with each other even after they realize why, why the major villain's plans leads to especially with Natsuru, what's up with Kaede?, what's up with the Entrail Animals giving girls power to turn them into Kampfers like a backstory to them, anything?, who's best girl *cough* Shizuku *cough*, Kampfer really doesn't care to explain to you leading to either being annoying or \"look at the yuri ecchi we're throwing at you\"...it sorta works but still, it's blatantly obvious Kampfer is more a fight now, explain never in terms of explaining things about the Kampfer (what little we DO get to know). Take this statement like you will but consider that Kampfer is a parody what with it's premise, meta-jokes and character-seiyuu awareness to the typical harem genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear be it with Kampfer's obvious flaws and oddly done strengths, that LA had fun with this anime, what with LA seeing Kampfer as a pure genuine parody of the harem genre, the yuri overtones were nothing but a bonus to LA!. Nonetheless Kampfer maybe an odd sit to some people and LA does know the uncanny valley effect this anime has right down to the get go and people might be put off with it's \"bare-boned plot, all yuri hijinks\", but as LA watched this purely with LA's brain off \"most of the time\", it was VERY funny to watch seeing this yuri harem hijinks crazy over the dense Natsuru while not caring about the entire reasoning as to why Kampfer fights just \"because\", just screams it's a parody and NOT to be taken seriously. Fuck it, call it a guilty pleasure for LA (and LA might as well), but LA damn well enjoyed Kampfer for the wrong reasons while still knowing it's blatant flaws and LA is fine with that...\\n\\n\r\nThough the countless amount of times female Natsuru gets \"exploited\" from MULTIPLE different characters is rather cringy at best and is meant to be taken as comedic relief doesn't help that...",

            "content": "Kampfer is one of those anime you go into expecting it to be stupid. Now that might not be a bad thing, especially not for me. There is something entertaining about watching something that takes a bizarre premise and just rolling with it. However Kampfer fails to fulfill that and ends up being unfunny and legitimately frustrating to watch.  \r\n      Kampfer follows out protagonist Natsuru who has been transformed into Kampfer, a female warrior granted supernatural powers by a stuffed doll. Kampfers are split into two groups blue andred. The two groups must fight each other for some mysterious reason. The first problem I have with this anime is how it thrusts you straight into the plot. Kampfer doesn't set up its world at all nor does it give you time to digest any of the plot. It just skips all the important plot details and goes straight into the action. In the first episode alone I had plenty of questions like: Why do Kampfer exist? Why are they fighting? Why does the main character get chosen to become a Kampfer? Nothing about the nature of Kampfers is explained until much later on and even then its still vague. It wouldn't be so much of a problem, however the most integral plot points all deal with the nature of Kampfers and their reasons for existing. The villains are representative of this problem as they lack any real motivation in this plot because they are so intertwined with restoring the status quo of Kampfers for some great beings that are never properly explained. They don't feel like an actual threat because I have no idea what their stake is in this universe and why they are such a threat. The story tries to be play it off by being mysterious and vaguely philosophical and it doesn't work because you will be too confused to even ponder the reason why any of this is going on. It even tries to throw in a couple plot twists, but they don't work either because they simply just come out of nowhere and it ends up being an excuse to show more girls fighting with each other. The plot takes a backseat for most of the anime so all of this just comes out of nowhere and feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\n     To be fair, I could tell that Kampfer wasn't supposed to be about the plot, but rather the humor of a man who can transform into a girl and how every female near them seems to instantly fall in love with his female form. However this fails to be funny. Most of the humor ends up being forced. Much like the plot, the humor lacks any set up and skips straight to the punchline. Most of the awkward situations that Natsuru is put in(such as buying a bra or wearing a bikini)end up happening because one of the girls in his harem decided to drag them around just because. They were often contrived excuses for jokes and fanservice which lacked any reason to exist. Another fault with this show's humor is its dialogue between characters. Often the interactions between Natsuru and their harem boiled down to Natsuru saying something that could be interpreted as sexual and then that character acting like that they're asking to have sex with them. This was unfunny and it gets old really quickly. \\n\\n\r\n     The characters themselves are also terrible. The main character is your bog standard extremely dense harem protagonist with no personality. It was really frustrating watching all the girls swoon over Natsuru and seeing how Natsuru was absolutely clueless about why these girls were making all these sexual advances. His female form doesn't save his personality either. Even when he's a girl Natsuru only gains a few new personality traits, mostly acting a bit more awkward than usual, but she acts mostly the same. In fact all the girls, with the exception of one, treat Natsuru the exact same way no matter what form they're in. It ends up being a missed opportunity to create a humorous contrast between how people react to him in guy form and how they react in her girl form. Kampfer really fails to hold up the comedic aspect of its premise. Throughout the entire anime Natsuru even progressively transforms less and less and it ends up losing any of its charm because of it.  \\n\\n\r\n    The other characters aren't any better. Most of the characters are your standard harem cliches, such as the kuudere, dandere, etc, who lack any nuance to their characters at all. They were pretty boring to watch as most of their screen time is dedicated to fighting over Natsuru. None of the characters are compelling and they all just seem to like Natsuru for no real reason at all. I can't even say that they like them for being a nice person because they all fall in love with them at first sight. Its really hard to care or even like most of Natsuru's harem because they are mostly just there for the sake of fanservice, which this anime has a lot of. I don't mind excessive fanservice personally, but I could tell that this anime shoved it in for the sake of having it as a way to keep the viewer engaged, and it doesn't work. \\n\\n\r\n      There is one minor exception in all these characters and that's Sakura. While she still likes Natsuru for no good reason, unlike the rest of the cast who could love Natsuru despite what form they are in Sakura is only infatuated with the female side. She ends up having a few funny interactions between the two forms of Natsuru, mostly relying on the contrast of her attitudes between male and female Natsuru. She could've fulfilled the promise of creating the joke of an awkaward yuri romance between a purehearted lesbian and man stuck in a girl's body. She could've saved this anime, but Kampfer always did things to make her seem less appealing compared to the other girls, and actively push her away from Natsuru. \\n\\n\r\n      The animation is also quite bad. A lot of the time the characters movement looked jerky and awkward. Most of the fight scenes were also disappointing as most of them were just one of the girls swinging or firing their weapons a couple times and the fight was usually over. The character designs looked pretty average and I didn't find any of them particularly attractive. The music in Kampfer was surprisingly decent and I kinda liked the OP and ED, but its nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\n    Needless to say I thought Kampfer was a train wreck of an anime that didn't fulfill the promise of its premise nor did it make me think about the plot or its characters. I actually might've enjoyed Kampfer if it was so aggressively terrible or even if it had more yuri in it, but it just became another bog standard ecchi harem series.           \\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading! \\n\\n\r\nMy Ratings\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nArt 4/10\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nOverall 3/10",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS- read at your own risk]\r\nK\u00e4mpfer\u2026 oh boy\u2026 I had really low expectations to start with, but it still managed to be extremely underwhelming experience in the end. \r\nMostly because the last episode (12th) was just a weird filler\u2026  and the story (if you can even call it \u201dstory\u201d) had no conclusion at all. I fully expected that most of those questions every viewer has after the first episode will not be answered, but I didn\u2019t expect that they add more questions in the last episodes and then left them unanswered as well, leaving nothing but feelings of bewilderment and frustration.\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nNatsuru Sejou is a male high school student that suddenly gains ability to transform into a girl and become K\u00e4mpfer, female fighter, sort of magical girl. Information about his new powers is provided by creepy talking plush doll harakiri Tiger (which really looks like a sort of cutesy version of tiger that has performed seppuku). Tiger is one of the messengers of mysterious moderators who have selected Natsuru to be K\u00e4mpfer, and since K\u00e4mpfers for some reason need to be female(for reasons only moderators know) so does Natsuru change gender when his powers are activated. All K\u00e4mpfers have a messenger that is talking and moving creepy plush doll that depicts some dead animal with guts hanging from their stomach(even though they are each died in a different manner, some stabbed, some hanged, some burnt alive), sick humour but I kinda liked the absurdity of these plush dolls, the Entrails Animals as their franchise is called. What they have to do with K\u00e4mpfers though\u2026 only moderators know. They all have rather famour Seiyuus voicing them and they joke about that quite a lot.  Anyways back to main K\u00e4mpfer, Natsuru has a blue ring in his/her wrist to symbolize that he is part of the blue K\u00e4mpfers who fight against the red K\u00e4mpfers, for reasons only moderators know. Natsuru has the power of magic or Zauber, other types of K\u00e4mpfers are Schwert(Sword) and Gewehr(firearms), and as everything related to k\u00e4mpfers they are in German for reasons only moderators know\u2026  \\n\\n\r\nOkay you are seeing a pattern here, Moderators know everything, but as you can probably guess nothing is ever answered. Despite that obvious senselessness premise is actually pretty good IMHO. I wholeheartedly expected that this show has a simple and stupid plot that doesn\u2019t develop and is just an excuse to show cute girls fighting each other a lot with magical abilities. This expectation was totally wrong. Plot surely is stupid though, but they actually try to develop it during the last episodes and it only gets worse from there\u2026. and fighting, this show is named K\u00e4mpfer yet there is very very little fighting. It\u2019s almost non-existent. Most of the time protagonist doesn\u2019t even fight back, yet in the end he/she is suddenly the best fighter for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThis is the main reason to watch this show, it looks good. Girls (including Natsuru) are cute and have a nice figure, animation is rather smooth and transformations are cool. Fights are rare but look pretty nice as well. There is a lot of fanservice and that\u2019s mainly very good, especially yuri-scenes. If that\u2019s your thing and you don\u2019t care about fights, chaarcter development, romance or actual plot, there is this \u201dplot\u201d pretty much. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nVoice acting is overall very good. Entrails animals especially are well acted. Music is nothing especially memorable though, but works well enough. It looks good and sounds pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nThis is the weak point. Especially Natsuru Senou, he/she is a very weak even for a protagonist character. Not in terms of fighting, but as being memorable or meaningful. This is usual problem in harem/ecchi comedies. Protagonist is extremely dense and stupid, usually pretty weak and pathetic too, but he still gets all the girls. This was sort of expected, but even for a harem protagonist Natsuru is one-dimensional. He(she) has no hobbies, no personality, no family and no interests besides the girl he is infatuated with: Sakura Kaede. \\n\r\nSakura appears to be friendly and cute, school idol beauty. She is not interested at all in Natsuru when he is guy, but falls in love with female Natsuru. Later it\u2019s revealed she is some sort of evil manipulator, not k\u00e4mpfer, but she has something to do with moderators and she has a harem of girl lovers that are also white k\u00e4mpfers that punish rebellious k\u00e4mpfers or something. Her motivation is completely mystery to me however, she seems to be lesbian, apparently hates men, but wants Natsuru as female, still she manipulates male Natsuru to have sex with Shizuku, for some reason, even though that fails\u2026 later she wants that Natsuru kills his/her k\u00e4mpfer friends\u2026. I don\u2019t get it at all what she wants. That entire Sakura-thing was such a stupid plot twist IMO. And despite all this Natsuru in the end has eyes only for Sakura\u2026. how can someone be that dense\u2026.. \\n\r\nThere are two characters I kinda cared about, Akane Mishima and Shizuku Sangou. Akane is shy meganekko with somewhat dirty imagination and she accidentally says ambiguous sexual things and gets flustered by her own words. When Akane turns into K\u00e4mpfer her personality changes (for reasons moderators would possibly know) as well as her looks, she has no more  glasses and her hair turns from orange to bright red. She becomes aggressive and swears a lot when shooting with her pistol. She is Gewehr-type K\u00e4mpfer in blue team like Natsuru. Shizuku is beautiful and smart student council president, but appears to be rather cold, calculating and bossy. Shizuku is in red team but refuses to fight and is interested in what moderators are up to. Her appearance changes only little with her hair shining a bit, she is Schwert-type k\u00e4mpfer.\\n\r\nThird (or fourth if you count Natsuru as girl)K\u00e4mpfer girl is Natsuru\u2019s tomboyish childhood friend Mikoto Kondou, who has travelled a lot and loves to make curry to Natsuru. She was sort of irritating to be honest. She is typical overly energetic character and of course in love with Natsuru as well. Her appearance changes, but her personality remains almost same when she turns into Schwert-type k\u00e4mpfer. When show starts she travels around the world and sends postcards to Natsuru, that was kind of fun recurring theme, but when she returns home and becomes k\u00e4mpfer she is often just plain irritating extra character that show didn\u2019t even really need IMO. She has some\u2026 interesting moments with Akane though\u2026. \\n\r\nThen there is harem of evil lesbians, white k\u00e4mpfers, who seem to be all sort of archetypes, loli, sadist, tsundere etc. but these baddies are poor fighters so they don\u2019t serve any purpose really\u2026. they just are there with Sakura-sama. Useless characters without any purpose really. \\n\r\nMale Natsuru has some male friend who likes to take photos of hotties (including female Natsuru) but that\u2019s pretty much it what comes to human characters. Then there are Entrails animals, Harakiri Tiger, Black Seppuku Bunny, Electrocuted Wildcat, Strangled Stray Dog and Burnt alive Lion, who are messengers of K\u00e4mpfers for some reason. They do all sort of weird things, talk, eat and drink and move but are still not really alive apparently\u2026. They are crazy concept but kind of fun self-assertive craziness. In episode 12, which is Christmas special they steal k\u00e4mpfer\u2019s bodies turning them into Kemonomimi girls and go to have fun in the town while k\u00e4mpfers are trapped in their plush doll bodies. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nFirst episodes were enjoyable but \u201dending\u201d was so bad it kinda ruined the mood. Episode 12 was a fine filler on it\u2019s own and made no sense at all, but for all those who didn\u2019t understand that episode 11 is the end of it, ep 12 came as unexpected surprise that feels like cruel joke to all those who expected some sort of conclusion or explanation what the hell actually happened in the entire show. Only moderators know and yes we never get to meet them, I guess\u2026. unless Sakura is moderator which I think she is not, but since nothing is never explained I don\u2019t know\u2026. and I don\u2019t care.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIdea was nice and non-sensical, but there were too little fighting and no character-development at all. It was all fan-service and ecchi comedy. Still there was very little comedy about the gender swapping in the end. Despite awesome opportunity with actually physically gender swapping protagonist, they pretty much fail to use his/her ability to do any actually funny scenes with it. \\n",

            "content": "*This review does not contain spoilers*\r\nWhen I first started K\u00e4mpfer I hadn't got the slightest idea as to what it would be about. So after the first episode I was a bit surprised. K\u00e4mpfer is an ecchi shoujo-ai/comedy/action anime, and because I had never seen an other ecchi series before, I just had to get used to it a bit. Right from the start of this anime I was slightly puzzled because you don't know why things are the way they are. It is just a fact, no explanation. At the 11th episode there is some sort of conclusion as to why things are happening,but still, the storyline is a bit vague. The art is really outstanding. I love the way it is drawn, very detailed; really a pleasure for the eye ^^. The characters were good. Most of them though have flat personalities, but some of the characters' personalities change in ways you would not expect. As I already said, there is definitely some humour in this anime. Not a lot but just enough to make it a bit more enjoyable. Overall I first wanted to give it a 9, but I didn't. Why? Because the last two episodes were a bit disappointing. The forelast episode is actually the last episode, because the story is \"concluded\" there. And what annoyed me was that at the most exciting moment in the story, where the music should have been exciting fighting music, the music was some sort of weird German happy childish song. That really spoiled the moment for me. And the last episode in fact does not make sense at all. You'd expect the story to be brought to a nice, sense-making end there, but in fact that episode does not add anything to the story at all. But still overall I looked forward to every episode, even though the last two episodes were a bit of a shame.",

Now think did you ever think of becoming a Female when you are a boy it would be cool right ? well it doesn't seem so to our Natsuru who has this opportunity because he was forced into it... and on top of that he has to fight ? right think how much of struglehe should have but that is not a problem when he has such beautiful girls around well ofcourse they make some trouble but oh well they are girls :) and he is a boy despite that he can change into a girl Well we also got these kind of annoying stupid toys but you rather watch for yourselves. Story is full of action , romance and other things that you can't see in one anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art at some point is gloomy but on other hand has its own good points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Huh development is beyond everything at some point we got girl+girl then all of a sudden we get boy+girl ... :D it changes all the time so i can't really describe it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ye i loved it because of all the confusion and teasing of Natsuru ... :D all the comedy aspects were nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: well if you love confusion and have time this anime is for you :)",

            "content": "In all honesty, when i first started watching this, I didnt think it would be that great. Kampfer is based of the light novel series by Toshihiko Tsukiji and revolves around the protagonist Seno Natsuru. One night he is turned into a girl and told that he is forced to fight as a Kampfer.After reading the description myself, I was skeptical, but decided I would try it anyways.  I knew I would be entertained by this anime for a while but besides that I wasnt expecting much. I was very much surprised when I found I had become hooked to the series. And itsnot because this series is extremely original or innovative. Instead, Kampfer keeps up a great sense of humour (although lewd at times I was always laughing) as well as a story which seems to get deeper and deeper the more you watch it. I wasnt convinced at the starting the story would be much but as we are getting into some of the later episodes it seems to be getting stronger. As for the characters, they really are by the books, the shy glasses, the strong willed student council and the eccentric childhood friend, but the characters themselves seem to be growing and evolving giving them another layer which is a nice addition. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is well done for this anime and I particularly like the sound that they used, its up beat when it needs to be and soft when needed. I do recommend this to anyone who likes these types of animes, it is definitely a cut above the rest. I give this a solid 9.",

            "content": "I have never watched an anime before, except pokemon, im always that person that tries to fit in, except I have only watched two or three episodes of Pokemon...\r\nAnyway, back to Kampfer. The story is unique and I kind of enjoyed it. The first episode was a nice way to introduce some of the characters, like Natsuru, Akane, and Shizuku. Let me tell you, I hate Akane when she becomes bitchy with Natsuru, I guess that means I kind of got immersive with the anime at some points. Every episode links but it slowly dies away from the plot, then it livens up at theend, which sucks, because it was getting to a climax. I even read the last manga of it, and im suprised this entire thing lived for almost 9 years.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets awkward at some points, like when they get horny, or when the White or Red kampfers show up. They are supposed to fight, I though that  Shizuku's plan (to find out why they need to fight) was a secret among the group, but hey, it has a good idea why they should fight. But for some reason,  I always want to come back to this anime. Dont know why, though. Its kind of a funny series, with a sort of serious plot, but I can see why this only has 14 episodes. It would get boring knowing that Natsuru is actaully a guy who can be a girl and hang out with other girls. What else would they do so they can keep it active? Introduce another Kampfer? Nope. It would just be another series of those cute animal plushies doing shenanigans, or one of the girls trying to get with a oddly transsexual 17 year old. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime lived and died, and thats it, and there will never be a second season. I wont call it bad, it was a cool anime to watch. I guess I will watch another episode, but I wil forget about this anime forever. Story is good, art was outstanding, sound I dont really care about because I watched it on an iPad, characters were fair, enjoyment was mediocre, and my overall was 8.\\n\r\nWatch this anime if your tired of seeing typical animes, then never watch it again. By the way, im only 15, so take it with a grain of sunflower and citric acid.",

Well, I know its not necessary but there are times I start to ignore the fact that she is actually a he and that he isnt actually sexy... Well, as always, the harem genre always have a cliffhanger ending and I always thought that these kind of endings are pretty stupid and annoying at times... Seriously...I found it seriously hard to cope... The characters were okay but sometimes I'm just like DAFUQ?! Sakura, apparently the bad one, fallsfor the female side of the male protagonist and tries to steal her(him) and as you all know, all the other girls that they like, saves him(her)... Happy ending bla bla bla... But the fact that the many sides of these girl leave me thinking HEEEEYYYYY~~ YURI!!!! Well, thanks to this anime, i've learnt some german and shit but the main point is not that right? Apparently, whether the male protagonist is male or female, the girls fall for him(her)... So I am just thinking did you fall for the male side or the female side? It's so stupid! He is a guy who has a penis that turns into a girl who has no penis... So where is the romance in this? I know its all criticism and biased and one sided but i personally found this anime hard to like it... Generally, as being a reviewer and not letting my preference disturb my thoughts about it, I gave this anime a 7, only because the story was somewhat original(Although i still hate the YURI and the ending parts)...",

            "content": "Who here likes ecchi filled, somewhat funny, kind of annoying anime with a case of ADD? Then Kampfer is the perfect anime for you.\r\nStory: What's good about the story in Kampfer is, when it focuses on the story, it's good. The problem here is, it rarely focuses on the story. It strays away from the story faster than you can say \"Attention Deficient Disorder\" in order to present you with ecchi and goofy things. Grated sometimes these goofy things can be funny, but most of the time it's crap. Now, when it focuses on the story, it really does a good job. The fighting isreally fun to watch and the story is interesting, but that doesn't mean it's flawless. It uses padding of ecchi and goofy things to prolong the plot and when we get the answers we need to understand the story, it's too late. We don't get all the answers we need either. The worst thing about the plot is, it has potential, but it doesn't use it all. It taps it a bit, but it didn't reach it's full potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Kampfer are OK as well. Akane and Mikoto are probably the best characters, even though they do try and whore themselves out. I can actually care about them, most of the time anyways. Natsuru is OK, but he's a giant dumb-ass. Seriously, he's as stupid as a rock that just had a lobotomy. He understands nothing. Shizuku is also OK but she's too controlling. Like really TOOOOOO controlling. She's a puppet master of a puppet master. And she doesn't need to be. It's extremely unnecessary and she does it anyway in an over-the-top fashion. Sakura is generic at first but then turns into a rip-off of Mesdusa from Soul Eater. Who is also a bad character. She rips-off an already bad character to become an even worse character. The Entrails animals are kind of fun to watch, but are also annoying. Especially in the last episode. But an anime can't be all bad when you have a character named \"Disemboweled Tiger\". The characters are just all around OK. They need a little work but, it can be worse as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: You know in most reviews, when people complain about the art, they usually say \"it needs more money\" or \"They didn't put enough effort in it\" stuff like that. Well, in Kampfer, it's the opposite. They put too much effort into it and it looks bad because of it. It's saying \"PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO US! WE WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO US!\" and it just fails epically. It's not all bad, but for the most part, it just sucks.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voices are pretty decent. I mean, they can be obnoxious at times, but it works for the most part. The OST is really good. I could feel it when I heard it. It has an amazing impact on the viewer and it just works.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As I said before, Kampfer has potential, but it gets drawn back because of it's goofy ecchi crap, obnoxious tendencies, and poor art. It can be entertaining at times, but if you're doubting about watching this anime, then I would say you shouldn't. On the other side, if you want to, go ahead and go for it. Kampfer was just decent experience for me, and nothing more. 6/10",

            "content": "I've been meaning to review this for a while. It's one of the worst anime I have ever seen. For a while I had wanted to write this, and I actually erased this since I didn't think it was good, so this is my second time writing it. Ultimately, K\u00e4mpfer is terrible. I guess there will be spoilers for the smidgen of story this show had. So, I'll tell you why it was terrible now, in part by part.\r\n/STORY- 2 NON-EXISTANT PLOT LINES OUTTA 10\\\r\nUh, what story? By that I mean, K\u00e4mpfer apparently doesn't have one. I mean, I guess it does, but also doesn't?Allow me to explain. A group of alien stuffed animals turn people into powerful warriors. Then they fight. Now dear reader, you might be thinking, \"Why are they fighting?\" Well, actually, there's no reason. They just are. And then, at the last episode, we get a 30 second explanation that goes no where. And, because of that, it brings about the entire shows downfall. You need to have a story to keep people engaged. This was one of those shows that really could have benefited from a second season despite being bad, because the whole show felt like a set up for something bigger that didn't happen. Like, maybe we could see the main characters going into space to fight those aliens that made them fight for no apparent reason? I think it would have been more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, that's just the backstory. The actual story is just as bad. Some uninteresting dude gets turned into a K\u00e4mpfer overnight and he must fight the others and ALSO team up with the others for no apparent reason like I said. There's just one little twist. Most of the Kampfers are feminists or something (/joke) so they aren't too keen on a male Kampfer for... some ... reason. But oh no, one of the enemy K\u00e4mpfers falls in love with him. Generic shinamigans ensue. You know how like, in the Simpsons, at the end of every episode, it just kinda 'resets'? Well, this show dies the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of other shows, you know the Power Rangers? I think this show was pretty much trying to be the Power Rangers, just if one day the Power Rangers went crazy and started killing EACH OTHER instead of the bad guys. \\n\\n\r\nThe genre of this show is one that is very disputable... it's definitely ecchi, but also a yuri. And of course, 'action' if you like action with minimal reason. Now, the former of those first two I'm not crazy about- I only watch them if they are apparently great. The ladder of the two I like much more (still not my favorite). So, if you enjoy any of these 3 I guess I recommend the show. Unfortunately for me though, I had to watch this show in 10-minute intervals or else I felt like my head was going to explode or heart would stop.\\n\\n\r\n/ART- 3 DULL COLORS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe art I'd say, is a good reflection of the show. Trying to be colorful and new, but still super dull nonetheless. This show had a close-to-HD-but-not-quite vibe, which I didn't really like. The style actually reminded me of Attack on Titan a little in the respect that it looked as if the characaters had been \"pasted in\" if you know what I mean. Except that show actually had some quality in it's animation.\\n\\n\r\n/SOUND- 3 HORRIBLE TRACKS OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is so forgettable it's not even funny. This was probably because I started skipping after the 3rd episode since it gave me a headache everytime I watched it. The visuals for the OP literally have nothing to with the show. Seriously, nothing that happens in the OP actually happens in the show. Now, the ED is just as bad. The music is just as forgettable. As for the visuals, it defied the laws of physics. Look it up, it's definitely laughable.\\n\\n\r\n/CHARCATER- 5 'BEST PART' OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also terrible for this show. They were the best part though, which is still terrible. I feel no need to go ver each one like I usually do. There was the blue hair guy who pretty much everyone hates except for the crazy girl. Crazy girl has her own weird harem who act like vampires or something. Then there was the red hair girl who is also insane and swears every two seconds. Then there was the student president, who seemed like she was the one who was least nuts and kinda smart but she kinda got sucked into it too. There, there's the 'characters'.\\n\\n\r\n/ENJOYMENT- 4 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nSo did I enjoy this show? No, not really. It wasn't even laughable either. It was less then \"eh\" in every respect. It was kinda weird and different though, so there was that. It wasn't as typical as other stuff I guess.\\n\\n\r\n/OVERALL- 4 OUTTA 10\\\\n\\n\r\nThis website says a 4 is 'decent'. That's probably because it's the word that describes this show best. Decent. It's pretty bad- atrocicus even. But I know there are people out there who will like it. So, do I recommend it? No, only if you liked the stuff you read in this review. If you did, go for it. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "I actually never wanted to write this review... until the last episode of this anime. Yeah, this anime is just bunch of fights for no reason and it's clear it has no story, but the last episode gave me so much hate it's not possible to describe. I've never hated an anime so much. I watched dozens of anime, but I never felt so ferocious about one...\r\nStory: Error 404 - story not found. I really don't have to mention this, but if you're looking for an ecchi/\"harem\" anime with some story just quit. It has no story at all. Just a boy turning into agirl called K\u00e4mpfer and fighting other K\u00e4mpfer. He meets other girls and they start falling in love with him (SPOILER: Except Sakura, I think she was just acting to like girls). The fight between blue and red stops because of Shizuku and then another team appears (SPOILER: under Sakura's leadership as it seems). They all hate those moderators, which never appeared... But it's all ok. For me a harem anime doesn't need to have a story, there can just be some eye-candy and a lot of hot scenes and I'm pleased. But the last episode angered me. What did we get in the last episode. !!SPOILERS!! They all switched their bodies with their plushies (those animals annoyed me in the first place, right from the start of the anime, they were so freaking annoying...) and what happens. They go out and they never switch bodies back. Episode 11 was kinda epic. It had an epic fight and it seemed like it's not over and because of that I expected an epic end in episode 12. All I got was some plushies...   Story: 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very good, I like all the girls designs except akane with the band on her forhead (gross). The K\u00e4mpfer version of the same is very seducing though... The weapons and fights were well drawn.   Art: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I really didn't like neither the opening or the ending. Although the themes from episodes were kinda annoying, they fit well into this anime.   Sound: 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This anime's characters are trash. Shizuku is too mysterious and she seems like an old widow. Mikoto is such a weird person. Akane is too pushy and Sakura is just a double-faced b!tc#. Our main protagonist, Senou Natsuru, has absolutely no idea about life... Everything's happening and he doesn't see a THING.   Character: 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I actually enjoyed this anime until the last episode. It broke all my feelings about it. So that's why -  Enjoyment: 3/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really wanted go give this anime a 2 or a 3, but I'll give it a 4 only because of good art (I liked Natsuru's female design sooo much). I don't recommend this to anyone, only if you watched less than 5 anime and actually don't know what a good anime is. Watch this and then watch Highschool DxD or something and you'll see a difference. That's it from me, hope I prevented you from wasting your precious time on this garbage.   Overall: 4/10.",

            "content": "This is my first review here on this website so please inform me if I broke any rules or conventions while writing this review. Now I noticed that all the people here who have left a review on \"Kampfer\" have all mist out on, what I believe, to be a vitally important aspect of the show as a whole. After watching kampfer and k\u00e4mpfer f\u00fcr die liebe I could not help but notice the communist symbolism so deeply ingrained in the heart of the series. \r\nMany people accuse Kampfer of having a trite and predictable plot full of fan service and unnecessary innuendo. They claimthat the characters lack personality and are there only to there to act as fodder to make up for the crappy and uninspired show as a whole. While I do not disagree with this statement I will say that the over arching themes of the show as a whole  makes the boring and uninspired characters worth putting up with. The premise of kampfer revolves around two groups of girls, one with blue brackets, and one with red battling each other in a school setting. it is explained in later episodes that they are made kampfers by a group of mysterious beings known only as \"moderators\" a force that oversees the conflict and creation of \"kampfers\". The kampfers fight each other to resolve a cosmic conflict taking place between two forces \"blue and red\". This is where I began the realize the communist symbolism deep within Kampfer.\\n\\n\r\n The blue and red factions represent the inherent infighting between the capitalist upper class. They represent the big multinational corporations like Exxon and Saudi Aramco vying for power in the global playing field, fighting tooth and nail for domination of their respective industries. The moderators, a sort of peace keeper in the Kampfer universe are the governments of the nations around the world. Because an extended conflict between thee corporations would essentially tear the world apart the moderators then passed the burden of the infighting to the Kampfers, random girls they selected from Earth. These Kampfers are the working class. Just like the Great Russian Revolution in 1917 the Kampfers led by Shizuku, a red Kampfer decide to band together and resist the bidding of the moderators. These Kampfers are the proletariat. They are pushed beyond their breaking point, forced to fight for a battle they dont even care about. The kampfers were pushed beyond their breaking point as their friends died around them and they are forced to rise up against their oppressors. Just like Marx envisioned in his Manifesto, the Kampfers rose up against their chains because they had already lost the lives of their sisters that came before them. They rose up against the cruel oppression of the moderators. They refused to fight against their will and rebelled against the their overlords. In a classic act of civil disobedience worthy of Gandhi himself they laid down their arms and refused to fight one another. \\n\\n\r\nOf course out friends the moderators could not allow this. In an equally classic move they created their own fighting force. The White kampfers, a sort of police force designed to tear apart the bond that had formed between the blue and red kampfers and force them once again into perpetual conflict. This is where Senou Natsaru comes in. The gender bending of Kampfer plays an important role in the communist symbolism of kamfper. Kampfers were always female. Males could not be kampfers and were not involved in the eternal conflict between red and blue. Natsaru was like an outsider. a bystander at best. When he became a Kampfer he was dragged into the battle between the people and the state, between freedom and injustice. Natsaru was in many ways like Vladimir Lenin. Lenin was born into a wealthy bourgeois family. Both were dragged into the conflict. Although Lenin became a revolutionary willingly the similarities are far to deep to ignore. Natsaru and Lenin both became the leader of their respective struggles. However there is one major difference between Natsaru and Lenin. Kampfer is still inherently an ecchi anime, it still needs to appease the carnal desires of countless adolescent males and in that regard it made Natsaru a an inexperienced leader. Immature and lacking any formal knowledge about his cause Natsaru would be forced to \"grown up\" and learn to lead his comrades to overthrow the opposition. \\n\\n\r\nHowever Natsaru would be hampered by numerous obstacles, namely his nemesis Sakura Kaede. Natsaru is not a natural born leader. As a male he seemed to be relatively shy but as a kampfer that shyness seems to have increased ten fold. Sakura acts as the temptation of materialistic wealth and total power. Natsaru must learn to overcome these challenges if he is to ever lead his allies to a final victory against the moderators. The most interesting part about kampfer however is the squabbling between the red and blue factions themselves. Here kampfer gives itself a sense of realism and the fallibility of human nature. Humans can never unite fully and completely. The struggle against the moderators although universal among all of the kampfers do not prevent human nature. The kampfers often fight among themselves. The struggle to win Natsaru's heart between Shizuku, Akane, and Mikoto are just like the struggle to win Stalin's approval between Field Marshal Zhukov and NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria. The internal struggle between the Kampfers themselves perfectly mirror the constant vying for power in communist politics themselves. \\n\\n\r\nI have not watched enough anime to give a accurate judge on the sound and art style of the show itself but I have read enough books to realize that the story behind kampfer far surpasses the plot of any anime I have watched so far. Kampfer is a story of the struggle between the people and the state, of the fight between freedom and oppression, of the fragile nature of the human mind, of the oppressed majority and the privileged minority, and the perpetual fight between communism and capitalist oppression.",

I really enjoyed this anime because of the comedic moments with the tad bits of romance here and there, the main protagonist is very airheaded and I think his personality is what makes the series interesting to watch as well as it makes you want to see certain things happen or certain people to get to together. The story line is very unique as I said before but the way theyintroduce the characters and how you see their relationships progress through the anime is interesting to watch. I think this anime is the sort of one that you watch if you have free time and don't know what to watch.",

Really good. Lots of boobies jiggling and boob grabbing. Plus there's fighting scenes and a guy that get's the opportunity to transform himself to a girl.

He always seems to turn intoa  kampfer at the wrong time which can often lead to entertaining adventures.  This anime was pretty funny.

If you watch Kampfer for the story, it is enjoyable in some way but the overall plot is really an excuse for the fan service. But who doesn't like fan service anyway? The 12th episode of Kampfer is really an omake and not the final conclusion. You might want to check out the bonus (13 and 14) episodes then. They still don't conclude the anime but it's a little more onthe main part of the story. Well at least its not an anime ending that can make you feel sad and depressed. Very good anime. I highly recommend it to ecchi fans.",

            "content": "I did say that I wanted to watch a magical girl-esque kind of anime, but this was not what I expected. \r\nKampfer, the anime that I can't really describe. Well, this is awkward, so I guess I'll get into the review now.\r\nStory: Well, story-wise, I think that Harakiri Tiger pretty much explained the entire premise of the show with his short explanation. There's a bunch of girls having to fight a war that doesn't really involve them. Simple, right? Well, it was, but then Natsuru got tied up in this war. But more about that in character. Kampfer's plot is kind of there, a bitmore than Guilty Crown, somehow. But overall, the plot is simple: finish the war that others started. It's a simple premise, but they do put in some fight scenes to help remind the viewers that this isn't just fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Kampfer is great, with visuals and everything being brought to life with the shadings. Natsuru's transformation scene is animated really well, even if it is really fanservice-y. And speaking of fanservice, there's a lot. Like, so much that it transcends the manga. Even the ending song has fanservice in the animation! But besides me only allowing a certain amount of fanservice, I will say that they draw the fanservice well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting in Kampfer is well, what I expected. The personality changes between Sakura's regular personality and her true self is played really well. But the one thing that did confuse me was Natsuru. No offense to Marina Inoue (who did her part very well), but seeing as how he's a teenage male, I expected a deeper voice. But besides the voice acting, I thought that the opening and endings were pretty good. The ending worked well, with Natsuru and Sakura having a duet, almost like they were having a conversation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really contrasted well, with Natsuru's density, Shizuku's sadism, and Akane's split personality being easy to detect. But outside of personality, the characters didn't really develop at all. Natsuru still stayed his dense and sometimes derpy self, and the 3 girls kept getting thirsty for him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though I listed lots of bad points about Kampfer, that really was what had me interested and kept me watching. Even if episode 13 was basically borderline hentai, this anime was still pretty enjoyable, and I'd rewatch it just for kicks. I guess that's why I randomly rated it 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not changing my score.",

I was told it was a no nonsense ecchi with some serious omg female x female moments but I did manage to enjoy the show for more than the tits it showed off\u2026asses too!\r\nStory: 1.5/10\r\n2 teams; red vs. blue; butt and boob shots every other scene; women who are a little too bicurious; you get the gist of the show. Wasn\u2019t really interested in the plot at all but for what it\u2019s worth the show did keep me interested until allhell broke loose on episode thirteen. Speaking of episode thirteen, that episode takes \u201cWell that escalated quickly\u201d to a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty solid in my honest opinion. The eyes where my favorite aspect of the animation with props also going to the detail of the female character models. For a show that relies heavily on fanservice, it\u2019s a good thing they got that right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was extremely generic and forgetful. The voice actors however did a pretty good job; while I cannot list the actors off the top of my head, I did recognize a couple from other anime I have enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll probably get a lot of flak for this but I actually enjoyed the character interactions in this show (and no not just the sexualish stuff). The bits that played off between each character was actually pretty funny to watch in most cases. Even though I hate indecisive male leads, it sometimes pays off to have multiple romantic options.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6/10\\n\\n\r\nI normally do not watch ecchi shows since I like stuff with substance but I was just in one of those moods to watch this kind of crap. Funny thing is compared to other ecchi no nonsense anime (Campione! and the newest season of High School DxD) this one was actually somewhat enjoyable. If you are looking for something to watch that involves bouncing balls of fat then here you go. You might just pay attention a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.2/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "---_-_-_- [VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD] -_-_-_---\r\nSo, here you have Fighter. An anime with many elements of its genre, not exactly new in any way shape or form. I do not tend to watch anime of this kind, however for the most part I found it quite enjoyable. There was a lot to like, and a lot to dislike about this anime but, as there are so many reviews that go super in depth, I will just share my own personal feelings on this anime.\r\nStory: 7 - Classic fighting style anime, you have a few battles here in there, No real explenation whythroughout the majority of the anime. Basically its just two sides fighting eachother, However there is no reason given as to why there is fighting until the very end, nor is there a reason given as to why the fighters must be all female. Next to that, there is no depth into a lot of the plot points created. I know anime like these are just seedy to get you to want to go read the manga, but regardless of that, it still feels like it could have been made a bit better than it was. I personally plan to read the manga in the near future, However that doesn't excuse the lack of closure onto this series, nor does it excuse the god awful 12th episode, If they left it at Ep 11 for this I would have been far happier with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - So, I don't know why but for some reason I really like the way this anime looks, Its flashy, bright colours and catching. the character designs are animated well, the scenes are created well enough to give the atmosphere without having to even know what they are saying. Generally just enjoyable to look at. However, everyone has their own tastes, so take it as you will.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - I really can't explain this. Nothing sounded off to me so im shooting in the dark here. I apologise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - I will preface this by saying that I really only cared about Shizuki through most of the series, she is by far my favourite and most appealing character. This is obviously a bias as she fits pretty closely to the ideal woman I would have in mind, However, disregarding that, the characters don't really have a backstory, its not a bad thing because this anime is not deep enough for them, So moving on to the characters themselves, Shizuki is basically your standard Kuudere type, however changes a bit and doesn't seem so cold in general within 1-2 episodes. She without any clear reason falls for the MC and continues to have her feelings ignored until the end. Generally though, an interesting character, only truly interested in the MC and has no qualms showing her affections. We move on to Akane, She gets introduced very quick as a badass, foul mouthed person who wants nothing more than to fight, However after she is saved by the MC from a falling poll (which he himself makes fall) she disengages and later shows up as her normal, shy self which also, has inexplicedly fallen for the MC over time. she is quick to assume and then quick to get shut down and become embarressed. Asides from her Kampfer side she is not bold and does not get what she wants, generally speaking. Next up, Kondou, the childhoold friend of our MC, for a good portion you see nothing but postcard images from her travelling around the world, suddenly she shows up and has also become a Kampfer, weird huh, everyone around the main character is a Kampfer. anyways, Kondou is an outspoken girl who clearly has, what a suprise, affection for the MC. she dislikes his Kampfer side, however adores his normal side and shows clear jelousy of the other girls whom have gone to the MC. Second to last, we have Kaede, my absolute, most hated character. we are introduced to her as a cute, idol-like person who has slight affections to the Main character. however after the MC turns into a Kampfer, we are quickly made aware that she is, in fact a lesbian who loves the other side of the MC, as most of the other characters in this story just so happen to be lesbians (speaking to the girls side of the school) it is made largly apparent that she has 0 true interest in the MC other than to get to his hidden female form. That is litterally her only motive through and through. Lastly, we have the MC, Natsuru. We are introduced to him as a female, he has transformed thanks to the power of some beings called the \"moderators\" and so his life is completely messed up, he now randomly (till he learns shit) turns into a girl and is stuck with the mixed up feelings of everyone. For the most part he is an annoying little shit, but that is because despite knowing that Kaede is a complete 100% lesbian, he is still only interested in her, even in his male state. It is honestly one of the most annoying ploys I have seen thus far in anime. Moveing on, he gradually grows and becomes closer to the other three girls mentioned, closest becoming to Shizuku, as they go on a date, have their first kisses together, and end up nearly sharing a bed, if you get what I mean. it is her that reverts him back near the end with the events that happen. However as he is star crossed over Kaede, he does not immedietly realize Shizukus' or the other girls feelings for him and believes their actions to be malevolent or not entirely benign. quite simply he is your standard harem MC, however he has a bit of a complex over one girl. that just about covers him \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I really enjoyed this anime, id honestly recommend it, however I will say to skip Ep 12. Lastely, I know for sure I will enjoy the Manga more. So keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - as an overall anime. I give it a 7. It has its good points, its bad points, but in the end it is not really anything new. it has a few interesting concepts that are badly explored and an ending that makes me want to give it a 5 with high inner scores. that aside. it is still good.\\n\\n\r\n(TL:DR on my ramblings. I enjoy Shizuku, Sorry I can't give a super good review but I am new to this)",

            "content": "K\u00e4mpfer's a strange case. \r\nStory first, I guess, even though that wouldn't seem to the the mentality of the creators. We follow Natsuru Senou, pretty much your average schoolguy. He wakes up one morning to find that he's now a K\u00e4mpfer - people that fight with superpowers for reasons unknown. Think Power Rangers, if they fought another team of Power Rangers. Thing is, since K\u00e4mpfers are exclusively female, when he 'suits up', he swaps gender, becoming female. Shenanigans ensue as he cannot control when he changes.\r\nIt starts off pretty strong, with a fun premise and some likeable characters put into funny scenarios. The problem lieswith the show's lack of any real focus: the entire series seems to revolve around fanservice, and particularly in the later episodes it kind of falls apart into the generic harem that we've seen so many times, and the 'grand reveal' of the series comes off in an 'Oh. That's it?' kind of way. The show had - and still did have be the end of the series - lots of potential, but so much of it is wasted as screentime is taken away from the K\u00e4mpfer battles and Natsuru struggling with leading a double life and given to every female under the sun throwing themselves at him. The ending has almost no closure - even if you sit through F\u00fcr die Liebe, the two-part sequel series - and there are so many loose threads left hanging that it may as well have just cut off randomly. And topping it all off we have the most ignorant anime character since Monkey D. Luffy - except instead of being endearing, it's infuriating as he fails to notice that every girl in 100 miles is trying to make a move on him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give K\u00e4mpfer a 6 - it's a fun enough watch, at least for the first two thirds or so while it still has some degree of focus, but it's severely dragged back by the lack of any real plot development and the sheer missed potential here. K\u00e4mpfer, you could easily have been great, but instead, you're just another face in the crowd.",

            "content": "I'm usually a huge fan of gender bender anime/manga, so after reading the description I thought it would be a an action/adventure based comedy, which is sort of unusual for the genre, but this was nothing like what I expected, it turned out to be a 'fan service' based, really awful ecchi love polygon, with the action and what should have been the main story line was sat out on the side lines of the show.\r\nStory 6/10 - The only reason why I am rating it this high, is because, as mentioned it does introduce itself as something that will be unique and interesting andit maintains it for about 2 1/2 episodes and then it becomes rubbish that's  been reused a hundred thousand times and done better with other anime. The story line is just completely derailed by the ecchi comedy/love polygon and even ignored by the characters themselves. But that's not all, the story also takes some really weird turns in itself, even away from the ecch;i at sometimes it feels like the randomness in anime like Ebiten.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10 - Wasn't really anything special, but it wasn't poorly done either. Very plain unmemorable characters that have been seen time and time again in ecchi comedy. Atmosphere wasn't that great, but shadows and lighting accents were quite exceptional. The pallet of the atmosphere consisted of your general comedy school life anime; light blue skies, sun always shining, grass really green.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 -Noting special here either, your pretty basic comedy OP/ED. The voice actors weren't that great, their reactions and lines weren't very realistic at all and they never seemed to convey emotions in a realistic manner, though that is the scripts fault more than anything else. At least the voicing wasn't whiny and shrill like what you mostly hear in these types of anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10 -And if it wasn't dead before, here is where the anime surely dies. Instead of developing any of the characters emotions or relationships, they just throw some clueless guy who turns into a girl into a harem and kill the whole story and premise of why I thought it would be alright to watch it in the first place. The only character that seems to be aware of the main storyline is even deviated into the whole harem thing about half way through the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 - Despite the horrible execution and disappointment this anime turned out to be for me, it did keep me laughing. It may have been crappy fan service that's been done before, but it puts the main character in those awkward/funny situations that make the gender bender genre appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4.8/10 -Overall the producers took something that could have been cool and unique and destroyed it for 'fan service' and crap. Recommend to anybody that was going to watch the anime on that premise to stay away. However, if you like to watch anime for the ecchi comedy and harems rather than story line, than this is definitely one you should check out.",

Im not looking at the sound, art or story. If im gonna look at those, those revieuws you read earlier probably are true. But i look at the anime just very differently because no anime like this one does have and is daring to to have so much comedy for an echi/comedy anime. \r\nI can start about the story and about the main character that turns into a girl but it wonttell you anything about the anime exept some lame story that doesnt show the true colors of K\u00e4mpfer. If you loved Green green you probably know wat i mean altouch kampfer is slightly better. I sometimes laughed out loud because of some scenes and let other comedy/echi animes do that cause they dond do often, not for me at least.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading this you probably still dond have much of a clue wat i am saying nor do you know wat the anime is about and thats because you cant realy make an revieuw for this anime because you just have to see it yourself.

            "content": "So, I had high hopes for this anime after reading a lot of the manga. However, most of the more mature themes in the story, such as death and politics, got ripped out and all that was left was ecchi. In the manga, Natsuru struggles with the moral implications of the Kampfer battles, but we see very little of that in the anime. In fact, it's been a while, but I seem to recall nobody was ever really killed in the anime, which removes all gravity from the battles since you know everyone's always gonna be ok. Also, in the manga, Shizuku was always probingaround trying to get more clues on who was overseeing the Kampfer battles, setting up clever ruses to lure them out and expose themselves, but that didn't happen. If I recall correctly, she just makes a snap judgement in the last episode with very little evidence. Additionally, a lot of the characters and situations from the second half of the manga weren't included, so really, this pretty much ended up being a big fan-service blowout until the very end where they had to rush the conclusion of the story. It was all over too quickly and there was very little character development. It's sad to see the potential of the original story go to waste, but this will probably be the only anime adaptation we'll ever get. Oh well. It's still worth watching to see some of the more notable ecchi scenes from the manga animated though, if you're so inclined. Just don't expect anything much deeper than that.",
