            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nTeenage romance is a hot topic in the anime world. Some shows are able to capture this phenomenon quite well (White Album 2, Clannad, etc.) while others miss the mark. But even those shows that don't hit that bulls-eye at least land somewhere on the board. Glasslip is a show that not only misses the board but also hits some stranger passing by, causing a huge debacle that mirrors the contents of this anime. This is quite arguably one of the worst ones I have ever seen.\r\nSTORY\r\nGlasslip begins in much the same way that Nagi no Asukara does.New transfer student David becomes friends with Touko. Touko then proceeds to introduce him to her main group of friends consisting of Yuki, Sacchi, Hiro, and Yanagi. Afterwards, the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by begins, I mean begins and doesn't move from that position. It's best to compare this to Nisekoi. Nisekoi is infamous for its absolutely abysmal plot progression. But the difference here is that in Nisekoi, that is the whole point of the show. Glasslip tries to have things move forward, tries to instill drama or emotion. Yet when it does, nothing ever comes of it. It is not a stretch to say that literally nothing happens over the course of the entire season. Every episode is a chore and doesn't have anything interesting attached to it aside from what the show calls \"future fragments.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat are \"future fragments?\" To be quite honest, I can't explain that to you. The show sets them up to be these premonitions that a couple of the characters have, but the problem is two-fold. One, it is never properly explained. As an audience member, I obtained some information about what could cause them but they never really made any sense as to why they occur or what purpose they serve. Two, they aren't even \"future fragments.\" As is learned later, the name it was given isn't even appropriate. Meaning for the majority of the show, I am left to believe that this \"power\" is somehow special or at the minimum has some focus to it. In reality, it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all this, Glasslip also contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen from a show. A lot of what the characters say is either nonsensical or just plain weird. When watching them, it is rather awkward because everything they say just doesn't feel like they should be saying it to one another. This is kind of hard to describe. It's as if the characters were holding conversations with themselves even though they were talking to someone right in front of them.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, it's important to know that the studio behind Glasslip is none other than P.A. Works. Recently, they have gained fame for their crisp animation and art style and interesting plots. Not only is the latter gone this time, but I argue so is the former.\\n\\n\r\nI give Glasslip one thing, that is that the art itself is gorgeous. The lighting is nice, the environments are pretty, and the character designs are modern.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is little to zero actual animation present. Credit to /u/tundranocaps (a reddit user) for pointing this out. When you actually sit down and watch the show, it becomes apparent that what goes on is just talking. This causes the characters to be rather stiff. They don't have to be, but the show chooses to usually only move their mouths during the majority of the scenes. So while the coffee shop might be very detailed, the characters' movements are definitely not.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, Glasslip employs this rather strange technique I call \"still frames.\" They started occurring more frequently as the show went on, but basically the entire frame/scene would freeze in an artistic fashion. Sometimes this would occur randomly when looking at a tree. But the worst offenders were when it would happen while the characters were interacting with one another. I don't know what compelled the studio to use this \"trick,\" but I found it to be rather lame and most of the time unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, and something a bit more personal, but I hate their mouths as well. Each mouth has a slight slant to it that makes each of the characters look as if they have some sort of facial defect. Not sure why they chose this, but just another thing to add to the hate pile.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip's characters, like its story, are rather atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nThe main group of friends constitutes the main cast. Starting with Touko, her character development does not go beyond the word, \"Ehhhhhh!?!\" I understand that she is confused by a lot of the things that are going on, such as \"future fragments\" or confessions towards her. However, if the only thing notable about your growth as a character is you repeating the same, grating line multiple times an episode, you are just a really bad character.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the worst character in the show is David (Kakeru). Seemingly Tsumugu's brother from Nagi no Asukara, David is extremely abstract and philosophical. He acts like a modern-day Plato, and for this reason, I completely hate not only his character but also this character type. I don't understand why P.A. Works enjoys it, but I cannot get behind someone who always has to spout something intellectual or only asks questions as opposed to giving answers.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Yuki, who early on actually seems to be one of the more sane ones. But in Glasslip-like fashion, he becomes a rather annoying character. After being rejected, he recedes into himself and for the rest of the show just runs. Literally the only thing you see him do is run from one point to another. Is this his way of dealing with things? Perhaps, but even if that is the case, I would much rather have that explained to me, rather than me having to make a guess as to how he is dealing with the situation. This is vital because the show doesn't have a plot, so it relies more heavily on its characters (meaning character interactions).\\n\\n\r\nSachi is an interesting girl. She is shown to have some type of illness, but like the \"future fragments,\" it serves zero purpose within the narrative. She can actually be quite manipulative despite her appearance, but she too fails to communicate properly with the other characters. So much so that she relies on roundabout ways in order to convey her feelings. Much like Yuki, this is fine, but rather strange for a girl seemingly in her teenage years.\\n\\n\r\nYanagi is Yuki's step-sister. And that should set a flag off almost immediately. Because, true to Japanese anime stereotypes, she falls for him. I do not like this type of development whatsoever, and I will never understand why it is so prevalent in Japanese culture. This is me being somewhat ignorant, I get that, but it just does not sit right with me. Besides her feelings, she is generally the most mature among the group, but even she has her strange moments too, such as walking around her house naked because she can.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character to go in-depth with is Hiro, the boy who has feelings for Sachi. Among everyone in the show, he is the most level-headed/makes the most sense. His actions are believable given what happens to him, and he never does anything extremely strange. Besides pining after the girl who doesn't necessarily see him the same way he does with her, he is actually realistic. That is pretty sad, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the mouths, my final point I want to say is that the rest of the cast is pretty bad except for Touko's dad and sister Hina. They were the only ones to make me smile during the show. Whether it was from their terrible dialogue or their actual funny moments, I appreciated having them there to keep me sane.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest part of Glasslip, its music is at least okay. The OP is somewhat nice due to its relaxing melodies and nice use of the guitar. The ED is okay. It reminds me of Hanasaku Iroha with its singing, and while the show tries to be dramatic, the ED instead is rather upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fine for what it is. Nothing stands out predominately but the tracks themselves are nice to listen to while watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, no outstanding performances are to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMany people started watching this show because it was tagged with the P.A Works label. And that's fine, because they have done a splendid job recently with all of their works. But something happened along the way with this one that just makes it hard to believe that it was made by the same studio that did NagiAsu, Hanasaku Iroha, and Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is never funny, its not dramatic as much as it tries to make itself seem, the characters are boring and unrealistic, and the story (for what is even present) makes no sense. While romance is abound in the show, I never cared for any of it. I love romance to death in anime, but the way everything was handled between the characters was so unbelievable that I didn't care if Touko ended up with David or Sachi with Hiro.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope P.A. Works reflects on this project. Glasslip was an attempt at something original. They certainly obtained this goal but it is definitely not the outcome that was desired.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, completely nonsensical\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, pretty yet mired with \"still frames\" and zero actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, characterization is non-present or extremely shallow\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, melodramatic and rather boring\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "What happened to my comfy slice of life series about glass blowing? I asked myself this question every single time I finished an episode and the ED started rolling. After somehow managing to finish this awful series about teenage angst, forced drama, and supernatural horseshit, I feel disappointed. Not only in this series, but also in myself. Somewhere deep inside me must reside a little masochist devil that enjoys watching me suffer through terrible anime. \r\nSaying that Glasslip had a story is laughable. It's as if the writing behind the series just patched together random ideas and put it on the screen. Even upon completionI don't understand what this series was trying to convey. Be shallow and fall for the good-looking, up-and-coming sociopath transfer student? Believe in and follow your delusions, which realistically seem like mental disorders, instead of hauling ass to the nearest doctor? I just don't know.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought my description of the story was bad, and that has somehow not put you off of this series yet (unless you've already suffered like I've suffered, God bless your soul), then this should do the trick. Let's talk characters. There are 6 important (who am I kidding?), main characters in Glasslip. They are: Touko, Kakeru, Yukinari, Sachi, Yanagi, and Hiro. Like most dramas and slice of life shows, the main driving force behind the series are its characters. However, with Glasslip, the only thing that will be driving is you. Off the nearest cliff.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is the main female lead of the series, who honestly seems like she's not all there mentally. Touko constantly spaces out, has little to no awareness of her surroundings, and easily has the lowest IQ out of all of her friends. Half her responses to trivial things is, \"EHHHHH!?\" and it reeks of such stupidity that it hurts my brain.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru, or \"David\", the emotionless transfer student, basically has no understanding of socially acceptable human interaction. Instead of easing his way into joining Touko's group of friends, like any normal person would, he acts like a condescending asshole. Big surprise! All of Touko's friends hate him. It doesn't help that he rarely says anything besides Touko this, Touko that, or it's my fault Touko feels sad. Want to get a restraining order filed on you? Follow Kakeru's detailed step-by-step examples.\\n\\n\r\nYukinari is an athletic guy that has some real apparent issues with catching hints and simply talking in general. He gets jealous easily, has a real douchebag attitude, and runs a lot. I think I could have gone to the store and bought a pair of Nikes \u2014 which would not have only been more enjoyable than Yukinari's character, but also more interesting \u2014 and gained more entertainment value. Nikes also won't complain or get angry about their running performance either, so that's another big plus. \\n\\n\r\nYanagi is an alright character, though still pretty bland and generic. She seems normal enough compared to the others, which isn't saying much, but also still has problems of her own. She's got the hots for her step-brother and is extremely quick to jump to his defense whenever someone even hints at what an imbecile he is. I swear Japan, something is wrong with you and your infatuation with brother-sister relationships.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really understand how Sachi even became friends with the rest of the group. All she does is read books, for the most part. She rarely attends the group activities because she has some sort of unexplained illness and rarely says anything of value. Apparently nobody seems to care that she lies to them and tries to play little, deceitful games to get what she wants either. Solid 10/10 would befriend material.\\n\\n\r\nHiro, you still haven't figured out that Sachi is a lesbian? You poor bastard.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters in this entire show, there were only a handful that stood out when given their time to shine. They felt like realistic portrayals of what they would be like in real life, which was a big surprise to me. I feel like screen time was lost on all of the 'main' characters when these guys were pushed off to the side and ignored for the majority of the show. Here's some insight as to why they were so great:\\n\r\n\u2611 Character interaction: As realistic as it gets. \\n\r\n\u2611 Voice acting: Morgan Freeman-narrating-a-documentary-tier.\\n\r\n\u2611 Character design: Can't even tell they're 2D. \\n\r\nSo, without further ado, let's give a big round of applause to Jonathan, Husserl, Confucius, Roger, and Makuzu, the school chickens. \\n\\n\r\nThe only positive thing I have to say about Glasslip is that the OST is decent. I like classical music and most of the OST consisted of it, at least from what I recall. The animation for this series felt pretty lacking in comparison to P.A. Work's last scenery porn project Nagi no Asukara. There was a frequent use of stills, which was strange to me. It's 2014, come on now. The studio barely did any notably good animation for this series. Just how low was the budget?\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't already tell, I did not enjoy Glasslip. On a positive note, Glasslip does do something right aside from the OST. It gives perspective on what a bad series is. Comparatively, you can now probably say \"(insert series name here) was better than that piece of shit Glasslip!\" and therefore adjust your ratings accordingly.",

            "content": "When I think of Glasslip, the show reminds me of a candle melting. At first, the fire shines strong and bright. Then, as time goes on, it slowly burns itself out and eventually into ashes. Honestly, Glasslip isn\u2019t too different. It\u2019s a show that started off with a decent premise but slowly burn itself out. Glasslip doesn\u2019t induce creative drama, laudable realism, or a genuine slice of life. Rather, it\u2019s an empty series that is misguided by its story and characters that almost makes us feel sorry for what it created. Well, almost.\r\nProduced by P.A Works with director Junji Nishimura involved, it\u2019s no surprise thatthe show share some similar gimmicks with True Tears. The series is a standalone running 1-cour (13 episodes) that isn\u2019t based off of any source material. Yet, this show exists as a confusion. And by that, I mean the show doesn\u2019t really know what to do with itself. For a show that starts off with an intriguing premise, it quickly loses its way by turning it into some teenage abominable drama that is unable to capitalize on any of its composed ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off simple at first with a small cast of main characters - Touko, Hiro, Sachi, Yanagi, Yukinari, and Kakeru. Five of them are already friends who have known each other for some time. The one oddball out would be Kakeru, a transfer student. The catch is that he didn\u2019t come to town to study or follow a dream. Rather, he came with the reasoning that something in the future ties him together with Touko. As strange as it sounds, Glasslip essentially tries to adapt with an idea relating to the of future. The early episodes heavily implies that Touko is actually able to see into the future through pieces of glass. I suppose this is where the title of the show comes from as Touko has this supernatural-like ability. However, the show neglects most of this concept. Instead, Touko focuses more on her own interpersonal relationship with others. Sure, there are times when Touko is concerned about possible events of the future through these supposed premonitions. However, most of that is discarded instead for clich\u00e9-riddled teenage drama where romance takes over and story sinks down the drain.\\n\\n\r\nA question that popped into my mind is \u2018why would this series beget into such a weak story with a cyclone of generic clich\u00e9s?\u201d The answer is simple as the show focuses more on relationships rather than story. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of romance the show is trying to accomplish though. It seems almost everyone has a crush on someone but nothing is reciprocated. One particular confession actually implies semi-yuri undertones or if it can be called that relating to Sachi. Nonetheless, the relationship is unworthy with so much drama going on. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t of mind it if the show has realism but the supernatural element relating to future premonition derives from that. No, rather than realism, Glassip\u2019s relationship dynamics focuses on formulaic and flawed logic that makes little sense at times. Love confessions are delivered with little development. Even if there was, I would call it as sappy because it lacks compatibility. There\u2019s little relevance to some of the relationships. For instance, Touko and Kakeru seems to have some connections not based on similarities but more on fate. The breakdown is that there\u2019s little foreshadowing while others seems to also get involved whilst making their relationship lacking. In the end, there really are concerns about what this show is trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t any better when it tries to explain the premise. Apparently, the tagline reads as \u201c\"On the other side of the glass, you can see tomorrow.\u201d But really, what I can see is more like days by days going by with horrid development. The show fails to keep up what it tries to do with poor momentum. There\u2019s also a sense of false advertisement when initial viewers may lead to believe on character building. If the series decided to focus on establishing a future of their characters (such as say, a career as an artisan), then I\u2019d be content. But what it offers is nothing of such sort as the realization about this show is focused on love drama. And even when it comes down to that, the drama lacks convincing themes. There\u2019s little focus on the motivations of the characters either. It shifts from character to character that with little credibility on back stories. In fact, back stories are hardly dealt with. In essence, it leaves most viewers in the dark on what we may really know about the characters. It creates that illusionary image that the show depicts slice of life but in reality is more like a generic teenage drama without fluency. There\u2019s just too much going on without proper explanation that creates a stab in the heart. Even True Tears had some parts that people can relate and knew what it was doing at times. However, this show disconnects from reality by relying on its fantasy tropes in inadequate balancing between fiction and reality. To be honest, that\u2019s almost laughable. I only give credit for a few moments when emotional drama induces real dilemma. But even then, its forced dialogues can be an annoyance. By the time the show tries to wrap up everything together, it feels like a point where there\u2019s no redemption as result of weak buildup. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no Nagi no Asukara but this show nailed its technical artwork when it comes to artwork. P.A. Works creates visual porn with the backgrounds including its countryside atmosphere, the sea coastlines, and natural mountains. It feels like nostalgic and brings a melody that makes you feel like a kid all over again. Character designs are generic but maintains balance especially with accessories that some of the girls are wearing. Nonetheless though, artwork is a strong point of Glasslip for its ability to convey communication through gestures. There are also minimal fan service as most of the show relies on more innocence and youth. More importantly, seasonal changes adaptation such as Spring and Winter depicts sincerity with what it\u2019s trying to do. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough not as strong as the artwork, the soundtrack of the show definitely stands above the shallow relationships that the series tried to craft. Melancholy is a main theme played throughout the show with quiet moments when characters convey their thoughts or feelings. More emotional scenarios has piano-like tunes playing in the backgrounds to show what characters are going through. Occasional comical comments are less noticeable but still makes sense more than the main story. I give some praise to both the OP and ED songs for keeping with its melancholic style. Finally, we have the character voice mannerisms of the main cast. I find little to talk about for this section since none of them really stand out at all. The girls often has that dramatic voice that is pushy with valley girl-like tones. The guys aren\u2019t worth praise either as most of them hardly has a voice that are worth remembering. Kakeru\u2019s voice easily wants me to forget what he says because of his personality while Touko\u2019s expressive voice sounds like an emotional teen who is worried about almost everything. Oh wait, she is.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what exactly is Glasslip? Surely, it at least has the word \u2018glass\u2019 as part of the show so naturally, we see its usage. The problem is the pacing and balance between what it\u2019s trying to accomplish. For a slice of life show, the fantasy trope doesn\u2019t fit in. If they wanted to focus on relationship building, then at least keep the momentum going. No, instead the show decides to jump around everywhere between characters. In retrospect, the show digs itself further and further into oblivion. Its lackluster comedy and love dramas are questionably unfavorable that can leave a bad taste in a viewers\u2019 mouth. I\u2019m not questioning the drama as some parts of it does command attention. But ultimately, this show is a stinker to what slice of life is. Besides visual porn quality and a tolerable soundtrack, Glasslip is a depressing show to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd no, I\u2019m not even talking about sadness as an emotion. It\u2019s more like how sad this show has fallen apart while burning away like a candle\u2026.\\n",

            "content": "You know there's something wrong with an anime about romance when the most interesting character is an ordinary freaking CHICKEN.\r\nSpoiler alert.\r\nGlasslip is an anime that takes place during a summer about a group of friends in high school. A transfer student, Kakeru, moves to the town in the first episode and starts to make friends with the main character, Touko. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all there is to say about this anime. Nothing interesting happens. At all.\r\nTo see where everything goes wrong with this garbage, let's first consider the characters, and then the story:\r\nTouko is the main character of this anime, and she's a usuallycheerful girl who has feelings for Kakeru, and she experiences some sorts of visions sometimes. That's all there is to say about her. She's a profoundly uninteresting character.\\n\r\nKakeru is a \"mysterious\" and cold student who also has visions and likes Touko. The most notable thing about him is that he's a schizophrenic who sees other versions of himself. He could be a very interesting character, but the writers never took the chance to explore his past and develop him very well.\\n\r\nYanagi is Touko's friend who takes dance classes and has a crush on her step-brother Yukinari. She seems cheerful most of the time. I have nothing else to say about this boring character.\\n\r\nYukinari is Yanagi's step-brother who likes to run and has a crush on Touko. He ends up punching Kakeru simply because Kakeru asked him if Yanagi confessed to him. In real life, you'd think he's justified in being angry at Kakeru for taking away his crush, but if you watch the scene, it's just so out of place and robotic that it doesn't really make any sense at all.\\n\r\nSachi is a frail girl who has a lesbian crush on Touko and a crush on  a dude named Hiro. She doesn't like Kakeru and plots to separate him from Touko. But she doesn't really do anything unfortunately.\\n\r\nHiro is a guy who always smiles and has a crush on Sachi. To get Sachi's attention, he reads books. That's all I have to say about him.\\n\r\nJonathan is a chicken who lives in the school. He seems to be a surprisingly intelligent chicken. The screen flashes to him after Kakeru and Touko kiss for the first time in episode 10, and for some reason he follows Touko around right before she kisses Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main problem with the characters is that every single character is like a robot with no depth whatsoever. You really can't think of anything else to say about them apart from that they're cheerful or cold, depending on the character, because they just have no depth. We seldom see any deep emotional reactions from any of the characters. The most emotionally charged scene, in which Yukinari punches Kakeru, is so robotic and strange that it seems completely out of place. It doesn't seem like any of these characters act like real people. If you pay attention to Yanagi jogging, even her breathing while they exercise sounds robotic and too much in rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the main problem with the story. Nothing ever really happens. Here's a list of all the important events in every episode:\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Kakeru moves to the town\\n\r\nEpisode 2: Yukinari confesses to Touko\\n\r\nEpisode 3: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 4: Touko admits she likes Kakeru\\n\r\nEpisode 5: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 6: Yukinari punches Kakeru\\n\r\nEpisode 7: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 8: Yanagi walks around naked in her house for no reason other than fanservice, but it's a good scene. You get a full-frontal view (without nipples of course).\\n\r\nEpisode 9: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 10: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 11: It's brought up that Kakeru is considering leaving the town. Nothing else of importance happens.\\n\r\nEpisode 12: Touko experiences a day in alternate-reality-world. Nothing happens though.\\n\r\nEpisode 13: It's not known if Kakeru decides to leave or not. The ending is open-ended. Apart from that, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a massive chore to watch each episode because the anime doesn't try to keep you interested at all. Every scene is meaningless and emotionless and pointless. I often have to spend every episode browsing my phone simply because I can't force myself to watch this anime without any form of stimulation.\\n\\n\r\nSide-stories are completely and casually abandoned by the writers with no conclusion whatsoever. Yukinari's crush on Touko is a perfect example of this. You'd expect stuff like Yukinari punching Kakeru to have some importance in the story and cause some bad-blood between them for the episodes to come. Not at all! In this anime, Yukinari completely forgets that Touko exists half way through and this plot point is just abandoned by the writers. It's never of any importance again. Similarly, Sachi's quest to remove Kakeru from Touko's life due to a lesbian crush has almost no relevance to the story. It's mentioned only once or twice and never again. Another example of this is the visions that Touko has. We find out in episode 12 that they seem to involve an alternate reality. But what are they? Why do Touko and Kakeru have them? Who knows, it's never explained. \\n\\n\r\nGlasslip is a boring, pathetic excuse for a romance anime that should be avoided. It's so boring that you can't even call it a \"so bad it's good\" anime. Because watching each episode is even more boring than counting blades of grass and watching paint dry on the wall: if there's nothing to laugh at while watching paint dry on the wall, why would you get any sort of enjoyment out of watching this garbage?",

            "content": "Like a light summer breeze, Glasslip, which looked to be a tranquil slice-of-life, floated onto the summer anime scene.\r\nLike summer itself, Glasslip was something that many viewers, including me, looked forward to. I think a lot of us were weaned on the gorgeous visuals, intricate plot, and superb character development found in Nagi no Asukara, which was created by the same studio that made Glasslip. A very sparse summary and teaser video only served to increase the enthusiasm for Glasslip. What I expected was another wonderfully drawn anime with a touch of supernatural and profound character progression.\r\nThere was just one thing that was, as Iwould discover, incredibly erroneous in that assumption.\\n\r\nWell, you know how it works! Keep reading for a flow of text; scroll down for categorizing through numbers. Read both if you like, but information can and will be repeated between the two sections. \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe key word is \u2018progress\u2019.\\n\r\nNow, see, I don\u2019t have a huge problem with slice-of-life, but one would hope to see significant changes in the characters and the plot. Glasslip is characterized by an utter lack of character development. I\u2019m upset that I wasted my time watching this anime ( which my friends have termed \u2018Glasshit\u2019 ); I think the reason why I ended up watching the whole thing is that I hoped something would happen. In the first few episodes, it seemed like some interesting events would take place; it was that hope for something to change that kept me going through the tortuous second half of the series. My hopes were only to be dashed into shards of glass at the end, as the finale tried to put on the premise of being deep and philosophical but just ended up being really confusing.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit difficult for me to write a review for this anime without venting my frustration, so to temper that, I\u2019ll state that Glasslip isn\u2019t horrible through-and-through. The art, as expected, ranks among the best I\u2019ve seen in an anime. The characters have decently attractive personalities for perhaps the first several episodes. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful ( and I loved the addition of classical music ). The issue with Glasslip is that it tries too hard and then fails miserably. Perhaps I should compare it to Icarus? I simply imagine that PA Works tried to follow up on Nagi no Asukara but ended up creating a disaster. All the right elements were there in a complete disarray. I think that everything in Glasslip could have been adjusted to have worked better, and it would have been a great story. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. \\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll concede that there will be people who like this anime. I actually have a friend who loved Glasslip ( and even compared it to a Miyazaki film, which provoked some skeptical reactions from me ), which helped give me a perspective into the, albeit few, good aspects of the series. So, if you really do want to give this anime a try, don\u2019t expect any plot development, but it is a slice-of-life and a romance in which basically everyone falls in love with each other at some point or another. The art is superb, the soundtrack equally so. Slice-of-life with a hint of fantasy is what I would describe Glasslip as if I enjoyed it. \\n\r\nBut I do have substantial reason to believe that most people disliked Glasslip. A small anecdote-\\n\r\nMy mom watches Chinese dramas.\\n\r\nUsually, she starts by watching the first one or two episodes.\\n\r\nThen, she skips right to the very end and watches the last episode.\\n\r\nPart of it is to conserve time [ after all, Chinese dramas can drag on for a very long time ], but she's said that honestly, there isn't much she's missing by not watching the bulk of the series. From the ending, she can pretty much piece together everything that happened.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the same thing, sadly, applies to Glasslip. It's a pity; I really wanted to like this anime and I had high expectations based off of what I had seen from P.A. Works before. What makes an anime more interesting than others is that way of making the viewers second-guess themselves, to get absorbed into the characters and then find that not everything plays out as they expected. That's something that P.A. Works achieved with Nagi no Asukara, but for some reason, they fell short here, using hackneyed storylines and characters so predictable that watching them interact incredibly boring. \\n\r\nThe relationships in Glasslip are largely forced. The romance comes out of nowhere, especially between Touko and Kakeru. If I were to sugar-coat things, I would call it spontaneous, but really, I\u2019m just going to call it utterly unprecedented. Their relationship basically goes from \u201cyou remind me of a Renaissance statue and I enjoy chickens\u201d to \u201clet\u2019s spend the night together in a school\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m all for hilarious or unconventional boy-meets-girl ( or vice versa ) situations, but after that, there was really no relationship development to merit their decision to go out with each other. One would imagine that they would be united by a common power that they share...but really, that power contributes to more awkwardness between the two, and thus I really don\u2019t understand where their relationship comes from.\\n\r\nI could rant about Touko and Kakeru\u2019s relationship all day, but let\u2019s talk about everyone else. I think the most genuine person here is Hiro, who actually shows that he likes Sachi and acts on it. And, following from that, I was interested to see a possibly? bi character in this anime, but turns out that she\u2019s incredibly jealous and rude to everyone. But with a sickly glasses-girl trope, it seems like Glasslip is trying to compensate and thus make you feel sorry for her instead of hate her. Ah, but to no avail. I expected a tragic or angst aspect involving Sachi, but really, she just sat in her hospital bed and brooded like an old witch over how to destroy everyone\u2019s lives. Come on, you could have just killed her. That would have been more character development than evidenced by anyone else in the entire series. \\n\r\nYanagi and Yukinari are a strange pair; I thought that Yanagi\u2019s attraction to her stepbrother was incestuous until I found out about their relationship a little too late for my own good. But anyway, I really don\u2019t think that it benefits your relationship with your brother to be walking around the house naked ( I suppose that was for fanservice, but it was out-of-place and totally unwarranted ). Yukinari was my favorite at the beginning because I\u2019m always rooting for the underdog type, but...? He didn\u2019t come to terms with his romantic attractions for anyone; you would imagine that even a bit of closure might be attained by the end of the anime.\\n\r\nHaha, who am I kidding? Nobody comes to terms with their romantic attractions at the end. Watching the anime to see how the love isododecahedron plays out is absolutely fruitless. Everyone is still in love with the same people, nobody progresses except for Touko and Kakeru ( and in the end, that\u2019s also pointless ), and even though they try to take middling steps in the direction of forming relationships, nobody really learns from such experiences. At the end of Glasslip, everyone is largely the same as they were at the beginning. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s move on to a small snippet about the \u2018supernatural\u2019 element of this anime. Supernatural! Fantasy! It would probably be a crucial part of the plot, don\u2019t you think? \\n\r\nTurns out that the supernatural powers possessed by Touko and Kakeru are ab-so-lute-ly useless. Touko uses her power to just make everything worse; instead of using it to save the world or whatnot, she uses it to help, but actually ruin the teenage drama in her life. Kakeru uses his power to embrace his tent fetish and alienate his parents. I got fooled into thinking that something was happening when the supernatural powers revealed the premise of something dark, but...who am I kidding? Nothing happened, as expected. \\n\r\nSo, character development and plot development were a shame, but how about the other aspects of Glasslip? \\n\r\nI think I did mention before that I wholeheartedly enjoyed the art and soundtrack of Glasslip. Art first, look up pictures of Glasslip and you\u2019ll be treated to PA Works\u2019 wonderful art. The landscapes are impeccably drawn and detailed, and the lighting does a wonderful job in portraying a relaxed summer world looked at through a lens. I enjoyed the vivid and bright palettes of this anime; just looking at the screenshots of the scenery reminds me of summertime. The characters are drawn in the same style as those of Nagi no Asukara - big eyes, simple features. I would say that such a style doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone, but I do enjoy how many different tones and aspects of lighting were included in the eyes, and the characters were distinctly drawn such that I didn\u2019t have any trouble differentiating between them. The one fault in the art was those awkward still frames. What were they doing there? Where did they come from? ( cotton-eye joe? ) And you would imagine that such frames would be used for emphasis in important scenes...quite the contrary. They were seemingly randomly placed, which I found quite irritating. \\n\r\nSimilarly, the OP and ED also remind me of summer. I particularly enjoyed the opening theme, which has an acoustic guitar and background beat that definitely feels like a summer breeze ( though it may be because I listened to the song quite a bit during the summer ). The OST had quite a bit of classical music, including many pieces that I\u2019ve played before, so I was really enthusiastic about the music in Glasslip. Overall, in terms of setting the mood for the warm environment of the series, the art and soundtrack were wonderful toward that purpose. However, Glasslip also does a wonderful job of proving that a great soundtrack and art can\u2019t redeem a terrible anime, for at the end of the day, it\u2019s the plot and characters that stand out the most. \\n\r\nThis is precisely why- I\u2019m sorry to say- that I think Glasslip is one of the worst anime I\u2019ve ever seen. The infamous Sword Art Online had more interesting plot and character development than this series, which is to say that Glasslip had none of those things. If you\u2019re a sadist or you just really, really like slice-of-life anime, then maybe you would enjoy Glasslip. It\u2019s far from a lighthearted and easy watch, though, not because it\u2019s dark or depressing, but because it\u2019s frustrating to try and follow a nonexistent plot and sympathize with terribly developed characters. \\n\r\nOn that note, let\u2019s go on to a numerical analysis of Glasslip. ( I\u2019ll provide some statistics of my own- I dislike this series so much that I wrote all of what\u2019s here so far in about fifteen minutes at probably a record pace fueled by rage, and somehow I\u2019ve also managed to consume a pint of ice cream while doing so. ) \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory :: 3\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to give the creators a gold star for trying...\\n\r\nThe plot seemed interesting enough at first, and I was definitely excited to see what would unfold as the series progressed, but after around episode 5 or so, it became obvious that this story was going nowhere fast. The finale tried to put on the premise of being deep and philosophical but just ended up being really confusing. The issue here is that since Glasslip is a slice-of-life that centers around a group of friends, the character development is basically the plot. A pity that there was neither.\\n\\n\r\nArt :: 9\\n\r\nI\u2019ll have to dock a point here for the awkward still frames, but Glasslip, despite its shortcomings, retains PA Works\u2019 characteristic detail in visuals. The art really stands out in the parts involving a lot of scenery, with lighting portrayed perfectly. A vivid and cheerful palette lend themselves to the summery theme of Glasslip, which brings back nostalgic memories of the time when I wasn\u2019t trying to balance 6 APs, maintain good grades, and cram for college exams. The characters are attractively drawn, and I really enjoyed the amount of detail put into their eyes, which again lend to the suggestion that not everything is completely realistic in Glasslip ( like the fact that they expect us to believe that there\u2019s a plot ).\\n\\n\r\nSound :: 9\\n\r\nRelaxing classical music abounds in the OST, and the OP and ED were catchy and, like the art, give me that nostalgic summer feeling. This was one of the first anime in which I actually paid a lot of attention to the soundtrack, since I recognized a lot of songs ( having heard them or played them myself ). So, while the classical music portion was completely unrelated to the plot, I thought it was a nice touch and personally, I really enjoyed the music. In a romantic sense, Glasslip is a very peaceful anime ( in other words, nothing happens ), and I think that the classical music suits the relaxed setting and pace. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter :: 1\\n\r\nOh, god.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I wasn\u2019t going to go back and add anything to that, but anyway, the most outstanding feature of Glasslip is the lack of character development. I entered the anime hoping to see a heartwarming coming-of-age story and got characters who ended up being largely the same as they were at the beginning, even after facing fruitless romantic relationships. One by one, each character proved that they weren\u2019t misunderstood, just totally irredeemable. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that with this review, I\u2019ve sufficiently convinced you to not waste any of your time on this anime. But hey, people don\u2019t like being told what to do. To them, I say \u2018the best of luck to you\u2019! \\n\\n\r\nGanbatte\\n\r\n- palladia\\n",

            "content": "The hugely negative reviews that this show is getting is mainly because this show is aimed at a specific audience. it is neither flashy nor has twists and turns like many other anime. It is a slice of life, a very thin slice and not everyone can connect to it. In real life things do not progress fast. In real life you dont have stereotyped characters like tsunderes and danderes. In that way the characters in glasslip are very real. I do not understand why the wort of an anime or character is measured by how interesting backstory it has or the struggle of eachcharacter. Yes, those anime are inspirational and hit us hard but just because an anime caters to the ordinary people with ordinary life does not mean its bad. The artwork is brilliant in this anime btw and that is one point everyone agrees.\\n\r\nVerdict:- If you want a thriller, a plot with huge twists and turns, characters with backstory etc. stay away from this anime. If you want to enjoy mundane lifestyle and complex romantic love life of a few teenagers, this anime is for you. Personally I could connect a lot to this anime, it was almost like school life all over again and I believe many can.",

            "content": "Starting episode one of Glasslip, the impression is given that the journey you are about to partake will be artistic, dramatic, and truly memorable. This is to say, on the surface, Glasslip is all of these things. However, once you tie your laces and start down the slippery slope, the series proves to have none of the above characteristics. Instead, the anime leaves you severely starved of the deep, intriguing elements it tries sparingly to mimic. In short, the thirteen-episode production was a disappointment.\r\nDuring the first episode you are introduced to a gaggle of main characters, specifically, Touko and her party of five friends. Whenthe new kid comes to town--as one often does in manga and anime--the group decides to remove the 'no dating' rule, for some reason vaguely related to the new kid being apparently a fine piece of ass.\\n\r\nPredictably, one thing after another goes wrong, and while I can tolerate love triangles, the ones utilized in Glasslip were poorly handled and did not create satisfying conflict. \\n\r\nEach issue that arises is solved in an incredibly calming way that, instead of delivering relief, leaves you bored. No one develops any particular hate for another character, nor do any of the characters interact enough for unique relationships to form.\\n\\n\r\nMostly, I belief Glasslip was riding on the artistic portion of itself. This may have worked for the show, if not for the art being just as uncomfortable and even a touch sloppy.\\n\r\nWhile you are introduced to scenic backgrounds, clouds, glass and stills episode to episode, the characters themselves are left out to hang, complete with strange ruffles in clothing, the frequent change of appendage proportion and an irritating, lopsided mouth. \\n\r\nThe most the art does is add to the atmosphere, complimenting the artisanal theme with softness and a brushstroke-like quality. This is a success in a pile of ruins.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also used to compliment the aesthetic, and a wide use of classical violin and piano remains in the background at almost all times. It seems as if it is trying to make the tone of each episode dramatic, coming off as a sort of mock-soap opera soundtrack. \\n\r\nThe OP is a sweet tune that fits the show, especially in that it is something you could easily fall asleep to. In all honesty, some of the best Glasslip footage is in the opening credits.\\n\r\nContrarily, the ED is incredibly misleading. I have encountered the stylings of Nano.RIPE in many series, and have heard both slower and peppier songs--unfortunately, the choice was made to go peppy at the end of Glasslip, which does not suit the show whatsoever. Sure, it may be fun, but I believe something calmer, like the ED to Hataraku Maou-Sama, would have done Glasslip more justice.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, the anime takes a big hit in quality because of its characters. The impression is given everyone will be fun and unique, but this is not at all true. Each character, from the supposedly forgetful, indecisive Touko to the blunt Yuki, does not fit the bill for the personality they need to level out the show. The screen time for each of them is so severely divided that you can barely start to care about anything they are doing. \\n\r\nFor an anime, their reactions are bland and underplayed. While you may think it is better and more realistic to leave out the misunderstandings and the obnoxious 'uwaaahhh's, without them, there is nothing grabbing to keep anyone invested in the plot. By the final episodes, you barely see Touko's friends at all, and praise god if they get one or two lines. The romances and understandings Glasslip works hard to build shatter with the disappearance of everyone under the shadow of one of the show's main flaws:\\n\r\nKakeru Okikura.\\n\r\nScene after scene is spent trying to understand Kakeru, the new kid, and to bring out his complexities and sense of self, only to play it out to the point he becomes a one note, overbearing, pretentious loner. He begins as a mysterious new addition to the town and ends with a sudden amount of melancholy on his back that you're supposed to feel sorry for--they only problem is the script surrounding who and how he is is vague. The fatal flaw of Glasslip is the fact that the conflict of the show starts out as 'two kids who can see the future' and ends with 'no one loves Kakeru'.\\n\r\nGlasslip handles characters like a man with greased hands juggles: everything ends up in a disappointing mess by the end, and the worst part is, the mess is just a touch anticlimactic. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy Glasslip, I really, really did. Sadly, here I am at episode thirteen and without the romantic drama I was so looking forward to.\\n\r\nGlasslip is a relaxant. In being such, it does not stand even close to the other series premiered this summer, and it's usefulness extends to only about a good computer background.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\n\"The next Nagi no Asukara?\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how many times I heard this anime advertised as the next smash-hit romantic drama series by PA Works following the monumental success of their previous entry into the genre. As a result, there was a LOT of hype behind this anime among fans of rom-drams. While I can\u2019t exactly call myself a fan of the genre, I couldn\u2019t resist giving the show a try considering that NnA was the best rom-dram I had ever seen. What I got not only didn\u2019t meet these (unreasonable) expectations, but it left me in awe of just howmuch of a disaster the writers managed to make out of what is one of the most basic concepts in writing: love polygons. Whether it\u2019s the horrible execution of the supernatural elements that the show tries to sprinkle in or the fact that they completely fail to properly introduce us to the characters, Glasslip is just an absolute and undisputed failure.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: 6 teenagers are in love, but none of them are in love with each other! Shocking, I know! (The rest of this synopsis is complete guess:) One of them, Touko Fukami, works as a glass artisan and that somehow enables her and a strange boy named Kakeru Okikura to see into the future, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s at this point you may be asking yourself: \u201cWhat the hell do love polygons, glass artistry, and the ability to see into the future have to do with each other?\u201d Well friends, you are not alone in that regard. Nobody has any clue what they have to do with each other because the show doesn't take the time to bloody explain ANYTHING, particularly this whole foresight garbage. Let me make something absolutely clear: writing a romantic drama is not hard. It\u2019s as formulaic as it gets; if you\u2019ve seen one, you can guess the direction and outcome of 90% of the others. Therefore, in order to stand out from the crowd, rom-drams need to add a little something extra in order to be considered noteworthy. NnA had its engrossing and imaginative setting, while Glasslip went for supernatural-future-sight. The only problem is that apparently didn't have the slightest idea of how to incorporate this into the \"story\" (did this show even have a story?). This is because they completely failed to make this mystery the slightest bit interesting or endearing to the audience. They don't explain a single, and I literally mean one SINGLE element or detail of ANYTHING in the entire show! Particularly not this whole \u201cfuture sight\u201d. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done, we don\u2019t know how many people can do it or why, we don\u2019t know who has the ability to do it, we don\u2019t know what is being seen, we don\u2019t know how far into the future they are looking, we don't know the relevance to the plot, we don\u2019t know a goddamn thing, and that is inexcusable. This is one of the stupidest fucking shows I've ever seen. Slowly unraveling a mystery is one thing, but they just butchered the execution by completely confusing their audience and refusing to clarify even the most basic details. The worst part is that the basic love-polygon drama of the show is also terribly executed, contrived and confusing. I don't know who wrote the script for Glasslip, but that person should never work in the industry again. Either I'm watching a bad translation, or this anime has the worst script since Fate/Stay Night's \"People die when they are killed\". When such a simple concept is so unbelievably hard to follow, you know that you are doing something terribly wrong. To wrap it up: It's hard to imagine a possible way that the plot could be any worse than it ended up. Glasslip's \"plot\" is as bad as it gets; it's a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot may have been botched, the characters are where this anime truly and utterly fails. This anime made the unwise and downright stupid decision to jump right into the drama without taking the time to introduce us to the characters. The result? Nobody cares about anything that is happening. Guy #1 loves Girl #1, but nobody cares. Girl # 2 loves Guy #1, but nobody cares. Guy #3 loves Girl # 3, but nobody cares. Girl # 1 loves chickens (?), but NOBODY. FUCKING. CARES. The main character, Touko, is literally the only character that isn\u2019t one-dimensional, but she is CERTAINLY no saving grace (she might have some sort of mental disability). This show betrays the very basics of story-telling 101: \u201cIf the audience doesn\u2019t know who the characters are, they don\u2019t care what happens to them\u201d. For a rom-dram, this is arguably the worst mistake that can possibly be made because these kinds of shows are VERY character driven. In Glasslip, the audience could care less if, say, Guy #3 died in a fire next episode, so how are we supposed to care about if he gets a girlfriend or not? Additionally, the character chemistry is awful. We are supposed to get the idea that the main characters are all close friends, and yet they are only shown together in about 3 episodes. Really, it is just truly baffling how awful the execution of this show is.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Glasslip is a complete disaster. Sure, it has a beautiful OST and pretty visuals, but those are not even close to enough to save this catastrophe from the bowels of shitty rom-drams. Glasslip doesn't know how to use a fucking plot device, it doesn't know how to introduce characters, and it doesn't even know how to write a basic love polygon. Needless to say, I don\u2019t recommend this show to anyone. It's garbage. My god it's garbage.",

            "content": "Some critics argue that the most integral part of a story is the climax. It displays the turning point of a certain situation that had been building up from previous events (or episodes) in an attempt to evoke a certain emotion or reaction from the audience. Whether or not this is the most integral part of a story, most would agree that the climax, in most cases, overall helps the story in overall worth. One should also keep in mind that what causes the climax to become as integral as it could be is essential in understanding how a good story works. A story issimilar to that of a recipe; if everything is put in at (roughly) the exact amount with the appropriate time allotted to let it bake or stir or settle, then the finished product turns out at a higher quality.\\n\\n\r\nHow the concept of a story's climax relates to that of Glasslip is simple: Glasslip is a show that tries to produce results by skipping certain ingredients. A good climax requires good build-up, good tension, and most of all, the audience's attention and empathy, along with other accessories. When a storywriter looks to the climax too earnestly, they are more likely to miss what comes before; like planning a trip before worrying about the luggage. I believe this is Glasslip's biggest flaw: it tries to play the drama factor before building up the drama.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is most noticeable about Glasslip is the attention to its scenery. Everything looks crisp and clear and certainly has the appearance of a somewhat light-hearted teenage drama. Not to discredit the production values, but with a studio such as P.A. Works, this is almost guaranteed. As the story progresses, however, the attention to detail begins to diminish. Not in the scenery itself, but to those who inhabit it. The faces of the characters, as I had noticed, barely change in expression. Even if they do change, they don't seem to look like they acquire the emotion behind the change in expression. I think this plays most prevalently with their eyes. Their eyes barely change. Nothing happens to their pupils, their size; everything seems to stay course. This is where the flaws in the outer region of Glasslip end, but where the inner regions begin to show signs of disarray.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Glasslip begins rather innocently. A group of friends are introduced and spend time with each other doing whatever life entails them to do. It is only when the appearance of Kakeru, a strange, transfer citizen, does a crack in the group begin to show. This results in another sub-plot to the show simply stated as \"the fragments of the future\" appearing as if by pure coincidence. Kakeru and Touko, the main female protagonist of Glasslip, are allowed to see these so-called \"fragments.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the previous claim about the climax of a story, what is almost essential in having one be effective is through the story's characters. Glasslip's characters can all be summed up through the use of one word: mundane. Whatever they choose to do throughout the course of the series ends up meaning nothing or being quickly forgotten by the beginning of the following episode. The major characters' use of dialogue with the other major characters, who are all supposedly great friends, give the audience no reason to think they are actually friends. There is no chemistry between any of these characters, whether it be with friends, family, or romantic partners, as some of the characters do (or hint) at a current or future romantic relationship. By the end of the series, the viewer is likely not concerned with the characters' wishes because neither are the characters on-screen. It is almost as if the characters were still infants, trying to form an identity of their own through their environment while the show was still airing.\\n\\n\r\nAfter understanding the characters, the viewer is brought back to the main story of Glasslip: drama. If Glasslip were to attempt any build-up whatsoever, some of the attempts at genuine drama could have been fruitful. Unfortunately, it tries to fill in the amount of wasted space in running time by showing cheap amounts of dramatic tension. Things such as jealousy, possessiveness, and betrayal are explored in this series, but are shrugged off the instant they arise. As stated above, everything that is said or done seems to mean nothing by the beginning of the following episode. Only the \"fragments\" are given any attention for more than a course of an episode, and even so, we know nothing more about the phenomenon by the end of the series as when it was introduced in the beginning of the series. When taking everything into account, this series is, simply put, a diorama, filled with pale, clay dolls moving from place to place.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that the climax of a story can make or break the worth of a show. So when Glasslip tries many, many times to provide worthwhile build-up to the climax of the series, it felt like nothing had been done, nothing had been accomplished. The dull characters and convoluted story only equate to a miserable and strenuous viewing. Not to overinflate the amount of analogies already present, but one last thing Glasslip could be an example of is an unfinished story. It is the outcome of someone's haste and overwhelming desire to get to the flashiest part of a story. It's quite a shame; it looked so pretty, too.",

            "content": "When I saw the trailers for this show, I like most of the anime watching community were expecting this to be either one of two things, 1. To be the next Nagi no Asakura, one of the most well known romantic dramas to have come out recently, or what I was expecting, a slice of life story of a girl who wishes to be a glass artisan like in the synopsis. Let me just say it dropped the ball for either one of these mindsets. For a romantic drama, everything feels forced and it uses love triangles and polygons that have been done time andagain, and as a slice of life about glass artisans it shows only 3-4 minutes worth of screen time in which the main character is heating glass and messing it up on multiple occasions at the place she works at and it never even talks about her goals to become a glass artisan IN THE LAST FOUR EPISODES. The show instead uses glass as some kind of plot device that allows our main character to see the future for some reason. I wouldn't mind if it did this if it did it properly, but they don't. When this future sight happens I am left clueless as to what future events are going to happen despite seeing them myself but for some reason the main character gets the entire gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters most of them are one dimensional and forgettable except for the main one, you got the new guy in town, a bookworm girl, and a few others. That's right there's 5 side characters we as viewers are supposed to care about in addition to Touko, the main lead, and three of them don't have any distinguishing traits or personality. And Touko only has a few traits, like caring for chickens and sketching them and making glass stuff and being the main reason romantic tension randomly happens. The reason I am sort of ranting on the characters is that if the genre is romance or slice of life, having good characters matters more then usual as they are what we focus on during romance and dramas. In my opinion this show is not the worst but there is better out there\\n\\n\r\nMy alternate recommendations would be the currently airing Ao Haru Ride or the just finished airing Soredemo Sekai wa Utskushi due to both of these shows being better in the romance genre then this show.",

            "content": "\"The next Nagi no Asukara\" quickly turned into the disappointment of the summer for most, but actually entertained me. Are you raising your brow yet wondering, \"why give an anime a 7 that's heavily hated on?\"\r\nWith Nagi no Asukara ending a few months before Glasslip was released, we had high expectations for it thinking it would live up to the hype that Nagi produced. By no means am I saying this anime is perfect, it isn't, it has a bunch of flaws, but still doesn't deserve that amount of hate it's getting in my opinion. \r\nIt opens with the group of friends having fun ata summer festival and showing each of their names, along with a unique event that the main character experiences. From there you're introduced to a new transfer student and he causes a stir within the group of friends and it begins to kick off from there. One flaw that this anime opens up with, is no character introduction. No one is properly introduced and you're literally just thrown into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was driven by the concept of Touko, the main character, being able to see visions or hear voices that may hint to the future. The \"fragments of the future\" are the main thing that drives the story, but it doesn't exactly get told what it is or why it's even there. With the obvious love cycle that this group has, feelings get told and nothing happens, the group just spreads apart and it stays that way for most of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne big flaw in the entire anime is that nothing does happen, it's sad to say, but things just go in a big circle and end in a big unclear ending that answers absolutely nothing. The entire situation that all the characters went through with their heart breaks and confessions, just goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nWith the anime having a bad story, you have mediocre characters to really back up it up. I won't say these are the worst characters that i've seen, cause i've seen worse, but some things they do are really questionable and just tend to make the overall anime confusing, but did entertain me. Due to the show being a slice of life, it's heavily character driven, and the cast isn't exactly the best for what the show was trying to do. Mainly the anime focuses on Touko and \"David\". Those are the two with the ability to see \"fragments of the future\" and share the ability. They drive the story with the curiosity to figure out why they have it and what it does, which never does get answered.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is a typical teenage girl and probably the most prominent of her group of friends. She's very curious and tends to be oblivious to the situation tending to make things worse. She had potential to be a great character, but  didn't shine as much as she could have and really just made the anime repeat a bunch of things that already happened. \\n\\n\r\nNext you have Kakeru, or David, the transfer student who just shows up. Like literally just shows up and is thrown into the story. With his appearance, he throws the group into conflict and even admits that hes messing with them to some extent on purpose. He's a lot like Tsumugu from Nagi, but less emotion. He does have his moments of why he does things, but it feels like he was just placed there cause they needed another character to fill the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the group is diversely made up and is one of the things that I enjoyed. Though they all literally just made more conflict and served no purpose in the story whatsoever, they made a lot of entertaining moments and gave the anime more life than what was given. You have characters who aren't even involved in the drama and have their own love story, and characters that mess up the drama further, by doing actions that are just questionable, but adds for a whole lot of interesting interactions and situations to keep the story from dying off.\\n\\n\r\nArt is possibly one of the best things this anime has to offer. The art comes from the famous P.A Works who has previously worked on Tari Tari, Hanasaku Iroha, and Nagi no Asukara. The scenery from the hikes, to the fragments and visions that Touko sees are all beautiful and give the anime a lot more entertainment to it. One thing i'd like to point out was the detail given to the entire environment that they were in. You can definitely feel the sea side thanks to the detail in moss on the walls, to the waves moving and animals surrounding it. With all the praise i'm giving the art, it's not perfect. A lot of scenes aren't fluid due to the characters. They're all drawn beautifully, but all lack facial expressions. They tend to have only one straight face through out the entire scene except for the occasional angry face, or confused face. \\n\\n\r\nClassical music has always been one of the things I love listening to and this anime has a lot of it. The soundtrack for this anime is possibly one of its biggest strengths and things that keep it going. From the sound effects of the fragments to just the beach or animal sounds, the anime did a splendid job making you feel like you were there and brought life to anime. The voice acting was nothing too great, but actually wasn't bad at all. If the characters showed the emotions that the voice actors were giving off, it would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this anime is being judged much harsher than it deserves to be. It does have many flaws, but a lot of points to cover it up. This series is definitely a hit or a miss for many people, but also has bad timing of its production. With the previous anime of P.A works just ending and getting a lot of praise, you're given a lot of expectation for their next work to be of the same caliber. Then with the strong line up that this Summer season has had, from Barakamon to SAO 2, you have something that lacks from the pack and is being pointed out on all of it's flaws. I think anyone can like this or have an unbiased opinion going into this, if they don't compare it to something else, cause this is it's own anime. It's not suppose to be a copy of something else.",

            "content": "\"Glasslip,\" a Slice-of-Life with the potential for greatness, crashed and burned.\r\nI'll admit I was looking forward to \"Glasslip\" this season. The art seemed clean and fresh, and an anime with a nice concept. Not only was I cruelly deceived by the anime's initial summary, but was completely caught off guard once some supernatural elements were added into the storyline.\r\nLet's talk a little voice actors, shall we? Touko got to be voiced by the lovely Seria Fukagawa (Aloalo [Happiness Charge Precure!]). She has actually only had two roles so far in the anime industry. It is a pity this had to be one of her jobs--nevertheless,she did a marvelous job! Her voice captured Touko's innocence and rather rude bluntness perfectly. Although a bit annoying at times, Fukagawa has a sharp feminine voice that's sure to land her more jobs. Moving onto Kakeru, he is voiced by Ryota Ohsaka (Marco [Attack on Titan). No longer is he a blue haired idol, a wimpy teenager in charge of a deadly mecha, or a dead man (too soon?). Meet Ohsaka, reborn as emotionally fragile, perhaps emotionless, but probably depressed Kakeru! Ohsaka uses his breathy voice to play out all the emotions very well. His voice perfectly fits the role, and I feel he did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile \"Glasslip\" had the potential to become something great, it stopped in the middle of character development and decided to say 'Hey, let's add that people can see the future!' Which turns out to not even be the future at all. Confusing? I know. Most anime fans watching this show were desperately in need of manly explanations, and were probably thinking 'P.A. Works, what the hell are \ufeffyou thinking?!' The relationships between characters especially seemed forced. Touko went from being slightly interested in Kakeru, to liking him, to hating him, back to liking him, and then...it's just left hanging. Other relationships form in the series, some expected, others not, but character development was definitely not one of the leading factors to the show. Suffice to say, I was not happy with this anime. But not only was the story confusing, but it seemed like the animation quality degraded around the third episode. It regained its grace in the lat couple of episodes, but for a moment there I was seriously wondering why the characters' eyes were so lopsided and their bodies so undefined. The backgrounds were very detailed though. Along with the fantastical, magical, supernatural things that never gets explained. It all leads me back to my very first complaint; What are these fragments of the future?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, if you like confusing animes who use up all their budget on backgrounds and magical swirls in people's eyes, then you will enjoy this anime very much! However, I'm not sure a lot of people want to be left hanging with their questions never answered. But if that's your cup of tea, then have at it.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nThe story is poorly executed, diverting from a potentially good storyline to just a god-awful combination of random thoughts. If the aim was to show the chaos going through a child's head before they become an adult, then that was inadequately done. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art started out as wonderful, but in the middle of the series it seemed like all the budget was spent on the backgrounds. Bodies were weirdly shaped, eyes were oddly positioned, and it was just a few degrees short from a mess. However, the animation quality got back up in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7\\n\r\nThe music was good. The opening was pleasant, and followed the Slice-of-Life theme. The ending was also cute, reflecting Touko's innocence. However, the music wasn't amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nThere was little development, and that's what is always necessary for a good score. There were some romance themes going on, but the main characters' romance seemed a bit forced. It went from interest, to love, to hate, back to a more hesitant love, and then it was just left hanging. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nFor being an anime I had really looked forward to, it disappointed me, and watching the episodes became a chore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.4\\n\r\nAs previously stated, and I will state again, this anime had lots of potential to be a really sweet Slice-of-Life with a bit of romance mixed in. Instead, Supernatural elements are thrown in, and I'm not even sure if it's meant to be taken literally, or if it's all just a metaphor for a teenager struggling to grow up. This anime was a definite hit and miss for me.",

I'm going to real talk you here. No one realizes that it's a set up as you're watching this. I was sure it was gonna be good even up to episode 11, but it dawns on you, episode 12 and 13 make it allto obvious. You've been baited.\\n\\n\r\nDon't Watch this. Please. Please, don't watch this.

Touko Fukami hangs out with her friends at a cafe called Kazemichi. The story at first sound interesting just when Touko sees the future by looking at the glass. However, this wasn't brought up again in the remaining episodes. The rest of the episodes are Touko hanging out with her friends.\r\nIt basically seems that everyone is doing their daily lives with no consequential events that happen. Everything in this anime is insubstantial. \r\nART (6):\r\nAs always from PA Works, the animation is serene and beautifuljust like the sea. However, the animation wasn't fully utilized to its full potential which became a bit stilted. Recycle animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThey use classical music in the anime itself, without coming up with their own music. The opening and ending song were good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (3):\\n\\n\r\nThere was barely any development from the characters or backstory. The characters that I liked are Yanagi Takayama and Hiro Shirozaki. However, it is sad that they have not enough screen time compared to Touka and Yukinari.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan, the chicken is also an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Touka and Kakeru is that they are bland characters, there wasn't any substance between them. I know they hang out and build a relationship but that relationship has to have some meaning behind it. However, it wasn't explained in the later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI barely remember all the casts.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, Touko's \"EEEEHHHH\" is the most hilarious line I have heard from her.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nTraditional storytelling is setting up a character, sending them on their journey and learning more about them. Glasslip, this anime is just chess-piece storytelling. Characters goes here, there and back and forth with no reason or meaning.\\n\\n\r\nPA Works, you have done good anime in the past, why suddenly you didn't put much effort in this anime? Even if it's a slice-of-life, you need to put in charisma and flare between the characters just like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun did. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a well executed comedy with great characters. What made Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun awesome is their relationship makes sense and the comedy is well-executed. In this anime Glasslip, characters are just going through their daily lives as if nothing had happened. I will not tolerate lazy work even if it's a slice-of-life anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "When I read the description of Glasslip on AniChart while picking shows to watch for the summer season, I was hoping for a more casual anime (meaning believable, realistic circumstances - a change of pace from what I usually watch) which focused on a young girl's dreams to become a glass artisan.  However, that's not the case.  We have seen very little time of glasswork at all.  Furthermore, in the five of thirteen episodes of Glasslip that have aired thus far, the show has failed to capitalize on what it has to work with - albeit not much for how much timethis anime wastes on situations which do nothing for the progression of the story, cliche love polygons and the main character's (Touko) ability to see the future.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nWhat makes this story poor?  There is very little story that exists in Glasslip so far, and for what story does exist, it's poorly paced.  I'm okay if a SoL is slow paced, but because of how poorly paced this show is, something's probably going to wind up incomplete, or leave gaping plotholes.  The story that exists so far is cliched love polygons that still don't seem to matter - in fact, nothing in this anime seems to matter so far.  As I jokingly said to a friend I'm watching the anime with \"it's as if Glasslip makes it a point to make everything meaningless.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation seems to be where most of the budget for this show went.  This anime is eye candy.  High detailing and a lot of stylization exists all of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nNo complaints to be made about the sound quality.  The voice actors and actresses match the emotion of the characters in the animation well, and the sound quality is crisp and clean.  There's nothing that makes this sound distinct amongst production of other animes.  Regarding the music, nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\r\nTouko is the only character who has had any character development that the anime makes out that you're supposed to think is important? - honestly I can't even fucking tell man.  This anime's writing is a train wreck all around.  Anyways, she can see into the future through a trigger, shiny objects such as glass, and she likes to draw chickens.  Honestly, the bike that falls over when Touko is confessed to by forgettable-character-whatever-his-name-is, that bike has more character development than most of the characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, check this bike out: http://38.media.tumblr.com/7691e6ddb1be8a9ff7d41604c734a5c3/tumblr_n8l3bl7k101syr5r5o1_r1_400.gif\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nI'm only watching this show because I'm watching it with a friend while it's airing.  If we weren't pointing out the obvious flaws in the writing most of the time and laughing at it, we probably wouldn't be watching it even then.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nThis score is still too high, but in the 5 catagories, it was carried by animation and sound, even though the sound is only on par.  Really, don't waste your time watching Glasslip.  Hell, School Days probably is better than this just because the direction of the show wasn't so fucking obscure.\\n\\n\r\nI'll update this review later on when the Glasslip has finished airing if the show changes any in story quality and character development.",

            "content": "SPOILERS UP TO EPISODE 6 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\r\nHow P.A. works disappointed me:\r\nWhen I started watching this I was confused why this show received such an undeserved horribly low rating (even kiss x sis had a better score, srsly ppl?). However episode 6\u2019s drama really unclouded my judgement as a PA works\u2019 fanboy and made me realizes how much of a mess this is.\r\nSTORY\r\nEach episode generally composes of scenery porn, walking, the occasional chicken, and the show diligently trying to keep the plot from progressing. We are half way through and nothing has been revealed about the tacked on supernatural element whether its importance tothe characters or why do those characters have it. You would think they would develop at least SOMETHING if they are not developing the characters.  I wish they had spent less time for the characters attempting to meet up somewhere to talk, because apparently the theme of saving your mobile credit is more important.\\n\\n\r\nI actually quite enjoyed the earlier episodes because of its relaxing slice of life nature along with living vicariously in a perfectly gender balanced group of  friends that I never had. Alas, that peace was ruined thanks to the poorly executed drama followed by the revelation of why these characters are bad.\\n\r\nIn the followings list I will attempt to explain why:\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nYukinari \u2013 Possessive, jealous, sulky and somewhat violent. Seriously needs to learn to accept things and control his emotions. His emotions are probably one of the most forced and overreacted and thus became a catalyst for this bad melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Kakeru Stoic-kun \u2013 The show tried so hard in making him mysterious that there has been absolutely no backstory about him, his family situation, his childish back-yard camping habits, his foresight ability and its significance to him as well as his ability to tolerant listening to the same song over and over again. I was thoroughly disappointed to realize he had feelings for Touko despite my denial of their romantic undertone. His interest for Touko wasn\u2019t evident in his emotions at all. His advancements towards Touko such as inviting her to that forest were straightforward but misleading and that I honestly couldn\u2019t tell what his intentions were romantic or is he just interested in her power. His way of thinking also makes no logical sense to me from his wise philosophy of chickens\u2019 feelings to his roundabout way in provoking Yuki with the race to receive a reaction from Touko. Even he himself admitted he had no clue why he did that.  Probably one of the messiest characterization of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHiro \u2013 A slick and smooth talking sonuvabitch that\u2019s scoring chicks left and right. Maybe if he didn\u2019t wear a girl\u2019s hair band he would get even more girls. Honestly what\u2019s his and sachi significance in the show?\\n\\n\r\nSachi \u2013 Emotionless yuki nagato clone but actually not emotionless because she likes to constantly smile politely? But we all know she\u2019s secretly and sadistically stringing along Hiro with the friend zone leash\\n\\n\r\nYanagi \u2013 Her actions actually made logical sense and I could understand her intentions as well as her emotions. Although her unwavering affection for yuki displayed in Ep 6 despite his aggressive tendencies brews concern as a domestic violence victim.\\n\\n\r\nTouko \u2013 Your everyday oblivious moe character. She is the type of girl to tell a nice guy to not change because she likes them for who they are but then friend zones them and run off in the sunset with the bad boy on a motorbike. Although I can\u2019t say that Yuki is a \u2018nice\u2019 guy but just her urging Yuki to confess but backfiring and her not knowing what to do annoys me. Mainly because of how contradictory she is and that using the excuse of a character being overly oblivious to other people\u2019s feelings is getting quite old. Another example in episode six is that despite the fact that Kakeru treated her friends like crap and wagers Touko and Yanagi like possessions with Yuki in a race, she still decided to side with him. Her lack of ability to understand her own feelings is frustrating and really slows down the pace of the show. Her interest for Kakeru is not justified well enough even if she shares a similar ability with him.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude in a tl;dr version of why I am disappointed. Characters are poorly established, there is no chemistry or justifications for their affection for each other. Kakeru is a very poorly written character with zero percent emotions and background thus making the audience difficult to understand him and his motivation. The pacing is also very slow. However, that animation and kawaii desu anime girl designs tho.",

            "content": "After seeing a lot of good romance animes this year such as Nagi no Asukara, Golden Time, Ao Haru Ride, I thought romance/Slice-of-Life anime this year would be great, that is why I gave a shot at Glasslip, believing that there would be some quality in this work, after all it is the work of Kenji Horikawa producer of Angel Beats, I mean c'mon this must be good!\r\n... Boy I was wrong...\r\n  After watching each of the 13 episodes, I felt more confused than when I started the anime, but let's break it down\r\n~CONTAIN SPOILERS~\r\n- Story - 1/10\r\n  The plot startswhen a new transfer student David arrives to the small town where this group of friends are just beginning their summer vacation. Ok it isn't horrible at this point, it pretty much starts like any other cliche anime. So let's begin the reasons why this anime went downhill.\\n\\n\r\n  This anime is all about the development of relationships throughout the summer vacation.\\n\\n\r\n  The main characters David and Touka become 'friends' i think (because i still don't know what they are) and both them have this strange connection regarding these ''future fragments''. I thought the show would spin around this theme but it doesn't and you at least expect the show to explain what these are, well they don't as well. Not only that but you discover somewhat in the anime that even the characters don't know what these fragments are...\\n\\n\r\n  The other 4 remaining engage in their relationships throughout the anime but at the end ALL relationships seemed not to have change... So... You might ask... What exactly happens during the anime, the answer is nothing. Not only you end confused but the story doesn't actually develop from where it started.\\n\\n\r\n  Not only that but most of the time (especially in the last episodes) you stay disoriented in most conversations along the anime. It only helps you get more lost than you were.\\n\\n\r\n- Character -  2/10\\n\\n\r\n  The show itself provides next to no character development or information about the past... I think the most that I learned from the past of character was from Yukinari and that he hurt his knee one day and couldn't run as well as he did... But that is it. So let's the characters:\\n\\n\r\n  Firstly there is Touko, who doesn't do much in the show even though she is supposed to be the main character along with David. She pretty much spends the whole anime thinking what are the future fragments, and in the end she doesn't even understand it...\\n\\n\r\n  Then there is the weirdest character of the whole summer line-up(might have exaggerated a bit) he is the main cause along with Touko to why you can't understand the dialogues, it seems like he has some deep understanding and knowledge by the way he talks, again No. Plus, he is just plain weird... Sleeps in a tent outside his house, i mean c'mon ...\\n\\n\r\n  Now one of the characters that most surprised me during the whole series, and that is Sachi. At first you just see common sick bookworm girl that uses glasses, very common. But then she suddenly turns into the most manipulative character in the series, and in a way that will only get pissed. Not only that it seemed, for me, that she was breaking up with her ''boyfriend'' while making a confession to another character, lol what!?... yeah this is the part that surprised me.   \\n\\n\r\n  Then there is Yukinari, which at first seemed a well rounded character, but then as the show passed turned into a boring depressive character after getting rejected, and he pretty much stays like that from mid to end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n  Next up, is Yanagi which was pretty much was simple character...  At first during the show she seemed jealous of Touko because Yukinari had confessed his feelings for her best friend not her. But then tries to act all grown up like doesn't care and it stays like that until the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n  Lastly, there is Hiro which is by far my favorite character of the show along with some support characters. The reason why he is my favorite is just because he was the most sane person in the group, and that had some pretty interesting interactions with the other characters, such as Sachi when she does something to harm DavidxTouko's  relationship. And that is it.\\n\\n\r\n- Art/Animation - 5/10\\n\\n\r\n  Even though the anime sucked, I got give some points in the art, nothing that stands out though... It doesn't match up to Nagi no Asukara, another work of P.A. Works but still it wasn't to shabby to complain. Even though, most of the show was slow and focused on the weird dialogues, the art compensated it.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  Indisputably the best part of the anime. The OP/ END were nice, along with the OST's throughout the anime, but nothing remarkable as well.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 1/10\\n\\n\r\n  Didn't enjoy the show at all, mostly because the show was pretty horrible. But also because I didn't feel anything throughout the show sadness, laughter (being aside the part with Touko's Sister =D that cracked me up) anything at all...\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 1/10\\n\\n\r\n  The show purely sucked a lot. I just can't believe something like this was created by the same producer of Angel Beats! And that P.A. Works responsible for the animation of Nagi no Asukara and Angel Beats! agreed to make this...\\n\\n\r\n  I am astonished that no one looked at the script and the final result of the project and said ''Yeah this sucks ass hard, are we really making this?'' (Sorry for the rudeness but that is pretty much what the show is)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Glasslip. I really did. The first few episodes had me convinced that this would be a great series.\r\nUnfortunately, it was not to be.\r\nWhat's happening? Why is it happening? Who are these characters? Why do they all seem to have some kind of psychological complex? What are they talking about? Do they have real emotions? What the hell does that line mean? Where is the story? What's the point? Is this some deep, meaningful metaphor for living life?\r\nThese are all legitimate questions I asked while watching Glasslip. And I got zero answers. Glasslip makes no sense whatsoever and it appears thatwhatever story premise they were trying to establish simply got thrown aside so that they could include scenes like a girl \"confessing\" to both a girl and a guy, who both casually accept it and laugh it off, and lines like \"It's your fault Yuki isn't attractive anymore.\" Ooooh, mystifying.\\n\\n\r\nI stuck it out because I was half-expecting some kind of plot twist or other resolution that would tie everything together and finally make the show make sense. Nope, didn't get that either. Regarding the story, there is really nothing to say because it appears to be nonexistent beyond two people occasionally \"seeing the future.\" Don't be fooled--this plot device goes nowhere and apparently serves no purpose whatsoever. Regarding the characters, there is also nothing to say because they're all dull, wishy-washy, and they seem to be speaking in code 80% of the time because I have no clue what they're talking about.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, at least Glasslip is nice to look at. Unlike the characters themselves, the character designs are actually incredibly appealing. The seaside town where the show takes place is nothing short of beautiful, and each episode features several great-looking stills. The soundtrack is also very pleasant and is often more interesting than listening to what is actually happening on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Glasslip is probably one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory and I'm amazed that such a mess received a green-light for production. Avoid it like the plague.\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nTeenage romance is a hot topic in the anime world. Some shows are able to capture this phenomenon quite well (White Album 2, Clannad, etc.) while others miss the mark. But even those shows that don't hit that bulls-eye at least land somewhere on the board. Glasslip is a show that not only misses the board but also hits some stranger passing by, causing a huge debacle that mirrors the contents of this anime. This is quite arguably one of the worst ones I have ever seen.\r\nSTORY\r\nGlasslip begins in much the same way that Nagi no Asukara does.New transfer student David becomes friends with Touko. Touko then proceeds to introduce him to her main group of friends consisting of Yuki, Sacchi, Hiro, and Yanagi. Afterwards, the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by begins, I mean begins and doesn't move from that position. It's best to compare this to Nisekoi. Nisekoi is infamous for its absolutely abysmal plot progression. But the difference here is that in Nisekoi, that is the whole point of the show. Glasslip tries to have things move forward, tries to instill drama or emotion. Yet when it does, nothing ever comes of it. It is not a stretch to say that literally nothing happens over the course of the entire season. Every episode is a chore and doesn't have anything interesting attached to it aside from what the show calls \"future fragments.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat are \"future fragments?\" To be quite honest, I can't explain that to you. The show sets them up to be these premonitions that a couple of the characters have, but the problem is two-fold. One, it is never properly explained. As an audience member, I obtained some information about what could cause them but they never really made any sense as to why they occur or what purpose they serve. Two, they aren't even \"future fragments.\" As is learned later, the name it was given isn't even appropriate. Meaning for the majority of the show, I am left to believe that this \"power\" is somehow special or at the minimum has some focus to it. In reality, it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all this, Glasslip also contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen from a show. A lot of what the characters say is either nonsensical or just plain weird. When watching them, it is rather awkward because everything they say just doesn't feel like they should be saying it to one another. This is kind of hard to describe. It's as if the characters were holding conversations with themselves even though they were talking to someone right in front of them.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, it's important to know that the studio behind Glasslip is none other than P.A. Works. Recently, they have gained fame for their crisp animation and art style and interesting plots. Not only is the latter gone this time, but I argue so is the former.\\n\\n\r\nI give Glasslip one thing, that is that the art itself is gorgeous. The lighting is nice, the environments are pretty, and the character designs are modern.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is little to zero actual animation present. Credit to /u/tundranocaps (a reddit user) for pointing this out. When you actually sit down and watch the show, it becomes apparent that what goes on is just talking. This causes the characters to be rather stiff. They don't have to be, but the show chooses to usually only move their mouths during the majority of the scenes. So while the coffee shop might be very detailed, the characters' movements are definitely not.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, Glasslip employs this rather strange technique I call \"still frames.\" They started occurring more frequently as the show went on, but basically the entire frame/scene would freeze in an artistic fashion. Sometimes this would occur randomly when looking at a tree. But the worst offenders were when it would happen while the characters were interacting with one another. I don't know what compelled the studio to use this \"trick,\" but I found it to be rather lame and most of the time unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, and something a bit more personal, but I hate their mouths as well. Each mouth has a slight slant to it that makes each of the characters look as if they have some sort of facial defect. Not sure why they chose this, but just another thing to add to the hate pile.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip's characters, like its story, are rather atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nThe main group of friends constitutes the main cast. Starting with Touko, her character development does not go beyond the word, \"Ehhhhhh!?!\" I understand that she is confused by a lot of the things that are going on, such as \"future fragments\" or confessions towards her. However, if the only thing notable about your growth as a character is you repeating the same, grating line multiple times an episode, you are just a really bad character.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the worst character in the show is David (Kakeru). Seemingly Tsumugu's brother from Nagi no Asukara, David is extremely abstract and philosophical. He acts like a modern-day Plato, and for this reason, I completely hate not only his character but also this character type. I don't understand why P.A. Works enjoys it, but I cannot get behind someone who always has to spout something intellectual or only asks questions as opposed to giving answers.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Yuki, who early on actually seems to be one of the more sane ones. But in Glasslip-like fashion, he becomes a rather annoying character. After being rejected, he recedes into himself and for the rest of the show just runs. Literally the only thing you see him do is run from one point to another. Is this his way of dealing with things? Perhaps, but even if that is the case, I would much rather have that explained to me, rather than me having to make a guess as to how he is dealing with the situation. This is vital because the show doesn't have a plot, so it relies more heavily on its characters (meaning character interactions).\\n\\n\r\nSachi is an interesting girl. She is shown to have some type of illness, but like the \"future fragments,\" it serves zero purpose within the narrative. She can actually be quite manipulative despite her appearance, but she too fails to communicate properly with the other characters. So much so that she relies on roundabout ways in order to convey her feelings. Much like Yuki, this is fine, but rather strange for a girl seemingly in her teenage years.\\n\\n\r\nYanagi is Yuki's step-sister. And that should set a flag off almost immediately. Because, true to Japanese anime stereotypes, she falls for him. I do not like this type of development whatsoever, and I will never understand why it is so prevalent in Japanese culture. This is me being somewhat ignorant, I get that, but it just does not sit right with me. Besides her feelings, she is generally the most mature among the group, but even she has her strange moments too, such as walking around her house naked because she can.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character to go in-depth with is Hiro, the boy who has feelings for Sachi. Among everyone in the show, he is the most level-headed/makes the most sense. His actions are believable given what happens to him, and he never does anything extremely strange. Besides pining after the girl who doesn't necessarily see him the same way he does with her, he is actually realistic. That is pretty sad, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the mouths, my final point I want to say is that the rest of the cast is pretty bad except for Touko's dad and sister Hina. They were the only ones to make me smile during the show. Whether it was from their terrible dialogue or their actual funny moments, I appreciated having them there to keep me sane.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest part of Glasslip, its music is at least okay. The OP is somewhat nice due to its relaxing melodies and nice use of the guitar. The ED is okay. It reminds me of Hanasaku Iroha with its singing, and while the show tries to be dramatic, the ED instead is rather upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fine for what it is. Nothing stands out predominately but the tracks themselves are nice to listen to while watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, no outstanding performances are to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMany people started watching this show because it was tagged with the P.A Works label. And that's fine, because they have done a splendid job recently with all of their works. But something happened along the way with this one that just makes it hard to believe that it was made by the same studio that did NagiAsu, Hanasaku Iroha, and Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is never funny, its not dramatic as much as it tries to make itself seem, the characters are boring and unrealistic, and the story (for what is even present) makes no sense. While romance is abound in the show, I never cared for any of it. I love romance to death in anime, but the way everything was handled between the characters was so unbelievable that I didn't care if Touko ended up with David or Sachi with Hiro.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope P.A. Works reflects on this project. Glasslip was an attempt at something original. They certainly obtained this goal but it is definitely not the outcome that was desired.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, completely nonsensical\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, pretty yet mired with \"still frames\" and zero actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, characterization is non-present or extremely shallow\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, melodramatic and rather boring\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "What happened to my comfy slice of life series about glass blowing? I asked myself this question every single time I finished an episode and the ED started rolling. After somehow managing to finish this awful series about teenage angst, forced drama, and supernatural horseshit, I feel disappointed. Not only in this series, but also in myself. Somewhere deep inside me must reside a little masochist devil that enjoys watching me suffer through terrible anime. \r\nSaying that Glasslip had a story is laughable. It's as if the writing behind the series just patched together random ideas and put it on the screen. Even upon completionI don't understand what this series was trying to convey. Be shallow and fall for the good-looking, up-and-coming sociopath transfer student? Believe in and follow your delusions, which realistically seem like mental disorders, instead of hauling ass to the nearest doctor? I just don't know.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought my description of the story was bad, and that has somehow not put you off of this series yet (unless you've already suffered like I've suffered, God bless your soul), then this should do the trick. Let's talk characters. There are 6 important (who am I kidding?), main characters in Glasslip. They are: Touko, Kakeru, Yukinari, Sachi, Yanagi, and Hiro. Like most dramas and slice of life shows, the main driving force behind the series are its characters. However, with Glasslip, the only thing that will be driving is you. Off the nearest cliff.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is the main female lead of the series, who honestly seems like she's not all there mentally. Touko constantly spaces out, has little to no awareness of her surroundings, and easily has the lowest IQ out of all of her friends. Half her responses to trivial things is, \"EHHHHH!?\" and it reeks of such stupidity that it hurts my brain.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru, or \"David\", the emotionless transfer student, basically has no understanding of socially acceptable human interaction. Instead of easing his way into joining Touko's group of friends, like any normal person would, he acts like a condescending asshole. Big surprise! All of Touko's friends hate him. It doesn't help that he rarely says anything besides Touko this, Touko that, or it's my fault Touko feels sad. Want to get a restraining order filed on you? Follow Kakeru's detailed step-by-step examples.\\n\\n\r\nYukinari is an athletic guy that has some real apparent issues with catching hints and simply talking in general. He gets jealous easily, has a real douchebag attitude, and runs a lot. I think I could have gone to the store and bought a pair of Nikes \u2014 which would not have only been more enjoyable than Yukinari's character, but also more interesting \u2014 and gained more entertainment value. Nikes also won't complain or get angry about their running performance either, so that's another big plus. \\n\\n\r\nYanagi is an alright character, though still pretty bland and generic. She seems normal enough compared to the others, which isn't saying much, but also still has problems of her own. She's got the hots for her step-brother and is extremely quick to jump to his defense whenever someone even hints at what an imbecile he is. I swear Japan, something is wrong with you and your infatuation with brother-sister relationships.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really understand how Sachi even became friends with the rest of the group. All she does is read books, for the most part. She rarely attends the group activities because she has some sort of unexplained illness and rarely says anything of value. Apparently nobody seems to care that she lies to them and tries to play little, deceitful games to get what she wants either. Solid 10/10 would befriend material.\\n\\n\r\nHiro, you still haven't figured out that Sachi is a lesbian? You poor bastard.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters in this entire show, there were only a handful that stood out when given their time to shine. They felt like realistic portrayals of what they would be like in real life, which was a big surprise to me. I feel like screen time was lost on all of the 'main' characters when these guys were pushed off to the side and ignored for the majority of the show. Here's some insight as to why they were so great:\\n\r\n\u2611 Character interaction: As realistic as it gets. \\n\r\n\u2611 Voice acting: Morgan Freeman-narrating-a-documentary-tier.\\n\r\n\u2611 Character design: Can't even tell they're 2D. \\n\r\nSo, without further ado, let's give a big round of applause to Jonathan, Husserl, Confucius, Roger, and Makuzu, the school chickens. \\n\\n\r\nThe only positive thing I have to say about Glasslip is that the OST is decent. I like classical music and most of the OST consisted of it, at least from what I recall. The animation for this series felt pretty lacking in comparison to P.A. Work's last scenery porn project Nagi no Asukara. There was a frequent use of stills, which was strange to me. It's 2014, come on now. The studio barely did any notably good animation for this series. Just how low was the budget?\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't already tell, I did not enjoy Glasslip. On a positive note, Glasslip does do something right aside from the OST. It gives perspective on what a bad series is. Comparatively, you can now probably say \"(insert series name here) was better than that piece of shit Glasslip!\" and therefore adjust your ratings accordingly.",

            "content": "When I think of Glasslip, the show reminds me of a candle melting. At first, the fire shines strong and bright. Then, as time goes on, it slowly burns itself out and eventually into ashes. Honestly, Glasslip isn\u2019t too different. It\u2019s a show that started off with a decent premise but slowly burn itself out. Glasslip doesn\u2019t induce creative drama, laudable realism, or a genuine slice of life. Rather, it\u2019s an empty series that is misguided by its story and characters that almost makes us feel sorry for what it created. Well, almost.\r\nProduced by P.A Works with director Junji Nishimura involved, it\u2019s no surprise thatthe show share some similar gimmicks with True Tears. The series is a standalone running 1-cour (13 episodes) that isn\u2019t based off of any source material. Yet, this show exists as a confusion. And by that, I mean the show doesn\u2019t really know what to do with itself. For a show that starts off with an intriguing premise, it quickly loses its way by turning it into some teenage abominable drama that is unable to capitalize on any of its composed ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off simple at first with a small cast of main characters - Touko, Hiro, Sachi, Yanagi, Yukinari, and Kakeru. Five of them are already friends who have known each other for some time. The one oddball out would be Kakeru, a transfer student. The catch is that he didn\u2019t come to town to study or follow a dream. Rather, he came with the reasoning that something in the future ties him together with Touko. As strange as it sounds, Glasslip essentially tries to adapt with an idea relating to the of future. The early episodes heavily implies that Touko is actually able to see into the future through pieces of glass. I suppose this is where the title of the show comes from as Touko has this supernatural-like ability. However, the show neglects most of this concept. Instead, Touko focuses more on her own interpersonal relationship with others. Sure, there are times when Touko is concerned about possible events of the future through these supposed premonitions. However, most of that is discarded instead for clich\u00e9-riddled teenage drama where romance takes over and story sinks down the drain.\\n\\n\r\nA question that popped into my mind is \u2018why would this series beget into such a weak story with a cyclone of generic clich\u00e9s?\u201d The answer is simple as the show focuses more on relationships rather than story. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of romance the show is trying to accomplish though. It seems almost everyone has a crush on someone but nothing is reciprocated. One particular confession actually implies semi-yuri undertones or if it can be called that relating to Sachi. Nonetheless, the relationship is unworthy with so much drama going on. Actually, I wouldn\u2019t of mind it if the show has realism but the supernatural element relating to future premonition derives from that. No, rather than realism, Glassip\u2019s relationship dynamics focuses on formulaic and flawed logic that makes little sense at times. Love confessions are delivered with little development. Even if there was, I would call it as sappy because it lacks compatibility. There\u2019s little relevance to some of the relationships. For instance, Touko and Kakeru seems to have some connections not based on similarities but more on fate. The breakdown is that there\u2019s little foreshadowing while others seems to also get involved whilst making their relationship lacking. In the end, there really are concerns about what this show is trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t any better when it tries to explain the premise. Apparently, the tagline reads as \u201c\"On the other side of the glass, you can see tomorrow.\u201d But really, what I can see is more like days by days going by with horrid development. The show fails to keep up what it tries to do with poor momentum. There\u2019s also a sense of false advertisement when initial viewers may lead to believe on character building. If the series decided to focus on establishing a future of their characters (such as say, a career as an artisan), then I\u2019d be content. But what it offers is nothing of such sort as the realization about this show is focused on love drama. And even when it comes down to that, the drama lacks convincing themes. There\u2019s little focus on the motivations of the characters either. It shifts from character to character that with little credibility on back stories. In fact, back stories are hardly dealt with. In essence, it leaves most viewers in the dark on what we may really know about the characters. It creates that illusionary image that the show depicts slice of life but in reality is more like a generic teenage drama without fluency. There\u2019s just too much going on without proper explanation that creates a stab in the heart. Even True Tears had some parts that people can relate and knew what it was doing at times. However, this show disconnects from reality by relying on its fantasy tropes in inadequate balancing between fiction and reality. To be honest, that\u2019s almost laughable. I only give credit for a few moments when emotional drama induces real dilemma. But even then, its forced dialogues can be an annoyance. By the time the show tries to wrap up everything together, it feels like a point where there\u2019s no redemption as result of weak buildup. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no Nagi no Asukara but this show nailed its technical artwork when it comes to artwork. P.A. Works creates visual porn with the backgrounds including its countryside atmosphere, the sea coastlines, and natural mountains. It feels like nostalgic and brings a melody that makes you feel like a kid all over again. Character designs are generic but maintains balance especially with accessories that some of the girls are wearing. Nonetheless though, artwork is a strong point of Glasslip for its ability to convey communication through gestures. There are also minimal fan service as most of the show relies on more innocence and youth. More importantly, seasonal changes adaptation such as Spring and Winter depicts sincerity with what it\u2019s trying to do. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough not as strong as the artwork, the soundtrack of the show definitely stands above the shallow relationships that the series tried to craft. Melancholy is a main theme played throughout the show with quiet moments when characters convey their thoughts or feelings. More emotional scenarios has piano-like tunes playing in the backgrounds to show what characters are going through. Occasional comical comments are less noticeable but still makes sense more than the main story. I give some praise to both the OP and ED songs for keeping with its melancholic style. Finally, we have the character voice mannerisms of the main cast. I find little to talk about for this section since none of them really stand out at all. The girls often has that dramatic voice that is pushy with valley girl-like tones. The guys aren\u2019t worth praise either as most of them hardly has a voice that are worth remembering. Kakeru\u2019s voice easily wants me to forget what he says because of his personality while Touko\u2019s expressive voice sounds like an emotional teen who is worried about almost everything. Oh wait, she is.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what exactly is Glasslip? Surely, it at least has the word \u2018glass\u2019 as part of the show so naturally, we see its usage. The problem is the pacing and balance between what it\u2019s trying to accomplish. For a slice of life show, the fantasy trope doesn\u2019t fit in. If they wanted to focus on relationship building, then at least keep the momentum going. No, instead the show decides to jump around everywhere between characters. In retrospect, the show digs itself further and further into oblivion. Its lackluster comedy and love dramas are questionably unfavorable that can leave a bad taste in a viewers\u2019 mouth. I\u2019m not questioning the drama as some parts of it does command attention. But ultimately, this show is a stinker to what slice of life is. Besides visual porn quality and a tolerable soundtrack, Glasslip is a depressing show to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd no, I\u2019m not even talking about sadness as an emotion. It\u2019s more like how sad this show has fallen apart while burning away like a candle\u2026.\\n",

            "content": "You know there's something wrong with an anime about romance when the most interesting character is an ordinary freaking CHICKEN.\r\nSpoiler alert.\r\nGlasslip is an anime that takes place during a summer about a group of friends in high school. A transfer student, Kakeru, moves to the town in the first episode and starts to make friends with the main character, Touko. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all there is to say about this anime. Nothing interesting happens. At all.\r\nTo see where everything goes wrong with this garbage, let's first consider the characters, and then the story:\r\nTouko is the main character of this anime, and she's a usuallycheerful girl who has feelings for Kakeru, and she experiences some sorts of visions sometimes. That's all there is to say about her. She's a profoundly uninteresting character.\\n\r\nKakeru is a \"mysterious\" and cold student who also has visions and likes Touko. The most notable thing about him is that he's a schizophrenic who sees other versions of himself. He could be a very interesting character, but the writers never took the chance to explore his past and develop him very well.\\n\r\nYanagi is Touko's friend who takes dance classes and has a crush on her step-brother Yukinari. She seems cheerful most of the time. I have nothing else to say about this boring character.\\n\r\nYukinari is Yanagi's step-brother who likes to run and has a crush on Touko. He ends up punching Kakeru simply because Kakeru asked him if Yanagi confessed to him. In real life, you'd think he's justified in being angry at Kakeru for taking away his crush, but if you watch the scene, it's just so out of place and robotic that it doesn't really make any sense at all.\\n\r\nSachi is a frail girl who has a lesbian crush on Touko and a crush on  a dude named Hiro. She doesn't like Kakeru and plots to separate him from Touko. But she doesn't really do anything unfortunately.\\n\r\nHiro is a guy who always smiles and has a crush on Sachi. To get Sachi's attention, he reads books. That's all I have to say about him.\\n\r\nJonathan is a chicken who lives in the school. He seems to be a surprisingly intelligent chicken. The screen flashes to him after Kakeru and Touko kiss for the first time in episode 10, and for some reason he follows Touko around right before she kisses Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nI think the main problem with the characters is that every single character is like a robot with no depth whatsoever. You really can't think of anything else to say about them apart from that they're cheerful or cold, depending on the character, because they just have no depth. We seldom see any deep emotional reactions from any of the characters. The most emotionally charged scene, in which Yukinari punches Kakeru, is so robotic and strange that it seems completely out of place. It doesn't seem like any of these characters act like real people. If you pay attention to Yanagi jogging, even her breathing while they exercise sounds robotic and too much in rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the main problem with the story. Nothing ever really happens. Here's a list of all the important events in every episode:\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Kakeru moves to the town\\n\r\nEpisode 2: Yukinari confesses to Touko\\n\r\nEpisode 3: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 4: Touko admits she likes Kakeru\\n\r\nEpisode 5: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 6: Yukinari punches Kakeru\\n\r\nEpisode 7: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 8: Yanagi walks around naked in her house for no reason other than fanservice, but it's a good scene. You get a full-frontal view (without nipples of course).\\n\r\nEpisode 9: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 10: Nothing\\n\r\nEpisode 11: It's brought up that Kakeru is considering leaving the town. Nothing else of importance happens.\\n\r\nEpisode 12: Touko experiences a day in alternate-reality-world. Nothing happens though.\\n\r\nEpisode 13: It's not known if Kakeru decides to leave or not. The ending is open-ended. Apart from that, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a massive chore to watch each episode because the anime doesn't try to keep you interested at all. Every scene is meaningless and emotionless and pointless. I often have to spend every episode browsing my phone simply because I can't force myself to watch this anime without any form of stimulation.\\n\\n\r\nSide-stories are completely and casually abandoned by the writers with no conclusion whatsoever. Yukinari's crush on Touko is a perfect example of this. You'd expect stuff like Yukinari punching Kakeru to have some importance in the story and cause some bad-blood between them for the episodes to come. Not at all! In this anime, Yukinari completely forgets that Touko exists half way through and this plot point is just abandoned by the writers. It's never of any importance again. Similarly, Sachi's quest to remove Kakeru from Touko's life due to a lesbian crush has almost no relevance to the story. It's mentioned only once or twice and never again. Another example of this is the visions that Touko has. We find out in episode 12 that they seem to involve an alternate reality. But what are they? Why do Touko and Kakeru have them? Who knows, it's never explained. \\n\\n\r\nGlasslip is a boring, pathetic excuse for a romance anime that should be avoided. It's so boring that you can't even call it a \"so bad it's good\" anime. Because watching each episode is even more boring than counting blades of grass and watching paint dry on the wall: if there's nothing to laugh at while watching paint dry on the wall, why would you get any sort of enjoyment out of watching this garbage?",

            "content": "Like a light summer breeze, Glasslip, which looked to be a tranquil slice-of-life, floated onto the summer anime scene.\r\nLike summer itself, Glasslip was something that many viewers, including me, looked forward to. I think a lot of us were weaned on the gorgeous visuals, intricate plot, and superb character development found in Nagi no Asukara, which was created by the same studio that made Glasslip. A very sparse summary and teaser video only served to increase the enthusiasm for Glasslip. What I expected was another wonderfully drawn anime with a touch of supernatural and profound character progression.\r\nThere was just one thing that was, as Iwould discover, incredibly erroneous in that assumption.\\n\r\nWell, you know how it works! Keep reading for a flow of text; scroll down for categorizing through numbers. Read both if you like, but information can and will be repeated between the two sections. \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe key word is \u2018progress\u2019.\\n\r\nNow, see, I don\u2019t have a huge problem with slice-of-life, but one would hope to see significant changes in the characters and the plot. Glasslip is characterized by an utter lack of character development. I\u2019m upset that I wasted my time watching this anime ( which my friends have termed \u2018Glasshit\u2019 ); I think the reason why I ended up watching the whole thing is that I hoped something would happen. In the first few episodes, it seemed like some interesting events would take place; it was that hope for something to change that kept me going through the tortuous second half of the series. My hopes were only to be dashed into shards of glass at the end, as the finale tried to put on the premise of being deep and philosophical but just ended up being really confusing.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit difficult for me to write a review for this anime without venting my frustration, so to temper that, I\u2019ll state that Glasslip isn\u2019t horrible through-and-through. The art, as expected, ranks among the best I\u2019ve seen in an anime. The characters have decently attractive personalities for perhaps the first several episodes. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful ( and I loved the addition of classical music ). The issue with Glasslip is that it tries too hard and then fails miserably. Perhaps I should compare it to Icarus? I simply imagine that PA Works tried to follow up on Nagi no Asukara but ended up creating a disaster. All the right elements were there in a complete disarray. I think that everything in Glasslip could have been adjusted to have worked better, and it would have been a great story. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. \\n\r\nAnd I\u2019ll concede that there will be people who like this anime. I actually have a friend who loved Glasslip ( and even compared it to a Miyazaki film, which provoked some skeptical reactions from me ), which helped give me a perspective into the, albeit few, good aspects of the series. So, if you really do want to give this anime a try, don\u2019t expect any plot development, but it is a slice-of-life and a romance in which basically everyone falls in love with each other at some point or another. The art is superb, the soundtrack equally so. Slice-of-life with a hint of fantasy is what I would describe Glasslip as if I enjoyed it. \\n\r\nBut I do have substantial reason to believe that most people disliked Glasslip. A small anecdote-\\n\r\nMy mom watches Chinese dramas.\\n\r\nUsually, she starts by watching the first one or two episodes.\\n\r\nThen, she skips right to the very end and watches the last episode.\\n\r\nPart of it is to conserve time [ after all, Chinese dramas can drag on for a very long time ], but she's said that honestly, there isn't much she's missing by not watching the bulk of the series. From the ending, she can pretty much piece together everything that happened.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the same thing, sadly, applies to Glasslip. It's a pity; I really wanted to like this anime and I had high expectations based off of what I had seen from P.A. Works before. What makes an anime more interesting than others is that way of making the viewers second-guess themselves, to get absorbed into the characters and then find that not everything plays out as they expected. That's something that P.A. Works achieved with Nagi no Asukara, but for some reason, they fell short here, using hackneyed storylines and characters so predictable that watching them interact incredibly boring. \\n\r\nThe relationships in Glasslip are largely forced. The romance comes out of nowhere, especially between Touko and Kakeru. If I were to sugar-coat things, I would call it spontaneous, but really, I\u2019m just going to call it utterly unprecedented. Their relationship basically goes from \u201cyou remind me of a Renaissance statue and I enjoy chickens\u201d to \u201clet\u2019s spend the night together in a school\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m all for hilarious or unconventional boy-meets-girl ( or vice versa ) situations, but after that, there was really no relationship development to merit their decision to go out with each other. One would imagine that they would be united by a common power that they share...but really, that power contributes to more awkwardness between the two, and thus I really don\u2019t understand where their relationship comes from.\\n\r\nI could rant about Touko and Kakeru\u2019s relationship all day, but let\u2019s talk about everyone else. I think the most genuine person here is Hiro, who actually shows that he likes Sachi and acts on it. And, following from that, I was interested to see a possibly? bi character in this anime, but turns out that she\u2019s incredibly jealous and rude to everyone. But with a sickly glasses-girl trope, it seems like Glasslip is trying to compensate and thus make you feel sorry for her instead of hate her. Ah, but to no avail. I expected a tragic or angst aspect involving Sachi, but really, she just sat in her hospital bed and brooded like an old witch over how to destroy everyone\u2019s lives. Come on, you could have just killed her. That would have been more character development than evidenced by anyone else in the entire series. \\n\r\nYanagi and Yukinari are a strange pair; I thought that Yanagi\u2019s attraction to her stepbrother was incestuous until I found out about their relationship a little too late for my own good. But anyway, I really don\u2019t think that it benefits your relationship with your brother to be walking around the house naked ( I suppose that was for fanservice, but it was out-of-place and totally unwarranted ). Yukinari was my favorite at the beginning because I\u2019m always rooting for the underdog type, but...? He didn\u2019t come to terms with his romantic attractions for anyone; you would imagine that even a bit of closure might be attained by the end of the anime.\\n\r\nHaha, who am I kidding? Nobody comes to terms with their romantic attractions at the end. Watching the anime to see how the love isododecahedron plays out is absolutely fruitless. Everyone is still in love with the same people, nobody progresses except for Touko and Kakeru ( and in the end, that\u2019s also pointless ), and even though they try to take middling steps in the direction of forming relationships, nobody really learns from such experiences. At the end of Glasslip, everyone is largely the same as they were at the beginning. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s move on to a small snippet about the \u2018supernatural\u2019 element of this anime. Supernatural! Fantasy! It would probably be a crucial part of the plot, don\u2019t you think? \\n\r\nTurns out that the supernatural powers possessed by Touko and Kakeru are ab-so-lute-ly useless. Touko uses her power to just make everything worse; instead of using it to save the world or whatnot, she uses it to help, but actually ruin the teenage drama in her life. Kakeru uses his power to embrace his tent fetish and alienate his parents. I got fooled into thinking that something was happening when the supernatural powers revealed the premise of something dark, but...who am I kidding? Nothing happened, as expected. \\n\r\nSo, character development and plot development were a shame, but how about the other aspects of Glasslip? \\n\r\nI think I did mention before that I wholeheartedly enjoyed the art and soundtrack of Glasslip. Art first, look up pictures of Glasslip and you\u2019ll be treated to PA Works\u2019 wonderful art. The landscapes are impeccably drawn and detailed, and the lighting does a wonderful job in portraying a relaxed summer world looked at through a lens. I enjoyed the vivid and bright palettes of this anime; just looking at the screenshots of the scenery reminds me of summertime. The characters are drawn in the same style as those of Nagi no Asukara - big eyes, simple features. I would say that such a style doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone, but I do enjoy how many different tones and aspects of lighting were included in the eyes, and the characters were distinctly drawn such that I didn\u2019t have any trouble differentiating between them. The one fault in the art was those awkward still frames. What were they doing there? Where did they come from? ( cotton-eye joe? ) And you would imagine that such frames would be used for emphasis in important scenes...quite the contrary. They were seemingly randomly placed, which I found quite irritating. \\n\r\nSimilarly, the OP and ED also remind me of summer. I particularly enjoyed the opening theme, which has an acoustic guitar and background beat that definitely feels like a summer breeze ( though it may be because I listened to the song quite a bit during the summer ). The OST had quite a bit of classical music, including many pieces that I\u2019ve played before, so I was really enthusiastic about the music in Glasslip. Overall, in terms of setting the mood for the warm environment of the series, the art and soundtrack were wonderful toward that purpose. However, Glasslip also does a wonderful job of proving that a great soundtrack and art can\u2019t redeem a terrible anime, for at the end of the day, it\u2019s the plot and characters that stand out the most. \\n\r\nThis is precisely why- I\u2019m sorry to say- that I think Glasslip is one of the worst anime I\u2019ve ever seen. The infamous Sword Art Online had more interesting plot and character development than this series, which is to say that Glasslip had none of those things. If you\u2019re a sadist or you just really, really like slice-of-life anime, then maybe you would enjoy Glasslip. It\u2019s far from a lighthearted and easy watch, though, not because it\u2019s dark or depressing, but because it\u2019s frustrating to try and follow a nonexistent plot and sympathize with terribly developed characters. \\n\r\nOn that note, let\u2019s go on to a numerical analysis of Glasslip. ( I\u2019ll provide some statistics of my own- I dislike this series so much that I wrote all of what\u2019s here so far in about fifteen minutes at probably a record pace fueled by rage, and somehow I\u2019ve also managed to consume a pint of ice cream while doing so. ) \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nStory :: 3\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to give the creators a gold star for trying...\\n\r\nThe plot seemed interesting enough at first, and I was definitely excited to see what would unfold as the series progressed, but after around episode 5 or so, it became obvious that this story was going nowhere fast. The finale tried to put on the premise of being deep and philosophical but just ended up being really confusing. The issue here is that since Glasslip is a slice-of-life that centers around a group of friends, the character development is basically the plot. A pity that there was neither.\\n\\n\r\nArt :: 9\\n\r\nI\u2019ll have to dock a point here for the awkward still frames, but Glasslip, despite its shortcomings, retains PA Works\u2019 characteristic detail in visuals. The art really stands out in the parts involving a lot of scenery, with lighting portrayed perfectly. A vivid and cheerful palette lend themselves to the summery theme of Glasslip, which brings back nostalgic memories of the time when I wasn\u2019t trying to balance 6 APs, maintain good grades, and cram for college exams. The characters are attractively drawn, and I really enjoyed the amount of detail put into their eyes, which again lend to the suggestion that not everything is completely realistic in Glasslip ( like the fact that they expect us to believe that there\u2019s a plot ).\\n\\n\r\nSound :: 9\\n\r\nRelaxing classical music abounds in the OST, and the OP and ED were catchy and, like the art, give me that nostalgic summer feeling. This was one of the first anime in which I actually paid a lot of attention to the soundtrack, since I recognized a lot of songs ( having heard them or played them myself ). So, while the classical music portion was completely unrelated to the plot, I thought it was a nice touch and personally, I really enjoyed the music. In a romantic sense, Glasslip is a very peaceful anime ( in other words, nothing happens ), and I think that the classical music suits the relaxed setting and pace. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter :: 1\\n\r\nOh, god.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I wasn\u2019t going to go back and add anything to that, but anyway, the most outstanding feature of Glasslip is the lack of character development. I entered the anime hoping to see a heartwarming coming-of-age story and got characters who ended up being largely the same as they were at the beginning, even after facing fruitless romantic relationships. One by one, each character proved that they weren\u2019t misunderstood, just totally irredeemable. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that with this review, I\u2019ve sufficiently convinced you to not waste any of your time on this anime. But hey, people don\u2019t like being told what to do. To them, I say \u2018the best of luck to you\u2019! \\n\\n\r\nGanbatte\\n\r\n- palladia\\n",

            "content": "The hugely negative reviews that this show is getting is mainly because this show is aimed at a specific audience. it is neither flashy nor has twists and turns like many other anime. It is a slice of life, a very thin slice and not everyone can connect to it. In real life things do not progress fast. In real life you dont have stereotyped characters like tsunderes and danderes. In that way the characters in glasslip are very real. I do not understand why the wort of an anime or character is measured by how interesting backstory it has or the struggle of eachcharacter. Yes, those anime are inspirational and hit us hard but just because an anime caters to the ordinary people with ordinary life does not mean its bad. The artwork is brilliant in this anime btw and that is one point everyone agrees.\\n\r\nVerdict:- If you want a thriller, a plot with huge twists and turns, characters with backstory etc. stay away from this anime. If you want to enjoy mundane lifestyle and complex romantic love life of a few teenagers, this anime is for you. Personally I could connect a lot to this anime, it was almost like school life all over again and I believe many can.",

            "content": "Starting episode one of Glasslip, the impression is given that the journey you are about to partake will be artistic, dramatic, and truly memorable. This is to say, on the surface, Glasslip is all of these things. However, once you tie your laces and start down the slippery slope, the series proves to have none of the above characteristics. Instead, the anime leaves you severely starved of the deep, intriguing elements it tries sparingly to mimic. In short, the thirteen-episode production was a disappointment.\r\nDuring the first episode you are introduced to a gaggle of main characters, specifically, Touko and her party of five friends. Whenthe new kid comes to town--as one often does in manga and anime--the group decides to remove the 'no dating' rule, for some reason vaguely related to the new kid being apparently a fine piece of ass.\\n\r\nPredictably, one thing after another goes wrong, and while I can tolerate love triangles, the ones utilized in Glasslip were poorly handled and did not create satisfying conflict. \\n\r\nEach issue that arises is solved in an incredibly calming way that, instead of delivering relief, leaves you bored. No one develops any particular hate for another character, nor do any of the characters interact enough for unique relationships to form.\\n\\n\r\nMostly, I belief Glasslip was riding on the artistic portion of itself. This may have worked for the show, if not for the art being just as uncomfortable and even a touch sloppy.\\n\r\nWhile you are introduced to scenic backgrounds, clouds, glass and stills episode to episode, the characters themselves are left out to hang, complete with strange ruffles in clothing, the frequent change of appendage proportion and an irritating, lopsided mouth. \\n\r\nThe most the art does is add to the atmosphere, complimenting the artisanal theme with softness and a brushstroke-like quality. This is a success in a pile of ruins.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also used to compliment the aesthetic, and a wide use of classical violin and piano remains in the background at almost all times. It seems as if it is trying to make the tone of each episode dramatic, coming off as a sort of mock-soap opera soundtrack. \\n\r\nThe OP is a sweet tune that fits the show, especially in that it is something you could easily fall asleep to. In all honesty, some of the best Glasslip footage is in the opening credits.\\n\r\nContrarily, the ED is incredibly misleading. I have encountered the stylings of Nano.RIPE in many series, and have heard both slower and peppier songs--unfortunately, the choice was made to go peppy at the end of Glasslip, which does not suit the show whatsoever. Sure, it may be fun, but I believe something calmer, like the ED to Hataraku Maou-Sama, would have done Glasslip more justice.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, the anime takes a big hit in quality because of its characters. The impression is given everyone will be fun and unique, but this is not at all true. Each character, from the supposedly forgetful, indecisive Touko to the blunt Yuki, does not fit the bill for the personality they need to level out the show. The screen time for each of them is so severely divided that you can barely start to care about anything they are doing. \\n\r\nFor an anime, their reactions are bland and underplayed. While you may think it is better and more realistic to leave out the misunderstandings and the obnoxious 'uwaaahhh's, without them, there is nothing grabbing to keep anyone invested in the plot. By the final episodes, you barely see Touko's friends at all, and praise god if they get one or two lines. The romances and understandings Glasslip works hard to build shatter with the disappearance of everyone under the shadow of one of the show's main flaws:\\n\r\nKakeru Okikura.\\n\r\nScene after scene is spent trying to understand Kakeru, the new kid, and to bring out his complexities and sense of self, only to play it out to the point he becomes a one note, overbearing, pretentious loner. He begins as a mysterious new addition to the town and ends with a sudden amount of melancholy on his back that you're supposed to feel sorry for--they only problem is the script surrounding who and how he is is vague. The fatal flaw of Glasslip is the fact that the conflict of the show starts out as 'two kids who can see the future' and ends with 'no one loves Kakeru'.\\n\r\nGlasslip handles characters like a man with greased hands juggles: everything ends up in a disappointing mess by the end, and the worst part is, the mess is just a touch anticlimactic. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy Glasslip, I really, really did. Sadly, here I am at episode thirteen and without the romantic drama I was so looking forward to.\\n\r\nGlasslip is a relaxant. In being such, it does not stand even close to the other series premiered this summer, and it's usefulness extends to only about a good computer background.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\n\"The next Nagi no Asukara?\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how many times I heard this anime advertised as the next smash-hit romantic drama series by PA Works following the monumental success of their previous entry into the genre. As a result, there was a LOT of hype behind this anime among fans of rom-drams. While I can\u2019t exactly call myself a fan of the genre, I couldn\u2019t resist giving the show a try considering that NnA was the best rom-dram I had ever seen. What I got not only didn\u2019t meet these (unreasonable) expectations, but it left me in awe of just howmuch of a disaster the writers managed to make out of what is one of the most basic concepts in writing: love polygons. Whether it\u2019s the horrible execution of the supernatural elements that the show tries to sprinkle in or the fact that they completely fail to properly introduce us to the characters, Glasslip is just an absolute and undisputed failure.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: 6 teenagers are in love, but none of them are in love with each other! Shocking, I know! (The rest of this synopsis is complete guess:) One of them, Touko Fukami, works as a glass artisan and that somehow enables her and a strange boy named Kakeru Okikura to see into the future, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s at this point you may be asking yourself: \u201cWhat the hell do love polygons, glass artistry, and the ability to see into the future have to do with each other?\u201d Well friends, you are not alone in that regard. Nobody has any clue what they have to do with each other because the show doesn't take the time to bloody explain ANYTHING, particularly this whole foresight garbage. Let me make something absolutely clear: writing a romantic drama is not hard. It\u2019s as formulaic as it gets; if you\u2019ve seen one, you can guess the direction and outcome of 90% of the others. Therefore, in order to stand out from the crowd, rom-drams need to add a little something extra in order to be considered noteworthy. NnA had its engrossing and imaginative setting, while Glasslip went for supernatural-future-sight. The only problem is that apparently didn't have the slightest idea of how to incorporate this into the \"story\" (did this show even have a story?). This is because they completely failed to make this mystery the slightest bit interesting or endearing to the audience. They don't explain a single, and I literally mean one SINGLE element or detail of ANYTHING in the entire show! Particularly not this whole \u201cfuture sight\u201d. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s done, we don\u2019t know how many people can do it or why, we don\u2019t know who has the ability to do it, we don\u2019t know what is being seen, we don\u2019t know how far into the future they are looking, we don't know the relevance to the plot, we don\u2019t know a goddamn thing, and that is inexcusable. This is one of the stupidest fucking shows I've ever seen. Slowly unraveling a mystery is one thing, but they just butchered the execution by completely confusing their audience and refusing to clarify even the most basic details. The worst part is that the basic love-polygon drama of the show is also terribly executed, contrived and confusing. I don't know who wrote the script for Glasslip, but that person should never work in the industry again. Either I'm watching a bad translation, or this anime has the worst script since Fate/Stay Night's \"People die when they are killed\". When such a simple concept is so unbelievably hard to follow, you know that you are doing something terribly wrong. To wrap it up: It's hard to imagine a possible way that the plot could be any worse than it ended up. Glasslip's \"plot\" is as bad as it gets; it's a complete joke.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot may have been botched, the characters are where this anime truly and utterly fails. This anime made the unwise and downright stupid decision to jump right into the drama without taking the time to introduce us to the characters. The result? Nobody cares about anything that is happening. Guy #1 loves Girl #1, but nobody cares. Girl # 2 loves Guy #1, but nobody cares. Guy #3 loves Girl # 3, but nobody cares. Girl # 1 loves chickens (?), but NOBODY. FUCKING. CARES. The main character, Touko, is literally the only character that isn\u2019t one-dimensional, but she is CERTAINLY no saving grace (she might have some sort of mental disability). This show betrays the very basics of story-telling 101: \u201cIf the audience doesn\u2019t know who the characters are, they don\u2019t care what happens to them\u201d. For a rom-dram, this is arguably the worst mistake that can possibly be made because these kinds of shows are VERY character driven. In Glasslip, the audience could care less if, say, Guy #3 died in a fire next episode, so how are we supposed to care about if he gets a girlfriend or not? Additionally, the character chemistry is awful. We are supposed to get the idea that the main characters are all close friends, and yet they are only shown together in about 3 episodes. Really, it is just truly baffling how awful the execution of this show is.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Glasslip is a complete disaster. Sure, it has a beautiful OST and pretty visuals, but those are not even close to enough to save this catastrophe from the bowels of shitty rom-drams. Glasslip doesn't know how to use a fucking plot device, it doesn't know how to introduce characters, and it doesn't even know how to write a basic love polygon. Needless to say, I don\u2019t recommend this show to anyone. It's garbage. My god it's garbage.",

            "content": "Some critics argue that the most integral part of a story is the climax. It displays the turning point of a certain situation that had been building up from previous events (or episodes) in an attempt to evoke a certain emotion or reaction from the audience. Whether or not this is the most integral part of a story, most would agree that the climax, in most cases, overall helps the story in overall worth. One should also keep in mind that what causes the climax to become as integral as it could be is essential in understanding how a good story works. A story issimilar to that of a recipe; if everything is put in at (roughly) the exact amount with the appropriate time allotted to let it bake or stir or settle, then the finished product turns out at a higher quality.\\n\\n\r\nHow the concept of a story's climax relates to that of Glasslip is simple: Glasslip is a show that tries to produce results by skipping certain ingredients. A good climax requires good build-up, good tension, and most of all, the audience's attention and empathy, along with other accessories. When a storywriter looks to the climax too earnestly, they are more likely to miss what comes before; like planning a trip before worrying about the luggage. I believe this is Glasslip's biggest flaw: it tries to play the drama factor before building up the drama.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is most noticeable about Glasslip is the attention to its scenery. Everything looks crisp and clear and certainly has the appearance of a somewhat light-hearted teenage drama. Not to discredit the production values, but with a studio such as P.A. Works, this is almost guaranteed. As the story progresses, however, the attention to detail begins to diminish. Not in the scenery itself, but to those who inhabit it. The faces of the characters, as I had noticed, barely change in expression. Even if they do change, they don't seem to look like they acquire the emotion behind the change in expression. I think this plays most prevalently with their eyes. Their eyes barely change. Nothing happens to their pupils, their size; everything seems to stay course. This is where the flaws in the outer region of Glasslip end, but where the inner regions begin to show signs of disarray.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Glasslip begins rather innocently. A group of friends are introduced and spend time with each other doing whatever life entails them to do. It is only when the appearance of Kakeru, a strange, transfer citizen, does a crack in the group begin to show. This results in another sub-plot to the show simply stated as \"the fragments of the future\" appearing as if by pure coincidence. Kakeru and Touko, the main female protagonist of Glasslip, are allowed to see these so-called \"fragments.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the previous claim about the climax of a story, what is almost essential in having one be effective is through the story's characters. Glasslip's characters can all be summed up through the use of one word: mundane. Whatever they choose to do throughout the course of the series ends up meaning nothing or being quickly forgotten by the beginning of the following episode. The major characters' use of dialogue with the other major characters, who are all supposedly great friends, give the audience no reason to think they are actually friends. There is no chemistry between any of these characters, whether it be with friends, family, or romantic partners, as some of the characters do (or hint) at a current or future romantic relationship. By the end of the series, the viewer is likely not concerned with the characters' wishes because neither are the characters on-screen. It is almost as if the characters were still infants, trying to form an identity of their own through their environment while the show was still airing.\\n\\n\r\nAfter understanding the characters, the viewer is brought back to the main story of Glasslip: drama. If Glasslip were to attempt any build-up whatsoever, some of the attempts at genuine drama could have been fruitful. Unfortunately, it tries to fill in the amount of wasted space in running time by showing cheap amounts of dramatic tension. Things such as jealousy, possessiveness, and betrayal are explored in this series, but are shrugged off the instant they arise. As stated above, everything that is said or done seems to mean nothing by the beginning of the following episode. Only the \"fragments\" are given any attention for more than a course of an episode, and even so, we know nothing more about the phenomenon by the end of the series as when it was introduced in the beginning of the series. When taking everything into account, this series is, simply put, a diorama, filled with pale, clay dolls moving from place to place.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that the climax of a story can make or break the worth of a show. So when Glasslip tries many, many times to provide worthwhile build-up to the climax of the series, it felt like nothing had been done, nothing had been accomplished. The dull characters and convoluted story only equate to a miserable and strenuous viewing. Not to overinflate the amount of analogies already present, but one last thing Glasslip could be an example of is an unfinished story. It is the outcome of someone's haste and overwhelming desire to get to the flashiest part of a story. It's quite a shame; it looked so pretty, too.",

            "content": "When I saw the trailers for this show, I like most of the anime watching community were expecting this to be either one of two things, 1. To be the next Nagi no Asakura, one of the most well known romantic dramas to have come out recently, or what I was expecting, a slice of life story of a girl who wishes to be a glass artisan like in the synopsis. Let me just say it dropped the ball for either one of these mindsets. For a romantic drama, everything feels forced and it uses love triangles and polygons that have been done time andagain, and as a slice of life about glass artisans it shows only 3-4 minutes worth of screen time in which the main character is heating glass and messing it up on multiple occasions at the place she works at and it never even talks about her goals to become a glass artisan IN THE LAST FOUR EPISODES. The show instead uses glass as some kind of plot device that allows our main character to see the future for some reason. I wouldn't mind if it did this if it did it properly, but they don't. When this future sight happens I am left clueless as to what future events are going to happen despite seeing them myself but for some reason the main character gets the entire gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters most of them are one dimensional and forgettable except for the main one, you got the new guy in town, a bookworm girl, and a few others. That's right there's 5 side characters we as viewers are supposed to care about in addition to Touko, the main lead, and three of them don't have any distinguishing traits or personality. And Touko only has a few traits, like caring for chickens and sketching them and making glass stuff and being the main reason romantic tension randomly happens. The reason I am sort of ranting on the characters is that if the genre is romance or slice of life, having good characters matters more then usual as they are what we focus on during romance and dramas. In my opinion this show is not the worst but there is better out there\\n\\n\r\nMy alternate recommendations would be the currently airing Ao Haru Ride or the just finished airing Soredemo Sekai wa Utskushi due to both of these shows being better in the romance genre then this show.",

            "content": "\"The next Nagi no Asukara\" quickly turned into the disappointment of the summer for most, but actually entertained me. Are you raising your brow yet wondering, \"why give an anime a 7 that's heavily hated on?\"\r\nWith Nagi no Asukara ending a few months before Glasslip was released, we had high expectations for it thinking it would live up to the hype that Nagi produced. By no means am I saying this anime is perfect, it isn't, it has a bunch of flaws, but still doesn't deserve that amount of hate it's getting in my opinion. \r\nIt opens with the group of friends having fun ata summer festival and showing each of their names, along with a unique event that the main character experiences. From there you're introduced to a new transfer student and he causes a stir within the group of friends and it begins to kick off from there. One flaw that this anime opens up with, is no character introduction. No one is properly introduced and you're literally just thrown into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was driven by the concept of Touko, the main character, being able to see visions or hear voices that may hint to the future. The \"fragments of the future\" are the main thing that drives the story, but it doesn't exactly get told what it is or why it's even there. With the obvious love cycle that this group has, feelings get told and nothing happens, the group just spreads apart and it stays that way for most of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne big flaw in the entire anime is that nothing does happen, it's sad to say, but things just go in a big circle and end in a big unclear ending that answers absolutely nothing. The entire situation that all the characters went through with their heart breaks and confessions, just goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nWith the anime having a bad story, you have mediocre characters to really back up it up. I won't say these are the worst characters that i've seen, cause i've seen worse, but some things they do are really questionable and just tend to make the overall anime confusing, but did entertain me. Due to the show being a slice of life, it's heavily character driven, and the cast isn't exactly the best for what the show was trying to do. Mainly the anime focuses on Touko and \"David\". Those are the two with the ability to see \"fragments of the future\" and share the ability. They drive the story with the curiosity to figure out why they have it and what it does, which never does get answered.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is a typical teenage girl and probably the most prominent of her group of friends. She's very curious and tends to be oblivious to the situation tending to make things worse. She had potential to be a great character, but  didn't shine as much as she could have and really just made the anime repeat a bunch of things that already happened. \\n\\n\r\nNext you have Kakeru, or David, the transfer student who just shows up. Like literally just shows up and is thrown into the story. With his appearance, he throws the group into conflict and even admits that hes messing with them to some extent on purpose. He's a lot like Tsumugu from Nagi, but less emotion. He does have his moments of why he does things, but it feels like he was just placed there cause they needed another character to fill the spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the group is diversely made up and is one of the things that I enjoyed. Though they all literally just made more conflict and served no purpose in the story whatsoever, they made a lot of entertaining moments and gave the anime more life than what was given. You have characters who aren't even involved in the drama and have their own love story, and characters that mess up the drama further, by doing actions that are just questionable, but adds for a whole lot of interesting interactions and situations to keep the story from dying off.\\n\\n\r\nArt is possibly one of the best things this anime has to offer. The art comes from the famous P.A Works who has previously worked on Tari Tari, Hanasaku Iroha, and Nagi no Asukara. The scenery from the hikes, to the fragments and visions that Touko sees are all beautiful and give the anime a lot more entertainment to it. One thing i'd like to point out was the detail given to the entire environment that they were in. You can definitely feel the sea side thanks to the detail in moss on the walls, to the waves moving and animals surrounding it. With all the praise i'm giving the art, it's not perfect. A lot of scenes aren't fluid due to the characters. They're all drawn beautifully, but all lack facial expressions. They tend to have only one straight face through out the entire scene except for the occasional angry face, or confused face. \\n\\n\r\nClassical music has always been one of the things I love listening to and this anime has a lot of it. The soundtrack for this anime is possibly one of its biggest strengths and things that keep it going. From the sound effects of the fragments to just the beach or animal sounds, the anime did a splendid job making you feel like you were there and brought life to anime. The voice acting was nothing too great, but actually wasn't bad at all. If the characters showed the emotions that the voice actors were giving off, it would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this anime is being judged much harsher than it deserves to be. It does have many flaws, but a lot of points to cover it up. This series is definitely a hit or a miss for many people, but also has bad timing of its production. With the previous anime of P.A works just ending and getting a lot of praise, you're given a lot of expectation for their next work to be of the same caliber. Then with the strong line up that this Summer season has had, from Barakamon to SAO 2, you have something that lacks from the pack and is being pointed out on all of it's flaws. I think anyone can like this or have an unbiased opinion going into this, if they don't compare it to something else, cause this is it's own anime. It's not suppose to be a copy of something else.",

            "content": "\"Glasslip,\" a Slice-of-Life with the potential for greatness, crashed and burned.\r\nI'll admit I was looking forward to \"Glasslip\" this season. The art seemed clean and fresh, and an anime with a nice concept. Not only was I cruelly deceived by the anime's initial summary, but was completely caught off guard once some supernatural elements were added into the storyline.\r\nLet's talk a little voice actors, shall we? Touko got to be voiced by the lovely Seria Fukagawa (Aloalo [Happiness Charge Precure!]). She has actually only had two roles so far in the anime industry. It is a pity this had to be one of her jobs--nevertheless,she did a marvelous job! Her voice captured Touko's innocence and rather rude bluntness perfectly. Although a bit annoying at times, Fukagawa has a sharp feminine voice that's sure to land her more jobs. Moving onto Kakeru, he is voiced by Ryota Ohsaka (Marco [Attack on Titan). No longer is he a blue haired idol, a wimpy teenager in charge of a deadly mecha, or a dead man (too soon?). Meet Ohsaka, reborn as emotionally fragile, perhaps emotionless, but probably depressed Kakeru! Ohsaka uses his breathy voice to play out all the emotions very well. His voice perfectly fits the role, and I feel he did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nWhile \"Glasslip\" had the potential to become something great, it stopped in the middle of character development and decided to say 'Hey, let's add that people can see the future!' Which turns out to not even be the future at all. Confusing? I know. Most anime fans watching this show were desperately in need of manly explanations, and were probably thinking 'P.A. Works, what the hell are \ufeffyou thinking?!' The relationships between characters especially seemed forced. Touko went from being slightly interested in Kakeru, to liking him, to hating him, back to liking him, and then...it's just left hanging. Other relationships form in the series, some expected, others not, but character development was definitely not one of the leading factors to the show. Suffice to say, I was not happy with this anime. But not only was the story confusing, but it seemed like the animation quality degraded around the third episode. It regained its grace in the lat couple of episodes, but for a moment there I was seriously wondering why the characters' eyes were so lopsided and their bodies so undefined. The backgrounds were very detailed though. Along with the fantastical, magical, supernatural things that never gets explained. It all leads me back to my very first complaint; What are these fragments of the future?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, if you like confusing animes who use up all their budget on backgrounds and magical swirls in people's eyes, then you will enjoy this anime very much! However, I'm not sure a lot of people want to be left hanging with their questions never answered. But if that's your cup of tea, then have at it.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nThe story is poorly executed, diverting from a potentially good storyline to just a god-awful combination of random thoughts. If the aim was to show the chaos going through a child's head before they become an adult, then that was inadequately done. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art started out as wonderful, but in the middle of the series it seemed like all the budget was spent on the backgrounds. Bodies were weirdly shaped, eyes were oddly positioned, and it was just a few degrees short from a mess. However, the animation quality got back up in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7\\n\r\nThe music was good. The opening was pleasant, and followed the Slice-of-Life theme. The ending was also cute, reflecting Touko's innocence. However, the music wasn't amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nThere was little development, and that's what is always necessary for a good score. There were some romance themes going on, but the main characters' romance seemed a bit forced. It went from interest, to love, to hate, back to a more hesitant love, and then it was just left hanging. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nFor being an anime I had really looked forward to, it disappointed me, and watching the episodes became a chore.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.4\\n\r\nAs previously stated, and I will state again, this anime had lots of potential to be a really sweet Slice-of-Life with a bit of romance mixed in. Instead, Supernatural elements are thrown in, and I'm not even sure if it's meant to be taken literally, or if it's all just a metaphor for a teenager struggling to grow up. This anime was a definite hit and miss for me.",

            "content": "I can see the future. Nah, just joking.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nThe story takes place in Hinodehama where Touko's family runs a glass-working business. Touko Fukami hangs out with her friends at a cafe called Kazemichi. The story at first sound interesting just when Touko sees the future by looking at the glass. However, this wasn't brought up again in the remaining episodes. The rest of the episodes are Touko hanging out with her friends.\r\nIt basically seems that everyone is doing their daily lives with no consequential events that happen. Everything in this anime is insubstantial. \r\nART (6):\r\nAs always from PA Works, the animation is serene and beautifuljust like the sea. However, the animation wasn't fully utilized to its full potential which became a bit stilted. Recycle animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThey use classical music in the anime itself, without coming up with their own music. The opening and ending song were good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (3):\\n\\n\r\nThere was barely any development from the characters or backstory. The characters that I liked are Yanagi Takayama and Hiro Shirozaki. However, it is sad that they have not enough screen time compared to Touka and Yukinari.\\n\\n\r\nJonathan, the chicken is also an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Touka and Kakeru is that they are bland characters, there wasn't any substance between them. I know they hang out and build a relationship but that relationship has to have some meaning behind it. However, it wasn't explained in the later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI barely remember all the casts.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, Touko's \"EEEEHHHH\" is the most hilarious line I have heard from her.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nTraditional storytelling is setting up a character, sending them on their journey and learning more about them. Glasslip, this anime is just chess-piece storytelling. Characters goes here, there and back and forth with no reason or meaning.\\n\\n\r\nPA Works, you have done good anime in the past, why suddenly you didn't put much effort in this anime? Even if it's a slice-of-life, you need to put in charisma and flare between the characters just like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun did. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun is a well executed comedy with great characters. What made Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun awesome is their relationship makes sense and the comedy is well-executed. In this anime Glasslip, characters are just going through their daily lives as if nothing had happened. I will not tolerate lazy work even if it's a slice-of-life anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "When I read the description of Glasslip on AniChart while picking shows to watch for the summer season, I was hoping for a more casual anime (meaning believable, realistic circumstances - a change of pace from what I usually watch) which focused on a young girl's dreams to become a glass artisan.  However, that's not the case.  We have seen very little time of glasswork at all.  Furthermore, in the five of thirteen episodes of Glasslip that have aired thus far, the show has failed to capitalize on what it has to work with - albeit not much for how much timethis anime wastes on situations which do nothing for the progression of the story, cliche love polygons and the main character's (Touko) ability to see the future.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nWhat makes this story poor?  There is very little story that exists in Glasslip so far, and for what story does exist, it's poorly paced.  I'm okay if a SoL is slow paced, but because of how poorly paced this show is, something's probably going to wind up incomplete, or leave gaping plotholes.  The story that exists so far is cliched love polygons that still don't seem to matter - in fact, nothing in this anime seems to matter so far.  As I jokingly said to a friend I'm watching the anime with \"it's as if Glasslip makes it a point to make everything meaningless.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation seems to be where most of the budget for this show went.  This anime is eye candy.  High detailing and a lot of stylization exists all of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nNo complaints to be made about the sound quality.  The voice actors and actresses match the emotion of the characters in the animation well, and the sound quality is crisp and clean.  There's nothing that makes this sound distinct amongst production of other animes.  Regarding the music, nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\r\nTouko is the only character who has had any character development that the anime makes out that you're supposed to think is important? - honestly I can't even fucking tell man.  This anime's writing is a train wreck all around.  Anyways, she can see into the future through a trigger, shiny objects such as glass, and she likes to draw chickens.  Honestly, the bike that falls over when Touko is confessed to by forgettable-character-whatever-his-name-is, that bike has more character development than most of the characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, check this bike out: http://38.media.tumblr.com/7691e6ddb1be8a9ff7d41604c734a5c3/tumblr_n8l3bl7k101syr5r5o1_r1_400.gif\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nI'm only watching this show because I'm watching it with a friend while it's airing.  If we weren't pointing out the obvious flaws in the writing most of the time and laughing at it, we probably wouldn't be watching it even then.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nThis score is still too high, but in the 5 catagories, it was carried by animation and sound, even though the sound is only on par.  Really, don't waste your time watching Glasslip.  Hell, School Days probably is better than this just because the direction of the show wasn't so fucking obscure.\\n\\n\r\nI'll update this review later on when the Glasslip has finished airing if the show changes any in story quality and character development.",

            "content": "SPOILERS UP TO EPISODE 6 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\r\nHow P.A. works disappointed me:\r\nWhen I started watching this I was confused why this show received such an undeserved horribly low rating (even kiss x sis had a better score, srsly ppl?). However episode 6\u2019s drama really unclouded my judgement as a PA works\u2019 fanboy and made me realizes how much of a mess this is.\r\nSTORY\r\nEach episode generally composes of scenery porn, walking, the occasional chicken, and the show diligently trying to keep the plot from progressing. We are half way through and nothing has been revealed about the tacked on supernatural element whether its importance tothe characters or why do those characters have it. You would think they would develop at least SOMETHING if they are not developing the characters.  I wish they had spent less time for the characters attempting to meet up somewhere to talk, because apparently the theme of saving your mobile credit is more important.\\n\\n\r\nI actually quite enjoyed the earlier episodes because of its relaxing slice of life nature along with living vicariously in a perfectly gender balanced group of  friends that I never had. Alas, that peace was ruined thanks to the poorly executed drama followed by the revelation of why these characters are bad.\\n\r\nIn the followings list I will attempt to explain why:\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nYukinari \u2013 Possessive, jealous, sulky and somewhat violent. Seriously needs to learn to accept things and control his emotions. His emotions are probably one of the most forced and overreacted and thus became a catalyst for this bad melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nDavid Kakeru Stoic-kun \u2013 The show tried so hard in making him mysterious that there has been absolutely no backstory about him, his family situation, his childish back-yard camping habits, his foresight ability and its significance to him as well as his ability to tolerant listening to the same song over and over again. I was thoroughly disappointed to realize he had feelings for Touko despite my denial of their romantic undertone. His interest for Touko wasn\u2019t evident in his emotions at all. His advancements towards Touko such as inviting her to that forest were straightforward but misleading and that I honestly couldn\u2019t tell what his intentions were romantic or is he just interested in her power. His way of thinking also makes no logical sense to me from his wise philosophy of chickens\u2019 feelings to his roundabout way in provoking Yuki with the race to receive a reaction from Touko. Even he himself admitted he had no clue why he did that.  Probably one of the messiest characterization of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHiro \u2013 A slick and smooth talking sonuvabitch that\u2019s scoring chicks left and right. Maybe if he didn\u2019t wear a girl\u2019s hair band he would get even more girls. Honestly what\u2019s his and sachi significance in the show?\\n\\n\r\nSachi \u2013 Emotionless yuki nagato clone but actually not emotionless because she likes to constantly smile politely? But we all know she\u2019s secretly and sadistically stringing along Hiro with the friend zone leash\\n\\n\r\nYanagi \u2013 Her actions actually made logical sense and I could understand her intentions as well as her emotions. Although her unwavering affection for yuki displayed in Ep 6 despite his aggressive tendencies brews concern as a domestic violence victim.\\n\\n\r\nTouko \u2013 Your everyday oblivious moe character. She is the type of girl to tell a nice guy to not change because she likes them for who they are but then friend zones them and run off in the sunset with the bad boy on a motorbike. Although I can\u2019t say that Yuki is a \u2018nice\u2019 guy but just her urging Yuki to confess but backfiring and her not knowing what to do annoys me. Mainly because of how contradictory she is and that using the excuse of a character being overly oblivious to other people\u2019s feelings is getting quite old. Another example in episode six is that despite the fact that Kakeru treated her friends like crap and wagers Touko and Yanagi like possessions with Yuki in a race, she still decided to side with him. Her lack of ability to understand her own feelings is frustrating and really slows down the pace of the show. Her interest for Kakeru is not justified well enough even if she shares a similar ability with him.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude in a tl;dr version of why I am disappointed. Characters are poorly established, there is no chemistry or justifications for their affection for each other. Kakeru is a very poorly written character with zero percent emotions and background thus making the audience difficult to understand him and his motivation. The pacing is also very slow. However, that animation and kawaii desu anime girl designs tho.",

            "content": "After seeing a lot of good romance animes this year such as Nagi no Asukara, Golden Time, Ao Haru Ride, I thought romance/Slice-of-Life anime this year would be great, that is why I gave a shot at Glasslip, believing that there would be some quality in this work, after all it is the work of Kenji Horikawa producer of Angel Beats, I mean c'mon this must be good!\r\n... Boy I was wrong...\r\n  After watching each of the 13 episodes, I felt more confused than when I started the anime, but let's break it down\r\n~CONTAIN SPOILERS~\r\n- Story - 1/10\r\n  The plot startswhen a new transfer student David arrives to the small town where this group of friends are just beginning their summer vacation. Ok it isn't horrible at this point, it pretty much starts like any other cliche anime. So let's begin the reasons why this anime went downhill.\\n\\n\r\n  This anime is all about the development of relationships throughout the summer vacation.\\n\\n\r\n  The main characters David and Touka become 'friends' i think (because i still don't know what they are) and both them have this strange connection regarding these ''future fragments''. I thought the show would spin around this theme but it doesn't and you at least expect the show to explain what these are, well they don't as well. Not only that but you discover somewhat in the anime that even the characters don't know what these fragments are...\\n\\n\r\n  The other 4 remaining engage in their relationships throughout the anime but at the end ALL relationships seemed not to have change... So... You might ask... What exactly happens during the anime, the answer is nothing. Not only you end confused but the story doesn't actually develop from where it started.\\n\\n\r\n  Not only that but most of the time (especially in the last episodes) you stay disoriented in most conversations along the anime. It only helps you get more lost than you were.\\n\\n\r\n- Character -  2/10\\n\\n\r\n  The show itself provides next to no character development or information about the past... I think the most that I learned from the past of character was from Yukinari and that he hurt his knee one day and couldn't run as well as he did... But that is it. So let's the characters:\\n\\n\r\n  Firstly there is Touko, who doesn't do much in the show even though she is supposed to be the main character along with David. She pretty much spends the whole anime thinking what are the future fragments, and in the end she doesn't even understand it...\\n\\n\r\n  Then there is the weirdest character of the whole summer line-up(might have exaggerated a bit) he is the main cause along with Touko to why you can't understand the dialogues, it seems like he has some deep understanding and knowledge by the way he talks, again No. Plus, he is just plain weird... Sleeps in a tent outside his house, i mean c'mon ...\\n\\n\r\n  Now one of the characters that most surprised me during the whole series, and that is Sachi. At first you just see common sick bookworm girl that uses glasses, very common. But then she suddenly turns into the most manipulative character in the series, and in a way that will only get pissed. Not only that it seemed, for me, that she was breaking up with her ''boyfriend'' while making a confession to another character, lol what!?... yeah this is the part that surprised me.   \\n\\n\r\n  Then there is Yukinari, which at first seemed a well rounded character, but then as the show passed turned into a boring depressive character after getting rejected, and he pretty much stays like that from mid to end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n  Next up, is Yanagi which was pretty much was simple character...  At first during the show she seemed jealous of Touko because Yukinari had confessed his feelings for her best friend not her. But then tries to act all grown up like doesn't care and it stays like that until the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n  Lastly, there is Hiro which is by far my favorite character of the show along with some support characters. The reason why he is my favorite is just because he was the most sane person in the group, and that had some pretty interesting interactions with the other characters, such as Sachi when she does something to harm DavidxTouko's  relationship. And that is it.\\n\\n\r\n- Art/Animation - 5/10\\n\\n\r\n  Even though the anime sucked, I got give some points in the art, nothing that stands out though... It doesn't match up to Nagi no Asukara, another work of P.A. Works but still it wasn't to shabby to complain. Even though, most of the show was slow and focused on the weird dialogues, the art compensated it.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  Indisputably the best part of the anime. The OP/ END were nice, along with the OST's throughout the anime, but nothing remarkable as well.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 1/10\\n\\n\r\n  Didn't enjoy the show at all, mostly because the show was pretty horrible. But also because I didn't feel anything throughout the show sadness, laughter (being aside the part with Touko's Sister =D that cracked me up) anything at all...\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 1/10\\n\\n\r\n  The show purely sucked a lot. I just can't believe something like this was created by the same producer of Angel Beats! And that P.A. Works responsible for the animation of Nagi no Asukara and Angel Beats! agreed to make this...\\n\\n\r\n  I am astonished that no one looked at the script and the final result of the project and said ''Yeah this sucks ass hard, are we really making this?'' (Sorry for the rudeness but that is pretty much what the show is)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Glasslip. I really did. The first few episodes had me convinced that this would be a great series.\r\nUnfortunately, it was not to be.\r\nWhat's happening? Why is it happening? Who are these characters? Why do they all seem to have some kind of psychological complex? What are they talking about? Do they have real emotions? What the hell does that line mean? Where is the story? What's the point? Is this some deep, meaningful metaphor for living life?\r\nThese are all legitimate questions I asked while watching Glasslip. And I got zero answers. Glasslip makes no sense whatsoever and it appears thatwhatever story premise they were trying to establish simply got thrown aside so that they could include scenes like a girl \"confessing\" to both a girl and a guy, who both casually accept it and laugh it off, and lines like \"It's your fault Yuki isn't attractive anymore.\" Ooooh, mystifying.\\n\\n\r\nI stuck it out because I was half-expecting some kind of plot twist or other resolution that would tie everything together and finally make the show make sense. Nope, didn't get that either. Regarding the story, there is really nothing to say because it appears to be nonexistent beyond two people occasionally \"seeing the future.\" Don't be fooled--this plot device goes nowhere and apparently serves no purpose whatsoever. Regarding the characters, there is also nothing to say because they're all dull, wishy-washy, and they seem to be speaking in code 80% of the time because I have no clue what they're talking about.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, at least Glasslip is nice to look at. Unlike the characters themselves, the character designs are actually incredibly appealing. The seaside town where the show takes place is nothing short of beautiful, and each episode features several great-looking stills. The soundtrack is also very pleasant and is often more interesting than listening to what is actually happening on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Glasslip is probably one of the biggest disappointments in recent memory and I'm amazed that such a mess received a green-light for production. Avoid it like the plague.\\n",

            "content": "I had been anticipating Glasslip since I first saw the preview for it. I thought that this slice-of-life anime would be something to mark the Summer 2014 season. Sadly, that was not the case.\r\nLet's start off with some positivity. Obviously, the art is the best aspect of Glasslip. I mean c'mon, it's P.A. Works! This was probably one of the reasons why this anime held much potential. We've all seen the mesmerizing effects of the animation produced by this company from previous animes, so it's not at all a surprised if Glasslip's art is what motivated us to watch the anime in the first place.\r\nThismay not be true for all, but I believe that Glasslip's soundtrack deserves some small credit. I like the OP and the other songs in the OST aren't half bad either. However, I think the creditability of the OST would be more enhanced if not for the half-assed story it had to accompany. \\n\\n\r\nLet's see now, shall I talk about how Glasslip went from a blooming bud full of potential to become a beautiful flower to a bud that was crushed under the heedless feet of the producers? Honestly, after watching the first four episodes, Glasslip's path was blatantly leading into the downward spiral of disappointing anime. However, as a devoted P.A. Works fan, I continued to grasp onto the possibility that this downgrading anime would redeem itself. Alas, my hopes were crushed completely in the last couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nYou might've thought that Glasslip would be a slice-of-life anime about glasswork. That is not exactly a lie. The \"glass\" part of the anime is definitely there, but it is not dominant. Instead of a easygoing SoL that we thought would soothe our conflicted hearts with its pure story, we got a half-assed romance with half-assed supernatural elements thrown into the mix, along with a exasperating female protagonist that goes \"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh?!\" with an annoyingly oblivious voice in every. single. episode.  The plot was just so very unconvincing and unsatisfying. It's like there was no development worth mentioning between the characters, and that they were merely running around in circles, searching for an answer that was literally right in front of them. The characters dwelt too much on the trivial matters, which is normal in anime, but there should at least be some solid conclusion to it, right? \\n\\n\r\nWell, too bad. We were left with a vague ending and no idea on what will happen to our fair protagonists. Sure, you can just \"imagine\" what happens to them, but that isn't the point, is it? And I do not want a second season.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointing story. Disappointing characters. Utterly disappointing results. My enjoyment for Glasslip rides as low as the scores I give it. I yield a warning to those who have not watched this yet.",

            "content": "As always, I suck at reviews! If u want a good review then. . . . read something else! I'm still sick, so I excuse any typos. . . . \r\nThis series was pretty much a way to kill time while waiting for Tokyo ghoul and Zankyou no terror (which wraps today noooooo!) every Thursday. Did it waste my time?. . . Let's see!\r\nStory:\r\nOur main characters and her friends live in a seaside town where all there is to do is to apparently draw chickens! A new guy shows up who stirs things up a bit aaaaaaand it's a basic slice of life from there.\\n\r\nWhile I don't think it's a bad setup for an easy going slice of life there really isn't anything going on until the last 3-4 episodes. The main learns through the new guy (let's call them Girl #1 and guy #1) that she can sorta see glimpses of the future when looking at something sparkly. They don't use this for anything big until like I said the last episodes, which is a shame since it could have given the series a bit more dept.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\nGirl #1 is the basic boring main. She loves to craft glass tough which is an interesting hobby for a main character. She pretty much only makes pearls to put in bracelets tough, which is a bit of a shame.\\n\r\nGuy #1. . . . I swear. . . HE HAS NO SOUL!! He show little to no emotions until the last 2 episodes, and even there it's super stiff! Without any hint he decides that he's in love with girl #1 halfway through. Could have fooled me! I never even saw him smile at her! He can sorta \"hear\" the future the same way girl #1 sees it and. . . .I never understood that. His seiyuu is the same guy who voices Eijun in Ace of diamond and Nice in Hamatora. This soulless character is a waste of his talent!\\n\r\nGirl #1 have 4 friends; Girl #2 and #3, and guy #2 and #3. They are all pretty much on the same level of blandness. Guy #3 can be a little funny at times, but really this series doesn't have any humor. Guy and girl #3 get together halfway through the series, but there is little to no chemistry between them.\\n\r\nAnything I have to say about any of the characters are pretty much rants, so I'm gonna leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nThe coloring of this is pretty nice, and the backgrounds can be very beautiful! They really know what to do to make this town and the surroundings feel a bit real around the bland characters. The music is what makes this for me. They have a lot of piano in this, which quite frankly I could just sit down and listen to a calm summer night without connecting it to the series at all. The character can look a bit derpy at times. The eyes are a bit misplaced and the proportions can seem a bit off, but if you don't look at them(the bgs are prettier anyways) it's fine!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is not the type of series that I usually watch, so I'm not sure if I have the rights to judge it. Anyhow this is a bit too boring for my tastes. Nothing really happens until the last couple of episodes, and the characters are blander than toast. Was it a complete waste of time??. . . . .Not exactly. I could find it a bit soothing to watch before getting into the darker series that I mentioned at the top. I would never watch this as a completed series tough, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nIf country side slice of life is your thing then you can check it out! You'll like it ok!\\n\r\nIf you don't watch them so often then leave it.\\n\\n\r\nI will now go to Mc Donalds before getting depressed that the last ep of Zankyou aired today. I bet it'll be epic!\\n\\n\r\nHave a good one!",

            "content": "Glasslip is an anime done by studio PA Works which has worked on the otaku sob fest Angel Beats, and the gorgeous and magical show Nagi no Asukara\r\nThe director Nishimura, Junji directed Dog Days and True Tears.  So is this anime a godsend from P.A Works, or is it a terrible attempt at a slice of life that should be melted down by giant alien gundam crocodiles?  Let's find out\r\nstarting off with the Story?????\r\nTHE STORY\r\nOur story follows our main girl Fukami, Touko who is the daughter of a glass artisan family and wants to become a glass artisan herself.  Not the highestgoal in life but sure.  She enjoys hanging around a cafe called Kazemichi  with her friends Yukinari, Sachi, Hiro, and Yanagi.  During summer vacation a kid named Okikura Kakeru meets Touko and tells her that they both can see and hear the future when they are looking at a shiny object like glass.  Right when Kakeru is introduced to her group, the friend group slowly begins to come apart like taking anal beads out of pooper.  From confessions between characters to more drama than the real housewives of Atlanta, these friends must overcome obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like a generic slice of life right?  That's because it kinda is.  Listen, the only real good thing to say about Glasslip is that it doesn't beat around the bush.  This anime actually has a confession within the first 3 episodes so Nisekoi should take some notes on this show. Also I might add that the anime had an interesting supernatural element, looking into the future is a wonderful idea for a slice of life which could add a bit of uniqueness.  The only thing unique about this anime is how PA Works was able to fuck up after their success with Nagi no Asukara.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the show suffers from a lack of explanation.  For example, throughout all of the second half there were an ample amount of phantasmagorias that are never actually explained at all and have literally no significance at all!  From snow randomly falling, to fake crows attacking the main protagonist Touko, I was surprised that the characters were mentally sane.  If you're going to put these illusions in your anime, at least have the decency to kinda explain them because when used, the illusions are kinda crap.  They lack symbolism which is something that when done right can add a whole new level to an anime, but instead  the \"symbolism\" becomes more distracting than Barrack Obama tap-dancing.  \\n\\n\r\nWas the pacing of this show done by Helen Keller because the people behind this show clearly couldn't see how awful the pacing was.  Sometimes the anime likes to skip around to the point where I always feel like I'm missing something.  The puzzle pieces holding this anime together begin to be misplaced and mismatched, some even become missing!  Here is an example, 2 characters are clearly seen to have affection for each other, the next episode they are suddenly together as a couple.  There is no scene beforehand that foreshadowed or informed me that those 2 would actually end up together.  And the fact that they got together did not bother me, it's the fact that it just suddenly happened out of nowhere without telling the audience that bothered me.  It left me saying \"Wait Whaa, did I miss something.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also lacks any backbone, there is no real story to tell, in fact if anything, the story lacks a story!  There is literally less focus in here than there are black people at a clan rally.  When I say that I mean the story is non-existent.  It's like the people working on this show literally got a bunch of ideas, threw them in a Titan's mouth and shat it out.  It's just a mess!\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue and character interactions are also laughably horrid.  I have rarely seen such bad character interactions in a show but here I found it.  Literally there could be better communication between a deaf girl and a blind girl.  The dialogue is highly unrealistic in every way possible, and the characters in their given situations would not act or respond in the way they do, it's just a hot mess! \\n\\n\r\nThe love and the drama in this show is blasted way out of proportion and is seriously one of the most melodramatic things I have ever seen in any show or movie.  No story needs to be this dramatic at all.  Also, as for the romance, the romance is highly unbelievable with a lack of romantic build up or pay off that is not presented in this story.  When character start to date it feels unnatural and comes out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least lets talk about the ending, which is open ended and not in the good way either.  Nothing is really concluded and everything and I mean everything is left for the audience to figure out.  It ends with unresolved characters and no explanation on the random \"future fragments\" or phantasmagorias that happened.  It's like the \"story\" stopped in the middle of a non-existent \"story\".  So to conclude with this section, Glasslip's story left a bigger mess than there was in Naruto and Hinata's bedroom.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nNow it's time to move onto the characters.  Oops did I say characters, I mean to say robots because ladies and gentlemen the flaws don't just stop at the story, the characters are also poor as well.\\n\\n\r\nTouko is our main female protagonist and takes on the Genki character archetype.  Her being a character is the equivalent of Ryuk being handsome, it just does not work at all.  Her character is always confused by every given  situation possible which makes the plot slow down and her character annoying.  She tends to say EHHHHHHH a lot, I don't know if it's a broken orgasm or what but it just goes to show how lazy the writers got with her character.  Instead of getting developed throughout the series it's just her\\n\r\neither running away from her problems or getting confused and not understanding anything around her.  Her stupidity and her IQ makes it seem like she went to school at McDonalds, she's never aware of her surroundings and her determination to become a glass artisan is never fully there.  It was in the synopsis that she wanted to become a glass artisan, we see a few scenes of her doing stuff that pertains to that job but do we see her fully develop or have that heavy determination to have her dream? No we don't.\\n\r\nA good example of a determined character is Chiaki from Nodame Cantabile who works hard to become an aspiring conductor and he keeps working til he gets that dream.  All and All, Touko is a poor excuse of a main female protagonist that is more 1 dimensional than a piece of paper.  Her lack of motivation and lack of being fleshed out makes her an awful main role\\n\\n\r\nWe go from bad to worse with Kakeru or David who is more bland that school cafeteria food.  This man has no personality and is merely used as a drama device in order to progress the story.  To say that Natsu from Fairy Tail is a better character than someone is a sin but if that's the case than David must have more sins than Mel Gibson because my god this man is just nothing.  Development?  What Development? Literally like I said he's only in here to give Touko a love interest and to be used to progress the drama even further.  Pardon my french bu he acts like an inconsiderate fuckface towards everyone but Touko which makes his character not just bland but extremely unlikable as well which makes him have no connection to the audience.  All and all, his character is just the worst.\\n\\n\r\nSachi is another female in this anime and her character is a nothing character like the rest of these characters!  All we know about her is that she has some sort of illness that is never explained and that she likes to read a lot that's it.  Also there are theories that she is a lesbian and likes Touko which I can believe and honestly if Glasslip was a yuri it'd be a 10/10 based on the images I have on my laptop.  But anyways, her character does nothing for the plot, therefore her purpose in the plot was more unnecessary than watching 2 girls 1 cup.\\n\\n\r\nYukinari is another male and is shown to be quite jealous of Kakeru for being close to Touko.  Listen, all Yukinari is, is a jealous stereotypical anime douche bag.  All we know about him is that he likes to run, that's basically all I got out of him.  All he does in this anime is run, goddamn!  We get nothing out of his character but that in order to cope with his problems he just runs from point A to B everyday.  He hides in a shell rather than talks to others which is fine if he develops, which he doesn't so it just makes him really 2 dimensional. Other than that he's a terrible character as well!\\n\\n\r\nYanagi is the last female we are going to mention and all she wants for christmas is Yukinari.  But plot twist, they are step brother and sister!  She gave Kakeru a slap so I guess she did something of use rather than just being a walking pair of boobs.  All she does is defend Yukinari whether he is right or wrong and does nothing else to serve the plot.  Honestly, I wanted her character to be good but what I got was more than disappointing.  Does she even develop, nope not at all.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, Hiro, the actual normal character.  He's also a bad character but he is the most level headed of them all.  He thinks the most logically and his actions seem way more realistic than the rest of the cast.  This isn't saying much but trust me, he's a breath of fresh air compared to the toxic air surrounding the rest of this horrid cast.\\n\\n\r\nGuys, literally, I am not even being overcritical on the characters, this is seriously how bad they were.  I had the hardest time trying to think of what to say about these characters and that's where the problem lies.  These aren't characters, they're cardboard cutout copies of different character that we have seen before done in the worst way possible. They have literally no redeeming qualities and when I tried thinking of any, my brain would fry faster than people on 4/20.  This is absurd and embarassing for an anime to have this bad of a cast of characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe art is done by PA works so expect a lot of nice looking visuals.  But coming off of Nagi no Asukara they set the bar high for their own art and animation.  Did they meet that bar here? No, did they even scrape it? No. Don't get me wrong, this show is better looking than a lot of shows but that's as far as it goes.  Everything just looks nice, sparkles in the glass look great, and the useless phantasmagorias looked great too. But other than that everything was pretty much uninspired!  Environments are basically super repetitive giving a lack of variety and Character designs are more uninspiring than the game Sonic Boom.  The animation also has problems.  There is one moment in the beginning episode where there was a car teleporting up a hill which looked absolutely terrible.  This is Glasslip, not Back to the Future, cars should not do that!  The abundance of still frames is a bother too, there are literally still frames that do not need to exist or does not represent anything.  They literally still framed a door, yes a door.  They still framed way too often which is either a lack in budget or they just didn't give a damn anymore about the show and just used pictures.  But they did also, to counteract this still framed Yanagi with some of her clothes off, but that's just my hormones on caffeine.  The animation can either be fluid or choppy, but luckily the animation is bearable but there is a lack of variety.  The characters are very stiff as well as a result of all the talking the characters do.  Majority of the scenes are just characters moving their mouth and doing nothing else, you can't seriously call that great animation? PA Works needs to utilize their art and animation better because after Nagi no Asukara people are expecting amazing visuals and animation from them and Glasslip did not deliver at all.  The delivery was abysmal.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND\\n\r\nNow it's time for the OST which was pretty meh, not the worst I've heard but certainly not good.  The opening was nice and relaxing, and the ending well, it sounded like the chickens were singing in the beginning but it gets better throughout the song.  Nothing really screams at me, telling me \"Peggy, notice me senpai\".  The tracks are nice to listen to while watching the show but are extremely forgettable.  The classical music they chose for this anime\\n\r\nweren't all that special either.  The voice acting for the characters is nothing great, actually it's very lacking in emotions in the voice and just overall really not all the great in general. However I will say, there is a character named Jonathan who is a chicken, my god can that chicken voice act.  I just want to fry it and hear it scream in pain while I devour it in a KFC bucket, Mein Black Fantasies ~MrRecklessPenguin\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, Glasslip is truly a disaster of an anime that I highly recommend nobody ever watches.  if anything watch Nagi no Asukara for it's PA works on top of their\\n\r\ngame.  Here are the scores, now don't laugh!\\n\r\nThe story gets a 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters a 2.75 out of 10\\n\r\nthe art/animation a 6\\n\r\nand the ost a 4\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip gets a score of a 3.9 without enjoyment and with my enjoyment being a 3.5 I award Glasslip with a score of 3.85 giving it a recommendation to quarantine this show at once.  It is truly an atrocity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Prior knowledge: N/A\r\nThis season had a lot of highly anticipated anime. Mahouka, SAO, and Aldnoah.Zero just to name a few. And in this list of anticipated shows is Glasslip. From the studio that created the original anime show Nagi no Asukara, famous for its pentagonic love-triangle and twist couple endings. An original concept is always something viewers welcome. No doubt many were expecting something of similar quality with this show and from the synopsis it was thought that was what people were going to get. Another original anime show based around some complicated love-pentagon (hexagon?) that expertly resolves itself.\r\nYou get none of that.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nSowhat's the story of this show? It's a romance show that centers around a close group of friends. The story itself is split into 3 different arcs revolving around 3 couples as they go through their own problems. Each arc revolves around a different theme that people of their age should be able to relate to. And it all branches from the concept of awkward teenage romances. Relatable enough. There's a bit of supernatural elements involved in the plot that doesn't make itself stand out so much since it's not the main focus of the show. So, if the plot is this simple then why is it so bad? It's not so much the plot as in the storytelling and exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe show certainly tried to create its own sort of atmosphere with the show. It tried to be abstract and deep. It tried to show its plot through uses of imagery rather than dialogue. And it did so in spectacular fashion (not in a good way).The plot's fragmented style, similar to that of the ef~ series, Baccano, and Durarara, along with its odd freeze frame shots give a very abstract feel to it. It's something different from many of the other generic romance shows out there and for that it deserves some recognition. Maybe it's what the show was aiming for, as a representation towards the hectic nature of teen romances. But hell, it's too abstract and a pain to watch. It's not so much the non-linear style that's boring but the events themselves. For a show that revolves around 3 hormone driven couples, it is amazing dull. The writing is extremely bad and the pacing is dreadfully slow. Even though there is progression, the show's writing and direction is so bad that it seem that nothing is going on. The progression is slow too. Nothing of interest happens for the first 6 episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\nEvents happen for no reason and every episode is just a shot of a character doing something utterly mundane. By this, I mean like walking to a store and then walking back (without getting anything). Or reading a book. Or sitting in the living room. There's barely any dialogue or movement. There's no backstory to the characters and we get no information at all about them or the setting. At the same time a bunch of couple problems get dumped at us at the weirdest times. This creates a situation where you have barely developed characters in tense emotional situations and it just doesn't work. Because there's no way the audience can hope to sympathize or connect with them. The arc switching and the show's events have no sense of progression. It simply cuts over to another mundane scene or postcard view. This makes the show very slow and very static.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the horrible direction and writing, the show could have been halfway decent if the characters were written well. And it's the characters that truly make this show the train wreck it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is rather nice. It's very reminiscent of Nagi no Asukara. But that's simply it. It's pretty. It's a pretty painting and nothing more. I've mentioned before the direction is abysmal. It really is. It seems that only one or two things actually ever move in a scene. The animation is very basic. It's like they were too lazy to animate anything more complex than the equivalent of a head tilt. It's not as if the animation was bad, it's just that there is barely any movement! Every other shot is a pan of the town scenery. Because it seems the it has nothing better to show us. Is it some symbolism representing fear of outside change? Who knows? The shots themselves are way too still. I'm not expecting dynamic camera angles for a romance/SoL show but the shots are way too still and too unchanging. The freeze frames are annoying and only makes the show seem that more still. There doesn't seem to be any valid point in having the freeze frames in the first place. It doesn't add anything to the plot, the characters or the atmosphere. It just seems bland and unfocused. It also shows this anime had a shitty budget. The animation and art direction is equally responsible in creating this static pacing the show gives off.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, it's pretty but that's about it. There's nothing wrong with the sound direction or voice actors but it's just drab and uninspiring. There's barely any dialogue even between two characters forced into a situation where they have to talk. The OP itself sounds relaxing but as the show continues it only reinforces the dull nature of the show. The classical piano music that accompanies certain scenes, such as Kakeru's inner thoughts, are only a reminder of how obnoxious the show is in trying too hard to be deep and meaningful. When in reality it's tiresome to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bad. Let's put that out of the way first. It's easy to say that something is bad. But we need reasons.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the main problem with our characters in Glasslip? It's that they don't develop. There's very little sign that they do. And even if you somehow make it to the later episodes, the static pace the show makes that I was talking about earlier, makes it incredibly hard to spot an inch of character development. There's also zero exposition. There are so many things we have to infer from all their relationships. It could be some sort of selective narration. Many times I was left wondering what exactly happened between the characters because I had no clear picture of their relationship. It forces you to put together the missing pieces. This technique of selective narration isn't bad. It's a pretty cool way of telling a story. However, with all the other factors added in; from the awful direction, to bad writing, to scenes that serve very little purpose, this technique only makes the show look confusing. And it's not nearly as effective if the characters show any trace of reaction or development.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very dependent on character tropes. The whole show is just a big mess of them. And the tropes are cranked up to eleven. We're shoved right into the heat of the story with the six characters. And we don't know anything about them. At all. No backstory. No mention of a relationship. We just have to 'assume' they're all tight from the get go. It's the tropes define their characters and actions. Because we don't know anything about themselves or their personalities, the show expects us to draw from the many cliches of anime romances to justify the characters actions. Just from the character designs we can predict each character's personality. Kakeru is the mysterious transfer student. Touko is the main innocent girl. Sachi is the \"tragic glasses girl\" (they literally say this in this episode), Yuki is the somewhat cool spunky kid. Yanagi is the somewhat tomboyish mature girl, and Hiro is the energetic side character. I'm sure many anime viewers can sense to some degree what an anime character's personality would be like after looking at their appearance. Since it's used time and time again in many anime shows. Glasslip is the same. Except nothing is added anything to it. They are embodiment of their cliche tropes. In contrast with say, Kokoro Connect. You have a similar situation with 5 friends, Inaba is the cold calculating person, Aoki is the comic relief, Taichi is the nice guy and so on. But Kokoro Connect actually develops their characters throughout the show past our initial impressions derived from their tropes. They react to the situations presented before them and their characters change as a result. It just doesn't happen in Glasslip. Their actions are a result of the tropes they represent and it's the only way we can justify any of their actions. I'm supposed to agree with what they do since I'm supposed to empathize with them, since they're teenagers and we were once there too and stuff. You cannot emphasize with cliche tropes. You can only expect the next trope to come. And if it's not the correct one, the show falls apart.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say there aren't any sane characters. Yuki and Yanagi's complicated relationship was resolved well. The reveal that they turned out to be step-siblings was executed well and explained many of the odd things they did. Even if their characters don't exactly change throughout the show, their actions did make sense in context. Kakeru's character, even if he is odd, is shown struggling in his decision on whether to stay with Touko or continue travelling with his mum. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast feels like props. They don't feel like people. It feels like they're props ordered to move around from one scene to another in order to move the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's an understatement to say this show is boring. The show is dull. Simply put. While the first three episodes first had my head scratching, the further it went on the more it became clear that this ambiguous vibe was only going to worsen. I could only enjoy the because of the numerous discussions I've had pointing out its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of arguments for this show. There are some people that would say that an SoL show isn't supposed to be all action and twists. And yeah, that's right. But this show doesn't tell a story about everyday teenagers. It just doesn't tell us anything properly. I would point you to Usagi Drop. Where it shows that a show about everyday life can be engaging and heartfelt. There's others that would argue 12 episodes isn't enough to see 6 main characters in detail. I'd point you to Kokoro Connect. Where it shows the relationships between the 5 main characters expertly and develops them further. You'll have some that would argue the future fragment element was detrimental and without it the show would be much better. I'd point you to Isshuukan Friends. Where its amnesia element was incorporated well into the plot and served to drive it forward. People could argue a love-triangle isn't needed in a romance anime. I'd point you to White Album 2 which shows conflict and resolution between the 3 main characters properly. And if you're still not convinced, I'd point you to ef~ a tale of memories. Which incorporates all these elements together from symbolism and imagery, to the supernatural, to intertwining plot lines. \\n\\n\r\nThere's lots of other shows that do the things Glasslip does a million times better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen a show written so badly, directed so horribly, paced so boringly. It always seems that nothing happens in this show. Still frames!? Why!? I don't need a 1080p wallpaper of Jonathan! Every other scene is just a pan of the bloody town! Only one or two things ever physically move in a scene. Characters are shown going to one place, then immediately going back for no reason at all! They are never elaborated on or developed. Any event that would seem to serve some sort of character development is somehow conveniently forgotten in the next episode. They don't seem to react after an event.The dialogue is just so static. The music, while fine at first, soon emphasizes the drab nature of the show. This equates to a feeling of zero pacing. Like this show is not going anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nNever before have I seen such a show that is simply bad.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback is welcome! If you liked what you read do visit my blog!",

            "content": "Okay I know that many reviews have been made for this train wreck, but I really think I need to state some important things here.\r\nStory: 4/10 - In the beginning you think \"oh, this is cute. it's about a girl who loves glass making and she'll end up falling in love!\" Nope. Wrong. Glass making was on the side. Not even kidding.\r\nNow I think people have bashed this anime enough about the shitty story. But I will tell you something, there is actually a very symbolic meaning to this anime. But holy crap, the execution was god awful. And if I have to physically lookup and go on a hunt to search up the actual plot of this anime, then you know it's terrible. \\n\\n\r\nI understand what they were going for, but they did such an awful job it's laughable. And if you've been sitting here since July watching this trash and you don't get what \"symbolic\" meaning I'm talking about, tell me and I'll tell you xD And if you're wondering if you should watch this, lol don't.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 - I do admire this aspect of the anime. Probably one of the few things that actually flowed, cuz the plot sure didn't. It has nice colors and decent background settings. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few nice things of this rubbish.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - The music for this anime is decent. The OP is soft and the ED is catchy. And the classical music that's played throughout the series it also enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nI think they put more money into the animation & sound verses a budget for the story. Like wtf. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 - Talk about annoying. The personalities of them are so bland I wanna whack my head against a wall. Like Touko is 18 but she acts like a 6 year old and wines too much. Yukinari doesn't know when to move on and stfu. Yanagi is just eh. She needs more of a defined personality. And Kakeru (AKA David) is this apathetic guy who seems to have a split personality disorder. And as for everyone else, they were just kind of there, adding more fuel to the fire. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 - Up until about episode 10, I was okay with this anime. I know things didn't make sense, but I didn't dislike it so much that I would stop watching it. But oh my god, everything went out of whack. Like what the actual fuck. Episode 11 made no sense, and episode 12 was just a huge mindfuck, and then episode 13 wasn't AS bad but that's probably because I was too busy going \"WHAT IS GOING ONE OMG\" to take notice. \\n\\n\r\nBut I understand what happened by looking it up online and reading sources on it. But if someone didn't do that, that person, like the people who suffered through this, are probably more confused than me. But the thought of how good this anime could have been makes this way less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10 - It had a good start, and the idea of seeing fragments of the future is cool, but this plot didn't even make sense. At least to people who didn't research it. I don't recommend this anime to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry for those of you who did watch this. *salutes you*",

            "content": "I didn't have any bad experience with P.A Works before. I had watched Nagi no Asukara and Hanasaku Iroha. NagiAsu is exceptionally a masterpiece and HanaIro, though it's not really good, it's not really that bad too because of the great art and a decent story. But, Glasslip as the P.A.W. latest work didn't come as my expectation.\r\nGlasslip came with an unique synopsis. It told you about the daughter of a glass artisan family, Fukami Touko. So I thought it would bring you some glass work and several trivial things about it, like HanaIro did. But it didn't. It's such a good example of deception.\r\nBut,I thought it's okay because many series have done something like that, as example recently is Rail Wars!. So let's see about the story first. At first, it came really good. It had same recipe as its predecessor, an unrequited love. It's really good, very good. Until the \"fragment of future\" came as the main topic here.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, till this day, I don't know what \"fragment of future\" is. It came to the person like Fukami Touko and the suck MC, Okikura Kakeru. Somehow, they're like people with Schizophrenia. It became the main topic in the later half, but somehow it's a biased topic. I hate it, they should just focused on the unrequited love instead of it. It's one of several turn-offs of the story. I won't tell another specifically, but as a summary, I hate them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good, as expected of P.A.W.. It's one of the reasons why I took this series. The character design is quite nice, not really good though. The animation is not really good. You might find yourself wondering why there are only a person talking in close-up. It is maybe the trick to saving their budget. Another point, the background is really good, as usual of P.A.W.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED is the best things here. You should hear them without watching the series. ChouCho and nano.RIPE did a good job with this part. Can't complain with this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is another turn-offs for this series. There were almost no interaction between the characters other than the determined pairs. The only connection between each pairs is through side characters, which make them the shining one instead the main characters. Because of it, there was no development, and even if there was a development that I missed, it must be a slow one. The characters itself without the interaction were really annoying, especially the boys. Okikura Kakeru with Dissociative identity disorder and Imi Yukinari with his own ego and couldn't even fight for his love. The good boys is only Shirosaki Hiro with steady characters. I love his characters more than the other main casts.\\n\\n\r\nI really couldn't enjoy it at all. The slow development of both story and characters never make it better. I could only enjoy both of the OP and ED, it's the only relaxing part before the story but it still couldn't help the series.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip came as a promising series. It come with a good art and character design, an unique synopsis, and a line of the senior voice actors. It was a promising series, but too bad it couldn't use any advantage it had. The turn-offs in this story was really much that it couldn't be helped with the advantages it had. Do not touch this series at all, except you're prepared with the story and bad characters.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this series.",

            "content": "------ SPOILER ALERT ------\r\nFrom Hanasaku Iroha, Tari Tari to Nagi no Asukara, I learnt PA Works. The inspirational, youthful and romance genre of the anime makes PA Works one of my favourite in the industry. Last season, Nagi no Asukara reached another high where I can cry almost every episodes.\r\nBearing the expectation of \"re-feel\" Nagi no Asukara again, I am highly expecting GlassLip before the start of its airing. After the first few episodes, however, my after impression is that it does not reach my assumption and in fact, somehow disappointing.\r\nFrom the first episode, I am excited because the drawing style of PA Works onceagain emerged before my eyes. The art is so good and the character is loveable especially Toko, where I somehow recall Manaka in Nagi no Asukara. At here, I assume that the story would tell about the relationship of all the characters, as usual, starting from the good friends eventually become worse due to something, then reach to dramatic climax and finally they solve it together. No sooner, the consequent episodes tell that GlassLip does not follow that way.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters in this anime. Toko, Yanagi, Sachi, Yukinari and Hiro are very good friends except Kakeru that comes from other place. From the very beginning, we can know that who has crush on who, and who are the destined couple in the end of story. However, we do not know the reason or story behind every act or motive. The story tells little or nothing about the characters history. And then, characters are not complexly intervened together to make story progress. At first, they do watch fireworks and climb mountain together. Later on, they seldom interact with each other as a whole. Not to mention the couple who always interact together. Sometimes, they do have one or two which is not couple interacts together. However, most of the time the anime keep switches between the daily life of the characters to lead the story flow. From this point, it gives the feel as if the story do not progress anymore or, actually at a very slow pace. The ability to look through the future spices up the anime, however, it is very confusing and does not actually improve the entertainment of the anime. Overall, everything is slow, confusing, and the less of climax makes the anime kinda dull.\\n\\n\r\nToday, GlassLip has came to an end. The ending is quite a good one if compare to the overall feeling it has given. After all, it tells a romance story involving six teenagers during their last summer of the high school year. The ending has all the couples develop well or at least, their romance has just began.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually all about understanding your love one, and take action instead of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nHiro likes Sachi. Therefore, he follows Sachi to read books. At first he get bored easily, but at the end, he actually learns alot from the books and can express impressive ideas until being praised by Yanagi.\\n\\n\r\nSachi does not like Hiro at first, but she tries to accept him. To do that, she actually confess to Toko in order to get rid of her odd liking. During mountain climbing at later part, she confess that she is trying very hard to reach him. Ashita wo tameni, could mean that the day is coming soon.\\n\\n\r\nYanagi tries to understand Yukinari as well. Everyday she run the same route as Yukinari run. She writes down everything she experiences during the run and send it to Yukinari. While Yukinari claims that he does not understand Yanagi as well, he goes to see Yanagi training in her dancing class. This shows that they have the similar aspiration to pursue the dream.\\n\\n\r\nHiro and Sachi, Yukinari and Yanagi, the two couples go well at the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the big contrast to the rest of the anime is Kakeru and Toko, and their ability to look through the future. Kakeru, the pitiful boy develops the ability due to the loneliness he has undergo throughout his life. As for Toko, it could be her deep consciousness that wanting for romantic love that lead to the same ability. Just like they said, because I want to meet you, so i met you. The ability attracts the two who possesses the same ability.\\n\\n\r\nIn the middle, Kakeru eventually loses the ability because he finally has Toko as his good listener and companion. Toko falls in love with Kakeru too. At the episode 12, Toko experiences Kakeru loneliness and that is the important episodes that we can finally know a thing or two about Kakeru past. Kakeru is a pitiful character as said, he is naturally forgotten by others because the lack of unforgettable memories with others. At the last episode, the glass meteor signify the resolvement of both Kakeru and Toko. Kakeru finally has a precious memory together with Toko. Whether Kakeru travels to other place or follows Toko to the same school, the ending gives us an open answer.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, GlassLip is a very meaningful anime. We cant simply undestand it by just having a look. The director indeed has something to tell in this anime, though using a very different way from usual, or we can call it art. Come to think about it, the less dramatic story and the less intervening of characters in the story are actually acceptable. It tells about the slice of life which is more real in our life. The OP conveys more information than we couldimagine. The intervening of characters in OP is something we hardly seen in story. The ability to look through future is nothing but a way used by director to eventually tells the theme of this anime: No matter what will happen in future, I believe the future me can overcome with it.\\n\\n\r\n(Does anyone try to combine the picture-diary in GlassLip?)",

            "content": "I would say the name 'Glasslip' definitely is the perfect name. What? No I don't mean that because the main character dreams of becoming a glass artisan! I mean that this anime is like glass: pretty but with nothing in it. This is the perfect description for an anime with gorgeous art and no story.\r\nTo this day I don't think this anime came to any conclusion at all. It was going SOMEWHERE at SOME POINT, but just like glass the plot broke and became worthless.\r\n\" But Kitty, there must have been SOMETHING in that anime, it's 13 episodes after all! \"\r\nAha! But you see these13 episodes were about small and useless conflicts. It's like: This guy was bothered by something and he spent the whole episode talking to 7 different him's inside his head before finally coming to the conclusion that he realized nothing anyway. There was definitely some hint of romance between characters, but as I mentioned before, NOTHING happened. There was no progress in ANYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say the characters were horrendous, but they weren't special either. Every episode was like watching someone in real life talking with his/her friends, just in anime form. Because nothing happened in this show there was obviously no character development. However, i must say I definitely enjoyed Jonathan. He knew what was up. (For those who haven't seen the show, Jonathan is a chicken who lives in the school courtyard)\\n\\n\r\nEven in this horribly boring anime I found a few things that were enjoyable: the art and music. The art itself was very gorgeous, even if there was nothing special about the animation it was still pleasing to the eye. The sound gave off a relaxing mood, being classical music and all. Very calm and soothing, something you could listen to while drawing.\\n\\n\r\nNow the thing is, did I enjoy it? Heck no! I was expecting more from this since the producers are known for anime's such as Hyouka, Angel Beats, Another and many more, so I had high hopes for this! Boy, was I disappointed. All I got for my excitement was 13 episodes of no story and random chickens. (God bless Jonathan)",

The worst has to be Sachi (The manipulative bi**h), she \"loves\" Touko and becomes Jealous of the time Touko and  David  spend together, she even plots to ruin a date the two are on by using Hiro. Now we have Yukinari who, just like Sachi, loves Touko and is jealous of david, he confesses to Touko and gets rejected and afterwards we are left with a despressed piece of sh**, Yanagi, the second most irratating character of the lot, she gets a bit jealous of Touko because Yuki likes her and she likes Yuki. seems to be ok with David one minute then angry at him the next mainly due to how his relationship with Touko hurts Yuki. Now best for last, Hiro. While Hiro is nothing special he is one that many would sympathise with simply because of how he is mistreated by both the aniime itself and one certain character (Sachi). He loves Sachi but unfortunately she loves Touko while she states that she loves both of them its clear she doesn't feel as strongly towards Hiro as she does towards Touko. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Art - 6 \\n\\n\r\nNothing too special with the art, the sound is good and both are definitely the only good points of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 0\\n\\n\r\nSeriously avoid this at all cost especially if you dont want to be mentally scarred for life with the fact you have wasted so much time on the biggest piece of rubbish in existence. \\n",

It started off by introducing us to an interesting cast of characters. A group of close friends. 3 girls and 2 guys. Throw in another guy to mix things up a little and you get a love square for drama. That's how itstarted, but once the supernatural was thrown in, everything got jumbled up. The story went away from the group of friends and started focusing on the relationships between pairs of the characters and the group wasn't ever seen altogether for a while. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a real plot is never established but somehow there's a conclusion. The only good things in my opinion were the art and sound. I guess that's where the main focus was when creating this original anime.",

            "content": "Alright, I can understand why people may be upset about the fact how this series ended and I feel empathy for those who seems unsatisfied. But let me explain why I gave this review a score of 7.8/10  (since I can't scores in the tenth decimal place). \r\nStoryline: 8/10\r\nThis story goes beyond the understanding of \"cutesy romance, after school clubs, and dramatic soap opera slice of life.\" As you may know the director who was involved with this series uses a lot of representations of items or scenes in explaining this series. Many of the times I watched this anime and thought what wasthe point of this anime? Why does this seem really confusing and how come it isn't making any sense? I read a post in understanding what this anime is about on reddit and looked at other opinions from other people, and what really stood out is the fact the metaphors are used greatly throughout this anime. Many of the times it seems that the different scenes and objects we see throughout the anime seems oblivious to us, but those scenes/objects are really important in terms of telling the story and understanding it. Realizing each scene about how it pertains to the characters, made better sense of what may have happened or the misunderstand of each other. I don't really want to ruin much of the story here, but you'll understand once you see the series with your own eyes. In the end, this story line seems more of a philosophical thought compared to the eye-candy-eye-catching artwork quality. I know it seems really bad in terms of rating, but once you put everything together throughout the story line it makes perfect sense, and don't just hate on it, you gotta let yourself think about the story line. Because the way how we think cultural differs on how the people in japan thinks culturally can effect what we think about this anime. You can't forget how sometimes Japanese culture are very subtle on how they act, but it means a lot more than what you might think. \\n\\n\r\n(I think the story line is more important and I only made brief comments as to why it was good on categories below)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe artwork quality was done magnificently in terms of landscape, especially the rendering of the background with the high saturation of light between the trees in certain scenes, while focusing more of the characters, and heights the mood of the plot. I would say the art quality was almost done as well as the story line and I can't really find a complaint as to why it would be off-putting compared to other animes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nGiving an eight for the score seems to be reasonable enough right? Since they didn't cheap out on the sound quality, and they did accurately display the recording of each character with its own scenes of ambient noises (like with cricket sounds, wind, or a car passing by). Now maybe if there were certain areas they had made the scenes sounded like they were on the beach because throughout the story line they all sounded like they were all in a room, but thanks to the ambient sounds and music, it had a less noticeable stale sound. (I may be asking too much, but I'm comparing this to the quality of their artwork) \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe writers of the anime did well in depicting the awkwardness in some characters. It does put a sense of eerie-ness within the story and it gives it a weird flavor of curiosity on what some character's might be saying, like how some words are cut off from certain characters with uneasiness, uncertainty, or maybe keeping things a secret. I think this is also why I was glue to this anime in the first place, with it character's personality on track rather than having to be changed dramatically, the progression on each character grew steadily  of awkwardness to a better understand why he/she is awkward. And character development does grow on you through the story and by watching the anime towards the end, you kinda know what they're going to say next or be satisfied on why they are the way they are.",

            "content": "For many reasons, I don't get the Google Car. I also don't get the people who are in favor with that contraption. Why would you take away the fun of driving? Driving is one of the few pleasures left in this world full of twisted, upside-down-pyramid society. The car itself looked like it came from a long-forgotten anime, and no one, not me, you, or anyone would want to get caught riding in it. Worse, the car is plagued with technologies that can't keep up with the complexities of the human's road instincts. Perhaps the only the good reason of ever getting a Google Caris that it drives by itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to Glasslip, which also drives itself in terms of storytelling. It may be good enough on its own, that is if you won\u2019t be comparing it with other dramatic coming-of-age slice-of-life anime such as Tari-Tari and Hanasaku Iroha, both of which came from Pony Canyon and P.A. Works--the very same studios that brought you Glasslip...er, this thing.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, Glasslip is horrible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nThere are many worthy cars around, but for the practicality and the feel of slice-of-life in it, it will be like this: if Tari-Tari is like a Toyota, and Hanasaku Iroha is like a Mazda, then Glasslip is like a Google Car.\\n\r\nLet me say this first: Glasslip is just massively, and I mean MASSIVELY, SUBSTANTIALLY plot-driven.\\n\r\nIts story is about a girl who was not supposed to be the main character in the first place. She was not supposed to be voiced by a talented seiyuu either. The only good point about her is she knows how to make glasses from furnaces which are completely unrelated to the progress of the \"future-seeing\" plot-element. Worse, it's later revealed that the glass themselves didn't serve as a medium or sort to the \"future-fragments\" at all. Yes, the plot is about seeing the future...yet you wonder \"why\"? \\n\r\nReally, why? \\n\r\nThere's no reason from beginning to end, except that it's...that. That it's just like how the writer planned on putting an element about the future through \"future-fragments\" that wasn't really there at all.\\n\r\nThen, add to this mess, there\u2019s the male lead who must have watched Gundam 00 or Gundam Wing before episode one started. And here, he claims about hearing voices of the future, something to do with enigmatic-looking visual effects.\\n\r\nAdd that girl and this guy who will become a couple, but didn't, but will become a predictable pair with supporting characters who also have become predictable couples who are as helpful as that chicken called \"Jonathan\" in progressing the story, then throw in the coming-of-age theme which sicks of coming-of-age Young-Adult, mention \"romance\" in the theme to give viewers an illusion that they're watching something romantic, plus a bit of a supernatural plot-element about \u201cfuture fragments\u201d that is as moot as that American author\u2019s Young-Adult genre sparklepires, and you get this dramatic slice-of-life \"romantic\" thing that's massively plot-driven.\\n\r\nEven if you put Furukawa Seria, Saori Hayami, Risa Taneda, Shimizaki Nobunaga, Osaka Ryota, and Yamashita Daiki themselves here as characters, it would not matter at all because the storyline will just drive itself like a confounded Google Car and will still arrive at the same plot development towards the conclusion or ending--this is what a MASSIVE plot-driven story means. It's a Google Car in analogy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4\\n\r\nOne badly-written character I\u2019ve ever come across is this Kakeru. Because let me put it this way. If you want to look cool and indifferent at the same time, you have to be Setsuna F. Seiei. For that to happen, you have to pilot a Gundam in world war 50, which will never happen in our lifetime. So at least, you got to have the chuunibyou syndrome, which might excuse your actions, but if the theme itself is \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d then having chuunibyou won\u2019t work because you have act as 12 until the last episode. Hence, Kakeru\u2019s actions is like\u2026being schizophrenic, because having chuunibyou is simply not an excuse with the given storyline, and you can only be cool and aloof if you\u2019re a war-torn individual in a war-torn situation in a war-torn world, or have enough supporting elements and concepts seen in fantasy-, psychological- and action-themed anime for the character to act up as that, let\u2019s say Hunter-X-Hunter for example, or Darker than Black\u2014both anime in which the situation calls for it.\\n\r\nPut that character concept in a slice-of-life and he\u2019s downright schizoid\u2014and yes, there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m saying this, er, I don\u2019t want to spoil it. But we both know that he does seem to sleep in a tent, outside of his own and his dad\u2019s and his mom's home. Thus, he might be in a chuunibyou-mode imagining he\u2019s Setsuna F. Seiei sleeping in the Exia\u2019s cockpit, just that Setsuna F. Seiei doesn\u2019t do that and doesn\u2019t have, er, well, you\u2019ll see.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Touko, who as the main character, is as complex as glass\u2026no, not really. She only relies in the future and is currently detached to the present. Thus, she could not do much and didn\u2019t do much at all. It\u2019s like she\u2019s waiting for the writer to finish up with the episode and come to the next. You see her making calls and talking to her friends. But you take her out of the picture, and the story is still fine on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the predictable pair Sachi and Hiro, who also can\u2019t make progress because, although she did made Hiro to approach her and vice-versa as Hiro wanted to, but instead some other things or events happened, and thus the next progressive thing to do is to cancel some other events, and think what they shall read next. Sure, there were some other stuffs going on between them but it always ends up with something to do with books, even if they were talking about the moon.\\n\\n\r\nThen we also have Yukinari and Yanagi, who had a progress, but for some reason the progress itself ran away and was never seen again. Hence, they\u2019re stuck from the development. Instead, what we have are the two of them being indecisive and beating-around-the-bush with their emotional reasons that doesn't blend with the story--and then, the writer just lost it and concluded that their parents were married to each other to begin with, therefore they' are step-siblings.\\n\r\nThen there's Touko's little sister, Hina, who likes to go outside in a swimsuit. And that has entirely nothing to do with the plot. Even the reason where Touko and company doesn't like Kakeru who was causing them to drift has nothing to do with the plot either. They just all drifted on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThen, somewhere in this chaos, the writer of Glasslip inserted the word \"romance\" as one of the themes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we go back to Kakeru and Touko, who, for a reason to exist, they must have been hit with the \"similar attraction theory\" thus they understand each other.\\n\r\nAnd so they agreed on that.\\n\r\nLater on the episodes, they again agreed that they don't agree they understand each other. And the story went on to the last episode. Some reviews in MAL says it's forced but it was not just forced, it was like the writer must have wrote the script while eating a rat.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters seem to be talking to each other, communicating, but are not interacting at all. And if they do talk, the events are already pre-determined so it doesn't matter if they talk about the moon, or fireworks, or books, or even a Hyundai, because the plot will just unfold itself as to what happens next. That's plot-development without the interaction, input and effect of the characters. It\u2019s like talking to a fax machine. But this is a badly-written type of story so we should understand it as a badly-written story.\\n\r\nAn American author came up with something very much like this and was able to get away with her characters she named Edward and Bella, and it worked in the same manner as feces working its way out of your large intestine and to your rectum.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nObviously, the art has nothing to do with the storyline so I'll rate it as 10 as this is made by Pony Canyon and P.A. Works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 5\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t think seiyuu-wise is talk-worthy here. Sure there\u2019s Saori Hayami on this, and she\u2019s also in Tari-Tari, and I love her as Haqua in TWGOK and Tsuriko in AnoHana. But the entire Glasslip\u2019s plot is driven like a Google Car. Not only there's Saori Hayami on this, there's also Risa Taneda, and neither of them can alleviate how badly-written this is. It has happened to some anime before that has Kana Hanazawa or Haruka Tomatsu on it and it will happen again.\\n\r\nOpening and ending songs are pretty much coming-of-age-esque, so we just leave it as that. Forever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 3\\n\r\nCan\u2019t enjoy it at all. The only drive I have why I finished watching this was because of Saori Hayami and Risa Taneda, and that I have one more anime to add to my list here in MAL. Yet for the sake of other people to open up their minds on this...thing, you can enjoy this like the Google Car, where you can watch anime or cut your nails or read an otaku magazine while it drives for you. It\u2019s always subjective in the end, this. In the end, it\u2019s you who\u2019ll decide subjectively and opinionated on how miserable or acceptable Glasslip is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 4\\n\r\nAfter watching more than half of the entire 13-episodes, I get the feeling that the animators, the people hired and tasked to animate this miserable thing, must have realized that they all are completely wasting their time.\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said, Glasslip is like a Google Car. It's so driven by itself that there's no other input needed, not even the characters'.\\n\r\nAnd oh, even after watching it 'til the end, I still don\u2019t get what\u2019s with those future fragments...and the voice of the future.\\n\r\nIt sounded something Relena Peacecraft or Marina Ismail would say, just not literally.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Sure, the plot has the potential by default, but only in the creative mind of a writer who knows how a dramatic slice-of-life coming-of-age themed story is made.",

            "content": "I was kind of surprised to see that Glasslip scored lower than Tokyo ESP this season. It wasn't a great anime, but I don't feel it deserves less than a 6- at least not by MAL standards. The reviews seem to be overwhelmingly negative- a lot of 2's, 3's, etc, which I think is kind of ridiculous, because it makes me wonder where complete technical failures like Zettai Junpaku Majou Shoujo and Mars of Destruction are supposed to reside on the scale. If Glasslip, despite it's beautiful animation and sound, is brought down to a 2 by it's faults in story telling, then there simplyis room for the truly terrible anime to exist on the same scale. Anyway, let's talk about Glasslip. \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem with Glasslip is likely its attempt at subtlety. There is a very fine line between conveying a message with few words, and saying a few words to pretend you have a message. There are a lot of really \"deep\" sounding lines in Glasslip- things no teenager would ever rightly say, or that are too purposefully vague to be meaningful. It takes a lot of thinking to work out coherent theories for what exactly was happening in Glasslip, and even when you come upon something you think is consistent, it's really just conjecture; the show doesn't give us, as the audience, enough to work with. We know that there's some strange love triangle (square, pentagon, hexagon- I've lost count) going on, and in the end, it feels sadly unresolved. We can speculate as to what the characters were thinking and feeling, but because the showed decided to be so vague, we can't say for sure. Sometimes that's not a bad thing... here, it just comes off as confusing. \\n\\n\r\nAs for further criticism... It was hard to relate to the characters at times, especially the main girl. She's quirky for the sake of being quirky, and naive to the point where you wonder if she's \"all there\". In the last few episodes, the storytelling aspect of the show really falls apart. A lot is left unexplained. There was a long buildup with no climax, and I think that's what throws a lot of people off.I n the end, you get the feeling that there was never a correct answer to the question the plot proposes, and that is very unsatisfying. It feels like the author wrote a story that was complex, but never had a way to tie it all together. I'm not sure how it was all explain in the light novels, or if the endings differed, or if the anime was just too short to cover the entire story- but on its own, it really doesn't stand up to criticism. \\n\\n\r\nNow for some praise. The show had beautiful art and sound. It wasn't the best I've ever seen, but it was well above average- especially the scenery. It looks a lot like Nagi no Asukara, and that's a good thing. The anime's main faults are its storytelling- it has the technical aspects down. And despite all of the flaws I've mentioned above, I didn't hate the story. It was needlessly vague at points, but their was, in fact, a fair bit of character development over the course of the anime. The change in their relationships is actually fairly coherent, although the reasoning is never clearly stated. In fact, if they had thrown out the whole \"magical\" aspect of the show, it probably would have benefited. The main plot was clumsy, but the character dynamics were alright. \\n\\n\r\nI also wasn't very bored when I was watching Glasslip. As I approached the last episode, I had a sinking feeling that nothing was going to be resolved, and that was immensely disappointing- but otherwise, I never thought the series got too stale. It was fairly fast paced, and a lot happened between episodes. I think that's another thing that makes the story somewhat hard to follow; the passage of time isn't very clearly explained, although it's obvious that several weeks must be passing between episodes. Still, it kept me entertained, and I think that's a principle value of anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere are better dramas you can watch. If you want action or something a bit more exciting, this obviously isn't the place to look. Glasslip isn't a great anime, but it wasn't that bad. It sits anywhere between a 6.5 and 7 for me.",

            "content": "It\u2019s rather hard to swallow to think that Glasslip whom I had high expectations for turned out to be this warped.\r\nI\u2019ve made some reviews before. I usually write reviews of good or at least passable pieces of work to me. This time, however, I made an exception.\r\nFirst, I\u2019d like to afford the genres:\r\nRomance, Slice of Life, Supernatural\r\nAlso, the minor genres:\r\nSchool-life\r\nNow, let\u2019s begin the review, shall we?\r\nThis anime has a great potential, I must say. Slice of life is a common genre in anime, and it is a popular one.\r\nBut what a slice of life show depicts don\u2019t have to be improved to the extent thatwill eventually confuse the audience. The plot is basically simple: a girl in a group who can see future and deals with it without her friends' knowing.\\n\r\nBut, when the show begins, the simple plot we\u2019re talking about appears to be a complicated plot. Even chickens join in. We\u2019ve got another big genre here, supernatural, plus romance and minor school life that can be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s combine these together and try to create a story based on these styles. That\u2019s it! Slice of life shows usually don\u2019t involve supernatural. Slice of life is usually connected with the reality of life, something realistic, while supernatural is somewhat surreal. Thanks to the genres, the story turns out twisted and very complicated to understand to such an extent that perhaps we should have professionals check it out themselves. In addition to the story, it ended awfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters develop poorly. So poor that I can\u2019t even explain it, I mean they\u2019re difficult to understand. Should they appear in my life, I should be smarter than the me now so that I will not end up become one of those oddballs.\\n\\n\r\nThis phase\u2019s conclusion: BAD\\n\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, not much to say, not bad but not great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEvery piece of work has good aspect(s), even the most unattractive ones\\n\\n\r\n\t                                                                           \u2013  Stelvedorn \u2013\\n\\n\r\nQuotation above is what I believe. This anime is not the worst. I\u2019ve seen many shows that are worse than this. The truth that I\u2019ve finished watching the show proves it.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip has a very good graphic, everyone admits. You should at least check it out. I\u2019m impressed, while much animes portray background people motionlessly, Glasslip doesn\u2019t, I mean, hey, they\u2019re (people) literally alive! The city\u2019s beautifully drawn. They\u2019re simply  beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not the only one finished Glasslip instead of dropped it. That\u2019s it! I astonishingly finished it because of the enjoyment. Well, not very enjoy it but, I enjoy watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis phase\u2019s conclusion: PASSABLE\\n\\n\r\nI conclude that Glasslip is not an anime I recommend you watching. Despite the positive aspects it has, the negative aspects are dominating. I hope you\u2019ll be helped by this.\\n\r\nI hereby end this review.\\n",

            "content": "Ordinarily I don't feel the need to review anime. If something is great, chances are someone else has already discovered it and published that fact. But Glasslip drove me to join the crowd warning against watching this pathetic excuse for a romance/slice-of-life show with a touch of fantasy/supernatural.\r\nThe reasons why this show was terrible have been well covered by other reviewers, but in short:\r\n* The characters are annoying, flat, and/or unmemorable.\r\n* There is essentially zero character development.\r\n* Again and again, plot elements are introduced only to have exactly zero effect on the plot or characters.\r\n* Oh, wait, there is no plot. Or at least, the\"plot\" is simply a series of scenes stitched together with no particular ordering to them.\\n\r\n* At random points, the animation (when there is animation, and not just heads with moving mouths) goes into an overly artistic freeze-frame mode for no good reason. Pretty? Yes, but it's not even relevant to the story (see previous point).\\n\\n\r\nThe list goes on. Which is pathetic. P.A. Works is perfectly capable of turning out well-written, well-animated, enjoyable anime that can also stand as meritorious works of storytelling. They did it with Nagi no Asukara last year, certainly. This time, though, they went with an original story, and they seem to have skimped on the writing budget.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip was just\u2026disappointing, for a number of reasons. It could have been good. It could have been great. But at this point, the only reason I can think of for watching it is the beautiful animation. With no characters to speak of and a plot that spends the entire season spinning its wheels, there's nothing else going for it.",

There were some good aspects but they were completely ruined by the awful story overall. This anime starts off pretty well. The animation is beautiful. There are two people who can see \"fragments of the future\" when they look at glass or do something special or whatever. This makes sense and seems pretty interesting. \r\nAfter this, it all goes down hill. There are 2 people with the seeing the future ability, a girl and a boy. The girl main character has a group of friends, and thesefriends pretty much crush on each other and create a ton of stupid drama that 1, has no relevance, 2, is boring, and 3, doesn't have any significance whatsoever. The boy main character moves in from another town and is quiet and somewhat rude. The boys in the group of friends are jealous of his good looks. After this, the girl crushes on the guy and they almost completely throw the storyline of \"seeing the future\" away. Everyone in the group freaks out when they see another person with their crush, and this gets extremely annoying. They added no depth at all, killed the plot of the future seeing(the only interesting part), and focus only on girls crushing on boys. There are no funny parts, the girl is a wimp, the voice acting is decent at best, and there were no turning points in the plot that were actually important. Furthermore, this anime drags on and on and on. Watching this anime became a chore for me. I had to force myself to continue watching it because it got so ridiculously boring.",

I thought this anime was going to be as good as Nagi no Asukara but i was sadly mistaken.\r\nStory:2/10\r\nI'm going to keep it nice and shitty for this one, just like the anime itself.This anime has one of the worst stories you have ever seen and my life would have been 10% better if i had just skipped this anime. For some reason i finished this anime and felt like the story writers are just shitting on a piece of paper and animating it.The only thing about the story that kind of drags you in is the romance and even that was done reallyshitty. Overall the story was just horrible and it makes me want to throw up the salad i ate for breakfast this morning\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie and tell you that the artwork is as bad as the story, In fact the art work was very beautiful and had very vivid colors. It was very solid animation and it was the only reason i continued to watch this anime. The animation is kind of the only thing that matters here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't bad but it they could have done a better job with it. Their weren't any tracks that caught my attention in any way but it does a good job in adding to the atmosphere. I also liked the voicing of the characters and they do a good job capturing how a character feels. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all get some kind of development but they didn't get to the level where I actually cared. Like i said the romance was shitty and that includes the feelings of the characters. I wanted to see them develop with the romance and feelings of the characters but instead the go and wipe arm pits with it. I got tired of these characters and the only one i really cared about was Sachi. She was the only interesting one to me and they still did a shitty work developing on her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n3 is pitty work because the only real thing i enjoyed was the animation.

Glasslip is a very interesting anime, it talks about the future that everyone wanted to see, wanted to control and wanted to grab, but in reality, Future lies at the things we really loved the most.\r\nTouko's character might be a typical girl who fell inlove at first sight at Kakeru, but to tell you the truth it is more than a typical love story. This one is more like a rubik's cube, you cannot get what they really want until you finished the whole series.\r\nThe development of the characters of Touko's friends kindagive me a vibe that there are people that are close to you yet they still have secrets they must keep. (Spoiler for that.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I love the opening song. SERIOUSLY! A summer vibe song!!! XD",

            "content": "Having been used to PA Works whipping out quality titles like Hana-Saku Iroha and Nagi no Asukara, it was a given that I was going to be tempted to try Glasslip out. At first glance, the premise seemed intriguing on paper as female lead Toko has the ability to see visions of the future through glass and a young man named Kakuru arrives in her home town for the summer that shakes things up with the relationships between Toko and her friends as he claims to be searching for her through hearing her voice, implying he may have some sort of supernatural ability like Toko.I would think that more concerning Kakeru and Toko's connection to each other would be revealed throughout the course of the series, and we may see things shaken up with Toko and her friends with an outsider mingling with them.\\n\\n\r\nSadly though, none of this really comes to pass as the biggest pitfall to Glasslip as a whole is that nothing really happens. We get little to no development with the characters and their relationships and their depth is rather limited, killing any interest one would have in caring for any bonds they have with one another or the characters on an individual level. Nothing in the plot really advances either as things with Toko and Kakeru's abilities never really lead to anything and nothing is ever delved into over the nature of their abilities nor why they have them, even with the title's occasional dropping of teases something may happen via Toko's visions. The storytelling here feels rather lazy and underwhelming, easily being the worst title I've seen come from PA Works to date.\\n\\n\r\nThe only high point to Glasslip comes from its visuals. Like many titles from PA Works, the scenic shots are quite pleasing to see with vast and detailed shots of the countryside, mountains and forests that sport vivid, bright color and depict differing times of day beautifully. Character designs are on the plain side, but sport just as much visual detail as the settings with unique features such as clothing and hair accessories. The animation in the series featured fluid movement regularly throughout the title's run as characters move about and go through with their daily routines like swimming or jogging.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip is easily one of the year's most disappointing titles considering the reputation PA Works had built among fans for the number of quality titles they've animated. With the plot and characterization to the series leading nowhere throughout its run, the series is a big waste of time that one shouldn't bother watching through unless you seek disappointment out of what you wish to see.\\n",

            "content": "Glasslip is great! It makes for a great wallpaper or screensaver. If it were part of a tourist promotional video or a commercial, it'd be quite excellent. Oh, as an anime, you ask? Not so much. It's almost like someone conceived of nice art with music and  then forgot it would be broadcast as an anime. \r\nThe show is done by PA Works, a studio that often frustrates me to no end with their work but often prove rewarding to watch in the end. Their shows have a lot of potential but often encounter some very strange decision making. Glasslip has the frustrating part,but unfortunately much less of the rewarding part. \\n\\n\r\nOn a conceptual level, Glasslip's story revolves around themes of loneliness and the desire for companionship as well how time is fleeting-- one lives in a moment that won't be there any more. There's also the concept of change brought by another new introduced element, most notable by one of the cast.  Glass, reflections, and fragments are key motifs in the story. There's all kinds of foreshadowing everywhere, many of it rather subtle and well done, so the plot progression isn't actually that rocky, convoluted, or contrived. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a masterwork right? Well...\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the series forever remains a tease. Stuff gets revealed and the foreshadowing turns out to progress the plot, except it doesn't really lead to a result I care about. Should I feel for what happened? What am I supposed to think? Glasslip just packs its bags and runs. In the end, nobody really cares! \\n\\n\r\nMaybe the show was to be low key. After all, human events of daily life aren't dramatic, and things just happen without many others caring. And to be fair, a lot of Glasslip is extremely idyllic and relaxing thanks to the soothing music and nice backgrounds and characters just doing mundane tasks. But that's why we often have drama so stuff is fun to watch. You don't want your audience to fall asleep!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, some works want you to leave it up to yourself to think of your own conclusions. I think it's a cop out, but others may like the journey being more important than the destination. Unfortunately, Glasslip sabotages itself with its greatest problem-- the dialogue. The interactions sometimes range from inane to flat out insane, almost to the point where you're wondering if they're playing homage to The Room or something. The series tries repeatedly to claim that the cast members are a circle of friends but there's too many scenes where they just keep sprouting exposition to each other-- and they really don't seem to show much concern for each other. Some friends to have, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters individually are actually not too bad. They are  often paired with another character where they have  relationships that are actually dynamic (too bad the group as a whole isn't). In them, they have to deal with their own insecurities and awkwardness, which generates conflict and drama. This is actually handled better than many over dramatic and over the top series. Most of them grow and reach some kind of revelation about themselves and the people around them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the side characters tend to be more well developed in this regard; I really don't know what the heck the 2 main leads were doing often. Glasslip also features a decent supporting cast such as the parents and siblings that I feel carries the show because they help the main cast feel like actual people. And of course, all hail Lord Jonathan the Chicken as well. I do feel however, that the developments could have been done in a concise manner, because parts of it got repeated and dragged over a bit too much for a 13 episode series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think what really kept me around was the art. Those glass making scenes (which I wonder why there isn't more of) are spectacular, and they actually make good use of the lighting and stuff especially when venturing into one of the plot elements. It also seems to change in mood-- the show started out insanely bright and slowly got darker as people got into conflicts... and then we have winter. The only problem here is that the animation is a bit weird and often just has stills for no good reason, proving that every time Glasslip does something great, it must do something awful to counter it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the art for the characters as well. They're a bit better than the 2 big eyes +line for a mouth +0.5 nose moestuff that I normally see, though I tend to like moe anyways. They should watch out for those sharp chins though. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of sound, the anime isn't bad. The opening song was pleasant to listen to every time, the ED song... not as much. Voice acting I thought was decent, well, except for Touko's ehhhhhh noise. Saori Hayami did a particular good job of bringing out the character of Yanagi.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, a double edged sword comes from PA Works's insular references. The chickens and the \"artsy\" stills are reference to the studio's work True Tears, also by the same director. You should probably be watching that instead of Glasslip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show's pretty inoffensive. It did make me somewhat sad though that this show could have been so much more if some care where made to the editing  but it decides to end up like this.  Such a pity, but reality is not measured in potential but what actually happened. At least it made me laugh, sometimes intentionally but often unintentionally. You could do a lot worse than Glasslip IMO, but I cannot recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "I've been reading reviews for quite some time on this show now, and no one here on MAL seems to get the point of Glasslip. When the top reviews have scores like 2 or 3, either something is wrong or the show is just that bad, which is not the case here\r\nOne thing to remember is that this review is based on my opinions and perspectives of the show, you don't have to agree nor disagree, you have only to respect it\r\nStory: -/10\r\nI CAN'T rate the story of this show, simply because it does not matter, it can't be bad or good because telling astory is not the point of it. When it came out, many people thought \"Hey, that's another boy meets girl romance right here\" and it is only fair to think that, although the show DOES present this particular plotline, it is not to be thrived for, it is not to be expected or hoped. Glasslip show us \"situations\" and people dealing with them. When I first moved out of my parents house, I found myself deeply frustrated by how hard it could be to fit in any group, that's our set of \"main\" characters and what they hope to show. They show someone who just arrived in town, being rejected by every one of the group members but one girl, he finds something in common with her, he looks for her and he also asks himself \"Why her?\" Those are feelings that I can't describe better than the show did and although that was the only \"situation\" I was able to identify myself, after doing it, I was able to see the rest of the show such as listed:\\n\\n\r\n- Recovery from an injury/illness\\n\r\n- \"Loving\" more than one people\\n\r\n- Incest (to some extent, I know they are not brother and sister but the guilt as well as the pressure is there)\\n\r\n- Bisexuality\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, judge me, I LOVED the music and the art, it was mainly the reason I watched it, those \"printscreens\" in glass and the violin solos, truly amazing, I felt really good most of the times watching it\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't say too much about them, cause there is really not much to talk about, as far as the melancholy Takeru express, I could very much relate, and I can't tell too much about the others for the reasons I listed in Story. Since the characters are not there to tell you a story but only to describe a situation, I can't see too much error on the characters themselves, as they are not supposed to be \"alive\". You are supposed to see yourself in that situation, so It would be unwise to make the characters too deep, instead, they are simple, with nothing standing and shinning\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching it once I realized it was not about a story, it ends how it starts and that is totally fine. It came, showed me situations, and left.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf not for the amazing sound and artstyle, I would give this a 6. It certainly isn't your conventional romance anime or big tears drama, but it speaks to you in a certain way. It made me feel really good about me leaving my parents house, and now that I've came back and will be leaving again shortly (hopefully) I might even watch it again, to make sure, not to make as many mistakes as I did back then\\n",

Then all of sudden one day she meets this boy named Kakeru Okikura who can see into the future, and she somehow begins to see into the future as well. Unfortunately this plot never gets enough time to develop andis ultimately brushed off during the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe subplots of this anime mostly consist of the relationships between the friends and the presence of a love hexagon. The love hexagon basically follows Touko likes Kakeru while her friend Yuki likes her, Yuki's stepsister Yanagi likes him, Kakeru likes Touko, and Sachi, Touko's best friend likes her and their other friend Hiro.  The feelings that each character has for their significant other are revealed throughout the anime, but considering how forced and unnatural these confessions came across as, I honestly couldn't care about any of their relationships.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were very flat and one dimensional. They also don't do anything worth making them likeable. First we have, the main protagonist, Touko Fukami, she wants to become a glass artisan and can see into the future apparently, that's all you need to no about her. Then there's Kakeru Okikura, he's best described as a loner who can see into the future, as well. There's Yuki who likes Touko and runs. There's Yanagi who likes Yuki and starts running. Finally there's Sachi who is bisexual having feelings for Touko as well as Hiro whom she ends up choosing and that's really all you need to know about him other than he works in the caf\u00e9 they hang out in. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10/Sound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this anime is really the only redeeming quality. Glasslip was produced by PA Works who have done an excellent job producing much more quality anime such as: Angel Beats! and Another.\\n\r\nThe sound was average at best, the OP was cute, but also generic. The ED was also generic and nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime all that much. I was quite disappointed by it, as it seemed to have a lot going for it such as a great animation studio but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a great slice of life or friendship anime, I highly recommend you watch the Clannad series, Angel Beats!, or this seasons' Ao Haru Ride or Barakamon, they are much better than this shit.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I would love to just state how bad I think Glasslip is, but instead, I'll point out the key moment that I realised it was going to be bad and actually give a detailed explanation of my issues with it as a show:\r\nEpisode 1, first 3 minutes prior to the OP theme. We have animation of a train, then random people wandering around, we then flash cut through the cast, with their names posted by them. Whoever decided this scene should exist, realised in retrospect that the characters and story was so anomalous that it was required to make sure their names were printed onscreen for a matter of seconds before they were rendered irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nThis was the absolute worst opening to any anime I've seen for a long, long time. Nothing was established, we have no idea who these people are and they showed no intention of progressing past that point.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who's studied film, worked on indie projects and a couple of uni projects, (storyboarding, scripting, re-writes) it was embarrassing to witness and turned me off the show instantly. It set a tone that nothing was important or of interest from the get go and stayed there. It's almost literally anti-direction 101; The initial establishing shot for the show establishes literally nothing.\\n\\n\r\nHow the direction and composition of the series can be so bad, I have no idea. The director for it is not bad by any means (Nishimura, Junji), but he has done a number of 'non-event' romance comedies; the second half of Ranma 1/2 (episodes 70 onwards) is what I knew him best for, but he also did some pretty good shows as well; True Tears, Simoun, You're Under Arrest! and more. So, while I could see the show not being the greatest, it should have at least been good, as the director is collaborating with Horikawa, Kenji, the producer of anime such as Jin-Roh, Evangellion and Angel Beats and helps explain why the show looks so good, despite the way it goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is the problem I noticed: Rika SATOU (\u4f50\u85e4 \u68a8\u9999) is listed specifically as the series compositor. This is a woman who's mostly known for key animation and in-between animations on shows and has no record of doing more. However, the shows she's worked on in-between and key animation with have had very good levels of animation. If that is so, why is she working on series composition? I have no idea.\\n\\n\r\nHow important is series composition you ask? Series composition works as such:\\n\\n\r\nThe Series Compositor writes the overarching story for an anime show. They are the one that the director and script writers turn to for their plots, stories and how it will all link together. They decide where a story will start, how it will flow, what episodes will occur where and how it will tie together. It's then down to the directorial staff/episode script writers to fill in the episodes as requested, while the series compositor decides what will or will not work from episode to episode. The compositor often writes a number of episodes, or at least outlines for them, but they rarely write the entire thing themselves. Think of them basically as the director of the directors; they are the first and last word in all story and plotting decisions and it is the job of those below them to put it all together.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR/Conclusion: Given that the director and producer of the show are veterans, who also collaborated on True Tears together (PA Work's first independent show), Rika Satou has probably been handed this job as a way to get into a more important position within the anime creation procedure (she worked with the producer on Angel Beats and she's worked with PA Works a few times before) and has probably been given too much free-reign over what happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe series showed some potential with the ideas it has failed to touch on, but goes no where story-wise or development-wise. The pacing is bad and the entire show feels discombobulated as a result. It feels as though it's been put together by a rookie, or someone with no experience in overarching plot work. Thus explaining my conclusion.",

            "content": "I bet many people would had high expectations for this anime, like me from the beginning as Glasslip was made by P.A Works and they made some really great animes such as Nagi No Asukara, Hanasaku Iroha and Angel Beats. I expected this anime to be the next 'Nagi No Asukara', for the settings and the characters, but I was wrong.\r\nAt the start, it was pretty engaging, so I decided to keep watching. Gradually as the series unveiled, my views on this anime began to degrade. My overall thoughts of the anime is complete utter s***! Let's now break this down into sections.\r\nStory: \r\nThe plotof Glasslip takes place in a seaside town called Hinodehama. Touko's family runs a business of glass-working and Touko hangs out with her friends at a cafe called Kazemichi. A transfer student called Kakeru then comes into the scene, which reminded me of Nagi No Asukara, (when Tsumugu came along). The show was slow-pacing, but I expected slow-pacing animes would result in a very memorable one such as Steins; Gate,  but this anime was a very big exception. Overall, nothing happens pretty much throughout the whole series. There wasn't any dramatic moment, so I was really bored for almost the whole time, watching Glasslip, The story was the weakest point of the series, along with the characters. \\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was indeed the strongest point of the anime. The scenery and setting were really appealing and beautiful to the eyes. Enough said.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good, in particular the OP, due to the tone. The ED was ok. The tracks throughout the series were mostly classical music and from what I notice, they are mostly compositions from Frederic Chopin. It's not bad using tracks of other artists/composers, but it would be better if the anime used original soundtrack, as they would stand out more. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs I said in the 'Story' section, the characters were also the weakest point in the entire series. Many of the characters have developed little to nothing, in personality and actions. The series does not allow us to learn more about each of the characters and we cannot see the characters changing throughout. So overall, the characters were not really memorable and that you could easily forget them after you completed the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't really enjoyed this project from P.A Works, unlike Nagi No Asukara and Angel Beats. I was really looking forward to another great romance slice of life, but it didn't turned out what I expected to be. Nothing dramatic happens in the series, so I wasn't on the edge of my seat (NOT EVEN ONCE!) and I barely understood the relationship between the characters. Even though it's a slice of life anime, the characters just literally play their role in their daily lives. Other slice of life animes, such as Clannad and K-On is much better than this.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nStory: Very boring and neutral (1/10 Pathetic)\\n\r\nArt: Nice-looking and colourful (8/10 Very Good)\\n\r\nSound: Decent, but could have been better (6/10 Fair)\\n\r\nCharacter: Little to no development throughout the series (1/10 Pathetic)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bored for almost the entire time (2/10 Dreadful)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 3/10 (POOR)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This will be a short piece on my own opinion about this show. P.A Works has produced many original works in the past, like Charlotte, Angel Beats, and others. To start off, the art and music were splendid, the only true \"good\" things about this show. The music is catchy and enjoyable, and P.A Works never disappoints with their animation. Now, the worst part of this show is the story. I really wanted to like and understand the show, but with the horrendous writing, it was impossible. With an unexplained supernatural aspect, and pointless drama, love triangles and of the sorts. This just continuously takesaway from each episode. As there always will be some pointless drama caused by simple reasons. I thought that you couldn't screw up writing a slice-of-life show, but Glasslip really surprised me. Characters, what can I say, a mysterious transfer student comes into a group of friends. Strange things began to happen, can't get more generic than that. Using generic character archetypes are fine, but trying to pretend that there was any meaningful character development is pointless and just plain deceptive in nature. There was really nothing interesting with anyone except the transfer student, and that's because we don't know a whole lot about him. We get some clues, and the show tries to give hints, but the execution of this is terrible and it would of just been better to explain upfront what's going on. I personally still found enjoyment in this show however, as the confusion and urge to try to understand what was going on motivated me to keep watching to the end. I have to say that it was a waste of time, as nothing really happened. If your a fan of slice-of-life, this might be a show to watch, but as there are thousands of others, this is something that should just be simply ignored.",

Honestly, the art and the synopsis got me into this anime, and I was hoping to get clarity on the ending.\r\n-WARNING: CONTAINS A SPOILER-\r\nThe story did start as good and is quite interesting, but as the story progresses, it completely lost me. I was like, what's already happening? The plot development is moving too fast that I think the author missed to justify each episode. \r\nDrama is too forced. Seriously, why on earth wouldyour friend try to break your romantic relationship just for the sake of keeping your group together? (Sorry, just got until ep. 9  and I won't elaborate any further)\\n\\n\r\nI think one other factor that made the forced drama is trying to incorporate supernatural plot that is not justified why it has to happen. And if it's you who can see bad things that'll happen in the future, won't you try to give a warning? As I see it, the lead character doesn't trust her friends.\\n\\n\r\nI really tried liking this anime that's why I made it to more than half of the series, but I won't force myself anymore to complete this anime.",

However that was all the appeal I could find for this anime.\r\nThere were elements in this anime that were poorly executed and just felt completely scripted rather giving a natural feeling. There was no clear foreshadowing and a lot of things that came off as a surprise were supposed to be obvious. Even the drama ruins it's own genre.\r\nThe characters felt emotionless, and no I'm not talking about the one or two stoic characters, the voice actors seemed to have almost no emotion whenthey talk in my opinion. They change their tones, but I feel nothing expressed through their voices until the characters are pushed to an extreme. The characters themselves can't be saved from their plain personalities. But then again, none of them were likable anyways so that doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not great, but it's not noticeable. It's supposed to help reflect and build an atmosphere of a scene but fails miserably. From the opening I got that it was a happy feeling anime, but that sure isn't it. Most of the time it just falls silent and it just doesn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Glasslip has been one of the most boring pieces I have ever seen. To summarize my thoughts - Stay the hell away because there are much better series to watch, as a result my final score is 6/10.",

I get that a good amount of viewers out there don't like to think on their own, use their imagination and see whats underneath the surface, but it's nevertheless a pity to see a fine show drown with the mass of dense and jaded folks.\r\nWhat it has going on for me personally is a calming pace, a gorgeous city, CHICKENS and a story, that will ask you to put some thought into it and drawconclusions on your own. (if you like Shakespear or are into philosophy, yet enjoy a bit of innocent romance, you should be set up well with this one)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is pretty, especially landscape wise. I'm not a huge fan of the choice in their character art, but it wasn't terrible either. Just a bit too generic. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed how puzzled I felt. The plot is challenging, not so much in a deep, intellectual way like Steins/Gate, but more along the emotional intelligence line. I would have liked a couple of more episodes to flesh it out better and get more time with the semi-main characters (though to be fair, it does try it's best to spread it's focus equally).\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were fine, hitting the right keys to match the show. However, the tracks that were used within the anime did not stay with me, moreover I got a little annoyed by the same piano track being used over and over and that's coming from someone who really loves classic music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nIt's rare for me to enjoy the majority of characters in an anime, to be frank.\\n\r\nThis is the case for Glasslip. I was especially thankful to find no moe personalities or annoying people with high pitched voices, yelling for attention every 2 minutes. I especially enjoyed Yuki and Yanagi and would have liked to see more about them, but oh well. Sadly, Kakeru, as one of the most important figures for the plot, was a little let down for me. He didn't seem to develop his own drive, never seem to be really there with all his heart and it made it difficult for me to relate to Toukus feelings. Yet he probably felt the same about himself and it makes sense again. \\n\\n\r\nThe show left me with a quiet, warm feeling and this is why I'm writing this review in the first place. \\n\r\nI advice those, who like animes, that will not give you every answer at hand and make things as obvious as possible to give it a go. Everyone else, please pass by and look for something else. (BAKA!) ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Coming after Nagi no Asukara (which was rather rather highly), everyone expected Glasslip to be a P.A. Works series which could rival that of the former. Turns out it was far from being able to do so. However, criticism of this series is rather subjective and really depends on the viewer himself/herself. \r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nTo put it very simply, this show is basically about teenage romance which has sparked off among a group of close friends. That's pretty much about it. They then spend the next 13 episodes contemplating on their feelings about one another. I'm giving this section a 6 because, at least they triedto think of something. It's not like they really threw in a random storyline just to last 13 episodes; the plot was there, but it was probably not strong enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe element of Romance is pretty commendable in my opinion. In fact, the primary reason I had watched this series (and continued on) was because of the Romance. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Wow! Amazing!\" was what I thought when I first saw the visuals and PVs for Glasslip. And it certainly lived up to expectations. The art was brilliant, as they illustrated the sceneries and places of Hinode well. Needless to say, the characters were good-looking too. If there's anything I would take away from this series, it would be the art as it was memorable to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDecent OSTs, including the OP and ED. The background music were played at appropriate times and really fitted the atmosphere and scenery of the anime. I've gotten their OST under my belt already and I have to say it rivals some of the top ones from other series. The OP and ED were fairly enjoyable as well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOn to another component of any series, the characters. As the characters are plunged into thoughts of love and their feelings, we see that every character have their explicit strengths and weaknesses. As a teenager myself, I'd have to admit that I really found the characters relatable. The problems they were going through were genuine, and I believe anyone would react like any one character in the series when faced with a similar situation. The characters won't make much of an impression in me after this, but the scenes they played out may. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I enjoyed every single moment of this, but to be fair there were some bits  I'd enjoyed. Those who have personally experienced genuine moments of love (first love, crushes, etc.) should find this worth watching. I probably won't be re-watching this, but I heard a LN will be coming out and I guess I won't mind checking that out. Hopefully the LN will portray the story in a much better manner than the animation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, not the best series you will see, but in my opinion and by my standards, it's enough to clinch a 6/10.",

But many series that go places and turn out to be good sometimes do; I'll use Steins;Gate as an example. If you give a series with a rough beginning a chance it might develop into a decent, or in the case of Stein;gate, fantastic series. Glasslip does not do this,in fact I'm going to tell you don't even bother watching the first episode. From the extremely confusing and bizarre beginning, Glasslip, starts in a downward spiral. The plot is not explained to the audience, hell it does not even havea fucking plot. There is hardly anything endearing about this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10- The story line starts out extremely confusing, and leaves the view in a state of bewilderment. This sense of confusion is persistent throughout the show, and leaves the viewer wanting some sort of background on the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10- If there is one decent factor about this show, it would be its art. The art is decent, nice to look at, and it is the only part of the show that the producers got right.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10- To me it would seem that the producers sat down and decided to make a cast of characters no one would like. It is impossible to like any of the characters, and they never develop. They never dive into why Sachi is so against Touko being with \"David\". Why does she feel this way, and why is it okay for her to have feelings for someone else? It's such bull shit, piss poor writing. They don't explain why, after possibly threatening her chickens, does Touko fall in love with Okikura-san. (I warned you about spoilers, but you shouldn't watch this any way's.) There is no development whatsoever. On a side note that \"ehhh\" noise that Touko makes every episode pisses me off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10- I think that Glasslip will be a memorable anime, memorable in how truly awful it was. It will be reminisced about with other titles like School Days. So should you watch this show? No, no you should not. There are far better things to watch this season. There is no need for you to torment yourself with this, you are better than that.",

            "content": "My overall impression after selecting \"completed\" was, just what the hell did I watch?\r\nStory: Where Glasslip fell short the most was the story, or lack there of one. There was no underlying theme or plot to the anime other than the fact that the two main characters develop some type of bond over \"future fragments.\" A lot of things were left unanswered in the end... Like most importantly, what was the point of Jonathan and all those damn chickens?! After halfway in, I began dreading the show and just wanted to know if anything significant happened...  I'd also like to add that despite thefact that this has romance in it, I found that the interactions between the pairings were very anticlimactic and confusing. Needless to say, I was left very disappointed and found that this anime's attempt to generate a unique plot was sloppy and all over the place. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have never been disappointed in the aesthetics that Production IG shoots out. Very easy on the eyes. This anime shines the most in how there is so much attention to the detail in the art. Even though I never quite understood what the hell was going in in their \"future fragments,\" I found that how they were showcased kept me interested enough to not consider dropping the series entirely. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Didn't hate the opening or ending songs, but I still found myself skipping through them with each episode. I honestly don't have much to say in this category since I found it to be pretty standard and no aspect of the shows music particularly staid out it me. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Absolutely no character development whatsoever. There were only a couple if characters I enjoyed seeing on the screen, but everyone essentially bothered me with their unnecessary angst. Aside from Sachi and Touko, I'm even at a loss as go why these 6 characters are still good friends, since their interactions and exchanges mostly felt awkward to watch. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I honestly enjoyed the fact that I no longer have to watch another episode of this show. I don't recall having anything but negative reactions to any of the episodes either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: When the pilot episode spent about 10 minutes on a bunch of chickens should have given me the cue to not pick up this series. I would not recommend this to anyone. 3/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "-----------------------------SPOILER ALERT-------------------------------------\r\nI already read some of negative and positive reviews earlier, and then continue to search for clue in order understanding how this anime works.\r\nIn my opinion this anime is very good in its own term. What I mean is originality (based on other previews and my experience), the main plot is indeed messed up . . . when you see it based on your current watching experience. But if you are more careful, you should see clue by clue given by author, especially in the last episode. For example, one of Kakeru quotes in last episode (in english),\"When you (Touko) say nevermind, then itis important (Touko's mom said that she used to be like Touko, at the end, she experience unexpected event,contrary of her future sight), the author implicitly give clue that every \"future fragment\" Touko and Kakeru experience just an imagination (perhaps?) yet in the end Touko still believe that and said (which she already said at the first episode), \"No matter what, the future me will overcome it\" (which is she forgot how that work in the middle episode which make her so afraid about future). And remember the scene about 14 marbles with some grass on the desk?That means Touko took it again after thrown it, but where is the rest of it? perhaps she neglected the rest or gave it to Kakeru as parting gift. Either way, it is clear that she already move on. Remember that last scene when her imagination come out again? etc etc, just conclude the story with clue given by author implicitly then you can understand the story as a whole. Rather see a picture inch per inch, it will be best if you see a picture as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe other morale story is love is'nt what you always imagine (Underline word \"imagine\" which is the key of term \"future fragment\"). As you can see, every imagination Touko seen (or heard) is'nt what to be expected. For example, Touko see that Sachi and Hiro had a good time together in hospital, but in reality Sachi is'nt really see Hiro as a boyfriend (you will see the clue when the two hiking together, friendzone detected). Yuki at the end love Yanagi as family (because they are brother and sister unrelated to blood),then you sure can't see them having romantic contact. And remember when Kakeru said \"I've found you\" then suddenly his ability vanish? There is a term in our social life, \"First Love Sight\", isn't it? It is just that simple. His ability is again just imagination caused by loneliness, when he found irreplaceable friend, he feels that he will not alone again.\\n\\n\r\nI will tell you my another perspective, this anime is'nt your average romance anime. It has some deep meaning in it. I'm sure the author mean it (I already watched Angel's Beats and it has deep meaning while combining with comedy).\\n\r\nThat's conclude my reviews. thanks for reading this :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nI have no idea what's with the low score or why people putting so much hate on it, nevertheless here comes my point of view of this anime.\r\nStory\r\nI found story quite enjoyable, it was chill, cute, mysterious and eerie at times. I mean the whole slice-of-life here was done right. It was really relaxing and cute to look at romance progression. With the touch of \"fragments of future\" it made it a bit intriguing. Though those fragments became rather than foreseeing future, they became more of emotional\"visions\" and valuation.  I mean I understand them as following, that those fragments were actually reliving someones experience or feeling the possible futures, past or times that passed, were to poss, variations or hopes of what to come. So somewhat \"longing future, bitter future, bitter differences\". Point being, fragments felt odd and sometimes they felt even eerie for me. But overall, story was as mentioned. Relaxing and cute.\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound\\n\\n\r\nWell art is what I call \"kyotos animation long lost sister\" , meaning that they have very nice touch and feel overall of slice-of-life. While kyoto has their \"quirky\" shows and beautiful art, while  P.A. Works has more of \"feet on their\" ground, simple and pretty style with great choice of music. (meaning they also have a lot of great slice-of-life. EX: Nagi No Asakura, Shirobako, Tari Tari, Hanasaku Iroha etc..)\\n\\n\r\nSound is something I absolutely loved in this anime. Probably because I have sweet spot for piano. Piano tracks were mostly relaxing, bittersweet, colorful and pleasant. Also Nano;Ripe is always welcome. Opening was probably the part I liked the least. Rest of OST was also between average and very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what to comment. I liked the them all. Only character I disliked or semi-annoyed me was the damn \"tee-hee-pero\" sister... that phrase of her felt so moronic. Rest of characters were between enjoyable and great. Maybe Touko wasn't that enjoyable for me. As not really my type. Point being.. all characters were \"normal\".. but in a enjoyable not, not in boring way. Very grounded, but very pleasant experience with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, I'm not sure what the hate is about, but I personally found this anime relaxing, bittersweet and pleasant experience with a little touch of mystery (and eeriness for me)",

Glasslip. That's the name. Glasslip. I \"repeat again, GLASSLIP!! That's it.\r\nGlasslip plot is simple. They start with a new transfer student name, David and become friend with Touko. And Touko introducing Yuki, Sacchi, Hiro, and Yanagi. After that, the story begin.\r\nThe story begin quite promising with Touko had the ability to see future. Soon after that revealed that Touko need to be each other with David to see this fragment offuture.\\n\r\nI really interesting with this plot and keep waiting and watching for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the really disaster begin.Each episode is out and is getting more,more, and more confusing.It seem like this story doesn't have any plot.This anime just show you what the characters do in their\\n\r\ndaily life, and is extremely boring!!\\n\r\nThen what happen to the ability to see future?? Here's what happen. \\n\r\nIS NOTHING HAPPEN.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the character apart Yanagi and David doesn't have any purpose in this anime and the plot as well!! \\n\r\n- Hiro's sister keep doing the \"tee-hee\" thing with the Hiro.\\n\r\n- Yanagi keep with the \"EHHHHH!?\" thing (And it's extremely annoying)\\n\r\n- Sachi keep reading the book from the episode 1 till episode 13.\\n\r\n- And Yanagi relationship with Yukinari still doesn't solve anything. Are they just friend? Or dating?? Or what??!! They just leave it unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the truth, I'm almost fall asleep around episode 5 and 6.To make it more confusing is when you realise that Hiro and Sachi sudden;y become a close friend.\\n\r\nHow's that happen?? The only thing they do is reading book together without saying anything. And they become close. What a stupid plot...\\n\\n\r\nIn comparism with Nagi No Asakura, is truth that the character resemble lots of similarity from that series. But the plot nowhere good enough with Nagi No Asakura!!\\n\\n\r\nNagi No Asakura is an anime that capable to make anyone shed a tear, but for Glasslip the only thing that anime capable is to make me feel boring and fall asleep early then my schedule.\\n\\n\r\nWell, after all the bad thing i told you guy about this anime, let me tell you the bright side of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and the animation really are remarkable.\\n\r\nThe opening song give you something harmony to hear and made you feel relax.\\n\r\nAnd the ending also not bad. I keep hearing over and over again and thinking why waste this good OST while you represent the worst romance anime ever??\\n\r\nAnd the animation really awesome.Properly the only thing that made me keep watching Glasslip is their nice graphic and also the comparism with Nagi No Asakura.\\n\\n\r\nBut again,such a waste, when the studio that manage to made Nagi No Asakura,one of the best romance anime, is the one who made the worst romance anime,Glasslip.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend this anime to anyone.Is not even worth to waste your time on this.And plz don't made this series second season. Just please!!! I had enough with it.\\n\\n\r\nAs summary,\\n\r\nhere's my final score. 3/10.\\n\r\nIf you guys have any question about this anime,just ask me.But don't expect any good thing about this anime.\\n\r\nHope my review help!!",

            "content": "Adulthood is a very difficult transition.  When you're a child, things come very easy.  You have parents to take care of you, you get into a general rhythm as how daily life is, and for the most part, things stay constant.  But, when you grow up, things change, as you are more expected to be independent and more willing to make your own choices, and the world around you can become different and scary.  Today, P.A. work's new project, Glasslip.  (There might be some glass puns in here.)\r\nStory:  The story of glasslip follows the lives of 5 youths, Touko,Yukinari, Hiro, Sachi, and Yanagi.  Being childhood friends in the port town that they live in, the five have grown up together and have spent a great deal of time being great friends without a single hitch in their relationship.  One day, on a fireworks festival, a strange boy by the name of Kakeru appears and starts to mix himself in the strong bonds of the five friends, and everything starts to change.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, as for first impressions, Glasslip gave me a rather awful one.  The setting of a port town, the close knit friends being disrupted by a new addition to the group, and the romantic feelings with one another between the various members of the group, made me think that this was a rip-off of its predecessor, Nagi no Asukara.  The two shows bear a lot of similarity in that regard and I felt that P.A. works was being a bit cheeky by creating something that was essentially the same as what their previous success was.  But over time, Glasslip started to give a different impression that really made it its own.  That impression was confusion.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the overall plot.  Well, it's shit.  What glasslip does in its runtime is beyond what it could've even tried to be in the grand scheme of things.  It had the very big philosophical idea of child to adult transition that everyone has to face as its theme, but it just could not deliver.  The show is structured in a very odd way as how the six main characters just split off into three separate groups of three to deal with their own problems while not even speaking a word to any of the other groups.  This is another example of \"try-hard\" in anime where the anime really tries hard to convey its message, but ending up leaving with a plotline that had an absurd amount of plot holes, lack of explanation as to what is going on, and leaving overall confusion to the general audience.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the anime tried to do was symbolism, and there was a lot of it.  This show requires you to literally pay EVERY single bit of it from the birds in the sky to dialogue word for word in order for you to truly understand what exactly is going on.  To its credit, the symbolism was rather genius and (with the help of some reddit threads to explain it to me), made a lot of sense.  The only problem is that for the average anime watcher who just wants to watch the show for the entertainment value, will not only get confused, but distraught as to what is happening in any given moment in time as even the most obscure things in the show are linked to the general main idea.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for pacing, well the show is a mess.  There's not really much explanation as to why any one character does a certain action or say a specific line.  (I quote \"You're the reason why Yuki isn't attractive anymore!\") In one scene, you will get the perspective from one duo of characters, then transition to another for another scene, then transition to the third group for a literal 10 seconds, before transitioning back.  It's this form of trying to tell three separate stories that really leads to its downfall.  (Aside for some dumb dialogue and lack of explanation for a core aspect of the show)  In the end, it just didn't work and was overall, just really confusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the ending.  Oh, boy, was that ambiguous.  The ending of glasslip basically does nothing, as the show doesn't really tell you anything that happened, making you have to imply what is going on, which for me isn't a fun experience when you've been ambiguous in storytelling this whole time.  (Not to mention the idea of the guy coming into town, leaving his mark, then just skipping town is freaking stupid idea from a viewer standpoint.)  As a whole, it made me really upset because it's just one of those \"THAT'S IT?\" moments that would infuriate anyone.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Glasslip's message was one of the better ones that I've seen in a long time.  The only problem is the fact that I had to get information from a third party source and have to think excessively about the symbolism in order to completely understand why this was done or why this wasn't done.  The pacing and overall presentation of the show clouded the great idea that it had behind it, and it really just felt awkward to watch due to just how much potential this show did actually have.  In the end, if you have a show that is basically a vague, visual representation of some sort of novel, you're not going to get a very positive response from the populous.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ FANTASTIC themes\\n\r\n-  Cutaways for three separate stories\\n\r\n-  Too much ambiguous symbolism\\n\r\n-  Unsatisfying ending\\n\r\n-  Awful pacing\\n\r\n-  Massive amounts of plot holes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  As for characters, well...they're also quite shit as well.  What really makes that characters in this show bad is because they don't really have much of a three-dimensional personality that comes very clear to the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is our main female lead, Touko Fukami.  As the lead female, well...I really don't know what to say honestly.  She's a very upbeat and cheery girl that wants to stay friends with the people that she's known all her life, which is quite commendable seeing as how they are all third years and approaching adult life.  Oh yeah, and she has the ability to see random \"fragments of the future\" through glass.  This aspect of her in addition to having met Kakeru are the defining moments of her personality, which honestly, doesn't say very much.  The reason being is the fact that the whole \"fragments of the future \" thing is a load of bull that not only gets shelved away for about half the series, but is never really explained in any entirety.  This aspect of seeing the future is what makes the show unique, and it is handled completely incorrectly, giving once again, a very vague idea as to what it actually is.  In the end, Touko's character is not really defined, as her relationship with Kakeru feels very forced and there aren't very noticeable qualities about her.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have our main male lead, Kakeru Okikura.  (Lotta K's.)  Kakeru faces a similar problem to his main female counterpart as he himself is not really explored very deeply.  Over the course of the series, you do get to understand some aspects of him that I suppose counts as character development, but once again, it's not really explained very deeply.  In addition to that, Kakeru has the ability to \"hear the fragments of the future\", which combined with Touko's ability to \"See\" the fragments, leaves them being able to completely see and hear what these fragments are.  This aspect of him really doesn't add a whole lot because there really isn't much explanation as to what the idea of the fragments really are, leading right up to the end, a very confusing idea.  In addition to that, Kakeru seems to be proficient in golluming, where there are some scenes that he \"talks to himself\" with two other Kakerus, which, like almost every other aspect of this show, is not explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe other four characters in the show, Yanagi, Yuki, Hiro, and Sachi are slightly minor in the grand scheme of things.  They don't get as much screentime as Kakeru and Touko get, and are really there just to serve as the \"other aspects of growing up\" with Yanagi and Yuki trying to chase their dreams and Hiro and Sachi delving into a more romantic aspect of life.  They don't get a whole lot of development and parts of them remain undefined since well, the show just doesn't say, making you have to infer and assume what is what.  (For example, Yanagi and Yuki live in the same house, but aren't siblings.  I assume they're stepsiblings, but...I'm really not sure.)  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for side characters, well, they don't serve much purpose other than moving the plot along.  We have Touko's sister and parents, Kakeru's parents, Hiro's grandfather and sister, Sachi's mom, and a chicken named Jonathan, which bears the same name as me.  These characters don't have as much purpose and serve for the most part, more aspects of symbolism that just make this show more confusing than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast of Glasslip wasn't really anything to hit home about.  Because of the way that these characters are designed, it's safe to say that this show is a story driven one, and the characters serve little purpose than to just go along for the ride and do the best they can.  Because of this, in addition to the gaping plot holes, gives the characters more than they bargained for, leaving them to be really just cardboard cutouts that don't see much in terms of development.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  \"OK\" main cast\\n\r\n-  cardboard cutout characters\\n\r\n-  Lack of use for supporting cast\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:  Ok, let's stop shattering pieces of this show and focus more on what really makes P.A. works so glorious and great, the art.  \\n\\n\r\nP.A. works has always done fantastic work when it comes to artwork, and this show is no pushover.  The backgrounds are amazing, the lighting mood with the sun look absolutely gorgeous, and the characters themselves look very nice.  Anything made by P.A. works has always shown itself to be a masterpiece in the art department and an absolutely stunning visual experience to watch.  Regardless though, there were a few quite noticeable flaws for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of the two problems are the stills.  In every episode, in various scenic (or not scenic) points in the show, the show will stop and show you a picture of a certain frame with a frosted border.  Now, since this is P.A. works, the stills themselves look quite amazing.  The only problem is the fact that it disrupts the show.  They inject the stills at random points in time and really just cuts into it and distorts the flow of the story by giving you a still frame.  As a viewer, I didn't like having these things pop up because they didn't add anything more to the show, and it looked rather stupid for doing so.  (Also, in the last episode, they do a skype sort of setup where they have a smaller picture in the corner with a bigger picture taking up the rest of the screen.  Really, P.A.?)\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem is chibi art.  While this happens rather uncommonly, the show does sport some chibi art by injecting a circle in any part of the screen and having a little chibi face of a certain character talk.  Ordinarily, this would be fine in any comedy show, but since this wasn't a comedy show, it really just didn't fit.  In addition, the art for it was completely different from the rest of the show, which gave for a jarring feeling as the two art styles clashed heavily upon one another.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, well, I love the opening.  I won't lie, this opening is a great opening to listen to.  It has a similar feel as what Nagi No Asukara had with its first opening and it was a good listen.  It's a song that I wholeheartedly would continue listening to on its own as it has a very memorable tune and it does leave a good impact.  As for the ending, well, it's ok, but I don't like how it's played.  The singer for the ending is a bit too high for what I feel like the vocals should've been, and it just didn't work in my opinion.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show uses piano a lot, which I quite like for a mood aspect.  Both the opening and ending for this anime are used as piano tracks for various points in the show, which actually, aesthetically, improves the overall feel of the show.  In addition, (since Kakeru's mom is a professional pianist), the show gives us some classical pieces that you can really just sit back and listen to because well, it's classical music.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  FANTASTIC VISUALS\\n\r\n+  Good opening\\n\r\n+/- Meh ending\\n\r\n-  Clashing artsyles and stills\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  When I first saw this show on Anichart, I expected this to be a good slice of life series.  Seeing as how the production studio was the same as the one that produced one of my all-time favorite anime gave me a glimmer of \"Oh my god, this is going to be a great show\".  After having come out from that experience, I have to say, I am really disappointed as to what this turned into.  One thing that I thought would be a plus was just how different it would be on anime as whole since Glasslip is a completely original anime series.  In addition, there was a lot of hype for the show, and with all of the expectations for it, it had to disappoint in some way or another.  Overall for me, the show was a very confusing experience as many plot points were scattered and the mass amount of symbolism of the show was just lost on me as a general viewer.  Anyway, onto the three questions!\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, yes.  The show looks fantastic and very detailed in terms overall look of the show.  The music was very nice and really, anything visually looked very pleasing to the eyes.  (Plus, the chicken has my name, so I had fun trying to reply to Touko every time she called out \"Jonathan\")\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nApart from the obvious problems with plot and character, there were several aspects of the show that felt either rushed, or just plain stupid.  For example, Kakeru sleeps in a tent.  I understand the whole symbolism of the cage an everything, but what parent would let their child sleep in a tent outside?  It's dumb.  In addition, the overall idea of the \"fragments of the future\" and \"Sudden unexpected loneliness\" was just completely lost on me.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not sure.  The show has a very good philosophy to it which if you connect all of the points, makes for a rather enjoyable watch that has a much deeper meaning to it than one can see.  This show requires overthinking because you really have to take EVERY aspect of the show in order to even get a sense as to what the characters are even talking about.  Personally, I think if you're someone who enjoys finding themes in stories and trying to find the overarching idea, then this show might be a good fit for you.  However, if you are, like me, trying to just enjoy a show for what it is, then this will be hell on earth.  The show is really awful in the way it was designed and executed, but it does delve into a core aspect of life which to be honest, fits with all they were trying to do with this show.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nSlice of life is my favorite genre so I've seen tons. I'm used to the slow, tepid pace of many slice of life anime. But Glasslip manages to be excruciatingly slow, yet at the same time frenetic because of the way they jump from character to character. You can watch the first episode, skip over to the 9th (where I am currently dropping this anime) and have no more insight into what is happening that watching the first five minutes of the first episode.\r\nI started watching this after reading the description about glass making, thinking at least this would be an interesting look into thecraft, but there is so little about glass making it's almost like false advertising. The actual substance of glass plays a slightly bigger part. But it's like a small tool they use try to fuel the story plot. If you watch you'll see exactly what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is the only thing I enjoyed about this show. Not specifically the character designs, but the background settings are beautiful to look at. Especially the way they set up to reflect the different times of day. It's nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sounds fit what is happening at the time, but beyond that, there isn't much to say. They don't stand out as anything other than fitting, not above average or memorable. None of the songs or soundtracks stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere is no character development. At all. You find out some things, but not much. What you find out they try to make mysterious so you'll want to keep watching, but you find out so little it's very uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nThis is slice of life at it's worst. They focus on the absolutely wrong time of life's moments.\\n\\n\r\nYou see the characters sitting, or sitting at eating, or sitting and talking, or sitting and looking at the sky, or sitting and reading.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically all they do, except you can substitute sitting for lying down or walking or hiking. It's so utterly boring and uninteresting.",

            "content": "--- This review may contain spoilers-----\r\nFirst of all, my review might not be accurate since there are 2 reasons:\r\n1. I am an easy going guy so I might be easy at some points.\r\n2. I just started watching anime again after spending years into MMORPG games so my Anime knowledge is quite lacking.\r\nA Glasslip cover caught my eyes when I was wandering around the Internet, looking for good Anime to start with. It was still airing during that time so I decided to bookmark and wait for it, with the thought like many others, this Anime has potential. I also avoided reviews in case of spoilers.\r\nOhboys............I have never been so wrong in my life..............\\n\\n\r\nAfter 13 episodes, I am like a person who is lost in the middle of the desert, mumbling: \"What on earth did I just watch?\"\\n\\n\r\nFirst episode actually got me thrilled, everything seemed to start at low pace, not much going on except for the .... chicken part which was a bit...... unexpected, but for me, personally, it's totally fine, by the end of the episode, I was still convinced that this Anime really had potentials. This was my first mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThen this David guy started talking about some craps such as Fragments of Future, all I did was to yell out:\" C'mon, no supernatural craps, keep it as slice-of-life and romance Anime please !!!\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter each episode, my hope started to crash, the more I watched it, the more confusing I got, to the point that I began to feel irritating. I kept hoping that the next episode would be better or at least,it could  explain some of the the questions I had. Here came my 2nd mistake. After 13 episodes, I was left with a huge disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nI am not confident to say that I understand the story was about although I did re-watched it twice (yeah, I was that brave, or more like I didn't give a crap anymore at the second time), you can call this decision was my 3rd mistake. Sometimes while watching it, I thought that P.A.W didn't even have the story prepared, they just put random stuff in while making the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI was sold by the art. Not gonna lie, I even did screenshot the sceneries and use them as my desktop background. The characters design,  especially in first episode, also made me excited. Then why do I give 6 for art? The answer is, I felt like P.A.W was being pushed, to the point that they didn't even care about the character looks anymore. First few episodes were ok, but for the rest, I felt like i was watching some kinds of Glasslip's doujin. Fortunately that the sceneries, the town still maintained their good view, otherwise, 6 would be too generous.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe best aspect of this anime, I am gonna be honest, Glasslip's OST has been my most played tracks for almost 2 months now, and I don't think I would stop listening anytime soon. Especially the OP, it suits perfectly with the sceneries and the beach town. For other anime, I usually skip the OP but with Glassilp, I made an exception.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFirst thing, while reading my review, you might have this question in your mind: \"why the heck does this guy choose Touko for his profile image, after so many saying so much negative things?\". Lots of people have been saying that she's boring, clueless, childish or even stupid. I don't disagree, in fact, they are true, most of them. However, I still like Touko, I am probably the only one that would put Touko as my most favorite character; simply because for some reason, she is quite close to my own ideal girl imagination (yeah, I have weird taste, you can say that). \\n\\n\r\nOkikura is plain boring. I like cool and mysterious guys, but this guy is just meh... I was glad that he didn't even end up with Touko. He made the Anime worse.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure what to talk about the rest since there weren't enough development nor connections between them anyway. There are many times in this anime that scenes kept being switched between characters, to the point that I didn't even think the conversations or actions were even near finished or at least, to the main point. It looked like the Director was thinking:\"hmm, this character hasn't got much scenes yet, let give him/her 2 seconds of glory !!!\". In the end, no personality was shown, they are just plain......\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI enjoyed the Anime up until episode 4 or 5. For the rest, I was only looking forward to any natural sceneries and ....Touko, as well as the glass making scene (just for curiosity). I finished the Anime because I don't want to do anything left hanging, just like the Anime did in the end. \\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime unless you have so much spare time and you enjoy the seaside town, as well as beautiful firework.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I wrote this review after watching....Nagi no Asukara. And I would say, Glasslip could have been better if P.A.W didn't rush (just my personal feeling but i think they actually did) the project, and made it around 20ish episodes, so they could go into details of those main characters at least, just like they did in Nagi. After all the negative things I gave, I seriously don't hate the Anime (except for Okikura), it was a huge waste when it could have been a big hit but P.A.W decided not to.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAll that glitters is not gold\u201d Glasslip was an anime that had tons of promise to be a nice and fun watch. And seeing that the same Studio produced Nagi no Asakura earlier this year we were expecting the same if not better. So what went wrong?\r\nStory: \r\nThe story revolves around a group of five friends who are on summer break before their last year at school. At one of the festivals Touko keeps seeing a strange guy around town but is too shy to say anything about it. The next day while she is at the caf\u00e9 with her friends the strange guy showsup and introduces himself as Okikura. He later tells Touko that she has the ability to see glimpses of the future while he can listen to what is said.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very interesting set up, pairing the supernatural into a slice of life. It adds originality to a show which can be compared to the countless others. However, the future predictions in the show carry almost no weight. There\u2019s no consequences for peering into the future and the predictions themselves are not important, Touko once foresaw her friend sitting in a hospital because she had an appointment. The story is really only driven by the side stories of the supporting characters and even then their stories rarely effect anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nWhen the plot is highly dependent on the characters there is no excuse to have bad characters. Instead the characters have to be constantly changing and maturing to the occasion and react to drama. Instead Glasslip relies solely on its characters to deliver unnecessary drama and not one decides to try to learn from their mistakes and move on.\\n\r\nOkikura is easily one of my most hated characters ever. With an over-the-top arrogant attitude coupled with a sympathetic backstory there no way to relate. He comes in as the new kid who is now going to live with his father in a tent outside. From there he quickly tries to show dominance over Touko by constantly taking her away from friends to talk to her about her ability to see the future. He is the sole cause of almost all the drama in the show with all but Touko and Hiro disliking him.\\n\r\nAnd the girl that everyone is fighting over is the clueless Touko. She is very kind and always wants to help, unfortunately she also tends to be clueless, and not understanding what is going on until it is over. Her \u201cpower\u201d as I\u2019ll call it is the ability to see images of the future, but they are not descriptive enough to accurately predict the future.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters operate in their own world most of the time, in fact the whole group really only gets together once after the opening scenes. And with them driving a huge amount of the story, the fact that their stories really go nowhere, with nothing gained or lost is frankly an insult.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nAfter the first five seconds of watching this I thought, wow, this is a beautiful anime. And it kept up its beauty with breathtaking background shots and amazing lighting. The character design is simple yet very beautiful with special attention towards the eyes to show all the pent up emotion that will occur.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music, while being utterly beautiful and I could listen to it outside the anime is too powerful. What I mean is that they will take a normal conversation and then put a very loud and overly dramatic score and it just kills the mood. I found myself laughing about how dramatic they were making it sound when all the characters were doing was texting. The OP is fantastic though, it puts you into a happy mood ready for a gentle show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nDespite me actually looking very much forward to this anime it quickly became a chore to watch. I kept with it thinking that something will get better, maybe a proper romance occurs, the foreseeing the future gets more accurate and has meaning, or even the characters would mature. Instead I just got bored and tended to sometimes just have it as background noise. \\n",

            "content": "I first found Glasslip on this website when I was scrolling through recomdations of similar animes to the one I was watching. I clicked into it and read reviews wanting to know whether it was worth watching or not, to my surprise most of the reviews were very negative. The reason I was surprised was that the summary that was given made the anime seem so amazing. So, I decided to watch it anyways and my thoughts on it were it's not as bad as everyone says it is. I think that everyone had  high expectations for it since it was from P.A. Works,so when it wasn't as good as other productions of  P.A. Works, they thought it was completely horrible. Well, my opinion on it is that it's not the best anime I saw but it's defininitely not deserving all the hates it's getting.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nThe story itself was great but the way they had expressed it has put some downsides to it. It can be a little confusing to watch though. They put on a flashback in one of the last episodes which was a fragment of the future that seemed like a flashback. I was really confused until someone said it was a fragment of the future down in the comments section. Lots of people had said that the story was really slow in development and had only gone through one summer vacation. I quite liked the fact that the story was slow, it allows me to know more detail and discover about their lives in their final summer vacation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  7/10\\n\r\nI loved the fact that the bunch of friends were all different and yet almost always get along with each other let alone fall in love with another person from the same group. Touko is the daughter of a glass artisan and is pretty talented at glass-blowing. What makes her interesting she can glas-blow, there are not many people that can master the art of glass-blowing and obviously she has. The fact she is always clueless and says \"ehhh\" is kind of funny. Kakeru is our typical loner guy, one that wants to be alone all the time until he meets Touko. He sleeps in a tent which makes other think that he is weird. Up until middle school he followed his mum traveling around the world as his mother is a pianist and does world tours. Throughout the travell he has done with his mother, he thinks that when meets someone, he hurts them, so when meets Touko he thinks that he will hurt her. The rest of the characters are great as well but if I talk about them,  this review would be too long.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI really loved the way that the art was drawn and Touko's hair was absolutely beautiful. I can draw anime/manga styled drawings but I doubt I can ever draw as good as that. It may not be the best art I have seen drawn in animes but it's definitely not the worst. Let's just appreciate the fact that they have spent so much time drawing the scenes and characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime's worst point is it's animation. There were so many freeze frames where they were talking but there mouths weren't moving and stayed in the same scene for a long time. This is the one thing I don't like about Glasslip.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThis is definitely the strongest point of Glasslip. The opening was part of the reason why I watched the anime. I loved the soothing melody and it was somehow catchy. The ending song was not as great but the upbeat music kind of lightend up the dramatic things that happen in the anime. The OSTs were great, I loved the classical piano music that was included.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, it gives me the feeling of something new and unique. I was never really in to supernatural things but this anime has inspired me to watch more supernatural themed animes. There is one thing that I hated about this anime, the fact that the ending left so many questions to the person watching, making the ending inconclusive, but look on the bright side, the creator might of thought that leaving questions means that there are many possible endings, there are no limitations to our imagination, so let's just appreciate the creators thoughtfulness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is not bad at all as a whole. I recommend this anime even though it is hated by so many people. Think about it, if you hadn't seen all these reviews where Glasslip is hated and instead read many reviews where Glasslip is recommended, you wouldn't have the impression of it being bad. Just try watching it, it may be good, it may be bad, it doesn't really matter as it is only 13 episodes. If you don't watch because you think it may be horrible, you may have missed out something you might find amazing. You've got nothing to lose by watching an anime that is not so great, I say just give it a go. Well, that's just my opinion.\\n",

            "content": "Personally, I find good to waste time and confusing in some parts, connected with visions... So when cut the visions, is normal love story with good art and characters. Again Personally, I don`t plan to compare it to other animation from love story type, after all compare to animes like Toradora! And Mashiroiro Symphony is a total waste of TV airtime. The point is that depend with what people compare it can go from Bad to Masterpiece. So lets start: Story: Group of 5 friends from the kids and a newcomer in the town same age as them. Everything starts from 2 main points: 1st:The lift of ban for a date in Group and 2nd Kakeru the newcomer in the town claims that see the same things as Tokyo. From here when I watch it. I felt a line between the love story and Mystery around visions. It`s true that overall in the search what are those \"visions\" Tokyo fell in love with Kakeru. However the interaction between other 4 members and \"visions\" are so few (mainly Sachi), that create line between them. That makes the anime have 2 story lines. One is \"Love relation in the group\". Kakeru interaction with it, is mainly around Tokyo. 2nd one is \"Search what those visions are\". Mainly Kakero and Touko. Personally,  I think this line makes story bad. Interaction between the two parts of story are few. \\n\r\nOn top of that Love story part is completed, however they left too many questions in \"Mystery around Visions\" part: 1st Why there is 3 Kakeru at 3-4 part in the anime and 2nd what are the true nature of Touko visions (Parallel world vision is my best guest base on 12 ep but that don't give all answers).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n   Actually, my thing is good. However, this depends on what a person looks for in it. It's hard to put it down in words. I guest I like all those panorama views in it and detail of place they usually are like the Hiro Grandpa Cofe sheep (bar)...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n   It didn`t make much of an impact to be fair, I hardly remember soundtrack of the anime other then Kakeru`s mother Piano play...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n    Tokyo, Kakeru, Sachi, Hiro, Yukinari and Yanagi and from sub hero Touko little sister Hina and Hiro big sister Momo. Personally thing each hero is easy to be remembered they all are unique compared to each other with their goals and characters. I can`t say much about the main characters, but I like Hina, she often act and answer above her actual age (yeah, I know what you thing knows: Lolicone lover (true story)) on the other hands, I don't dislike her (oh yeah, I talk about Momo Hiro`s big sister) however this \"tee hee Peru\" move she use is really going on my nerve :).... *Tee hee pero*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n   When you watch it for the first time, even to the story is confusing going episode after episode whit unique care, good love part in the story and mystery around \"visions\" element. Waiting to see what will happen next make you stay put and enjoy it until episode 12 and then ep 13 where its end and leave a lot of questions. Leave a bitter taste that something is missing and make all the enjoyment from episode to episode which disappear in mid air...\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n    Good to waist time anime. Enjoyed watching it episode by episode, however, when get to end of it leaves confusion and a bitter taste. I  compare it to other anime most likely will end with overall low scores like other user who let there review here...",

            "content": "I decided to give this anime a shot,thinking that it would be good. The plot sounds so very interesting. At one point i though to myself \u201cthis can be very funny\u201d Oh how very wrong i was. I refused to give up on this show, even though i could not bear to watch a whole episode without doing something else. This is a show you have to judge for yourself.\r\nStory(3/10)\r\nThe story originally showed so much promise,I thought it would be one of the best of the season just from the story plot. After the first few episodes, things got weird. They was executed well. Afterthe first few eps, things changed a lot. They just sorta forced the story. They would never give out proper explanations. When it reached episode 8, I had no idea what i was watching anymore. Things started to clear up a bit towards the end. Then it had it\u2019s biggest \u201cwhat in the world\u201d moment I have ever seen. No resolution for the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\r\nThe art was very captivating, It was one of the few things that kept me watching. Such pretty art to gaze upon.\\n\r\nThe character designs also had a nice feel to them. The backgrounds are drawn very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound(1/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is awful. and I found it to be the weakest point of Glasslip. I had to skip the intro every time and cut it off as soon as the show ended so I would not have to listen to the end song(yes i call it that).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(2/10)\\n\r\nTo me,The next weakest point of Glasslip are the characters.In my opinion,they are very one-dimentional,boring and forgetful.They had  no type of character development whatsover,As they focused too much on the story and romance to properly develop the characters. The couples was very boring. I know others also feel this way. My fav character was Yanagi. She is the only reason I put the characters over the sound. Kakeru was also interesting up till the point he wanted Touko so badly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(4/10)\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Glasslip,there are many moments where I just wanted to drop it and stop watching. However I gave this a 6 because I hoped and hoped Yanagi would notice how dull her \u201cdream guy\u201d was. Also I hoped Kakeru would see how stupid Touko is. The 6 is from the hope I had of Yanagi and Kakeru would hook up. The wait was not worth it. I\u2019m actually going to give this a 4(only because of the hope).\\n\\n\r\nOverall(6/10)\\n\r\nGlasslip is a bad anime,It had the potential to be better and improve. But they did not use it. I\u2019m giving this a 6 because hey what do I know. Maybe i did not understand it. Maybe it should be that way. I do know it was the worst anime of the season for me. Good luck to anybody that watches this. You will need it more then goku needs a power up every fight.",

            "content": "STORY\r\n  I found Glasslip to be interesting in the beginning at least. I was wondering where this was going to go, but in the end, Glasslip disappoints. It really didn't went anywhere, it's a mess. So many things unexplained and things just end up confusing. I mean, it'll try to go into a direction, but the show just ends up back where it was. This is apparent with the whole \"future foresight\" plot point. By the end of the show you don't even know what is this certain skill that Touko and Kakaru has. Not to mention the show is very very slow paced.Usually I don't mind a slow pace, in fact I love slow paced shows a lot. But.... Glasslip's plot is so uninteresting, that it was really hard just to care. Slow paced shows work for me, because no matter how slow they are. THEY GET SOMEWHERE. So, the pacing really does hurt the show. Also, I just have to mention, the final 2 episodes of Glasslip. These episodes were a lot more enjoyable than the rest of the show, because  admittedly it had a few interesting concepts. While the show went somewhere, during these 2 episodes, it drew to a open ended ending. Which I couldn't care less to interpret . Overall, I found the story of Glasslip no where near as compelling I hoped it to be.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n  While the story is the main reason why this show suffers, I felt like a big factor to why the story sucks, was our cast of characters. The characters are really one note, and I can describe all of them with a few sentences. While a few characters do go through a development, the build up to that change was very weak. This is because of the weak relationships between the characters. Most of the main characters are suppose to be friends, but I just couldn't feel the connection between them. Not to mention the \"amazing\" relationship between Touko and Kakaru. These two share almost no chemistry. Really, most of their conversations are about the mysterious power to see the future thing. Which is a plot point I couldn't care less about. But when they do sit down a have a normal conversation(which is rare.), I can kind of see a growing relationship? Well, anyway, this aspect of the anime suffer because of weak character bonds and just shallow development.\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\n  Animated P.A Works, Glasslip does look good. While the character designs aren't P.A's best ones, they are decent. The feel the animation gives off is very summer like. With the look of the town the characters live in. The scenery is beautiful as well, as expected from P.A Works. Now, to the problems. The actual animation is lack luster, still frames, and out of place chibis. They really skip on the animation. I found P.A Works to be the one studio that has a nice balance between, flowing animation and nice designs. And, it's a bit disappointing  that Glasslip doesn't have this balance.\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\n  The music of Glasslip consists of relaxing, dramatic, and even classical songs, which is a nice. I expected this kind of OST, so I'm not surprised that it doesn't stand out. Yeah, sometimes I thought \"Oh! This song is nice.\", but really, that's only because there wasn't much going on screen, and I would forget the song in another second.  The opening is a very nice song, is a waste on this show, and it really should have gone to GOOD slice of life. The ending was catchy and cute, that's it, it wasn't memorable. \\n\r\n   In terms of voice acting, the actors/actress do their job, trying to make the characters interesting, but in the end they don't have much to work with, so their efforts are useless. One notable fact is Fukagawa Seria, as Touko. She is new to the job, and She did her best as Touko, and I can tell she was having fun, with the number of times Touko said, \"EHHHHHHHHHHHHHH?!\".\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n So, with the combination of a messy plot, a ending couldn't care about, bad character relationships, lackluster animation, and a unmemorable OST. I should hate this show right? Well, I kind of don't. I just don't know why I can't bring myself to hate Glasslip. I am disappointed, but not enough to hate it. It's a drag to watch, but somewhere in Glasslip there are tiny pieces of enjoyment. Though, in the end I wouldn't tell anybody to watch Glasslip. \\n",

I later (more than a year after) started watching it again, wondering why it had so bad reviews. And thenI learnt why:\r\nStory & Characters: The story really never goes anywhere. In the beginning it looked as if it had a direction and purpose and could eventually get some emotional depth to entertain the people watching it, but I gave up on that aspect after episode 5. The big thing int the show, the \"Future Fragments\" never got a real explanation and wasin the end deemed unimportant even by the two character that had been chasing them the throughout the whole series. The character relations also kind of suck, and they never do anything, so it can just be ignored.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art is nice to look at, but, as many have pointed out before, there isn't much animation done. The sound was fair, but nothing special.\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed the first 3 or 4 episodes before the show went very stale and pointless. I guess it's an okay show for some, but not for all.",

            "content": "Whoever the hell thought that this anime was good enough to be released needs to be forever banned from the anime industry as should the writer. \r\nStory - This anime tries to use a phenomenon called future fragments as a plot to move the story alone. Future fragments are basically premonitions, thats all you know about them. The anime fails to explain in further detail about these premonitions and as to why the characters get them and what they mean.... No I am not joking. I mean seriously, who the hell had written this? I mean imagine something like this on a popular anime likeNaruto or One Piece, there would be outrage. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nTouko - She is the Main female character and seems utterly clueless and easily gets confused. A seriously poor, dumb and generic MC. \\n\\n\r\nKakeru - An emotionless knob who acts like an snob, no wonder Touko's friends hate him, although they aren't any better. \\n\\n\r\nYukinari - A athletic douchebag with an annoying attitude, who can't take being rejected, suddenly becomes addicted to running because you know, getting rejected does that to ya. \\n\\n\r\nYanagi - What is it with Japan and familial relationships? A question that will probably be left unanswered for the rest of time. Yanagi likes! her step brother who happens to be athletic douchebag mentioned above, Yukinari. She gets jealous of Touko as a result. She, like a lot of the characters, is horribly generic. \\n\\n\r\nSachi - Sachi AKA the manipulative bi*ch, she has to be the worst character in this anime, and given the list of utterly awful characters, that is a bit of an acheivement. Sachi contributes nothing to the group and just reads books, seems happy to lie to the others and to be honest she only seems to be in the group because she loves Touko (and I don't mean 'like'). \\n\\n\r\nHiro - This poor character, the only one with any value at all, although why he likes Sachi is beyond my comprehension.\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style didn't deserve to be wasted on such rubbish.\\n\r\n-----------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The only enjoyment you could get from this is to stop watching it. The plot is incomplete and confusing and the relationship between the characters is as chaotic as a car accident.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The artwork is amazingly good, and even the characters are enjoyable to watch in the beginning.  But after a few episodes you begin to feel like your just being strung along with no real conclusion ever coming.  I will admit that each episode has a way of sucking you in and making you anticipate that just maybe some clue as to what is going on will be revealed.  But by the end of each episode you are still left with morequestions than answers.  If the creators of the anime had some sort of deep meaning that we were supposed to understand then it got lost some where along the way.

In the beginning I saw many similarities between the two, but after a few episodes I had no clue what was going on.\r\nEvery time I sat down to watch it I was drinking maybe a little too much and when I would start a new episode I felt like I had missed huge chunks of the story somewhere and thought to myself \"you must just be drunk\", which wasn't the case. The show was actually just awful.\r\nStory was incredibly confusing. Started off with a seemingly interesting plot that deteriorated into nothing.I don't have any idea what I watched, or what the point of it was. It started so many different things that it could've added to the show to make it better, or could've better explained just about anything. Instead the entire show consists of nothing but really awkward interactions among really awkward friends with unexplained backstory and plot. It's so forced and generic.\\n\\n\r\nArt was pretty. Not many different scenes, it was the same thing in every episode. Pretty generic overall. The artsy still frames were also annoying.\\n\r\nMusic was alright, nothing I loved or wanted to hear more than once, voice actors were nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were somewhat pointless. I didn't understand what any of their purposes were. They all start out as friends but they end up in separate groups contributing nothing to the story and never really hanging out in a group again. Nothing is really tied together. There's no conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIncredibly confusing show. I honestly thought I wasn't paying enough attention due to my alcohol intake until I read other reviews and realized I wasn't wrong in thinking it was a load of garbage.

            "content": "Glasslip's story totally fell short. It had so much potential to be something great but it just crashed. What really attracted to me this anime is the characters. I had felt like I could somewhat relate to each character in some way. However, the whole idea in which Touko and Kakeru could see \"fragments of the future\" literally fell flat by the end of the anime. This is why I gave the storyline a 4. You do not get to find out what this ability they seem to have means and it literally was frustrating as a watcher to not have that cleared up. Theytried to explain it in the last episode but it still isn't crystal clear. I feel like they wanted to have an open ended ending but with this kind of storyline it just didn't work. The creators kept building up to what this \"fragments of the the future\" mean but didn't really explain it at all whatsoever. Viewers need that closure by the end of the anime and the creators just didn't give us that. The anime had so much potential and I was really hoping for an actual explanation or a better conclusion but all I got was frustration. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the fall of storyline, the characters were really what made the show. Kakeru is the true main boy character with Touko as the main girl. They are complete opposites in character. While Touko is indecisive, Kakeru is bold. To me he isn't what \"broke\" the group apart but actually strengthen the relationships within the group. By \"breaking up\" the group he was able to allow them to grow and to me Kakeru didn't harm any of them like he thinks he did by the end of the anime. I won't go in full detail about the other characters but I have to say that their growth and development was pretty awesome. Each character were able to conquer their weakness in some way shape or form. That is something I admire about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the aesthetics of the anime well that is really what I loved about the anime. The sound track and the art was astoundingly beautiful. The soundtrack literally fit so well with the scenes and to me personally felt like it enhances moments in the anime. The art was really beautiful as well. The colors and shades and I just loved the sparkle of the \"visions\" that Touko experiences. It was really pretty.\\n\\n\r\nTo me if the anime just had a better ending I would have really loved this anime but because it fell short all I can give this anime is a 7. It absolutely wasn't the best anime but because of the characters, their development and the aesthetics of the anime it still was pretty enjoyable to watch",

And by terror, I\u2019m revealing the twist that was never in the series\u2026 none of the humans in this show are actually human beings. They are something that scientology is ladling into our ears like old diarrhea and puts all of their other works to shame. P.A. Works may secretly be comedic geniuses, because this show is often hilarious but mostly uncomfortable to watch.\r\n\t\u2022 If you thought David Lynch was the king of the popular sub-genre called surrealism then you would be sorely mistaken. Move over Dave,Junji Nishimura has taken your place because Glasslip was so fucking obtuse that I didn't have clue as to what was happening most of the time. Why are all Junji's pretentious nut-sacks? I mean, I love Uzumaki, don't get me wrong, but you have to admit that Junji Ito is a little pretentious. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Like you would expect from a pseudo-Lynch, all of the characters in Glasslip have weird, stilted interactions, but unlike Twin Peaks, there's really no point or irony to be played upon. I thought that Oniisama e\u2026 had a lot of stills in it, but this show takes the cake. Except UNLIKE Oniisama, they don't just put stills on dramatic moments, it will randomly happen with a chicken or a shot of the sky.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 A character will often bring up a topic, in dialogue, and another character replies with something completely different. The characters are a bunch of schizoids, I guess? The main two characters are a couple of nut-cases that claim that they can look into to the future. If you've ever seen the film Bug, then you know very well that crazy is infectious and Kakeru spreads it to Touko in gallons. She starts out being the very stupid girl, then became the very crazy, stupid girl, who's kind of hot and who everyone crushes on. Kakeru even talks to two other versions of himself randomly. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 All of this insanity is all speculation and observation, of course, because the series doesn't explain a goddamn thing! I think purple dinosaurs like Barney make more fucking sense than this damn anime. There's a lesbian chick who pretends to date a dude to sabotage the relationship between Touko and Kakeru, because she's gay. And then later says that she doesn't care that Touko\u2019s dating a guy because she's bisexual and everyone just accepts it\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There's no development really between the another guy who likes Touko and his step-sister who's crushing hard for him, because I don't know. They randomly bring Touko's sister into it, in the middle of the series, for no particular reason. I guess they noticed that after SNAFU and Oreimo that little sisters were a hot item? The chicken, Jonathan, is the most likable character and makes more sense than the humans in the show.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If you want to see something that ranks among the likes of Garzey's Wing in what-the-actual-fuck category\u2026 then Glasslip is perfect for you! If you want a possible debate of pretentious over-thinking about parallel worlds, then this show isn't for you either because there's absolutely no clarity about whether that\u2019s actually going on. I give Glasslip a 1/10 and a strong recommendation if you want to be confounded by this studio's brilliance! Just kidding.",

I would consider Glasslip to be underhated; in that more people should be aware of its existence and despise it accordingly. \r\nI heard about this anime on forums online, from people claming it was the worst anime they had ever seen, and I decided to foolishly put the tales to the test. And it was so much worse than anything I could have imagined. \r\nGlasslip is actually the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Out of watching literally hundreds of anime, this is the one that prompted me to write a review.\r\nI wish I could tell youabout the story, but it is so bland, boring, and forgettable that I can't even remember a single character's name, nor do I want to. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins well enough, I must admit for the first couple of episodes I didn't believe the legends. P.A. Works is a good studio that has put out some quality work, and it is a testament to their skill that they were able to front-load this anime as well as they did. But the animation, voice acting, sound, plot, and pretty much every other component to a visual medium soon unraveled into a jumbled mess. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is boring and nothing happens. There is moderate set up for `something` to happen, but then nothing does. I guess the best analogy for this anime is like if someone told you that you were going to be watching a 6 hour video of paint drying, and then unbeknownst to you they just pull up a picture of wet paint, so just sit there for 6 hours waiting for the paint to dry and not even that happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, and nothing more. As the anime goes on I distinctly remember the anime quality drop as though the animators lost their will to continue working on the project. The sound has been forgotten, the OP and ED unmemorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all bland nothings, with one exception. And not a good exception mind you; the main \"\"\"love interest\"\"\" is extremely contemptible from the moment he speaks. The rest of the characters might as well have been cardboard cut outs for as much depth and personality they had. \\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Glasslip, and to this day it has been the only anime to have put me to sleep. It didn't even produce any good memes. It's just trash. \\n\\n",

The two were certainly connected, but poorly at best.  It would be nice to find a writeup somewhere that explained what the underlying story was supposed to be, but I'm not going to hold my breath.  I didn't hate the show,I just didn't see the point.  Maybe it was the translations, but I don't think so.  Japanese is a difficult language to translate given it's inherent ambiguity.",

The freeze frame scene transitions at key 'moments' and the classical music score deftly and effectively achieve this goal. \r\nThe characters are interesting without being dramatic and overwrought, which is a breath of fresh air; and we are given understated reasons why their relationship growth is believable.\r\n....................................................................................................................\r\nWhy so don't people like it?\r\nThe negative reviews largely concern frustration about having their expectations betrayed.

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nMelodrama is a term that I feel is thrown around in this medium a lot without much thought or care, but since it's pretty much going to be the driving topic of this review, it's probably a good idea if we define it right here and now. The confusion is probably due to how nebulous the concept has become in the situations it is applied, so forgive me if my definition doesn't quite match up with your own, but we need a solid definition so we can move forward with this review.\r\n     For me, when I saymelodrama on this blog and in these reviews, I typically refer to \"drama instigated by the narrative instead of the characters\". Good drama is most efficiently communicated when actions, both rash and seemingly inevitable, are instigated by the characters, while melodrama appears when the narrative has seemingly run out of things to do, and needs some unconsequential actions to shake the status quo before instantly restoring it. That seems to be a practice, that the topic of today's review: Glasslip, has somewhat mastered.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you're having a pleasant day, and welcome, one and all, to a new anime review... finally. It's time to beat on this dead and brutalized horse, so join me in picking out which bats to use. Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip was animated by the wonderful P.A Works, who have made ripples before in the industry with such titles as Angel Beats!, Nagi no Asukara, and Shirobako. The director was Junji Nishimura, the guy behind True Tears and this season's Bakuon!!, with some rather mediocre stuff in between. Credit for script goes to Tatsuhiko Urahata, and that surprises me frankly, since Urahata has shown adept skill in multiple genres including slice-of-life and romance. Some of his notable scrips have been for anime like Nana, Rokka no Yuusha, Aria and Hanasaku Iroha, though to be fair, there's been some duds in the bunch, like Strike Witches, Haganai, and Escha & Logy no Atelier: Tasogare no Sora no Renkinjutsushi. Glasslip aired 13 episodes in the summer season of 2014, stretching from July 2nd to September 24th. With all the technical stuff out of the way, let's get this review started.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nSummer has arrived for Touko Fukami and her group of friends, which include the comic-relief Hiro, asshole-McEmo(or Yuki), glasses-endowed/resident lesbian Sachi, and spurned women Yanagi. The group of friends mostly live a peaceful life, as they struggle to figure out their feelings for one another, since trust me, the relationship dynamics in this show require a spreadsheet to understand, and decide what to do about their futures as the new year of school comes closer and closer. However, two events are about to shake the foundation of their friendships to the core.\\n\\n\r\n      The first thing that happens is the arrival of Kakeru Okikura(or David as he goes by), a brash and somewhat enigmatic new arrival in the town who seems to stir up trouble wherever he goes. While the group of friends seem to unanimously decide to hate him, Touko finds herself inexplicably drawn to David, not only because he is sort of hot as all hell, but because of the choice words he whispered to her on the night of a fireworks festival a few nights ago: \"I saw the same thing.\" Which brings us the second disruption. Touko has been living her normal life without much drama thus far as she works towards an admirable goal of becoming a glass artisan and perhaps one day inheriting her family's studio, but on the night of the fireworks festival, a strange vision came to her as light reflected off of the thimble she held, showing Touka and her friends in places and situations she didn't recognize. Upon talking to David about it, it appears that he saw the same vision, and they mutually begin to understand that they both have the same strange power: to be able to see \"shards\" of the future reflected in anything shiny or bright.\\n\\n\r\n     Armed with fragmented knowledge of the future gained from these \"shards\", Touka attempts to both try to understand her power and the feelings she has begun to have for David, a situation made more complicated by the fact that both Yuki and Sachi already have a thing for Touka, while Hiro has a thing for Sachi, at the same time as Yanagi has a thing for Yuki(her step-brother, by the way), made even more ambiguous by the fact that David may or may have a thing for Touko as well. Got all of that? Good, because there's a quiz later.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, it's another big dumb \"everyone is in love with everyone\" scenario that you've seen a million times, and hell, while that's obviously an over-used troupe in anime, that's not necessarily a criticism. I'm not even saying this premise is bad for a slice-of-life/romance per say, because I've seen anime pull this kind of thing off before, most notably Nagi no Asukara, with the whole huge love-web scenario made even more confusing by vague supernatural elements driving the story from the side-lines. Glasslip however, does a few things wrong right off of the bat.\\n\\n\r\nProper characterization of your cast is really important before you want to start doing dramatic things with them, and while I get into this more when I get to the \"Characters\" section of this review, the bland and largely unlikable cast of Glasslip don't help the show's case at all. Dramatic tension isn't so much built up through events in the narrative as much as stuff just kind of happens, the characters wine about it for an episode or two, before the next event on the checklist steps up to be dramatized. The narrative never seems to know really what it is doing. First I thought that the power to see \"shards\" of the future that Touko and David posses would tie into some thematic center about facing the future and change, but that theory hits a dead-end quick as the narrative continues to do a lot of stuff, yet somehow a whole lot of nothing. It's this nebulous focus that just simply kills any kind of structure that the show may have had, and the series of largely disconnected events that each episode entails fails to have any impact.\\n\\n\r\n     Look, I'm not saying that Glasslip had to be about something, because it didn't, not really, especially in the genre it is a part of. Many of my favorite anime are about nothing in particularly: the narratives of slice-of-life anime like Nichijou, Toradora, Clannad, and hell, another show by P.A Works that came out later the same year as Glasslip, Shirobako, could be argued by a cynic to be about nothing in particular. And yeah, maybe that's correct, the events in those shows were also random, sometimes disconnected events of the everyday anxiety of normal people. Despite that though, everyone of those shows had something to say about the nothing of everyday, about the human experience, about the connections between their characters, managing to tie all of that into some kind of lesson or moral for the audience that they could apply to their own days of nothing in particular. So no, Glasslip didn't have be about something. But it did have to say something. And it doesn't. There's no overarching moral, the characters don't really learn much of anything by the end except how not to get on one another's nerves, and the whole sorry affair is just a gigantic waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the one part of this narrative that might have been interesting: the ability to see the future in the reflection of objects(a cool and somewhat narratively appropriate idea that I found interesting) is completely undermined by just how contrived the story is, and ultimately makes no sense. Just to be clear, I'm not saying I need an explanation per say for supernatural powers in a contemporary setting, certain stories need the audience to suspend disbelief in order for their narrative to work, and that's fine, stories are allowed to define the boundaries of their own worlds. What I am calling Glasslip out for is that the power itself doesn't operate under any given rules, and pretty much just does what the narrative wants it to do. There's no rhyme or reason for when the visions of the future grip Touko or David, or how the visions present themselves, whether through a corporeal screen or as a full-blown hallucination of varying vividness. At one point, David loses his power to see the future for some reason, and hell, it's not even clear why Touko received the power to see the future when she did. She wasn't born with it, and as far as we know, and hadn't been repressing it. Is this a metaphorical manifestation of teenage anxiety, like what Charlotte did? I don't know. And at this point, this story has become stupid enough for me to not really care either.\\n\\n\r\nIn truth though, all of this ties into the biggest problem with Glasslip, which I'll talk about more in depth later, but for right now, I guess I'll touch on the few things I did like about this show. While this is more likely attributed to the animators at P.A Works than Urahata, I appreciated the range of expressions on the characters' faces, cluing in the veiwer into what they might be thinking(unless there was some obnoxious inner monologue), and helping to tell the story, no matter how crappy it may be, in a more organic and subtle way. That actually ties into my next positive: the silent storytelling. Many of the best moments of the entire show are when the characters keep their fat mouths shut, like when Touko and David silently lay down in a meadow of grass enjoying the sun and the breeze, a maelstrom of unsaid things between them swirling around the scene. Or that moment when Hiro realizes exactly what kind of person Sachi is(which I can't elaborate due to spoilers, though I'm not sure why I even care at this point), and he simply stares at her for moment in confusion which transitions to disgust, before he walks out of the room without hardly another word, unable to fully process what exactly just happened. Oh, and there's this one chicken named Jonathan who is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main cast of Glassip mostly come off as unlikable, stupid, or boring, and that's something that can be attributed to how the story treats them, or to be more precise, what the story makes them do. See, the characters in Glasslip aren't so much actually characters as they are plot-devices in order to serve the narrative, and in many ways, this is the worst parts of Glasslip, the characters have no agency of their own, they only are there to create the drama. Our main heroine Touko is the bland shoujo protagonist for nearly everyone of the male cast(and female to be fair to Sachi) to latch onto and fall in love with, not because they share any sort of particular chemistry or personal connection with her, but because drama will be created as she inevitably turns them down to end up with David. David's character basically only exists to break the group of friends up and create tension. Yuki is only there to act like an asshole to everyone, and for Yanagi to get all upset when he goes after Touka. Hiro... well to be fair Hiro is probably the only character I like in this entire cast, mostly just because he seems to be the only one with truly good intentions. A lovable idiot, Hiro is a simple, tactless, well-meaning guy who just can't help but fall for the quiet, glasses-wearing Sachi(who incidentally is only there to create drama when Yuki isn't around).\\n\\n\r\n     While the main characters don't really have anything to do besides from what the story needs them to do as they try to pretend to be people stuck within the extremely rigid personalities the anime has given them, the side characters thankfully have a little more breathing-room, which pretty much instantly makes them more likable then the main cast. Since the narrative doesn't(usually) make them do anything stupid to serve the drama, the supporting cast actually feel like people observing the situation, and the anime actually did a really good job of putting that observation into a family unit. I enjoyed characters like Hiro's older sister, David's parents, and Touko's younger sister the most; just because their sort of realistic demeanors of amusement and understanding watching these stupid teenagers scream their feelings at one another was the closest this show came to being self-aware. I mean, I doubt it was intentional, but it at least gave me the closest thing to enjoyment while watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nP.A Works are notrious for their stupidly beautiful anime, and Glasslip is thankfully no exception. This is probably the best-looking show I've seen from them disregarding Nagi no Asukara; it's got that feeling of quality that only certain animation studios can make vivid. I could go over the pleasant character designs and the lustrous colors used, but the place I feel the animation really shines is in the backgrounds of the anime. Even without pointers via the narrative, the town where the characters live is so wonderfully realized and drawn with such detail that it really does feel like a living breathing town. There's always a nice landscape in the background to gawk at as the characters do whatever stupid thing they're doing, and there is almost always movement, from birds taking flight in the distance, to cars passing by the characters as they walk to school. It's that sort of commiment that makes this studio stand out among others. It just would have been nice if they had animated something kind of worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound in contrast, is where the aesthetics of this show fall a little bit short, at least for me. The composer: Akito Matsuda, has done a couple of really good OSTs before Glasslip, including but not limited to soundtracks for anime like Hibike! Euphonium, Bokura wa Minna Kawaiso, and D-Frag, but I can't get too excited about his efforts here. Glasslip's soundtrack is heavily themed around classical orchestra pieces, and while I'm sure the OST is a treat for fans of that era of instrumental music, it just isn't for me. Now, I fully realize this negative impression of the soundtrack is due to my personal tastes alone, and I'm sure others who enjoy this kind of music will be delighted by the renditions heard in the background of certain scenes, but even when I take that into account, most of the tracks simply feel much too similiar to each other. Nearly all of the OST pieces use many similiar instruments and follow similiar tempos, and it just makes for a boring listen when you have to go through the whole soundtrack for a review, hypothetically. That said, there were a couple of pieces I felt stood out to some degree. The piano rendition of the song \"Toumei na Sekai\" is rather lovely unlike its vocal counterpart and reminiscent of some of the piano pieces from SNAFU Zoku's OST, and the fast-paced yet somehow intriguing \"Tsunagaru Kokoro, Takanaru Kokoro\" is probably one of my favorite pieces from the whole soundtrack. In summary, while I know that I never was going to like this OST contrary to some people, that fact that even an uncultured music listener like me can find a few tracks to enjoy probably is a testament in itself to well how structured this entire soundtrack is. At the very least, it's much better than most OSTs in a given season, so, you know, I'll stop being a pretentious prick for a moment and give the OST a solid \"good\".\\n\\n\r\n     I got really excited when I saw that nano.RIPE was doing the ED for Glasslip, but I ended up extremely disappointed in that regard. The band has done some of my favorite OP's for the slice-of-life/supernatural genre; I absolutely adore their opening credit songs for Sankarea and both seasons of Non Non Biyori, but Glasslip's Ed \"T\u014dmei na Sekai\" is just kind of generic sounding and uninspired, and honestly sort of unfitting seeing how much of the show's episodes end on some sort of dramatic cliffhanger. As for the OP \"Natsu no Hi to Kimi no Ko\", I can't really say anything about it. It's about as typical as OP's go, and is not even saved by maybe some creative visuals playing into the whole \"shards\" of future thing, but rather is made monotonous by the boring pannning shots and character vignettes.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, at the end of this review, I need to swing this conversation right back along to melodrama, because really, that's core of why Glasslip is the way that it is. Melodrama is a term thrown around without much care in slice-of-life/romance genre, and sometimes that irks me greatly since I feel it's greatly unjustified. This, is one of the few exceptions.\\n\\n\r\n     Fundamentally, nothing in Glasslip really makes much sense, and that is precisely because it's melodramatic, a flaw which you can easily trace to nearly every single integral fault of the story. It was doomed from the moment the agency of the characters were compromised in their own story in order to serve the narrative, and its fate was sealed from the moment that the characters were created reliant on the narrative, because from that point, they didn't take action because they should, they took action because they needed to in order for the narrative to work. Why does Touka's and David's power to see the future fluctuate on how it works so often? Because the narrative said so. Why do they even have these powers in the first place? Because the narrative said so. Why do the character makes stupid and irrational decisions that only begets more drama? Because the narrative said so. Hell, why does this group of teenagers have feelings for one another in the first place, despite not really sharing any chemistry? Because the narrative said so. Why does this show suck so much? Because you, P.A Works, screwed up big time.\\n\\n\r\n     Somewhere along the way, I feel, Glasslip forgot to make its characters actually human, and whatever it wanted to do with them later, the sentiment was already compromised. Look, it makes it hard to care when you feel you're watching a bunch of wind-up dolls with water balloons attached to their eyes. It makes it hard to care when these dolls seemingly seek out drama. It makes it hard to care. And so, at the end of the day, I don't really care about Glasslip. I didn't care what happened with the story, or what happened to the characters, or even if everybody would be happy at the end. I just... didn't care. Apathy is the next step after sadness. Sadness is the next step after anger. And anger is the next step after apathy. If a show obviously doesn't care about itself enough to be coherent, why the hell should I put in the effort to find its positives or to recommend it to people who may feasibly enjoy it for some reason? I'm not. Instead, just to spite it, Glasslip gets a dismissive last phrase in this review, because frankly, I've spent way more time in this review talking about the show than it deserves. Glasslip is a failure of romance, a failure of a drama, and a failure of a story. Skip it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Jonathan was always the MVP.\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "This is very difficult anime to review (and my first review, so bear with me). There are so many conflicting emotions that stem from this, but I will try to be succint in my summation.\r\nUltimately, I liked this, but I can see for sure why most people really didn't. As far as a show with entertainment goes, it had very very little, everything that I got from this anime I had to struggle and think very hard about, I did a lot of reading around to cement my own opinions about the endings and come to a marginally satisfying conclusion, but therein lies the biggestproblem. To truly like this you have to put far too much effort in and not have any real payoff beyond what you imagine.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this worked because I could relate to the fears of both Kakeru and Touko, so in that sense I had a vested interest in seeing their characters grow (although again, it could be argued that they didn't particularly grow at all). The supernatural element was not explained at all and did not really have any benefit to the show, especially for a show that was basically one long metaphor. It just muddied up the waters and made it harder to understand, made the characters less believable and ultimately was a nuisance.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I can't shake how this is staying with me, I keep thinking about it, studying the characters, their motivations, their feelings, and for me this is OK, I just wish we had a bit (OK, a lot) more explanation on the devices used in the plot.",

            "content": "This is the first review I've ever done, so be easy on me - hard to maybe do considering my review is kind of going against what everyone else seems to be saying.\r\nFirst of all let me start by saying this is not in a million years what an example of a good teen romance should be, or a drama, or anything of the sort. This anime is a pretty little mess of genre elements that seem to have been sewed into a somewhat bearable story. But in essence, to me at least, that was almost its charm point. I've not watched an anime thatseems to work with complicated chips as much as Glasslip did.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was of slow pacing and with characters you seemed to fluctuate feelings towards and against. In some ways you rooted for things to go one way but after a strange or awkward event you went another. The way this anime dealt with character interaction and emotion was personally very life-like and almost realistic, despite the heavy (almost forced) emphasis on love triangles and romantic tension. Some may call them bland and a bit bare, but I for one think this kind of anime needed these sort of characters, that were also very genuine in their emotional well-state that made them 'enough'. One main point I see brought up time and time again is that of the 'time shard' plot - I have no real argument against it's place in the anime but I would have liked to see it explored a little more, as the way it was in the series almost seemed like an unnecessary add-on to try and keep the viewers interested. Whilst these are heard complaints/critiques, I like to think that this was the best way this anime could tell its unique little story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the music for both the opening and ending were very charming, and the elegant, relaxing OST throughout made it such an easy watch for me. The art style for me was also one its more pleasing points, as the nature-filled environment flooding the anime made me feel very at ease. The setting next to a seaside with the hills and fireworks definitely added to the calming feel I think the anime was trying to go for. VA was also decent and I have no real complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR, to summarise, this will not be (and has proven not to be) everyone's cup of tea. However, if you're looking for something a little bit more laid-back and non-serious before you go to bed, Glasslip may be an option for anyone interested enough. Whilst not the best in any way at all, I appreciated what the anime was trying to get at and its beautiful animation/music/VA work won me over and I give it a VERY generous score of 7.\\n\\n\r\nPrepared for the backlash for defending a <6 MAL scored anime,\\n\\n\r\n- Kento",

By the end of the anime an explanation of what are the \"future fragments\" is not given and understanding what these were was the main point of the whole story.\r\nI guess someone might say that the romance was also part of the main plot, but considering that this wasn't really developed in the story with the exception of 2 or3 scenes, I don't it counts as one.\\n\r\nI had a lot of questions about the anime that I was hoping to get an aswer for them, sadly the last chapter only got me more questions and almost no answer.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was really good, especially the background scenes, I don't really know how to explain it but it was really good.

I got to like it very much and pretty much listened to it every chapter. The ending theme on the other hand was ok, it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't a memorable one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis was another problem with the anime. There wasn't really any character that could be memorable besides Touko and that is only because the story is basically about her and Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had really good potential, it isn't that bad of an anime it's average. I'm pretty sure there might be people that will really like this anime so I think maybe give it a chance, specially if you liked NagiAsu xd.",

In Glasslip we just watch the story develop throught the Anime but we don't know a lot about the story that happened before the show itself, I don't know if you understand me (probably won't).\r\nArt: Average/good. It wasn't bad but wasn't excellent. The animations were also okay.\r\nSound: One of the things I liked the most in thisshow. Nothing else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Aff. Why? Why?! Idk why but I didn't like the character development throughout the series, specially for the main girl character and the boy who she is in love with I suppose. It just felt wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Average I would say. The show had the potencial to grow a lot more than it did. The story went the wrong way basically. The ending was boring in my opinion and I would change almost everything in this show when it comes to its development. It really sucks that this show just ended like that, it could have gone so much far but no. I felt a little bit bored in some episodes but not very much though, when I first noticed the Anime here in MAL and read the synopsis I was expecting something like Ano Hana, but I was wrong, unfortunetly.\\n\\n\r\nI still recommend you this Anime even though I was expecting a lot more from it, if you liked Ano Hana you might like Glasslip, this show is actually interesting but the creators didn't know how to build a good show. I'm really sad because I spent my time watching something with such potencial being wasted...",

            "content": "Glasslip has been often quoted as one of the worst anime series by many people. I feel this is a completely false statement and people who have seen many anime series will probably confirm this. There are much, much worse series out there. I actually don't even think Glasslip was a completely terrible series! And it could have been much better if it hadn't done so many things oh so wrong. This is what I'm going to discuss.\r\nGlasslip: SoL or Drama?\r\nThroughout watching Glasslip I felt the show constantly was jumping between drama and slice of life and it ended up being a mess. One ofmy favorite series is Nagi no Asukara, a series that came out roughly a year before Glasslip. The two series are both original series by P.A. Works and many NagiAsu fans (me included) were hoping for another series like Nagi no Asukara. Nagi no Asukara, in my opinion, is a series focused on conflict, drama. Sure there is a SoL feel in some episodes but that only lasts so long before a conflict arises, testing the characters' limit and leaving the audience hoping for the characters to overcome the events and grow as people from them. \\n\\n\r\nGlasslip does not take this course, and even if it did, the characters would ruin it. I'll talk more about that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life genre stands on one thing. The characters. Without lovable and entertaining characters, the series is noting. Why would we want to watch the life of boring and unlikable individuals with nothing spectacular happening? Series that succeed in the SoL genre like Ichigo Mashimaro, Barakamon, and Non Non Biyori only succeed because people want to watch the characters. They enjoy their personalities and just watching then do mundane and simple activities is fun. \\n\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip: Characters\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, characters make a SoL show. The problem is every character in Glasslip was annoying and felt extremely unnatural. They even tried to rip off the characters in Nagi no Asukara. With the \"quiet and mysterious new guy\" character Kakeru a failed attempt to recreate Tsumugu from Nagi no asukara. And the main girl is a clumsy, cheerful, lovestruck heroine extremely similar to Manaka's character in NagiAsu. Yet somehow even trying to recreate the characters from Nagi no Asukara, I disliked every character in Glasslip, even if I love every character in NagiAsu. Actually the only character in Glasslip I liked was the main character's little sister, Hina, who had very little screen time! So watching the show I couldn't get invested in what was happening to the characters because I didn't like or care about any of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip: Sci-fi or not??\\n\r\nThe most frustrating thing about Glasslip is its piss poor attempt to integrate a sci-fi or fantasy element like they did in NagiAsu. And yea, the set-up on paper is cool. A girl and boy who can tell the future through a looking glass? But what happened to that? Its mentioned here and there and then nothing. It's like a romantic drama. The characters all trying to figure out their feelings for each other in the hot summer. Hormones, a hot sun, sandy beaches! ... oh yea and some of them have this power..... They do such a poor job at this area of the show, it would make the show better if it didn't have the most interesting concept in it! As you can tell I'm pretty mad about it. The idea had so much potential and they just took a giant shit on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs Glasslip a terrible unwatchable show?\\n\r\nNo. \\n\\n\r\nBut is it a show that I would recommend to someone looking for a colorful slice of life show? Or perhaps a drama-filled romance? A fantasy show about a girl seeing the future of her closest friends right before her eyes?\\n\r\nNo, no I wouldn't. None of that.\\n\\n\r\nBut is it a show with pretty animation and a nice soundtrack?\\n\r\nHaha, yep.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: I give Glasslip a 5/10.",

            "content": "I just finished Glasslip so I decide to do another review on it. Last one was on the first four episodes, this is on the complete show. So here it goes\r\nStory- Generic slice of life story. Like in my other review I can't say much more then that. Granted I'm not a big fan of slice of life in general, but for the anime in slice of life that I have seen this is pret generic. But he story started to piss me off. Not because of the slice of life, I can live with that. It the other aspect they added to the show.The whole vision concept and power that our main MC and Kakeru (Hope to god I spelled his name right) have. It isn't never explained. They just showed glimpse and pieces of how it works. At first it was some future seeing thing but then the whole power got turned around in the final episode out of nowhere. It ended up being something different. And they barely explained that. That is my biggest gripe with it because they never fully explained how this power worked. I'm no expert in this, far from it, But I think if your going to add some supernatural power you need to explain it. Not show it, then say it might be something else and still not fully explain after you say it might be something else. Overall them not explaining that power took the story score down. Overall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt- One of my high points in this anime, but I have a gripe with this two. Not the animation, no no no. It's the still frames. For anyone that has seen it you know what I am talking about. I don't know why but when they used the still frames all silly-hilly it pissed me off to know end. Other than that I got nothing bad to say about the background or the animation or the characters. Overall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The background music fits the theme and I really loved the opening and ending to it. And voice actors did their job. Not much else to say. Overall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- While I will say these characters can be relatable, in anime, they are generic. Touko the MC who loves her friends and has a crush on David, Yanagi the girl who wants in incest love with her step brother (Kinda exaggerating that, but I sh*t you not about loving her step brother), Yuki the guy who has a crush on Touko, which isn't really returned (but has that incest direction if that completely bombed) , Hiro the cheerful jokester in the group, Sachi the quiet book reading friend who didn't want to lose any of her friends and Kakeru our mysterious transfer student who is the love interest of Touko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7/10 I'll admit I actually enjoyed it. I'll honestly admit that much. Not higher because of the ending\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 5/10 While the animation and sound is good the way it ends it without explaining the supernatural power that it tried to add to make it different from other slice of life, really ruined it for me. I'll will say though I would fully recommended this to slice of life fans. Others...not so much",

The colors are reminiscent of Nagi no Asukara, and the music is light and entertaining.  \r\nNow for the bad stuff:\r\nThis anime was on my list of anime i was excited for when it aired. I sat through the entire series because of the artwork and the few characters I did like. But other than that it was painful towatch sometimes.  The main character is distasteful, I did not like her at all, she was annoying in the slightest and never really went for anything. Static is a good word for her. The side characters however were relatively interesting. My biggest problem with this anime was the lack of development. The main characters NEVER CHANGED, they played cat and mouse the entire anime.  Needless to say I was disappointed by this anime. It leaves you feeling short of story and lack of fulfillment.",

            "content": "The hugely negative reviews that this show is getting is mainly because this show is aimed at a specific audience. it is neither flashy nor has twists and turns like many other anime. It is a slice of life, a very thin slice and not everyone can connect to it. In real life things do not progress fast. In real life you dont have stereotyped characters like tsunderes and danderes. In that way the characters in glasslip are very real. I do not understand why the wort of an anime or character is measured by how interesting backstory it has or the struggle of eachcharacter. Yes, those anime are inspirational and hit us hard but just because an anime caters to the ordinary people with ordinary life does not mean its bad. The artwork is brilliant in this anime btw and that is one point everyone agrees.\\n\r\nVerdict:- If you want a thriller, a plot with huge twists and turns, characters with backstory etc. stay away from this anime. If you want to enjoy mundane lifestyle and complex romantic love life of a few teenagers, this anime is for you. Personally I could connect a lot to this anime, it was almost like school life all over again and I believe many can.",

But it wasn't with every passing episode I found myself getting less and less interested and more and more confused. \r\nCharacter development was pretty eh, one of the things that annoyed me most was when Hiro went to the hospital and his sister was also there and she had walked out of a hospital room (her boyfriends) crying. The anime never really cleared that up. Why was she crying? What happened?\r\nAside from that this anime definitelycould've been longer than 13 episodes. There was a lot of potential for character development but the creators just ignored it. \\n\r\nEpisode 12 was maybe what made my opinion of this anime drop to a lower score. It made me so utterly confused. I didn't understand it at all. Episode 13 was its ending. And I was wrong to have hope that in the final episode it could make up for the mistakes. But it didnt, instead I was just more confused. It didn't feel like any of the characters got closure on their stories. Except maybe Hiro and Sacchan. It didn't really explain what happened to Kakeru his tent in the backyard was just gone. Did he go on tour with his mother? What the hell man? \\n\r\nI'm not sure if I was the only one confused all through out that anime. But I hope I wasn't. There's probably a lot more I could analyze on this anime. It felt kind of like a waste watching this anime. But if I didnt I most likely would have just continued thinking I missed out on watching a good anime. I'm glad I tried It out and satisfied my curiosity. But was it worth my time? Not really. I didn't like this anime. Though this is all just my opinion and I respect those who did enjoy this anime (and their opinions).",

The first problem was the under development of characters. If there was some sort of attachment to them this anime could've easily been bumped up to about a 7. From there the next problem was the story line. A story should not be this confusing. There was no real explanation of what happens, and why everything is happening. Sadly you can't just leave us here expecting us to decipher the whole situation, if that was fixed, then it could've been all the way upto an 8. Overall, this anime was pretty decent, so it gets a 5 from me.",

In my opinion, this anime would be categorized as either a slow-paced romance or simplified slice of life.\r\nFirst of all, The story's quite... mediocre. Don't get me wrong, I like the romance part of it all, but it's just that it's too predictable. It didn't really get my heart pumping. And I think it wasn't right to add \"magic\" into the show. There was literally no point to it. It was just there for the sake of diversifying the simpleplot. Probably the only part I liked about the wholes series was episode 12. The others, bunch of crap.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started with the characters. They're all pretty much a copy of every shoujo manga character. And like I said before, the romance was predictable. From the start, I knew who was gonna end up with who. They didn't even bother to add some kind of conflict to the story. It's just them getting together and that's it. The end.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if it wasn't for the classical music and simple art style, I would have ranked this a 3. And I definitely don't recommend it if you're looking for a new anime to watch. Believe me, it's a waste of time.",

So while I did set my expectations low, I ended up really enjoying everything about it. And that's despite being completely oblivious to its allegories. I guess I was a bit bothered by ambiguity of the ending but I didn't find it nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. \r\nMy friend pitman (as well as many others I'm sure) think Glasslip is boring, but that view is completely beyond me, especially since those people like ''just relax back and enjoy the cute moe''no-plot healing type of shows. I don't see how can Glasslip then be more boring than those, when it has some romance drama on top of gorgeously drawn SoL setting and moegirls  to hnng for really strongly. Hell, I feel it could be a show just about watching Sachi read  and I'd enjoy it just for how pretty and cute it is.\\n\\n\r\nPitman was also bothered by Glasslip trying to have some sort of love polygon that he felt was too convoluted and introduced some supernatural plot device that wasn't explained.\\n\\n\r\nTo which I answered that Glasslip actually straightens out the love polygon rather quickly and it boils down to 3 pairs. Everyone seems to be bothered by the supernatural element, funny since everyone says almost the same thing about Golden Time supernatural element. I didn't mind either, as I understood that they weren't actually supernatural elements but were rather just meant as creative artistic expression of something that can't easily be expressed otherwise. In Golden Time it's representation of what it feels like to have split personality. Having the other personality drawn and animated characterizes it as a separate entity, something that wouldn't work nearly as well with just ''hearing a voice in his head''. In case of Glasslip: \\n\\n\r\n Reddit quote: Because of their love, because of their fears, and because of their sensitive nature, Touko and Kakeru experience and share their emotions through imagination, otherwise known as ''fragments of the future''. It has nothing to do with alternate worlds, fates, other dimensions, timelines, or other bullshit - it's just their vivid imagination. They learn about each other and about each other's feelings and emotions this way. \\n\\n\r\nFunny enough, Kill la Kill is what opened me up to enjoying this type of allegorical/non-literal storytelling (as well as some of bobduh's writeups possibly). I used to dislike it before hand, though I still do if it's completely over my head like in Yuri Kuma Arashi since that just makes me feel stupid for not getting absolutely anything at all...",

            "content": "Glasslip is... well, I don't quite understand it much, but it's about a group of third year high students undergoing their summer vacation-- which is the final summer vacation they will have as high schoolers for they will graduate after that school year ends. Two of these said teenagers possesses abilities of some sort that allowed them to see/hear the \"future fragments\".\r\nIt all started with five \"close\" friends from childhood who often hangs out, and stuff like that (the normal squad stuff). It all changed when Okikura \"David\" Kakeru came in town claiming that he saw the same thing as Fukami Touko, our MC, duringthe fireworks festival from the start. And starting from there, the group started going separate ways and don't seem to be as close as they were before.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion in this is this: if their friendship is that easy to break, then were they even close in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, the MC Touko is... well... I would say shallow. She actually fell for David after she only met him. Or maybe it was because they possess the same abilities? Or maybe because she saw the \"future\"? I wouldn't know, but it does happen in real life. \\n\\n\r\nShe has this ability to see the future (I don't know if what she can see is future though, but for this review's sake, let's just say that she can see the future), it is triggered whenever she looks at reflective, shiny things (namely, glass).\\n\\n\r\nIn general, she is this string who holds the group together and the group fell apart because her, being the string, was taken by David, who she spent most of her time with. \\n\\n\r\nDavid is quite a stoic and serious boy, at times he can be blunt and straightforward. He is also perceptive but is insensitive to people's feelings, so he ends up saying too much and whatnot. David has two other alternate egos, to whom he talks to about his problems. He hops from place to place because of his Mom's job, he happened to be in this town and saw the same thing Touko did, which intrigued him.\\n\\n\r\nHe has the ability to hear the future, it occurs whenever he hears his mother's classical music.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Imi Yukinari who liked Touko, a runner from the track team, and his step-sister, Takayama Yanagi, who liked Yuki. At first, it confused me as to why they were living together, and I had to look up that they were actually step-siblings, they should really explain that one from the start geez. I still wonder why they have different surnames though. Anyway, Yuki is the guy who is almost always seen with a scowl, he is also jealous of David at the beginning. Yana is the pretty one, although I sometimes get the bitter vibe from her.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go over to Nagamiya Sachi, a frail bookworm who may or may not have romantic feelings for Touko, and Shirosaki Hiro, who is in love with Sachi. I actually find him sweet. Well, Sachi harbors feeling of hatred towards David for being the reason their group falls apart. But I'm glad that Sachi is gradually falling for Hiro, so it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music is amazing and the effects are almost flawless. The art is what I see as the strong part of this anime. I like the frozen frames in each episode (the ones when it pauses and portrays the scene as an amazing drawing). The ending of ep 13 which showed all the frozen frames is very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, this anime is not so good, the plot is all over the place, and there are a lot of things that are left unexplained. Personally, there are scenes that just made my eyes roll, and there are also scenes where I was like \"What just happened?\". I do recommend it if you like good art, because the art is just fantastic.",

            "content": "Remember those high school classical literature texts that teachers assigned for literary critique? Remember those stories that could be interpreted in countless ways due to their vagueness, hinted symbolism, and usage of metaphors? Well welcome back to high school; your assignment for the next six and a half hours is to work your way through this slow and perplexing work of art. It is a work of art because I'm certain that if you look at it from certain angles, you will find beauty. However, whether that glimmer of beauty is worth it is obviously up to the viewer. If you can deal with aslow story and like the challenge of having to think to figure out what is happening, this might be a candidate for watching. If you like your conclusions and hearty plot chunks served nice and warm on a clean plate stay clear of this one.\\n\\n\r\nGlasslip follows the daughter of a glassblower, Touko, and her group of friends, who have agreed to a pact of no relationships. This pact rapidly shatters (pun intended) with the arrival of Kakeru, a confident yet childishly ignorant transfer student who suddenly claims to understand Touko in ways that her other friends don't. Kakeru claims that Touko's occasional hallucinations when she sees shiny things (such as glass) are fragments from the future, and as we know, you have to be careful when playing with glass shards. How will Kakeru affect everyone's relationship with each other, and will he be able to solve the mystery of Touko's shards?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIf there is one category that immediately shouts beautiful, it's this category. The artwork in this work borders and even supersedes the quality of some animated movies. P.A. Works has obviously spared little here; the background is filled with lush details and the overall scenery, a rural small-town, combined with the calming music and sound effects create an atmosphere truly worth envying. This is proudly on display from the get go with some of the best fireworks animations I have yet seen. Though the overall quality is very similar to what was seen in Nagi no Asukara, the focus this time is squarely on the town rather than the sea. Some of the scenes, such as the morning seaside scene at the beginning of episode 6, are absolutely breathtaking; from the reflection of gentle, incoming waves, to the calm dew enveloping the landscape, you just can't help but feel a sense of calm and utter relaxation. Looking beyond the general background and lighting, P.A. Works has also put their special touch on the characters. All of the characters are well styled and well animated. What I love about P.A. Works is probably the subtle details that they focus on with their characters, whether it is a slight off-glance in response to a remark or the many emotions that Touko goes through while figuring out how to open a bottle of Ramune. The characters are all distinct though Touko's reddish-eyes and pale skin would almost make one think this would be a fit for a vampire flick.\\n\\n\r\nThis is neither an action nor an ecchi show, unless you count girls in simple school swimsuits as ecchi. Do expect a punch or two and some kissing though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound of this show beautifully complements the animation. The show starts with a fittingly calm and melodic piece by ChouCho and ends with a more livelier piece by Nano Ripe (I still don't like her high-pitched, nasal voice though). Even more impressive for me is the great BGM that brings in the OP and ED as well as some other orchestral pieces that are both melodic and memorable. The instrumentation is relatively light compared to some other works but it is nonetheless very effective. Add on a nice set of sound effects including a multitude of seaside waves and chirping cicadas and you have a very compelling sound package.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the VAs in this work are relatively junior in comparison to Nagi no Asakura. This shows a bit as Yanagi, voiced by Saori Hayami, clearly is the strongest character in terms of clarity and presence. While nothing was particularly annoying, Kakeru's ambivalent voice and personality was just a bit too reminiscent of Yuu from Persona 4 for my tastes. Overall, not the best VA work I've seen from P.A. Works but it still gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nGoing in to this show, I had already sensed the beginnings of a bumpy road with a lot of negative reactions to early episodes. A quick Reddit search confirms suspicions with people claiming that finishing this show was just as harrowing of an endurance as watching Haruhi's infamous endless eight. To be fair, the show was quite ambitious in its goals and the overall execution wasn't all that focused. We all know that if you try to multitask too much you end up getting nothing done, and certain parts of this show certainly felt that way. Most perplexing is the fact that, despite trying to accomplish so much, the show came across as tortoise slow. Perhaps the slowness is due in part because of the calming, serene atmosphere and perhaps it's due in part because the director spent all the time focusing on the tiny moments that I so enjoyed. Regardless, if you venture into this, prepare to give your full, undivided attention if you want to make sense out of much of the show; and prepare for bits to still not make sense afterwards (two full viewings in my case).\\n\\n\r\nSo as I mentioned earlier, Kakeru is a cue ball traveling full speed towards a group of five other billiard balls (two striped and three solids), and the resulting collisions take up the full length of the show, and whether or not any of the balls end up in holes is for the viewer to figure out. The previous sentence is both a metaphor not unlike what you will encounter in the show as well a description of the main plot and rather incomplete conclusion. You will encounter much in this adventure including references to literature that I have never read, chickens conveniently named after philosophers (other than Jonathan), sudden sound effects that sound as if they came straight out of Another accompanying supposedly supernatural events, and some slice of life romance mixed in as well. If you get confused along the way, I recommend stopping and looking at a map (figuratively); attempting to plow further will most likely just get you even more lost. And here's the deal breaker for most of you, even when you reach the end of the road you will find neither a pot of gold nor a harem of seventy two virgins, you just find a dead end. The series forces you to retrace your steps to hypothesize on, but to be honest they leave few foreshadows.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, though the show has its moments, many of the plot elements felt thrown in for the heck of it, and the story doesn't really get its message across, whatever it is supposed to be; it rather just drops you off on a random ditch with a few glass beads for your trouble.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nStory aside, the show does have well-developed characters and some fairly good interactions. Like Nagi no Asukara, the story revolves around multiple characters all with their own subplots, and like Nagi no Asukara you have a group of established friends whose fate becomes intertwined with an outsider, who seemingly tugs at certain female group members. However, Touko (who reminds me of a much more attractive version of Manaka) aside, the characterizations are very different and the relationships much more subtle in general. Here's a hint, if you watch the OP, you'll already have a good idea of where much of the relationships are going. They give that to you as a freebie, what you have to figure out the themes and meanings outside of the relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that can really spoil one's rating here would be the viewer's impressions of Touko and Kakeru. Touko is a simple girl and one who is slow at quite a lot. A lot of viewers will find this not as cute but rather off-putting. Kakeru is cast as an lone wolf who thinks of attachments as troublesome, yet he is somehow surprisingly keen at times when it comes to social sense. As the majority of the show is told from their perspectives, a strong distaste for either character will leave quite a sour aftertaste; and judging by the character votes on Anidb, most people do feel this way. For me, I was able to work through Touko's shortcomings and enjoy her attempts at resolving the group's issues in her own way. However, Kakeru is still an utter mystery; his decisions don't seem to follow any traceable path and his overall ignorant/confident attitude just completely throws me off.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a saving grace, it's the strong character of Yanagi, who is seriously the only character (Hina aside) with a good amount of emotional maturity. I guess I should also point out that at least some of the parents play a role in the show and that there are relatively few additional supporting characters, both nice pluses. However, the pluses are mired by uneven growth and ultimately unsatisfying romance.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis series was truly difficult to review, and I had to commit to watching the entire thing twice before I felt I had enough of the fragments to form a worthy review. Glasslip is a beautifully drawn work with great atmosphere and music. In that way, it is very similar to K, another show with great presentation but questionable storytelling. The story that Glasslip tries to tell is something of a mess. Yes there are some cute moments but overall you feel like you're trying to draw water out of an empty well. However, if you can see yourself liking the characters, then at least not all is lost. Though I enjoyed the show with its interactions and animation, I know that many will not find that as reason enough to watch this. And quite honestly, I feel that the show could have been so much more. If you really like P.A. Works and have shoveled through blizzards such as Red Data Girl, you might as well trudge on with this one. But alas, if you do not fall under this category, this show is probably one that you should probably pass.",
