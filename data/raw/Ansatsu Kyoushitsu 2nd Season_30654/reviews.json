            "content": "Oh Koro-sensei, He wasn't just teaching his students new things, he taught us fans new things too, even if we didn't realize it. Among-st the many things Koro-Sensei taught us, was how to laugh, learn & develop, always make room to improve, be inspired, challenge yourself, and most importantly use your full potential! \r\nDuring the shows first season I was not interested in the anime nor manga. I felt that the story was absolutely ridiculous and a complete  waste of time reading/watching. It wasn't until 2013 that I saw \"Funny moments\" or \"best moments\" in anime videos on Youtube and saw Assassination classroom onit and thought to myself, \"ha, this does look pretty funny\" \"I'll try any show once\", gave it a watch and was for the most part blown away.. like the moon...  (Puns intended.)My favorite thing about the story and plot is that it connected to me, the viewer on a personal level.  I could relate to how most of the characters backstories in E classroom were treated at school. For the most part, mainly towards the ending of the season 2 I felt that the build up towards the final episode were very well executed... or should I say.. assassinated.. wait, I don't think that  word works.. whatever. The begining of the season 2  has ups and downs however for the most part, it remains pretty solid. I don't want to use the term \"roller-coaster\" but I think I will use that to describe it. For example, 1-4 episodes will be about the daily lives of certain students, or the students working on something unrelated to the story. It felt more like filler episodes for the most part.  Now for the second part season 2 the backstories about certain characters past and the history of class E finally begin to unfold. We are introduced to more characters and both shocking, and sudden plot developments, as to be expected. For the most part each arc of season 2 is all over the place and honesty, I felt it lacked a sensible amount of balance. The plot for certain episodes can feel a bit confusing at times because one second the students are honing their skills then next episode they are helping re-build a shelter. So balance does seem to be a reoccurring problem within the story-line. Overall I l was generally impressed with the story, I believe that Y\u016bsei Matsui did an amazing job with his work and that Lerche did an amazing job following the work.\\n\\n\r\nNumber one thing that annoyed me about the series overall is that  the animation or lighting in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, even without the show being censored it's really dark. There are multiple moments in the show where areas are unnecessarily darkened to the point where I actually start questioning myself \"This is the uncensored or raw version right?\" The background settings looked poorly done so maybe that's why the animators decided to use darkness in multiple scenes. Character designs still remain the same so I do not have much to add to the subject. I felt like the artwork, especially the background settings needed to be re-done. I hope to see whoever is in charge of editing the Blu-Ray discs, brightens things up.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't anything to special, I don't want to say lackluster however most of the times I'd be watching an action scenes I didn't feel like the music playing enhanced the situations(s) occurring on screen. I also didn't care for both opening songs and the latest ending song Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi by Shion Miyawaki. The ending song from PT 1 was my only favorite track. Seiyuu's are always amazing in this show. Of course my main man, a hundred grams, N*gga's just don't understand, Jun Fukuyama reprises his role as the lovable and somewhat admirable Koro sensei. Perhaps my favorite thing that Jun does with Koro sensei is his laugh. Every time I hear \"Nyeh heh heh heh heh\" or \"Nyu fu fufu fu\" I burst out laughing too.  Nagisa, Karma, I really liked that their voice actors went through good lengths of studying English so they could speak it properly for certain episodes. While Karma's actor Nobuhiko English sounded a bit \"broken\" I did however like that Nagisa's voice actor Mai\\n\r\nFuchigami was able to enunciate or pronounce English better. Everyone else did a great job with their roles and I think that Ansatsu Kyoushi has one of the best cast of voice actors for an anime series. Each of the actors are able to express a good amount of feeling with their characters in order to make their characters feel more... realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the most vital part of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. The main focus for all characters in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is growth & development. These  two things  are literally the key in what makes this series work out so great. As to be expected of course, during the beginning of the series season 1 until the ending, the characters are lacking strength, potential, and skill. My favorite thing about the series characters is that I felt like I got to experience growth along with the students, and the teachers in this series. The way the characters react  when they learn new things or acquire a new skill, because I felt so involved while watching it made me feel like I learned something new too. For example, if Koro-sensei is speaking directly to the students about studying for an exam and he's giving them both words of advice and encouragement then I, the viewer am also receiving some sort of acknowledgement too. Another thing about the characters is that they're all made to be either relate-able and or likable. That way viewers like me feel like they are on the same level as the characters in the show. Out of all departments listed from the \"rate the anime\" category I would say that characters are my most favorite thing about the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and pleasure is always experienced while I'm watching Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I don't think for a second I've ever been truly unsatisfied with an episode. I have to give the series some praise because for 25 episodes and not a single one for me to dislike, I think that's amazing. I think to myself, even while writing this, \"hmmm, I know there has to be at least one episode I hate\" but I just cannot think of a single episode. Overall I was very satisfied with Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I think although it may not have been the best of the current season it still stood out enough to earn the 4th spot in my top 5 airing the spring season. 9/10 for a memorable and joyful experience.",

            "content": "The sad fact of life is that all good things must eventually come to an end, and that includes whatever school year might have actually been fun for you. Thus, Class 3-E - the only class that teaches assassination - must come to an end, as well, whether the world goes down with it or not. In this season of Assassination Classroom, we get to see how it all ends, making it one of those anime that is actually a full adaptation of the original manga. When I watched the first season last year, I enjoyed it a whole lot; that was more than enoughto get me to watch the second season when it came out. Needless to say, this season was even better.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, tentacles all over (yes, I'm saying that again), here is my review of Assassination Classroom Second/Final Season.\\n\\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with Assassination Classroom, it centers around Class 3-E, which is considered to be the lowest class in Kunugigaoka Junior High (and gets poor treatment from both teachers and students because of it). They end up getting a new teacher, which is a huge, yellow, octopus-like thing capable of Mach 20 speed and, as it is said, mass destruction; you see, he is apparently responsible for the recent destruction of the moon. He claims to be destroying Earth next in a year, but first, he wants to teach Class 3-E. Thus, Class 3-E is given the assignment of killing this thing, now named Koro-sensei, by graduation, and they will earn the 10 billion yen bounty on his head if he does so. Needless to say, Koro-sensei proves to be an excellent teacher to the students by not only teaching them the regular school subjects and assassination, but also life lessons.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Assassination Classroom picks up from where it left off, and boy, does it get great from there! A few parts of the story in this season feel a little rushed, but it was certainly never boring! It provided a lot of character development for each character in this series, even some of the ones that started out unlikable. For example, the principal of Kunugigaoka Junior High, Asano, starts off as someone with a heart of stone, but when you get to see his backstory, you start to sympathize with him even a little bit. Speaking of backstories, Koro-sensei's backstory is finally revealed in this season, as well, and while trying not to give too much away.... man, is it intense!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in season two of AssClass (still amused by this abbreviation) is pretty much the same as in season one, seeing that it's still Lerche animating it, so there really isn't much for me to say here. It's still well-done animation that especially stands out in the easy-to-get-into action scenes. The Japanese voice acting for this season is pretty good, too. Now, as for the music, I honestly thought that both the opening and ending themes of this season left more of an impact than the opening and ending themes of the first. I especially liked \"Bye-Bye Yesterday\", the second opening theme; it's really sad that this anime is ending, and this opening really made me feel the impact of its upcoming end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I did enjoy season one of Assassination Classroom, season two was even better. If anyone has seen season one and wants to know how it ends, you'd better watch this. I'm personally looking forward to seeing more of these interesting characters in the spin-off, Koro-sensei Q, but for now, we must say goodbye as Class 3-E graduates from their assassination classroom.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n--------------\r\n\"The journey is the reward\" - Steve Jobs\r\nIn some cases, plot armor works to help the anime. Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is one of these rare examples. Sure, we know what's going to happen. Sure, it's the greatest moment when the entire show builds to it's climax and then it explodes into a colorful rainbow of nostalgia and emotion. But it can't wash away all the screw ups of the show in the past, right?\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nThankfully, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu rarely screws up, but even if it had, most of it would have been forgotten with the climax to top all climaxes. Ansatsugets most of it's praise from how unique it is, and I won't argue with that. It's a very strange concept that almost makes you forget it's a shonen at points. ALMOST. Being a shonen isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. It just means that it's prone to the flaws of shonen - arcs that are inferior to others. Again, Ansatsu pretty much blows that out of the water though. None of the arcs are inferior to others, which I feel even works against it at a point, when the final arc was just as exhilarating as one from the halfway point. And, most of the arcs follow a common pattern in shonen - bad guy shows up, minor struggle, you beat him, the next bad guy shows up, slightly larger struggle, you beat him, boss shows up, big struggle, you beat him, recovery episode. Which brings me to the ending. From the very beginning, straight out of episode one, you had been waiting for the death of Koro-sensei. The moment was just as filled with sadness as everyone had predicted, it wasn't surprising at all. But looking in the episode discussion, you don't find anybody complaining, even the manga readers were impressed with how well it was handled. In conclusion, Ansatsu is creative, but not quite groundbreaking.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLerche isn't a very famous studio, and even if you had heard of them before, it probably wasn't for their mind boggling animation and more likely for their screw up of Daganronpa. When the original season first aired the animation was still pretty mediocre, but it hasn't improved since then, and the animation around it has, which has made it even more underwhelming. Both the art and animation are bad.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme screams average to me. It sounds like I've heard it before, kind of thing. The endings are slightly better but still, 99% of people won't care to remember or even listen. But every once and a while, there is an theme song that completely outclasses the rest, the one people remember the show for. Bye Bye Yesterday is one of the three openings I've listened to so many times in a row I got tired of it. Usually it's one or two, but with this one it was probably 20 - 30. That's insane. Actually, I'm amazed I was able to, writing that down. It may seem unbelievable, but it was THAT good to me. The soundtrack gets completely ignored because most of the openings aren't spectacular, which is such a shame because the innovative soundtrack is one of the show's best features. Some of it feels a little out of place, like it should be in a mystery show, but it's still great nonetheless. The average sound effects are made up for by the highly praised seiyuu that voice the characters. Koro-sensei and Karma, in particular, are voices that I could put to the face blindfolded. Ansatsu has it's ups and downs in the sound department.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nReally, Koro-sensei is the only character that I felt was good. He works really well as the series mascot, but if that wasn't enough, he was also hard not to love. Despite this, I can see why others consider him to be annoying. The other main character, Nagisa, is pretty average for a main character. Acts-weak-but-is-actually-the-best-in-the-class kind of thing. As for the supporting cast... well, this is why Ansatsu is so praised. All of them get their own little development arc, which seemed forced to me. On top of that, the characters really are just templates, design and personality-wise. Just because the show does a good job at featuring them all doesn't necessarily make them good characters. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu is definitely show that was meant to for you to not expect anything at all, and then take the viewer by surprise. Did it take you by surprise? Or did you like it anyway? Feel free to comment on my profile and tell me what I did wrong with this review, I'm always up for feedback. Thanks for reading!\\n",

If it's not your thing then you may still enjoy it, there are still funny moments, silly interactions between characters and some assassinations attempts that stay true to the first season.\r\nThe art and music is as good ifnot better than the first season, with wonderful openings/endings and beautiful characters this show is great if you like the normal computer animation style done well and great music. \\n\r\nI loved this anime so much and I will probably continue to love it for many years as I do for a few others. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, the season season of Assassination classroom is defiantly worth a watch if not for its enjoyable story then for it's art and music.",

            "content": "After finishing the first season, I started to question the direction of the story. It had its moments and the comedy was fairly good, but I wasn\u2019t overall very impressed with it. The assassination premise is presented in a colourful and fun manner that it tends to take lightly of its consequences. It glorifies that assassination serves as a way for fellow assassins to create bonds and promote self-improvement. I can\u2019t help but see it as a flaw, given that I\u2019m already used to seinen titles that explore the world of assassination in detail and it\u2019s definitely not all fun and games. The dynamic betweenClass E and Koro-sensei is great but the latter still remains a mystery. Little is known about his background and motives. They are all complaints I had but things start to get more interesting as the second season started rolling in. \\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the second season is graduation. We all know that feeling, sharing fun moments with your fellow classmates inside the classroom. But, you know that they will all come to an end in the inevitable future. Fitting that into the pre-established setting, it unexpectedly works well. Who would have thought that the show can manage to promote that sense of sentimentality despite its assassination theme as each characters reflect on how they have progressed so far. Assassination is taken more seriously now, since it starts to slowly sink in that they will have to kill Koro-sensei eventually and that time is running out, making it an interesting conflict of emotions. Questions are posed such as \u201cWhat does it really mean to kill?\u201d and \u201cIs there any other way around it?\u201d The fun approach towards it is still there, but it\u2019s toned down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes full-force with the sentimentalities of graduation but it tends to breeze past its pre-existing issues such as the education system and the involvement of the government and other external agencies in relation to killing Koro-sensei. It\u2019s a shame that they were never really tackled and explored well while certain episodes are wasted on school activities that has little to do with the ongoing story. It does enhance the reoccurring theme but they feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts to unfold Koro-sensei\u2019s past and makes his motives clear to everyone which is a good thing since that was what often bugs me while watching the previous season. The character development among the cast is starting to be more apparent. The gravity of the situation is starting to get into them and we get to see how they plan to cope up with it even if the situation is over. It\u2019s like being anxious not being to be able to graduate, and the only way for that to happen is to pass the final exam. That final exam is Koro-sensei. He has been with the cast from the start. Despite being an assassination target, everyone becomes attached to him in a way. This further adds up to the sentimentality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you found the previous season somewhat lacking, then this sequel will somewhat remedies that. It doesn\u2019t resolve every single issue, but it manages to conclude the main story well that leaves you quite the emotional impact. \\n",

CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS !!!!!\r\nAll good things must come to an end and the end has finally come! You hear many fans complain about wanting a teacher like Korosensei but my answer to such request is that we already have our own Korosensei! That\u2019s the beauty of this story and character where Korosensei doesn\u2019t act as a teacher for just class 3-E but also for all its viewers! Just like s1 he teaches or at the least reminds us of important life lessons that must be taken to heart. After the dazzling s1 reviews, the hype for this onewas big and I am glad to say they delivered one more time! You wonder what plot points are included this time around and they are pretty much the same as the story starts off exactly where we left off in s1. Since few new arcs are included, much of the 1st half are light toned comedic filler-esque episodes but they help fix one of the problems from s1 and that\u2019s character development of the other students. These characters get their backstory to help fully understand them and the other teachers have their own little romance going! I found Professor Bitch very funny this time around! Even though the story progression is slow, it has so much heart to it hence connecting with the audience on a more personal level! It does fall to a more comical side with that trip to s**** but it more than makes up for it with its perfectly timed humour that delivers many LOL moments! \\n\r\nThe clash between class A and class E is further explored and plays more within the main arc. Both classes showcased the different ethics they possessed, thus representing the different teaching styles of their respected teachers. This arc brought both humour and drama to the table, from the way how the exam scenes were portrayed to the rivalry and relationship between Korosensei and the principal. In fact, my favourite character development was of the principal! He wasn\u2019t just a generic bad guy! I hated him in s1 but after understanding his backstory, I felt nothing but sympathy for him and was glad when he started reverting to his old self. And we finally get our backstory on Korosensei! He looks handsome with all that hair! :D Korosensei once again had the best moments of the series and we finally get a look behind the curtain for this octopus creature! Nope for this human! I was craving for it since s1 and the reveal was satisfying! The other main characters like Nagisa, Karma and Kaede are still the ones to get the most screen time which is key to this show and the build-up to the finale was beautifully realized. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED are still okay but much better than last time. I also enjoyed the art work more cause some background scenes were nicely portrayed. In addition, the action scenes were stellar, creating an intense and dangerous atmosphere and the sound effects pleasingly captured the nerve wrecking tension especially during that Nagisa vs Kamina fight! The dub voice acting for Korosensei is still my favourite! \\n\\n\r\nI had very minute problems with this season which can easily be rounded off to nit-picking! I liked/loved all the episodes and that\u2019s saying something! The laughter at the comedy, enjoyment at the action and overall satisfaction with those inspirational quotes makes this as one of the best anime out there! It sucks that this show doesn\u2019t get the same type of respect and recognition as the other anime\u2019s do! \\n\\n\r\n!!!!! CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS !!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe set up to the finale was well done because the ending is very emotional and sad! Korosensei reaches his inevitable end as foreshadowed from the beginning. He had grown so much on us that we all wanted him to live somehow but alas the student efforts to save him were in vain. Korosensei\u2019s death was well executed and I was happy they didn\u2019t miraculously bring him back for that would have spoiled the entire finale! Despite being a tearjerker moment, the anime doesn\u2019t end with that note! Rather you have another episode where you see how each of the students of class 3-E ends up after their graduation and that was wonderful to behold! Even if Korosensei no longer exists, his teachings will forever live in our hearts! Those lessons encouraged the kids to follow in their Sensei\u2019s footsteps as if Korosensei is giving part of himself to all of them! After all he wanted them to surpass even him for he wasn\u2019t perfect either. \\n\r\nThat was a nice touch with the students coming back to buy the property and preparing the classroom to its original condition for Nagisa to teach their later. Also, that image of Nagisa with Korosensei\u2019s coat was heart breaking! If they do want to carry on with another season, then I would like it to continue with Nagisa as a teacher rather than bringing Korosensei back!",

            "content": "Now that you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you have already watched Season 1. Season 2 starts questionable but ends with a BOOM, it's \u007fbetter than Season 1 in my eyes.\r\nThe first season raises a lot of questions concerning the single characters, especially Koro-Sensei. Season 2 does a great job at clearing up those. It answers most - if not all - questions there are. Furthermore, it also shows the past of a few other key characters which certainly explains their behaviour. Some of those are surprising and definitely good plot twists. Another strong point of the season is the right mix of seriousand comedic scenes. It starts out rather happily and turns more serious towards the end when the moment of the truth arises: What will happen in March? \u007fThe ending is a key element of any anime. And with that Assassination Classroom 2 does a great job at ending the show. It is heartwarming and will definitely tear you apart. I wouldn't be surprised if tears would fall from your eyes. But indeed, it is satisfying for the viewer and well chosen for sure. My only concern is that Nagisa didn't show up at the class meeting of the last scene.\\n\r\nMusicwise, this anime continues to amaze. It reuses a lot of good tracks of the first season which is a plus. Its art and animation continue to be superb. Just as in season 1, Assassination Classroom 2 does an exceptional job at developing the characters. Their bond evolves and every one of the class is part of the anime and thus part of the development. That is especially noticeable in one of the final scenes of the anime when Koro-Sensei does the last attendance check of the class. You know that all characters were involved well in the anime if you can connect with the characters. And I could, that's for sure. With almost every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAt last, I want to mention a part that I enjoyed but most people probably either didn't understand or just couldn't care less about it. It is the math problem in the final exam. Yes, you've heard right, mathematics. I myself do a lot of mathematics and I can confirm that it was a beautiful problem. Showing the two solutions was well done. Especially Karma's solution was brilliant. It's a problem that could very well be proposed as an easy olympiad problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enough about me blabbering about maths. Assassination Classroom is a masterpiece. And Koro-Sensei is the best teacher there is. So are his quotes.\\n\\n\r\nFun times are bound to end. ~Koro-Sensei",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe best professor who I have ever had the pleasure of learning from goes simply by the name of John.\r\nJohn is a complete character. With his long, scraggly beard and expletive-filled conversations, he taught me and my friends two very important life lessons: scratch your itch and quid pro quo.\r\n\u201cScratch your itch\u201d means to follow your dreams. You only have this one life, so you may as well make the most of it. I\u2019m scratching my itch by writing and becoming a writer I can be proud of.\r\n\u201cQuid pro quo\u201d means you have to putin the effort to get any results. So long as you are determined and willing and focused, success will follow. I apply these words to writing, too, having experienced firsthand what such effort brings.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom Second Season has also taught me words to live by: Moving at Mach speed will not solve all troubles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nClassroom begins almost immediately after where the first season left off. With the kidnapped kids saved and Koro-Sensei out of his protective bubble, the class finishes up their getaway and prepares to take down their teacher within the next handful of months \u2013 or face the Earth\u2019s imminent explosion.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the show, it\u2019s the only one doing the exploding, for it has as many problems (once again) as Koro-Sensei has tentacles.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest being the gross over-exaggeration of many of the events therein.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Nagisa\u2019s abusive mother goes from calm to insanely ballistic in less than second, making it difficult to take her tantrums seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe main-campus kids, after one tough study session, start foaming at the mouth, wanting to (in their words) kill the E-Class.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei\u2019s death scene is dragged out for as long as alienly possible for a finalized farewell, but it goes on for so long that time must have frozen. (Otherwise, the world would have ended due to overshooting their time.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother way to put it: Classroom has next to zero subtlety when it comes to its emotions, actions, and outcomes. And it can be seen all throughout this second season.\\n\\n\r\nA different, odder problem is the anime not capitalizing on Koro-Sensei\u2019s weaknesses. The ones that were constantly highlighted. While many of them were for fun, like him getting motion sickness (from the first season) or being a sucker for romance gossip, the vast majority do not get used against him. Not utilizing its Chekov Guns of sort.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime actually tries to go the save-Koro-sensei route which is beyond silly. They were trying to kill him for over thirty episodes and it is literally the plot of the show. The whole board a spaceship, fly it successfully to the space station, and threaten the people on board with bombs (to which the astronauts invite them to hang out) makes this entire arc that much more absurd.\\n\\n\r\nThere being a one-percent chance of Koro-Sensei blowing up (or potentially and slowly dwindling away years from now) even if they do save him \u2013 meaning it\u2019s not an absolute cure \u2013 makes it even worse: pointless.\\n\\n\r\nYes, they are kids who do not want their teacher to die after everything he has done for all of them. But when the premise, direction, and events are each geared towards assassinating him, and saving him becomes an idea (and even a possibility) near the last leg (tentacle) of the series, it makes little sense to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnd getting back to Koro-Sensei\u2019s death scene, the way the class kills him does not even follow the whole premise of the show. They were supposed to assassinate Koro-Sensei since that\u2019s what they were trained to do (let alone \u201cassassination\u201d being in the title of the show).\\n\\n\r\nBut no. Instead, he gets very tired from fighting the new Reaper and resurrecting Kayano, and they all just sit on him and strike a dagger through his heart. (A couple of his weaknesses that the class actually does take advantage of.)\\n\\n\r\nThese issues are the most notable. Smaller problems also add up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having assassinations and aliens, the anime chooses to have a (similar) repeat of the exam arc.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the kids\u2019 apprehension at attacking Koro-Sensei when opportunities arise, such as when Itona is being used to lure out Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire save-versus-kill survival game mini-arc halted progress of the plot without adding much to it (no matter how divisive the class had become).\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei essentially beating the new (powered-up) Reaper with a beam made of his feelings produces a shake of the head and not a holler of triumph.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of harping has gone on up to this point, so it would be unfair to not list some positives. For there are a few. \u201cFew\u201d not \u201cmany.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nClassroom does follow-up on some characters and events from the previous season: the romance between Irina and Karasuma, the man in white (who happens to be Kotarou, the researcher who turned Koro-Sensei into who he is), the teenager that Nagisa duped near the end of the first season. Following through on these threads demonstrates that the anime did have a vision in mind moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe daycare-helping episode was nice and easily the strongest of the season. The comedy of the kids putting way too much thought and detail into the renovations was smart. Having the kids take a step back and realize that their newfound skills do not permit them to be overly careless and arrogant provided a new perspective. Slyly introducing Reaper into the equation was a good plot point.\\n\\n\r\nKayano\u2019s twist was surprising (in a good way). While Classroom technically could have done this surprise with any of its characters, it was an interesting and unpredictable way of going after Koro-Sensei once more and segueing into Koro-Sensei\u2019s backstory.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the show\u2019s best feature is that it actually finishes. The anime completes its story, going so far as to provide a small epilogue to bring as much closure as possible to the tale that was told. This detail seems obvious (since any well-crafted story will finish), but, considering the medium\u2019s penchant for incomplete tales, it\u2019s welcoming to see this nearly fifty-episode long experience fully come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this second season has more negatives than positives, so the narrative ends up subpar overall.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNot much can be said about Classroom\u2019s art and animation that was not already brought up last season, for, as expected, both areas remain mostly the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe kids still go to their out-of-the-way building. The detail of the backgrounds is still only marginal at best. And the animation remains roughly similar: lots of phasing and movement whenever Koro-Sensei takes the lead or when the kids are doing their assassination-esque duties, not as much nuance during downtime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the anime does make a couple of nice additions to the character-design department. Koro-Sensei shows off a brand-new color \u2013 black for absolute anger \u2013 and Irina\u2019s extremely attractive casual outfit: a turtle-neck sweater, an unkempt ponytail, and a long, red skirt. Otherwise, the character designs, too, maintain their same level of quality. In this case, a high level of quality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nClassroom, same as before, has a lot of characters. One may even say a whole classroom\u2019s worth.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Yukiko and Manami, got their spotlight in the first season, so their presence (and those similar to them) is not felt all that much. That\u2019s fine because, as was just written, they have already been given attention.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Takuya and Masayoshi, receive more on the characteristic side. Takuya\u2019s family runs a ramen shop, and Masayoshi\u2019s name means \u201cJustice.\u201d Once again, other characters of this kind can be seen throughout the show which, once again (again), is fine since the anime is at least trying to showcase as many of the students as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Yuuma and Asano, get a little bit more. Parts or even whole episodes aim at their \u201cwhat a guy\u201d nature or how he values strength not through domination but through demonstration. Either way, it helps to make these characters feel that much more developed or, at the minimum, more meaningful to Classroom beyond only being related to food and nicknames.\\n\\n\r\nThese categorizations cover a large majority of the cast, and, clearly, the show targeted as many of them as time would allow even if that means most of them are neither deep nor intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters not apart of the majority must therefore do the heavy lifting. The question is, do they?\\n\\n\r\nIrina is a character that arguably gets a lot of time (relative to the others). She gets her own mini-arc (shared a bit with the new Reaper), her background story is slightly visualized, and her conflict of not feeling as though she belonged in the world of safety and fun with the students fits her character well since she has often been an outsider of sorts (beautiful beyond compare, a seasoned veteran, a coarse nickname).\\n\\n\r\nThe resolution to her character being that she comes back more relaxed than ever, as well as ending up in a romantic relationship with Karasuma, ends her on as high of a note as possible. (Even if the second half of the season barely has her around.)\\n\\n\r\nGakuhou, the evil principal and Asano\u2019s father, also gets much-needed backstory. Surprisingly, he used to teach at the same building that Koro-Sensei does now, doing his best to impart fun and wisdom on his meager class. Unfortunately, after one of his students commits suicide after being bullied at school (after graduating from Gakuhou\u2019s class), he abandons his teaching philosophies entirely, favoring rigorous ideals and unwavering arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the student\u2019s death is tragic, going the complete opposite way in character is quite the shift. Especially when his two other students went on to lead successful lives despite their own (unseen) hardships.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Gakuhou\u2019s (new) way of teaching is one that Koro-Sensei does not support but recognizes. For while their methods may differ, their aims are the same: give their students the tools to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when Koro-Sensei bests Gakuhou at his own game, the psychotic man finally eases up ever-so-slightly, indicating that even a person as staunch as Gakuhou could be influenced by the yellow alien.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, as the pseudo-main-character, has his path laid out for him as well. He discovers a small love for teaching while working at the nursery. He realizes the gap between his strength and that of the seasoned-veteran Reaper. He \u201cbeats\u201d Karma in a one-on-one duel, solidifying his spot as the best assassin as well as his relationship with the red-haired troublemaker.\\n\\n\r\nKayano as well. She unveils her tentacle secret as well as the connection she shares with her older sister \u2013 who, in turn, shared a connection with Koro-Sensei (before he became Koro-Sensei). Her acting ability allowed her to pretend to be somebody she wasn\u2019t, and she endured agonizing pain every single day in the hopes of attacking and killing Koro-Sensei, demonstrating her fierce hatred of the man who (she presumed) murdered her sister.\\n\\n\r\nLike how Nagisa chooses to become a teacher instead of an assassin, Kayano, too, chooses the better of the two routes by forgiving Koro-Sensei and apologizing for her actions. Granted, both Nagisa and Kayano are not extensive characters, but they still have some change throughout (however small).\\n\\n\r\nThis all leads to the final, most important character: Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first season\u2019s biggest flaws was opting to ignore anything on Koro-Sensei. Maybe one half-second flashback was shown, but nothing remotely worthwhile about him was given. Thankfully, in this second season, Classroom corrects this error by dedicating an entire episode to Koro-Sensei\u2019s backstory and hence his character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a mess.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it was called \u201cbackstory,\u201d what is given is more like a quick recap. For Koro-Sensei\u2019s childhood, growth, and life in general is never fully shown. Instead, it\u2019s glossed over and assumed that he becomes the best assassin alive \u2013 known simply as the Reaper.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without any actual backstory to go off of for him, it places his character in a weak spot for what follows: namely, captivity at the hands of the researchers. For without knowing about his experiences, ideas, and motivations other than \u201che is really good at killing,\u201d the show makes it very difficult to resonate with him.\\n\\n\r\nThen in walks Kayano\u2019s older sister, Aguri. The setup itself is nice. He\u2019s the trapped, charming assassin, she\u2019s the optimistic, odd-shirt wearing lab assistant, and the two slowly start to fall for one another. However, their \u201cmoments\u201d together can be counted on a couple of fingers, and they were not exactly romantic given the giant glass wall that separated them.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that pre-Koro-Sensei still has nothing meaningful backing his character, meaning it is hard to gauge what this relationship means for him as a person.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, he does seem to have feelings for Aguri. \u201cSeem\u201d because, once he begins to escape the facility, he quickly pushes her away, telling her that she\u2019s \u201cnot even worth taking hostage.\u201d Which makes his sudden reversal later, after her death, weird to see. He liked her, then he didn\u2019t care for her, and then he liked her again. Wishy-washy writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s how Koro-Sensei came to be. Aguri\u2019s death sparked him to lead her class to victory as well as turning him into the happy-go-lucky alien. All in all, not very riveting which, considering that Koro-Sensei\u2019s past is arguably the most important piece of information in the series, makes this mishandling of his character arguably the worst offense of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNear the end, during the final-boss fight, Classroom tries (and fails) to make up some ground by throwing in the twist that the white-robed villain was Kotarou, the researcher that mutated Koro-Sensei, and that his lackey was the new Reaper who, in turn, was once Koro-Sensei\u2019s pupil.\\n\\n\r\nBut Kotarou\u2019s goal of revenge rings hollow since it was a part of Koro-Sensei\u2019s weak background, and the new Reaper\u2019s relationship with Koro-Sensei is only given as fast flashbacks that lack importance (even if one of them involved Koro-Sensei killing the new Reaper\u2019s father and another showed the new Reaper getting Koro-Sensei captured).\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei\u2019s actual character is a bust, but the wisdom he imparts is not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the series as a whole, what he did and what he taught was certainly unorthodox. After all, not many kids can say they learned in school how to handle knives and stalk their prey. But the beauty of it, like most knowledge that is taught, is that it can be used elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei did teach them the \u201cbasics\u201d to killing. But he also taught them how to help others. How to have confidence. How to simply reach their greatest potential through their own means.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Koro-Sensei did not just teach them some skills.\\n\\n\r\nHe taught them how to be themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to answer the question posed earlier, a lot of the characters did do some heavy lifting. And while Koro-Sensei was mishandled, what he did is something that even the audience can appreciate and is definitely worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP of Classroom comes out strong with switching between male and female singers, a level beat, the \u201cQuestion\u201d lyrical segment, and a groovy guitar. The second OP is not as interesting, but its catchy-guitar riff and its slightly somber tone help to make it at least a competent piece to lead off the episodes in the second half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is very reminiscent of the first season\u2019s ED. And, while it does not live up to that one\u2019s splendor, this new ED\u2019s relaxation and sincerity contrast well with the show\u2019s craziness and assassinations. The second ED follows a similar sentiment but is even more sincere. Given what goes down, and how the series itself comes to an end, it\u2019s a fitting and heartfelt way to send off the anime (even if the song itself is nothing too special).\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST (and as it was with the art and animation) sticks with what the first one provided. Comedy tracks for when Koro-Sensei acts ridiculous, ominous tracks when the new Reaper intimidates the students, and dramatic tracks for when the class goes through their roll-call.\\n\\n\r\nAnd although the voice-acting performances are (yet again) nothing superb, Jun Fukuyama at the minimum deserves another shout-out for continuing his Koro-Sensei-related mannerisms and vocal cues.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThose that have read my review of the first season know that I was most certainly not a fan of it. This second season did not change my mind. Arguably, it made me dislike the whole series even more.\\n\\n\r\nI could not stand the whole \u201cclap in their face\u201d ability. I shook my head at how much the show tried pushing this super-cool-and-effective technique that was literally just putting one\u2019s hands together. And it was carried all the way until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI was also peeved that the anime chickened out on the romance angle. Nagisa\u2019s bold move being excused as just utilizing his assassination toolkit was already lame, but then the anime, after the time-skip, had to bury any chances of him and Kayano getting together by her just not caring about the possibility since Nagisa is doing his own thing or some similar silliness.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei continued being an annoying blob. His doofy laugh, his unfunny overreactions, and his near infallibility grated on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime even had a lot less of one of my favorite characters: Ritsu. She had some moments, like when she officiated in her police outfit during the cops-and-robbers game or when she was hacked which caused her to become extremely lazy and irritable. But she was not around nearly enough for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nI did like Irina once again. If only because she was so attractive in her new design and because her getting lovesick was funny to see. And, admittedly, I got a teeny tiny bit emotional during Koro-Sensei\u2019s death scene despite how dragged out it was.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the other drama is lame, the villains are laughable, the characters are bland, and the action is boring, this second season ends up as a unentertaining experience.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom Second Season does not get a passing grade. The story finishes and the cast gets attention here and there, but the poor writing decisions, Koro-Sensei\u2019s weak background, and the annoying content make quid pro quo an unequal trade in this situation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while flashes of strength can be found, the narrative lacks any subtlety, mires itself in silly plot choices, and even goes against its own premise\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay artistic direction, okay actual animation, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while Koro-Sensei\u2019s character is mishandled yet again, the attention given to the supporting cast as well as their theme on gaining more beyond the \u201cbasics\u201d makes the cast at least passable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, \u201cclapping\u201d induced eye rolling, Koro-Sensei is annoying again, and Irina\u2019s attractiveness can only do so much\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

I actually started watching this because I got spoiled for a quite important plot point and I wanted to know how that came to be, and somehow knowing it would happen made it all the moresatisfying when things finally started making sense. And I'm sure that rewatching the first season will be a lot more fun now that I have answers to the questions that were raised back in the first episode, and I will also be able to appreciate the very first episodes so much more now that I know that each of them is meant to teach a lesson.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I watched the two seasons back-to-back and while I did notice some changes in the art style overall, mostly in the character designs, it wasn't anything drastic, which isn't a bad thing, because I really loved how the first season looked. I will say though that here they had more opportunities to really make the art stand out, especially in the second half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Like most of the things in this show, the voice acting and music are above average in general but they really stand out in the second half. For starters, the second opening theme is one of the few anime opening themes to make me cry despite being such an upbeat song. I also really loved the first opening theme, and while I didn't much care for the ending songs, this show features what might possibly be my favourite anime insert song like.... ever.... Apart from that I didn't really notice too many of the songs used in the background, but that might just be because the serious tone of this season required a much more low-key OST. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the voice acting, which was incredible before but now it's just absolutely outstanding. Again, thanks to the more serious tone of this season the voice actors really had the opportunity to show their talent, especially in the second to last episode, which might feature some of my favourite voice acting to date. (another special shoutout to Jun Fukuyama for being able to make me cry with two words.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Unfortunately in this season the majority of the focus is centered on the same characters it was in the first season, which might be due to having to adapt such a large number of manga chapters in just 47 episodes, but the standout characters are handled with such care it's hard for me to complain about it. We get backstories and development and realistic character relationships, and even the antagonists get their fair share of screentime, so much so that it never feels like anyone is evil just for the sake of it. My only problem in this section is the way Irina's character is handled, especially during the Reaper arc, but apparently that arc is longer in the manga so that might change my perspective on it. Other than that, this show has my favourite mentor figure in all of anime, and also possibly the most terrifying antagonist I've come across.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I flew through it so fast, there was never a dull moment and I felt incredibly sad whenever I had to stop watching for whatever reason, however I'm not sure sobbing non-stop during the last four the episodes counts as 'enjoyment'. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I get attached to fictional characters very easily, and yet no piece of media has ever made me this emotional before. Thanks to that it has automatically become my favourite anime of all time. As for recommending it, well, if you liked the first season and you like having your heart ripped out in the most brutal way imaginable, this is the show for you. It will probably resonate with you if you have any sort of strong feelings towards education and educators (be they negative or positive) or even if you don't have any such feelings, it's worth watching just for Koro-sensei as a character.\\n\\n\\n",

A unique story with loads of humor and unlike the first season a bit more serious. The story gets better and you get better understanding for the characters. The enjoyment stays the same (Which is very good). As for now when this show is most likely done, i am layin gin my bed crying missing the charters and wonder what to do with my life now... just as a normal person does after completing a really good anime. Overall this showis a really good time, and you really do feel with the characters. This show made me feel a lot. It was lightheaded at start and one of the most enjoyable anime's i have ever seen. The passion, the commitment and specially the bond that the students share with their teacher is something that i cannot explain with words. I loved this anime form the bottom of my heart, and if you are reading this i am sure you are considering to watch it... Take my advice! Do it you won't regret it. It's rare for me to be this entertained by a show. Sorry if it was not the best review it's my first however for me to write this review is just because i felt i CANNOT simply drop this anime i need to help it grow. I NEED TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS \"THE\" ANIME TO WATCH! #nuruhuhu\\n\\n",

The first season makes the entire thing seem like a pure comedy anime , but anyone who has finished both seasons will know this is not the case. The second season is absolutely amazing , just as you think you know how the anime will end there are 2 huge twists in the story. All of the questions are answered in season 2. Assassination Classroom also has very little filler. When a certain activity or situation does take up an entire episode , it is always for a very good reason or important tothe story. Do not watch season 2 without having seen season 1 , It will have little to no impact on you and you will probably be quite confused. With 47 episodes in season 1 and 2 in total , the length is perfect. It fits every detail in without falling short and without having a ridiculous amount of episodes. Korosensei's lessons are at times mind blowing and the ending to season 2 is the best anime ending I have ever seen .",

I was bored and I'd barely had any time to watch tv lately, but I'd grown so bored just doing work all the time that I looked for animes with semi-interesting summaries so I could work and simultaneously kinda listen/watch while I did. \r\nIt was supposed to be something I just kinda glanced at now and then. It turned out to be so much more. \r\nThe first season was pretty good. I spent more time on my ships and appreciating Kuro-sensei's lessons, the works. But this season... it's beyond perfect. Thereare some animes that are way too dark, some with too much fanservice, some with overpowered main characters; etc, etc. But this strikes a perfect balance. \\n\\n\r\nThere's the action, there's the shipping, there's the morals and lessons and teamwork and cool strengths and sad scenes and cute scenes and comedy and parts where I wasn't to rip my heart out. Overall, if you have time to watch something that doesn't put you in one of *those* permanent moods, this'll be a good fit for you. I can already tell which parts I'm going to rewatch until the end of time and which ones I can't bear to because I WILL cry, no doubt about it. \\n\\n\r\nI found the filler episodes to be fulfilling as well. They all linked back to the plot somehow and each and every incident had some meaning in the end. Overall, a very, very, very well written and produced anime, and I have to say that I didn't expect this at all. \\n\\n\r\nI went for background noise and I got a show that tore up my heart. Bravo.",

Wanna feel mentally destructed yet ascend to mind at peace?  Well search longer not! This anime provides more than needed.\r\nEven though I was never the one to read mangas, I must say that I do enjoy animes. And this one is by far the most entertaining ( of course what is best changes on my mood), but as for now, it is.\r\nAs for story, it was by my view flawless. It didn't lack plot development. It was keeping at an amazingpace, which made every episode interesting. The studio didn't overdevelop side stories. And that pretty much sums it. The anime simply had a wonderful story.\\n\r\nBut then I am actually not a judging type, and I am unexperienced with norms of anime. Nonetheless flawless in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI myself don't know much about art, but for me it was very pleasant to look at. I just never had a time where I had to stop, because of unnatural movement of a body...\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in this anime was amazing. It matched every moment, but I had hoped for more feels striking, If ya know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters played a very big part in this one. I've never seen so much character development. And they always made a logical decision so, if you have experienced it, you don't have to scream WHY! every moment in this anime. Though since I am a romantic sort of guy I had really hoped for some yknow romantic development, though not dissapointed. Just my taste that's all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for enjoyment, I loved every second that I could spend watching this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I don't think I will ever miss my sleep nor the preparation to my school. I felt really tired but never have I smiled so much and cried so much at one same moment. I still remember friends asking me why the heck am I smirking. And I simly replied Life is beautiful, let's value every moment. That's something trivial, but a friendly reminder from this anime was more than heart touching.",

Karma looks great for example but that suits him\\n\r\nalso the combats and the especial effects are over the roof, paying attention to the details after watching this for the fifth time each combat is well thought \\n\r\ni love what they do with the eyes of some characters as they are about to engage on combat or prove some points right\\n\\n\r\nSound-9- \"Tabidachi no Uta\" i'm just saying that, don't look it up on youtube you may get MANY spoilers so please don't\\n\r\nand i feel like the sound crew did a good job picking each sound of each moment #approved\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10 Prepare your jaws to drop when watching this season because oh boy oh boy, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! finally an anime that isn't 400 episodes long (or that isn't Tokyo Ghoul) and has INSANE character development and i'm not even focused on the main character, I literally mean ALMOST everyone! Koro sensei is also my favorite anime character of all time the jokes, the advice, how much he cares for his students the happy moments the sad moments he's been through, watching him brings me joy\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10? really? cant it go higher because i want to give this 100/10\\n\r\nI've never laughed so hard, smiled so much, and cried so bad during an anime, all those points, Clannad may have shattered my heart, but this anime broke it, I've seen some reviews and they cite how sad some moments in this anime are so i'm not giving away any sort of spoilers, there are going to be some sad moments\\n\\n\r\nOverall-11 best anime 10/1 would watch again for the 6th time i have never felt so many emotions at once\\n",

            "content": "AP classes, or Advanced Placement Classes are a kind of challenge that students put themselves through in order to show that they're the best of the best or much higher level than the rest.  These courses are much faster than their 'less advanced' counterparts, have much more material to them, and are usually less fun.  So why do I make this analogy?  Well, if AssClass S1 is a standard course, AssClass S2 is an AP course.  Case in point, onto the lecture as to why this show isn't as good as people may say it is.\r\nStory: Continuing off from the firstseason, the story of AssClass S2 as stated from its release, that the rest of the manga would be finishing up in this one 2-cour series.  It's a finished series, start to finish, nothing really left behind.  Sounds good, right?  Well, here's the problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the manga is about 180 or so chapters.  Season 1 of the series adapted around 60 or so chapters with 2 cours to complete said chapters.  Season 2 on the the other hand has the same runtime of 2 cours but adapts 120 chapters instead.  Using simple math, this season is adapts around twice as much material as its first season counterpart.  So, what's the point of this simple math equation?  Well, the answer to that is the simple fact that this season is HORRENDOUSLY rushed.  Due to the fact that this one season had to adapt about twice as much material as the first season, the content that we're shown has a lot of problems.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem that this adaptation shows us is the fact that none or very few of the given arcs that we're shown actually sink in.  Many portions of the anime have character development for a certain side character that is integral to the series that falls flat due to the fact that the show speeds through their portion of the series in 1-2 episodes without very much detail.  We're given just the outline of what happens to the character rather than the full essay that makes us even give a damn.  As a result, the development feels stagnated and forced, being practically just thrown in there to make the audience care instead of easing into each arc and telling the story at an even pace.  The pacing also affects several other parts of the anime, but I'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of the pacing, how does this the middle and end of the story compare to its beginning?  Well, it's a B- at best.  While the show does give us some pretty worthwhile arcs that not only give development to characters that we otherwise would've though to be worth spiting than liking, as well as some rather heartwarming moments, the show doesn't keep very much consistency in quality.  Due to its rather short runtime for a series with so much content, Lerche prioritized certain parts of the series and left others to hang back, thus creating this gap of importance that felt unfair.  Not only that, but the series loses quite a lot of its luster at the end of the series with some rather...unfavorable arcs that just seemed downright stupid for this series.  (Cue the random-ass Space Plot)  Plus that final fight was probably the most uneventful fight in the entire series and it was just a big disappointment all around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, AssClass S2 is a mixed bag of positives and negatives with more C's than A's.  Its pacing throws a lot of the content and characterization that the story has out the window, focusing solely on the progress of its title character, Koro-Sensei rather than the focused side-plots that aided in progressing the story.  Its pacing leaves far too much to be desired, but It has an extremely nice and heartwarming last few episodes and great lessons that really makes the series come together in a nice, wrapped bow.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Finishes the series\\n\r\n+ Characterization for many of its arcs\\n\r\n+ Heartfelt ending\\n\r\n-  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE pacing\\n\r\n-  Characterization feels forced and uneven\\n\r\n-  More of an outline than an actual story\\n\r\n-  Some pretty bad arcs, particularly at the beginning and end areas\\n\r\n-  Disappointing climax moment\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters are probably the other biggest hit in quality when it comes to the impact of pacing, which once again, really hampered this series from becoming as great as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nKoro Sensei, the title character of the series.  The majority of this season in particular is centered around Koro Sensei.  Not only do we get to see more of his impact as a character and what he does to help the other characters that are around him, but we also get to see more of him as a character.  Since the series is about killing this overpowered octopus man, pretty much everything that this season has to offer is revolved around him and his teaching policies.  The series puts a lot of attachment to the character and despite its terrible pacing, really does shine through at times and makes those moments all the more sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Class 3-E.  My problem with season 1 came at the fact that the series just sort of characterized the ENTIRE CLASS as one character.  Due to the manga having an abundance of chapters that focused solely on one member of the class, each character, or at least a great deal of them, felt more like individuals rather than one whole group.  Similar to its S1 predecessor, this season doesn't really do a good job in the way of making each class member seem unique and just sorta lumps them all together with the exception of our protagonist, Nagisa who we follow the POV of, and Kaede who...well, let's just say she's a character who gets an entire arc to herself.  Though for the most part, the rest of the class are just background characters that have some unusual quirks here and there.  I doubt anyone can remember more than 10 of the 29 or so class members.  Hell, I can't even do it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for side characters, we have a group of recurring and new additions to the side cast.  Now, one thing that makes this side cast so much better than the majority of other side casts is the one fact that everyone in this side cast has value, or at least has a dedicated arc to them that adds more to the series.  They all have some sort of worth, probably even more worth than the majority of Class 3-E, and that makes them not only memorable, but more important in the grand scheme of things.  However, there are a few strange motives amidst some of the 'antagonist' related characters and that doctor guy just really...didn't do anything.  (If you've seen the series, you'll know who I'm referring to.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Koro-sensei is a great character\\n\r\n+ Characterization for some protagonist and especially for the side cast\\n\r\n-  Some strange motives for some antagonist characters\\n\r\n-  Class 3-E felt like a lumped up group rather than a group of individual characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Lerche, the art for Assassination Classroom S2 is the same style and quality that the first season has.  It has this light and bright style that has this really unique contrast that could be both bright and cheerful but also brooding and dark at the same time, which is really commendable due to how quickly the series contrasted between fun and cheerful with serious and dark.  Akin to the manga, the show also uses a lot of symbolism or motifs to represent certain parts or characters of the series to better bring its point across which I personally always appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nOne special mention that I want to point out is the design for the female Class 3-E military uniforms.  Lerche changed the design of the female outfits when adapting the series by losing the open midriff area that the girls had to show off their curves in black clothing and instead lengthening their jacket to cover up that area.  While many people probably never noticed or probably never cared, I personally really like this change because with all of the combat that goes on in this series, having that extra layer of protection on an area that has been noted in many anime and shows for being notoriously hard to heal back or recover from really helps protect these middle school assassins a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nFor comedic moments, the show used more exaggerated appearances more than anything else to bring home its more cheerful and fun moments in the series.  Aside from that, there really isn't much else.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Unique and extremely flexible artstyle\\n\r\n+  Usage of symbolism\\n\r\n+/- Rather bland comedic stylings\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OPs for this season...really don't stand out.  They're two songs that don't really sound much different from one to the other and I personally didn't care for them all too much because of how meh and similar they sounded.  They were like the first season's OPs in terms of styling and I'm honestly quite surprised how similar all four of them sounded to each other cause it's just the Class 3-E seiyuus singing a rock tune.\\n\\n\r\nFor ED's, the first one doesn't really come out to me all that well.  It's gentle and nice, but it doesn't really feel or seem all that memorable or special.  This second ED however, is by far the best track that the series has had from start to finish.  Known as \"Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi\", this song is a gentle and calm ballad that evokes and capitalizes on the overall connection with Koro-sensei that Class 3-E has.  It's sounds very heartfelt and with where in the series that it was placed (which was ep. 15-25), it's easily the most memorable song that this soundtrack has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Memorable and fantastic second ED\\n\r\n-  Rest of the tracks fall flat\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: As someone who has read the AssClass manga start to finish, this adaptation really grinded my gears for many reasons.  And yes, it may seem like everything that has been said up till now has been biased because you may be thinking \"Oh, he read the manga, he knows everything that happens and the manga is always better than the anime, neh\", but let me convince you otherwise.  Lerche did their best to adapt this series to the best of their ability.  They only had so many episodes and they had to finish the entire manga, so there was absolutely NO WAY that they would be able to cram in everything without leaving some things behind.  What they did was they took the main arcs or most influential parts of entire manga and adapted those to give us that ending feeling.  These problems were inherent and there was no way that this adaptation was going to go as well as it could've because of that.  That being said, onto the questions.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said in done, I would say my opinion towards this adaptation is average.  Despite all its flaws, Lerche managed to pull off a well-done adapted conclusion to the series that saved a lot of my personal salt that I had watching certain things get cut out due to the pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI'm just gonna say it, like I have many times over, pacing.  The only thing that has to be blamed for the failure of this adaptation is its pacing.  Having to make an adaptation with 2x the content in the same amount of time is an extremely tall order for any animation studio and as such, barely anything got the attention that they deserved and I really wished they did another season and give this story the attention it deserves, cause quite honestly, this adaptation missed out on A LOT of small details that had a decent amount of impact.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I would say to just read the manga.  As usual, the idea of 'The manga is always better' prevails yet again cause there's no time constraint and since the entire series is finished, you can read everything from start to finish without missing a single detail.  Though if you're lazy and would rather watch what happens instead, then I would say go right on ahead.  Personally, I would not say it is as good as many people say it is, but the adaptation does have merits, such as some favorite choice moments being animated, but it has its merits and unlike many adaptations, finishes up a rather well-made story that teaches us the joys of learning and killing.  C+ for this one, Lerche, C...+.",

            "content": "Well, if season one was good, this was just phenomenal. This fits the very definition of masterpiece. An ingeniously told story about the meaning of life, determination, and potential. Although it started off goofy, wacky and above all else comedic, it gradually evolved into a show that was so much more than a fun way to kill time.\r\nKoro-sensei\u2019s backstory was incredibly powerful. There had been some hints to it in the first season, but I definitely did not expect it to have the depth it did. My entire perspective of him changed \u2013 my understanding of his motivations, his personality, his struggles, his efforts inbecoming who he did \u2013 suffice to say he\u2019s now one of my favourite characters. I\u2019d even say he\u2019s a contender for first place. \\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Koro-sensei who was developed. Nagisa, Asano, Itona and Isogai all got their own place in the spotlight (Isogai\u2019s episode in particular was a great showcase of his abilities as a leader). In fact, every character in class 3-E got their own time to shine. The sense of camaraderie from the first season reached its pinnacle here; by the end of the series you could clearly see how much the entire class cared for each other. They started out as a bunch of oddballs, by the end they had become a cohesive (and deadly) unit.  I couldn\u2019t help getting drawn in to their struggles and celebrating their triumphs. I loved each and every character by the end. Even the bad guys; that\u2019s how well they were depicted.\\n\\n\r\nOne who especially deserves mention, though, is Kayano. I mentioned in my season one review that I had really been expecting more from a character who was so heavily featured in all the opening themes and treated as an MC, when in reality she was hardly shown at all. Boy did I eat my words in season 2. Now I see why she was so important, and just how cleverly the anime was put together. Kayano really was a major focal point of the show \u2013 even though we only see it in season 2, it underlay the entire anime. I can\u2019t go into more detail than this because it would cause major spoilers, so if you\u2019re curious you\u2019ll have to go watch it yourself. \ud83d\ude0a \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the anime changed so much throughout the season. It became altogether more serious, and explored far deeper themes than in the first season. Koro-Sensei\u2019s advice was always mature and profound, which sometimes seemed weird coming from a character who himself stated his main purpose was comic relief. Honestly though, I think anyone who\u2019s seen this anime should try and take away a few lessons from it. We could all do with a teacher like Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nDo not give up on this anime before the ending. The entire story builds up to this climax, and personally I don\u2019t think it could have been handled better. (Besides the space episode that is. That one was just stupid). But I was sobbing by the end \u2013 me, who didn\u2019t even cry at Clannad After Story \u2013 totally full of emotion. I think I felt as proud of those kids as Koro-Sensei did.\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of those fantastic rides that at times I wished would never end. I can\u2019t praise it enough. If you liked season one or are just trying to decide whether to give this series a go, then ask yourself: Do you want to watch an anime that is comedic yet deep, nonsensical yet clever, and inspiring enough to make you want to change who you are? If the answer is yes, then you know what to do. XD\\n",

            "content": "Probably some spoilers, sorry:\r\nArt (9)/Sound (8): I really don't get it when people say the animation of this show isn't good. Most of the time, the art style looks awesome and is incredibly appealing. And when the animation  needs to be awesome, it is. Koro-sensei's tentacles look awesome when they need to, and the stylized character designs lend themselves to a wide variety of expressions and emotions for the characters to display. The sound is pretty good. Both EDs are kinda sad and slow (not very fitting for the tone of most of the show) but are a great foreshadowing for the later partsof the show. Both OPs are pretty good, though I way prefer the second to the first. The ENG dub isn't very good. Most of the characters feel miscast (except Koro-sensei, who is hilariously played by the same guy who played Hughes in FMA). But the JP dub is pretty awesome. The voice actors do a good job of getting the character's emotions and personalities across. Karma's voice is the best in my opinion. Though, I'm probably biased because I love Karma. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9): I have to say, that the story definitely gets better as the season goes. It starts pretty much exactly where the last one left off, then jumps back into it's episodic format after the whole Itona conflict. I'd say the story gets awesome again at about episode 14. Not that it's bad before that. The structure of the show usually lends itself to occasional serious and intense stories interjected with light and fun episodic stories. None of these episodic stories are necessarily bad, it's just the parts where the story is really allowed to shine are the best. And that is episode 14. \\n\r\nAfter this episode, the story is pretty awesome for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): The characters have pretty much always been my favorite part of Assassination Classroom. Karma reigning as the king. I LOVE KARMA. Which is probably one of the reasons I like this season more than the last one. Karma is given a lot more screen time, and an entire mini-arc is dedicated to his relationship with Nagisa. Probably my favorite three episodes the ENTIRE SERIES. OMG! These episodes are amazing. It shows just how well they know each other. That hesitation that Nagisa shows at the end of their fight, because he knows how tricky Karma is, how Karma doesn't take his opportunity to beat Nagisa because he knows he wouldn't listen if he beat him that way. It adds new layers to their relationship and shows how close they really were before they drifted apart. OMG! I love this mini-arc! But Karma and Nagisa aren't the only good characters. Koro-sensei is as awesome as always. Kaede gets her own little mini-arc. And I still love Sugino. Though not all the characters are created equal. Not many of them get major focus, which is sad, but the ones who do are amazing.\\n",

            "content": "Oh Koro-sensei, He wasn't just teaching his students new things, he taught us fans new things too, even if we didn't realize it. Among-st the many things Koro-Sensei taught us, was how to laugh, learn & develop, always make room to improve, be inspired, challenge yourself, and most importantly use your full potential! \r\nDuring the shows first season I was not interested in the anime nor manga. I felt that the story was absolutely ridiculous and a complete  waste of time reading/watching. It wasn't until 2013 that I saw \"Funny moments\" or \"best moments\" in anime videos on Youtube and saw Assassination classroom onit and thought to myself, \"ha, this does look pretty funny\" \"I'll try any show once\", gave it a watch and was for the most part blown away.. like the moon...  (Puns intended.)My favorite thing about the story and plot is that it connected to me, the viewer on a personal level.  I could relate to how most of the characters backstories in E classroom were treated at school. For the most part, mainly towards the ending of the season 2 I felt that the build up towards the final episode were very well executed... or should I say.. assassinated.. wait, I don't think that  word works.. whatever. The begining of the season 2  has ups and downs however for the most part, it remains pretty solid. I don't want to use the term \"roller-coaster\" but I think I will use that to describe it. For example, 1-4 episodes will be about the daily lives of certain students, or the students working on something unrelated to the story. It felt more like filler episodes for the most part.  Now for the second part season 2 the backstories about certain characters past and the history of class E finally begin to unfold. We are introduced to more characters and both shocking, and sudden plot developments, as to be expected. For the most part each arc of season 2 is all over the place and honesty, I felt it lacked a sensible amount of balance. The plot for certain episodes can feel a bit confusing at times because one second the students are honing their skills then next episode they are helping re-build a shelter. So balance does seem to be a reoccurring problem within the story-line. Overall I l was generally impressed with the story, I believe that Y\u016bsei Matsui did an amazing job with his work and that Lerche did an amazing job following the work.\\n\\n\r\nNumber one thing that annoyed me about the series overall is that  the animation or lighting in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, even without the show being censored it's really dark. There are multiple moments in the show where areas are unnecessarily darkened to the point where I actually start questioning myself \"This is the uncensored or raw version right?\" The background settings looked poorly done so maybe that's why the animators decided to use darkness in multiple scenes. Character designs still remain the same so I do not have much to add to the subject. I felt like the artwork, especially the background settings needed to be re-done. I hope to see whoever is in charge of editing the Blu-Ray discs, brightens things up.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't anything to special, I don't want to say lackluster however most of the times I'd be watching an action scenes I didn't feel like the music playing enhanced the situations(s) occurring on screen. I also didn't care for both opening songs and the latest ending song Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi by Shion Miyawaki. The ending song from PT 1 was my only favorite track. Seiyuu's are always amazing in this show. Of course my main man, a hundred grams, N*gga's just don't understand, Jun Fukuyama reprises his role as the lovable and somewhat admirable Koro sensei. Perhaps my favorite thing that Jun does with Koro sensei is his laugh. Every time I hear \"Nyeh heh heh heh heh\" or \"Nyu fu fufu fu\" I burst out laughing too.  Nagisa, Karma, I really liked that their voice actors went through good lengths of studying English so they could speak it properly for certain episodes. While Karma's actor Nobuhiko English sounded a bit \"broken\" I did however like that Nagisa's voice actor Mai\\n\r\nFuchigami was able to enunciate or pronounce English better. Everyone else did a great job with their roles and I think that Ansatsu Kyoushi has one of the best cast of voice actors for an anime series. Each of the actors are able to express a good amount of feeling with their characters in order to make their characters feel more... realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the most vital part of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. The main focus for all characters in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is growth & development. These  two things  are literally the key in what makes this series work out so great. As to be expected of course, during the beginning of the series season 1 until the ending, the characters are lacking strength, potential, and skill. My favorite thing about the series characters is that I felt like I got to experience growth along with the students, and the teachers in this series. The way the characters react  when they learn new things or acquire a new skill, because I felt so involved while watching it made me feel like I learned something new too. For example, if Koro-sensei is speaking directly to the students about studying for an exam and he's giving them both words of advice and encouragement then I, the viewer am also receiving some sort of acknowledgement too. Another thing about the characters is that they're all made to be either relate-able and or likable. That way viewers like me feel like they are on the same level as the characters in the show. Out of all departments listed from the \"rate the anime\" category I would say that characters are my most favorite thing about the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and pleasure is always experienced while I'm watching Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I don't think for a second I've ever been truly unsatisfied with an episode. I have to give the series some praise because for 25 episodes and not a single one for me to dislike, I think that's amazing. I think to myself, even while writing this, \"hmmm, I know there has to be at least one episode I hate\" but I just cannot think of a single episode. Overall I was very satisfied with Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I think although it may not have been the best of the current season it still stood out enough to earn the 4th spot in my top 5 airing the spring season. 9/10 for a memorable and joyful experience.",

            "content": "The sad fact of life is that all good things must eventually come to an end, and that includes whatever school year might have actually been fun for you. Thus, Class 3-E - the only class that teaches assassination - must come to an end, as well, whether the world goes down with it or not. In this season of Assassination Classroom, we get to see how it all ends, making it one of those anime that is actually a full adaptation of the original manga. When I watched the first season last year, I enjoyed it a whole lot; that was more than enoughto get me to watch the second season when it came out. Needless to say, this season was even better.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, tentacles all over (yes, I'm saying that again), here is my review of Assassination Classroom Second/Final Season.\\n\\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with Assassination Classroom, it centers around Class 3-E, which is considered to be the lowest class in Kunugigaoka Junior High (and gets poor treatment from both teachers and students because of it). They end up getting a new teacher, which is a huge, yellow, octopus-like thing capable of Mach 20 speed and, as it is said, mass destruction; you see, he is apparently responsible for the recent destruction of the moon. He claims to be destroying Earth next in a year, but first, he wants to teach Class 3-E. Thus, Class 3-E is given the assignment of killing this thing, now named Koro-sensei, by graduation, and they will earn the 10 billion yen bounty on his head if he does so. Needless to say, Koro-sensei proves to be an excellent teacher to the students by not only teaching them the regular school subjects and assassination, but also life lessons.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Assassination Classroom picks up from where it left off, and boy, does it get great from there! A few parts of the story in this season feel a little rushed, but it was certainly never boring! It provided a lot of character development for each character in this series, even some of the ones that started out unlikable. For example, the principal of Kunugigaoka Junior High, Asano, starts off as someone with a heart of stone, but when you get to see his backstory, you start to sympathize with him even a little bit. Speaking of backstories, Koro-sensei's backstory is finally revealed in this season, as well, and while trying not to give too much away.... man, is it intense!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in season two of AssClass (still amused by this abbreviation) is pretty much the same as in season one, seeing that it's still Lerche animating it, so there really isn't much for me to say here. It's still well-done animation that especially stands out in the easy-to-get-into action scenes. The Japanese voice acting for this season is pretty good, too. Now, as for the music, I honestly thought that both the opening and ending themes of this season left more of an impact than the opening and ending themes of the first. I especially liked \"Bye-Bye Yesterday\", the second opening theme; it's really sad that this anime is ending, and this opening really made me feel the impact of its upcoming end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I did enjoy season one of Assassination Classroom, season two was even better. If anyone has seen season one and wants to know how it ends, you'd better watch this. I'm personally looking forward to seeing more of these interesting characters in the spin-off, Koro-sensei Q, but for now, we must say goodbye as Class 3-E graduates from their assassination classroom.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n--------------\r\n\"The journey is the reward\" - Steve Jobs\r\nIn some cases, plot armor works to help the anime. Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is one of these rare examples. Sure, we know what's going to happen. Sure, it's the greatest moment when the entire show builds to it's climax and then it explodes into a colorful rainbow of nostalgia and emotion. But it can't wash away all the screw ups of the show in the past, right?\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nThankfully, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu rarely screws up, but even if it had, most of it would have been forgotten with the climax to top all climaxes. Ansatsugets most of it's praise from how unique it is, and I won't argue with that. It's a very strange concept that almost makes you forget it's a shonen at points. ALMOST. Being a shonen isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. It just means that it's prone to the flaws of shonen - arcs that are inferior to others. Again, Ansatsu pretty much blows that out of the water though. None of the arcs are inferior to others, which I feel even works against it at a point, when the final arc was just as exhilarating as one from the halfway point. And, most of the arcs follow a common pattern in shonen - bad guy shows up, minor struggle, you beat him, the next bad guy shows up, slightly larger struggle, you beat him, boss shows up, big struggle, you beat him, recovery episode. Which brings me to the ending. From the very beginning, straight out of episode one, you had been waiting for the death of Koro-sensei. The moment was just as filled with sadness as everyone had predicted, it wasn't surprising at all. But looking in the episode discussion, you don't find anybody complaining, even the manga readers were impressed with how well it was handled. In conclusion, Ansatsu is creative, but not quite groundbreaking.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLerche isn't a very famous studio, and even if you had heard of them before, it probably wasn't for their mind boggling animation and more likely for their screw up of Daganronpa. When the original season first aired the animation was still pretty mediocre, but it hasn't improved since then, and the animation around it has, which has made it even more underwhelming. Both the art and animation are bad.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme screams average to me. It sounds like I've heard it before, kind of thing. The endings are slightly better but still, 99% of people won't care to remember or even listen. But every once and a while, there is an theme song that completely outclasses the rest, the one people remember the show for. Bye Bye Yesterday is one of the three openings I've listened to so many times in a row I got tired of it. Usually it's one or two, but with this one it was probably 20 - 30. That's insane. Actually, I'm amazed I was able to, writing that down. It may seem unbelievable, but it was THAT good to me. The soundtrack gets completely ignored because most of the openings aren't spectacular, which is such a shame because the innovative soundtrack is one of the show's best features. Some of it feels a little out of place, like it should be in a mystery show, but it's still great nonetheless. The average sound effects are made up for by the highly praised seiyuu that voice the characters. Koro-sensei and Karma, in particular, are voices that I could put to the face blindfolded. Ansatsu has it's ups and downs in the sound department.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nReally, Koro-sensei is the only character that I felt was good. He works really well as the series mascot, but if that wasn't enough, he was also hard not to love. Despite this, I can see why others consider him to be annoying. The other main character, Nagisa, is pretty average for a main character. Acts-weak-but-is-actually-the-best-in-the-class kind of thing. As for the supporting cast... well, this is why Ansatsu is so praised. All of them get their own little development arc, which seemed forced to me. On top of that, the characters really are just templates, design and personality-wise. Just because the show does a good job at featuring them all doesn't necessarily make them good characters. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu is definitely show that was meant to for you to not expect anything at all, and then take the viewer by surprise. Did it take you by surprise? Or did you like it anyway? Feel free to comment on my profile and tell me what I did wrong with this review, I'm always up for feedback. Thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "After finishing the first season, I started to question the direction of the story. It had its moments and the comedy was fairly good, but I wasn\u2019t overall very impressed with it. The assassination premise is presented in a colourful and fun manner that it tends to take lightly of its consequences. It glorifies that assassination serves as a way for fellow assassins to create bonds and promote self-improvement. I can\u2019t help but see it as a flaw, given that I\u2019m already used to seinen titles that explore the world of assassination in detail and it\u2019s definitely not all fun and games. The dynamic betweenClass E and Koro-sensei is great but the latter still remains a mystery. Little is known about his background and motives. They are all complaints I had but things start to get more interesting as the second season started rolling in. \\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the second season is graduation. We all know that feeling, sharing fun moments with your fellow classmates inside the classroom. But, you know that they will all come to an end in the inevitable future. Fitting that into the pre-established setting, it unexpectedly works well. Who would have thought that the show can manage to promote that sense of sentimentality despite its assassination theme as each characters reflect on how they have progressed so far. Assassination is taken more seriously now, since it starts to slowly sink in that they will have to kill Koro-sensei eventually and that time is running out, making it an interesting conflict of emotions. Questions are posed such as \u201cWhat does it really mean to kill?\u201d and \u201cIs there any other way around it?\u201d The fun approach towards it is still there, but it\u2019s toned down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes full-force with the sentimentalities of graduation but it tends to breeze past its pre-existing issues such as the education system and the involvement of the government and other external agencies in relation to killing Koro-sensei. It\u2019s a shame that they were never really tackled and explored well while certain episodes are wasted on school activities that has little to do with the ongoing story. It does enhance the reoccurring theme but they feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts to unfold Koro-sensei\u2019s past and makes his motives clear to everyone which is a good thing since that was what often bugs me while watching the previous season. The character development among the cast is starting to be more apparent. The gravity of the situation is starting to get into them and we get to see how they plan to cope up with it even if the situation is over. It\u2019s like being anxious not being to be able to graduate, and the only way for that to happen is to pass the final exam. That final exam is Koro-sensei. He has been with the cast from the start. Despite being an assassination target, everyone becomes attached to him in a way. This further adds up to the sentimentality. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you found the previous season somewhat lacking, then this sequel will somewhat remedies that. It doesn\u2019t resolve every single issue, but it manages to conclude the main story well that leaves you quite the emotional impact. \\n",

CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS !!!!!\r\nAll good things must come to an end and the end has finally come! You hear many fans complain about wanting a teacher like Korosensei but my answer to such request is that we already have our own Korosensei! That\u2019s the beauty of this story and character where Korosensei doesn\u2019t act as a teacher for just class 3-E but also for all its viewers! Just like s1 he teaches or at the least reminds us of important life lessons that must be taken to heart. After the dazzling s1 reviews, the hype for this onewas big and I am glad to say they delivered one more time! You wonder what plot points are included this time around and they are pretty much the same as the story starts off exactly where we left off in s1. Since few new arcs are included, much of the 1st half are light toned comedic filler-esque episodes but they help fix one of the problems from s1 and that\u2019s character development of the other students. These characters get their backstory to help fully understand them and the other teachers have their own little romance going! I found Professor Bitch very funny this time around! Even though the story progression is slow, it has so much heart to it hence connecting with the audience on a more personal level! It does fall to a more comical side with that trip to s**** but it more than makes up for it with its perfectly timed humour that delivers many LOL moments! \\n\r\nThe clash between class A and class E is further explored and plays more within the main arc. Both classes showcased the different ethics they possessed, thus representing the different teaching styles of their respected teachers. This arc brought both humour and drama to the table, from the way how the exam scenes were portrayed to the rivalry and relationship between Korosensei and the principal. In fact, my favourite character development was of the principal! He wasn\u2019t just a generic bad guy! I hated him in s1 but after understanding his backstory, I felt nothing but sympathy for him and was glad when he started reverting to his old self. And we finally get our backstory on Korosensei! He looks handsome with all that hair! :D Korosensei once again had the best moments of the series and we finally get a look behind the curtain for this octopus creature! Nope for this human! I was craving for it since s1 and the reveal was satisfying! The other main characters like Nagisa, Karma and Kaede are still the ones to get the most screen time which is key to this show and the build-up to the finale was beautifully realized. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED are still okay but much better than last time. I also enjoyed the art work more cause some background scenes were nicely portrayed. In addition, the action scenes were stellar, creating an intense and dangerous atmosphere and the sound effects pleasingly captured the nerve wrecking tension especially during that Nagisa vs Kamina fight! The dub voice acting for Korosensei is still my favourite! \\n\\n\r\nI had very minute problems with this season which can easily be rounded off to nit-picking! I liked/loved all the episodes and that\u2019s saying something! The laughter at the comedy, enjoyment at the action and overall satisfaction with those inspirational quotes makes this as one of the best anime out there! It sucks that this show doesn\u2019t get the same type of respect and recognition as the other anime\u2019s do! \\n\\n\r\n!!!!! CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS !!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe set up to the finale was well done because the ending is very emotional and sad! Korosensei reaches his inevitable end as foreshadowed from the beginning. He had grown so much on us that we all wanted him to live somehow but alas the student efforts to save him were in vain. Korosensei\u2019s death was well executed and I was happy they didn\u2019t miraculously bring him back for that would have spoiled the entire finale! Despite being a tearjerker moment, the anime doesn\u2019t end with that note! Rather you have another episode where you see how each of the students of class 3-E ends up after their graduation and that was wonderful to behold! Even if Korosensei no longer exists, his teachings will forever live in our hearts! Those lessons encouraged the kids to follow in their Sensei\u2019s footsteps as if Korosensei is giving part of himself to all of them! After all he wanted them to surpass even him for he wasn\u2019t perfect either. \\n\r\nThat was a nice touch with the students coming back to buy the property and preparing the classroom to its original condition for Nagisa to teach their later. Also, that image of Nagisa with Korosensei\u2019s coat was heart breaking! If they do want to carry on with another season, then I would like it to continue with Nagisa as a teacher rather than bringing Korosensei back!",

Season 2 starts questionable but ends with a BOOM, it's \u007fbetter than Season 1 in my eyes.\r\nThe first season raises a lot of questions concerning the single characters, especially Koro-Sensei. Season 2 does a great job at clearing up those. It answers most - if not all - questions there are. Furthermore, it also shows the past of a few other key characters which certainly explains their behaviour. Some of those are surprising and definitely good plot twists. Another strong point of the season is the right mix of seriousand comedic scenes. It starts out rather happily and turns more serious towards the end when the moment of the truth arises: What will happen in March? \u007fThe ending is a key element of any anime. And with that Assassination Classroom 2 does a great job at ending the show. It is heartwarming and will definitely tear you apart. I wouldn't be surprised if tears would fall from your eyes. But indeed, it is satisfying for the viewer and well chosen for sure. My only concern is that Nagisa didn't show up at the class meeting of the last scene.\\n\r\nMusicwise, this anime continues to amaze. It reuses a lot of good tracks of the first season which is a plus. Its art and animation continue to be superb. Just as in season 1, Assassination Classroom 2 does an exceptional job at developing the characters. Their bond evolves and every one of the class is part of the anime and thus part of the development. That is especially noticeable in one of the final scenes of the anime when Koro-Sensei does the last attendance check of the class. You know that all characters were involved well in the anime if you can connect with the characters. And I could, that's for sure. With almost every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAt last, I want to mention a part that I enjoyed but most people probably either didn't understand or just couldn't care less about it. It is the math problem in the final exam. Yes, you've heard right, mathematics. I myself do a lot of mathematics and I can confirm that it was a beautiful problem. Showing the two solutions was well done. Especially Karma's solution was brilliant. It's a problem that could very well be proposed as an easy olympiad problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enough about me blabbering about maths. Assassination Classroom is a masterpiece. And Koro-Sensei is the best teacher there is. So are his quotes.\\n\\n\r\nFun times are bound to end. ~Koro-Sensei",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe best professor who I have ever had the pleasure of learning from goes simply by the name of John.\r\nJohn is a complete character. With his long, scraggly beard and expletive-filled conversations, he taught me and my friends two very important life lessons: scratch your itch and quid pro quo.\r\n\u201cScratch your itch\u201d means to follow your dreams. You only have this one life, so you may as well make the most of it. I\u2019m scratching my itch by writing and becoming a writer I can be proud of.\r\n\u201cQuid pro quo\u201d means you have to putin the effort to get any results. So long as you are determined and willing and focused, success will follow. I apply these words to writing, too, having experienced firsthand what such effort brings.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom Second Season has also taught me words to live by: Moving at Mach speed will not solve all troubles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nClassroom begins almost immediately after where the first season left off. With the kidnapped kids saved and Koro-Sensei out of his protective bubble, the class finishes up their getaway and prepares to take down their teacher within the next handful of months \u2013 or face the Earth\u2019s imminent explosion.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the show, it\u2019s the only one doing the exploding, for it has as many problems (once again) as Koro-Sensei has tentacles.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest being the gross over-exaggeration of many of the events therein.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Nagisa\u2019s abusive mother goes from calm to insanely ballistic in less than second, making it difficult to take her tantrums seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe main-campus kids, after one tough study session, start foaming at the mouth, wanting to (in their words) kill the E-Class.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei\u2019s death scene is dragged out for as long as alienly possible for a finalized farewell, but it goes on for so long that time must have frozen. (Otherwise, the world would have ended due to overshooting their time.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother way to put it: Classroom has next to zero subtlety when it comes to its emotions, actions, and outcomes. And it can be seen all throughout this second season.\\n\\n\r\nA different, odder problem is the anime not capitalizing on Koro-Sensei\u2019s weaknesses. The ones that were constantly highlighted. While many of them were for fun, like him getting motion sickness (from the first season) or being a sucker for romance gossip, the vast majority do not get used against him. Not utilizing its Chekov Guns of sort.\\n\\n\r\nThen the anime actually tries to go the save-Koro-sensei route which is beyond silly. They were trying to kill him for over thirty episodes and it is literally the plot of the show. The whole board a spaceship, fly it successfully to the space station, and threaten the people on board with bombs (to which the astronauts invite them to hang out) makes this entire arc that much more absurd.\\n\\n\r\nThere being a one-percent chance of Koro-Sensei blowing up (or potentially and slowly dwindling away years from now) even if they do save him \u2013 meaning it\u2019s not an absolute cure \u2013 makes it even worse: pointless.\\n\\n\r\nYes, they are kids who do not want their teacher to die after everything he has done for all of them. But when the premise, direction, and events are each geared towards assassinating him, and saving him becomes an idea (and even a possibility) near the last leg (tentacle) of the series, it makes little sense to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnd getting back to Koro-Sensei\u2019s death scene, the way the class kills him does not even follow the whole premise of the show. They were supposed to assassinate Koro-Sensei since that\u2019s what they were trained to do (let alone \u201cassassination\u201d being in the title of the show).\\n\\n\r\nBut no. Instead, he gets very tired from fighting the new Reaper and resurrecting Kayano, and they all just sit on him and strike a dagger through his heart. (A couple of his weaknesses that the class actually does take advantage of.)\\n\\n\r\nThese issues are the most notable. Smaller problems also add up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having assassinations and aliens, the anime chooses to have a (similar) repeat of the exam arc.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the kids\u2019 apprehension at attacking Koro-Sensei when opportunities arise, such as when Itona is being used to lure out Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire save-versus-kill survival game mini-arc halted progress of the plot without adding much to it (no matter how divisive the class had become).\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei essentially beating the new (powered-up) Reaper with a beam made of his feelings produces a shake of the head and not a holler of triumph.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of harping has gone on up to this point, so it would be unfair to not list some positives. For there are a few. \u201cFew\u201d not \u201cmany.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nClassroom does follow-up on some characters and events from the previous season: the romance between Irina and Karasuma, the man in white (who happens to be Kotarou, the researcher who turned Koro-Sensei into who he is), the teenager that Nagisa duped near the end of the first season. Following through on these threads demonstrates that the anime did have a vision in mind moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe daycare-helping episode was nice and easily the strongest of the season. The comedy of the kids putting way too much thought and detail into the renovations was smart. Having the kids take a step back and realize that their newfound skills do not permit them to be overly careless and arrogant provided a new perspective. Slyly introducing Reaper into the equation was a good plot point.\\n\\n\r\nKayano\u2019s twist was surprising (in a good way). While Classroom technically could have done this surprise with any of its characters, it was an interesting and unpredictable way of going after Koro-Sensei once more and segueing into Koro-Sensei\u2019s backstory.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the show\u2019s best feature is that it actually finishes. The anime completes its story, going so far as to provide a small epilogue to bring as much closure as possible to the tale that was told. This detail seems obvious (since any well-crafted story will finish), but, considering the medium\u2019s penchant for incomplete tales, it\u2019s welcoming to see this nearly fifty-episode long experience fully come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this second season has more negatives than positives, so the narrative ends up subpar overall.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNot much can be said about Classroom\u2019s art and animation that was not already brought up last season, for, as expected, both areas remain mostly the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe kids still go to their out-of-the-way building. The detail of the backgrounds is still only marginal at best. And the animation remains roughly similar: lots of phasing and movement whenever Koro-Sensei takes the lead or when the kids are doing their assassination-esque duties, not as much nuance during downtime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the anime does make a couple of nice additions to the character-design department. Koro-Sensei shows off a brand-new color \u2013 black for absolute anger \u2013 and Irina\u2019s extremely attractive casual outfit: a turtle-neck sweater, an unkempt ponytail, and a long, red skirt. Otherwise, the character designs, too, maintain their same level of quality. In this case, a high level of quality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nClassroom, same as before, has a lot of characters. One may even say a whole classroom\u2019s worth.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Yukiko and Manami, got their spotlight in the first season, so their presence (and those similar to them) is not felt all that much. That\u2019s fine because, as was just written, they have already been given attention.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Takuya and Masayoshi, receive more on the characteristic side. Takuya\u2019s family runs a ramen shop, and Masayoshi\u2019s name means \u201cJustice.\u201d Once again, other characters of this kind can be seen throughout the show which, once again (again), is fine since the anime is at least trying to showcase as many of the students as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSome, like Yuuma and Asano, get a little bit more. Parts or even whole episodes aim at their \u201cwhat a guy\u201d nature or how he values strength not through domination but through demonstration. Either way, it helps to make these characters feel that much more developed or, at the minimum, more meaningful to Classroom beyond only being related to food and nicknames.\\n\\n\r\nThese categorizations cover a large majority of the cast, and, clearly, the show targeted as many of them as time would allow even if that means most of them are neither deep nor intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters not apart of the majority must therefore do the heavy lifting. The question is, do they?\\n\\n\r\nIrina is a character that arguably gets a lot of time (relative to the others). She gets her own mini-arc (shared a bit with the new Reaper), her background story is slightly visualized, and her conflict of not feeling as though she belonged in the world of safety and fun with the students fits her character well since she has often been an outsider of sorts (beautiful beyond compare, a seasoned veteran, a coarse nickname).\\n\\n\r\nThe resolution to her character being that she comes back more relaxed than ever, as well as ending up in a romantic relationship with Karasuma, ends her on as high of a note as possible. (Even if the second half of the season barely has her around.)\\n\\n\r\nGakuhou, the evil principal and Asano\u2019s father, also gets much-needed backstory. Surprisingly, he used to teach at the same building that Koro-Sensei does now, doing his best to impart fun and wisdom on his meager class. Unfortunately, after one of his students commits suicide after being bullied at school (after graduating from Gakuhou\u2019s class), he abandons his teaching philosophies entirely, favoring rigorous ideals and unwavering arrogance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the student\u2019s death is tragic, going the complete opposite way in character is quite the shift. Especially when his two other students went on to lead successful lives despite their own (unseen) hardships.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Gakuhou\u2019s (new) way of teaching is one that Koro-Sensei does not support but recognizes. For while their methods may differ, their aims are the same: give their students the tools to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when Koro-Sensei bests Gakuhou at his own game, the psychotic man finally eases up ever-so-slightly, indicating that even a person as staunch as Gakuhou could be influenced by the yellow alien.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, as the pseudo-main-character, has his path laid out for him as well. He discovers a small love for teaching while working at the nursery. He realizes the gap between his strength and that of the seasoned-veteran Reaper. He \u201cbeats\u201d Karma in a one-on-one duel, solidifying his spot as the best assassin as well as his relationship with the red-haired troublemaker.\\n\\n\r\nKayano as well. She unveils her tentacle secret as well as the connection she shares with her older sister \u2013 who, in turn, shared a connection with Koro-Sensei (before he became Koro-Sensei). Her acting ability allowed her to pretend to be somebody she wasn\u2019t, and she endured agonizing pain every single day in the hopes of attacking and killing Koro-Sensei, demonstrating her fierce hatred of the man who (she presumed) murdered her sister.\\n\\n\r\nLike how Nagisa chooses to become a teacher instead of an assassin, Kayano, too, chooses the better of the two routes by forgiving Koro-Sensei and apologizing for her actions. Granted, both Nagisa and Kayano are not extensive characters, but they still have some change throughout (however small).\\n\\n\r\nThis all leads to the final, most important character: Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first season\u2019s biggest flaws was opting to ignore anything on Koro-Sensei. Maybe one half-second flashback was shown, but nothing remotely worthwhile about him was given. Thankfully, in this second season, Classroom corrects this error by dedicating an entire episode to Koro-Sensei\u2019s backstory and hence his character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a mess.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it was called \u201cbackstory,\u201d what is given is more like a quick recap. For Koro-Sensei\u2019s childhood, growth, and life in general is never fully shown. Instead, it\u2019s glossed over and assumed that he becomes the best assassin alive \u2013 known simply as the Reaper.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without any actual backstory to go off of for him, it places his character in a weak spot for what follows: namely, captivity at the hands of the researchers. For without knowing about his experiences, ideas, and motivations other than \u201che is really good at killing,\u201d the show makes it very difficult to resonate with him.\\n\\n\r\nThen in walks Kayano\u2019s older sister, Aguri. The setup itself is nice. He\u2019s the trapped, charming assassin, she\u2019s the optimistic, odd-shirt wearing lab assistant, and the two slowly start to fall for one another. However, their \u201cmoments\u201d together can be counted on a couple of fingers, and they were not exactly romantic given the giant glass wall that separated them.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that pre-Koro-Sensei still has nothing meaningful backing his character, meaning it is hard to gauge what this relationship means for him as a person.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, he does seem to have feelings for Aguri. \u201cSeem\u201d because, once he begins to escape the facility, he quickly pushes her away, telling her that she\u2019s \u201cnot even worth taking hostage.\u201d Which makes his sudden reversal later, after her death, weird to see. He liked her, then he didn\u2019t care for her, and then he liked her again. Wishy-washy writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s how Koro-Sensei came to be. Aguri\u2019s death sparked him to lead her class to victory as well as turning him into the happy-go-lucky alien. All in all, not very riveting which, considering that Koro-Sensei\u2019s past is arguably the most important piece of information in the series, makes this mishandling of his character arguably the worst offense of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNear the end, during the final-boss fight, Classroom tries (and fails) to make up some ground by throwing in the twist that the white-robed villain was Kotarou, the researcher that mutated Koro-Sensei, and that his lackey was the new Reaper who, in turn, was once Koro-Sensei\u2019s pupil.\\n\\n\r\nBut Kotarou\u2019s goal of revenge rings hollow since it was a part of Koro-Sensei\u2019s weak background, and the new Reaper\u2019s relationship with Koro-Sensei is only given as fast flashbacks that lack importance (even if one of them involved Koro-Sensei killing the new Reaper\u2019s father and another showed the new Reaper getting Koro-Sensei captured).\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei\u2019s actual character is a bust, but the wisdom he imparts is not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the series as a whole, what he did and what he taught was certainly unorthodox. After all, not many kids can say they learned in school how to handle knives and stalk their prey. But the beauty of it, like most knowledge that is taught, is that it can be used elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei did teach them the \u201cbasics\u201d to killing. But he also taught them how to help others. How to have confidence. How to simply reach their greatest potential through their own means.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Koro-Sensei did not just teach them some skills.\\n\\n\r\nHe taught them how to be themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to answer the question posed earlier, a lot of the characters did do some heavy lifting. And while Koro-Sensei was mishandled, what he did is something that even the audience can appreciate and is definitely worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP of Classroom comes out strong with switching between male and female singers, a level beat, the \u201cQuestion\u201d lyrical segment, and a groovy guitar. The second OP is not as interesting, but its catchy-guitar riff and its slightly somber tone help to make it at least a competent piece to lead off the episodes in the second half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is very reminiscent of the first season\u2019s ED. And, while it does not live up to that one\u2019s splendor, this new ED\u2019s relaxation and sincerity contrast well with the show\u2019s craziness and assassinations. The second ED follows a similar sentiment but is even more sincere. Given what goes down, and how the series itself comes to an end, it\u2019s a fitting and heartfelt way to send off the anime (even if the song itself is nothing too special).\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the OST (and as it was with the art and animation) sticks with what the first one provided. Comedy tracks for when Koro-Sensei acts ridiculous, ominous tracks when the new Reaper intimidates the students, and dramatic tracks for when the class goes through their roll-call.\\n\\n\r\nAnd although the voice-acting performances are (yet again) nothing superb, Jun Fukuyama at the minimum deserves another shout-out for continuing his Koro-Sensei-related mannerisms and vocal cues.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThose that have read my review of the first season know that I was most certainly not a fan of it. This second season did not change my mind. Arguably, it made me dislike the whole series even more.\\n\\n\r\nI could not stand the whole \u201cclap in their face\u201d ability. I shook my head at how much the show tried pushing this super-cool-and-effective technique that was literally just putting one\u2019s hands together. And it was carried all the way until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI was also peeved that the anime chickened out on the romance angle. Nagisa\u2019s bold move being excused as just utilizing his assassination toolkit was already lame, but then the anime, after the time-skip, had to bury any chances of him and Kayano getting together by her just not caring about the possibility since Nagisa is doing his own thing or some similar silliness.\\n\\n\r\nKoro-Sensei continued being an annoying blob. His doofy laugh, his unfunny overreactions, and his near infallibility grated on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime even had a lot less of one of my favorite characters: Ritsu. She had some moments, like when she officiated in her police outfit during the cops-and-robbers game or when she was hacked which caused her to become extremely lazy and irritable. But she was not around nearly enough for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nI did like Irina once again. If only because she was so attractive in her new design and because her getting lovesick was funny to see. And, admittedly, I got a teeny tiny bit emotional during Koro-Sensei\u2019s death scene despite how dragged out it was.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the other drama is lame, the villains are laughable, the characters are bland, and the action is boring, this second season ends up as a unentertaining experience.\\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom Second Season does not get a passing grade. The story finishes and the cast gets attention here and there, but the poor writing decisions, Koro-Sensei\u2019s weak background, and the annoying content make quid pro quo an unequal trade in this situation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while flashes of strength can be found, the narrative lacks any subtlety, mires itself in silly plot choices, and even goes against its own premise\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, okay artistic direction, okay actual animation, and nice character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, while Koro-Sensei\u2019s character is mishandled yet again, the attention given to the supporting cast as well as their theme on gaining more beyond the \u201cbasics\u201d makes the cast at least passable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, \u201cclapping\u201d induced eye rolling, Koro-Sensei is annoying again, and Irina\u2019s attractiveness can only do so much\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "I'm very conflicted about this anime, because on the one hand it is undoubtedly one of the best shows I've ever seen, but on the other hand it features both the most beautiful and most soul-crushing episode in existence.\r\nStory 10/10: It continues from where the first season left off, but the number of light-hearted episodes is drastically reduced and the overarching plot gets much more focus this time around. I actually started watching this because I got spoiled for a quite important plot point and I wanted to know how that came to be, and somehow knowing it would happen made it all the moresatisfying when things finally started making sense. And I'm sure that rewatching the first season will be a lot more fun now that I have answers to the questions that were raised back in the first episode, and I will also be able to appreciate the very first episodes so much more now that I know that each of them is meant to teach a lesson.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I watched the two seasons back-to-back and while I did notice some changes in the art style overall, mostly in the character designs, it wasn't anything drastic, which isn't a bad thing, because I really loved how the first season looked. I will say though that here they had more opportunities to really make the art stand out, especially in the second half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Like most of the things in this show, the voice acting and music are above average in general but they really stand out in the second half. For starters, the second opening theme is one of the few anime opening themes to make me cry despite being such an upbeat song. I also really loved the first opening theme, and while I didn't much care for the ending songs, this show features what might possibly be my favourite anime insert song like.... ever.... Apart from that I didn't really notice too many of the songs used in the background, but that might just be because the serious tone of this season required a much more low-key OST. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the voice acting, which was incredible before but now it's just absolutely outstanding. Again, thanks to the more serious tone of this season the voice actors really had the opportunity to show their talent, especially in the second to last episode, which might feature some of my favourite voice acting to date. (another special shoutout to Jun Fukuyama for being able to make me cry with two words.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Unfortunately in this season the majority of the focus is centered on the same characters it was in the first season, which might be due to having to adapt such a large number of manga chapters in just 47 episodes, but the standout characters are handled with such care it's hard for me to complain about it. We get backstories and development and realistic character relationships, and even the antagonists get their fair share of screentime, so much so that it never feels like anyone is evil just for the sake of it. My only problem in this section is the way Irina's character is handled, especially during the Reaper arc, but apparently that arc is longer in the manga so that might change my perspective on it. Other than that, this show has my favourite mentor figure in all of anime, and also possibly the most terrifying antagonist I've come across.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I flew through it so fast, there was never a dull moment and I felt incredibly sad whenever I had to stop watching for whatever reason, however I'm not sure sobbing non-stop during the last four the episodes counts as 'enjoyment'. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I get attached to fictional characters very easily, and yet no piece of media has ever made me this emotional before. Thanks to that it has automatically become my favourite anime of all time. As for recommending it, well, if you liked the first season and you like having your heart ripped out in the most brutal way imaginable, this is the show for you. It will probably resonate with you if you have any sort of strong feelings towards education and educators (be they negative or positive) or even if you don't have any such feelings, it's worth watching just for Koro-sensei as a character.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS HERE\r\n(This is my first review be gentle) ^_^\r\nHello, Let me start of with saying this series is a one of a kind. A unique story with loads of humor and unlike the first season a bit more serious. The story gets better and you get better understanding for the characters. The enjoyment stays the same (Which is very good). As for now when this show is most likely done, i am layin gin my bed crying missing the charters and wonder what to do with my life now... just as a normal person does after completing a really good anime. Overall this showis a really good time, and you really do feel with the characters. This show made me feel a lot. It was lightheaded at start and one of the most enjoyable anime's i have ever seen. The passion, the commitment and specially the bond that the students share with their teacher is something that i cannot explain with words. I loved this anime form the bottom of my heart, and if you are reading this i am sure you are considering to watch it... Take my advice! Do it you won't regret it. It's rare for me to be this entertained by a show. Sorry if it was not the best review it's my first however for me to write this review is just because i felt i CANNOT simply drop this anime i need to help it grow. I NEED TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS \"THE\" ANIME TO WATCH! #nuruhuhu\\n\\n",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom has now become my favourite anime of all time. The first season makes the entire thing seem like a pure comedy anime , but anyone who has finished both seasons will know this is not the case. The second season is absolutely amazing , just as you think you know how the anime will end there are 2 huge twists in the story. All of the questions are answered in season 2. Assassination Classroom also has very little filler. When a certain activity or situation does take up an entire episode , it is always for a very good reason or important tothe story. Do not watch season 2 without having seen season 1 , It will have little to no impact on you and you will probably be quite confused. With 47 episodes in season 1 and 2 in total , the length is perfect. It fits every detail in without falling short and without having a ridiculous amount of episodes. Korosensei's lessons are at times mind blowing and the ending to season 2 is the best anime ending I have ever seen .",

I was bored and I'd barely had any time to watch tv lately, but I'd grown so bored just doing work all the time that I looked for animes with semi-interesting summaries so I could work and simultaneously kinda listen/watch while I did. \r\nIt was supposed to be something I just kinda glanced at now and then. It turned out to be so much more. \r\nThe first season was pretty good. I spent more time on my ships and appreciating Kuro-sensei's lessons, the works. But this season... it's beyond perfect. Thereare some animes that are way too dark, some with too much fanservice, some with overpowered main characters; etc, etc. But this strikes a perfect balance. \\n\\n\r\nThere's the action, there's the shipping, there's the morals and lessons and teamwork and cool strengths and sad scenes and cute scenes and comedy and parts where I wasn't to rip my heart out. Overall, if you have time to watch something that doesn't put you in one of *those* permanent moods, this'll be a good fit for you. I can already tell which parts I'm going to rewatch until the end of time and which ones I can't bear to because I WILL cry, no doubt about it. \\n\\n\r\nI found the filler episodes to be fulfilling as well. They all linked back to the plot somehow and each and every incident had some meaning in the end. Overall, a very, very, very well written and produced anime, and I have to say that I didn't expect this at all. \\n\\n\r\nI went for background noise and I got a show that tore up my heart. Bravo.",

Wanna feel mentally destructed yet ascend to mind at peace?  Well search longer not! This anime provides more than needed.\r\nEven though I was never the one to read mangas, I must say that I do enjoy animes. And this one is by far the most entertaining ( of course what is best changes on my mood), but as for now, it is.\r\nAs for story, it was by my view flawless. It didn't lack plot development. It was keeping at an amazingpace, which made every episode interesting. The studio didn't overdevelop side stories. And that pretty much sums it. The anime simply had a wonderful story.\\n\r\nBut then I am actually not a judging type, and I am unexperienced with norms of anime. Nonetheless flawless in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI myself don't know much about art, but for me it was very pleasant to look at. I just never had a time where I had to stop, because of unnatural movement of a body...\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in this anime was amazing. It matched every moment, but I had hoped for more feels striking, If ya know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters played a very big part in this one. I've never seen so much character development. And they always made a logical decision so, if you have experienced it, you don't have to scream WHY! every moment in this anime. Though since I am a romantic sort of guy I had really hoped for some yknow romantic development, though not dissapointed. Just my taste that's all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for enjoyment, I loved every second that I could spend watching this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I don't think I will ever miss my sleep nor the preparation to my school. I felt really tired but never have I smiled so much and cried so much at one same moment. I still remember friends asking me why the heck am I smirking. And I simly replied Life is beautiful, let's value every moment. That's something trivial, but a friendly reminder from this anime was more than heart touching.",

Karma looks great for example but that suits him\\n\r\nalso the combats and the especial effects are over the roof, paying attention to the details after watching this for the fifth time each combat is well thought \\n\r\ni love what they do with the eyes of some characters as they are about to engage on combat or prove some points right\\n\\n\r\nSound-9- \"Tabidachi no Uta\" i'm just saying that, don't look it up on youtube you may get MANY spoilers so please don't\\n\r\nand i feel like the sound crew did a good job picking each sound of each moment #approved\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10 Prepare your jaws to drop when watching this season because oh boy oh boy, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! finally an anime that isn't 400 episodes long (or that isn't Tokyo Ghoul) and has INSANE character development and i'm not even focused on the main character, I literally mean ALMOST everyone! Koro sensei is also my favorite anime character of all time the jokes, the advice, how much he cares for his students the happy moments the sad moments he's been through, watching him brings me joy\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10? really? cant it go higher because i want to give this 100/10\\n\r\nI've never laughed so hard, smiled so much, and cried so bad during an anime, all those points, Clannad may have shattered my heart, but this anime broke it, I've seen some reviews and they cite how sad some moments in this anime are so i'm not giving away any sort of spoilers, there are going to be some sad moments\\n\\n\r\nOverall-11 best anime 10/1 would watch again for the 6th time i have never felt so many emotions at once\\n",

            "content": "AP classes, or Advanced Placement Classes are a kind of challenge that students put themselves through in order to show that they're the best of the best or much higher level than the rest.  These courses are much faster than their 'less advanced' counterparts, have much more material to them, and are usually less fun.  So why do I make this analogy?  Well, if AssClass S1 is a standard course, AssClass S2 is an AP course.  Case in point, onto the lecture as to why this show isn't as good as people may say it is.\r\nStory: Continuing off from the firstseason, the story of AssClass S2 as stated from its release, that the rest of the manga would be finishing up in this one 2-cour series.  It's a finished series, start to finish, nothing really left behind.  Sounds good, right?  Well, here's the problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the manga is about 180 or so chapters.  Season 1 of the series adapted around 60 or so chapters with 2 cours to complete said chapters.  Season 2 on the the other hand has the same runtime of 2 cours but adapts 120 chapters instead.  Using simple math, this season is adapts around twice as much material as its first season counterpart.  So, what's the point of this simple math equation?  Well, the answer to that is the simple fact that this season is HORRENDOUSLY rushed.  Due to the fact that this one season had to adapt about twice as much material as the first season, the content that we're shown has a lot of problems.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first problem that this adaptation shows us is the fact that none or very few of the given arcs that we're shown actually sink in.  Many portions of the anime have character development for a certain side character that is integral to the series that falls flat due to the fact that the show speeds through their portion of the series in 1-2 episodes without very much detail.  We're given just the outline of what happens to the character rather than the full essay that makes us even give a damn.  As a result, the development feels stagnated and forced, being practically just thrown in there to make the audience care instead of easing into each arc and telling the story at an even pace.  The pacing also affects several other parts of the anime, but I'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of the pacing, how does this the middle and end of the story compare to its beginning?  Well, it's a B- at best.  While the show does give us some pretty worthwhile arcs that not only give development to characters that we otherwise would've though to be worth spiting than liking, as well as some rather heartwarming moments, the show doesn't keep very much consistency in quality.  Due to its rather short runtime for a series with so much content, Lerche prioritized certain parts of the series and left others to hang back, thus creating this gap of importance that felt unfair.  Not only that, but the series loses quite a lot of its luster at the end of the series with some rather...unfavorable arcs that just seemed downright stupid for this series.  (Cue the random-ass Space Plot)  Plus that final fight was probably the most uneventful fight in the entire series and it was just a big disappointment all around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, AssClass S2 is a mixed bag of positives and negatives with more C's than A's.  Its pacing throws a lot of the content and characterization that the story has out the window, focusing solely on the progress of its title character, Koro-Sensei rather than the focused side-plots that aided in progressing the story.  Its pacing leaves far too much to be desired, but It has an extremely nice and heartwarming last few episodes and great lessons that really makes the series come together in a nice, wrapped bow.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Finishes the series\\n\r\n+ Characterization for many of its arcs\\n\r\n+ Heartfelt ending\\n\r\n-  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE pacing\\n\r\n-  Characterization feels forced and uneven\\n\r\n-  More of an outline than an actual story\\n\r\n-  Some pretty bad arcs, particularly at the beginning and end areas\\n\r\n-  Disappointing climax moment\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters are probably the other biggest hit in quality when it comes to the impact of pacing, which once again, really hampered this series from becoming as great as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nKoro Sensei, the title character of the series.  The majority of this season in particular is centered around Koro Sensei.  Not only do we get to see more of his impact as a character and what he does to help the other characters that are around him, but we also get to see more of him as a character.  Since the series is about killing this overpowered octopus man, pretty much everything that this season has to offer is revolved around him and his teaching policies.  The series puts a lot of attachment to the character and despite its terrible pacing, really does shine through at times and makes those moments all the more sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Class 3-E.  My problem with season 1 came at the fact that the series just sort of characterized the ENTIRE CLASS as one character.  Due to the manga having an abundance of chapters that focused solely on one member of the class, each character, or at least a great deal of them, felt more like individuals rather than one whole group.  Similar to its S1 predecessor, this season doesn't really do a good job in the way of making each class member seem unique and just sorta lumps them all together with the exception of our protagonist, Nagisa who we follow the POV of, and Kaede who...well, let's just say she's a character who gets an entire arc to herself.  Though for the most part, the rest of the class are just background characters that have some unusual quirks here and there.  I doubt anyone can remember more than 10 of the 29 or so class members.  Hell, I can't even do it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for side characters, we have a group of recurring and new additions to the side cast.  Now, one thing that makes this side cast so much better than the majority of other side casts is the one fact that everyone in this side cast has value, or at least has a dedicated arc to them that adds more to the series.  They all have some sort of worth, probably even more worth than the majority of Class 3-E, and that makes them not only memorable, but more important in the grand scheme of things.  However, there are a few strange motives amidst some of the 'antagonist' related characters and that doctor guy just really...didn't do anything.  (If you've seen the series, you'll know who I'm referring to.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Koro-sensei is a great character\\n\r\n+ Characterization for some protagonist and especially for the side cast\\n\r\n-  Some strange motives for some antagonist characters\\n\r\n-  Class 3-E felt like a lumped up group rather than a group of individual characters\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Lerche, the art for Assassination Classroom S2 is the same style and quality that the first season has.  It has this light and bright style that has this really unique contrast that could be both bright and cheerful but also brooding and dark at the same time, which is really commendable due to how quickly the series contrasted between fun and cheerful with serious and dark.  Akin to the manga, the show also uses a lot of symbolism or motifs to represent certain parts or characters of the series to better bring its point across which I personally always appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nOne special mention that I want to point out is the design for the female Class 3-E military uniforms.  Lerche changed the design of the female outfits when adapting the series by losing the open midriff area that the girls had to show off their curves in black clothing and instead lengthening their jacket to cover up that area.  While many people probably never noticed or probably never cared, I personally really like this change because with all of the combat that goes on in this series, having that extra layer of protection on an area that has been noted in many anime and shows for being notoriously hard to heal back or recover from really helps protect these middle school assassins a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nFor comedic moments, the show used more exaggerated appearances more than anything else to bring home its more cheerful and fun moments in the series.  Aside from that, there really isn't much else.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Unique and extremely flexible artstyle\\n\r\n+  Usage of symbolism\\n\r\n+/- Rather bland comedic stylings\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OPs for this season...really don't stand out.  They're two songs that don't really sound much different from one to the other and I personally didn't care for them all too much because of how meh and similar they sounded.  They were like the first season's OPs in terms of styling and I'm honestly quite surprised how similar all four of them sounded to each other cause it's just the Class 3-E seiyuus singing a rock tune.\\n\\n\r\nFor ED's, the first one doesn't really come out to me all that well.  It's gentle and nice, but it doesn't really feel or seem all that memorable or special.  This second ED however, is by far the best track that the series has had from start to finish.  Known as \"Mata Kimi ni Aeru Hi\", this song is a gentle and calm ballad that evokes and capitalizes on the overall connection with Koro-sensei that Class 3-E has.  It's sounds very heartfelt and with where in the series that it was placed (which was ep. 15-25), it's easily the most memorable song that this soundtrack has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Memorable and fantastic second ED\\n\r\n-  Rest of the tracks fall flat\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: As someone who has read the AssClass manga start to finish, this adaptation really grinded my gears for many reasons.  And yes, it may seem like everything that has been said up till now has been biased because you may be thinking \"Oh, he read the manga, he knows everything that happens and the manga is always better than the anime, neh\", but let me convince you otherwise.  Lerche did their best to adapt this series to the best of their ability.  They only had so many episodes and they had to finish the entire manga, so there was absolutely NO WAY that they would be able to cram in everything without leaving some things behind.  What they did was they took the main arcs or most influential parts of entire manga and adapted those to give us that ending feeling.  These problems were inherent and there was no way that this adaptation was going to go as well as it could've because of that.  That being said, onto the questions.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said in done, I would say my opinion towards this adaptation is average.  Despite all its flaws, Lerche managed to pull off a well-done adapted conclusion to the series that saved a lot of my personal salt that I had watching certain things get cut out due to the pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI'm just gonna say it, like I have many times over, pacing.  The only thing that has to be blamed for the failure of this adaptation is its pacing.  Having to make an adaptation with 2x the content in the same amount of time is an extremely tall order for any animation studio and as such, barely anything got the attention that they deserved and I really wished they did another season and give this story the attention it deserves, cause quite honestly, this adaptation missed out on A LOT of small details that had a decent amount of impact.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I would say to just read the manga.  As usual, the idea of 'The manga is always better' prevails yet again cause there's no time constraint and since the entire series is finished, you can read everything from start to finish without missing a single detail.  Though if you're lazy and would rather watch what happens instead, then I would say go right on ahead.  Personally, I would not say it is as good as many people say it is, but the adaptation does have merits, such as some favorite choice moments being animated, but it has its merits and unlike many adaptations, finishes up a rather well-made story that teaches us the joys of learning and killing.  C+ for this one, Lerche, C...+.",

The art in the anime is splendid as well and overall Ithoroughly enjoyed this wonderful piece of work.I highly recommend this to every anime lover and I am sure it won't disappoint you.",

            "content": "Well, if season one was good, this was just phenomenal. This fits the very definition of masterpiece. An ingeniously told story about the meaning of life, determination, and potential. Although it started off goofy, wacky and above all else comedic, it gradually evolved into a show that was so much more than a fun way to kill time.\r\nKoro-sensei\u2019s backstory was incredibly powerful. There had been some hints to it in the first season, but I definitely did not expect it to have the depth it did. My entire perspective of him changed \u2013 my understanding of his motivations, his personality, his struggles, his efforts inbecoming who he did \u2013 suffice to say he\u2019s now one of my favourite characters. I\u2019d even say he\u2019s a contender for first place. \\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Koro-sensei who was developed. Nagisa, Asano, Itona and Isogai all got their own place in the spotlight (Isogai\u2019s episode in particular was a great showcase of his abilities as a leader). In fact, every character in class 3-E got their own time to shine. The sense of camaraderie from the first season reached its pinnacle here; by the end of the series you could clearly see how much the entire class cared for each other. They started out as a bunch of oddballs, by the end they had become a cohesive (and deadly) unit.  I couldn\u2019t help getting drawn in to their struggles and celebrating their triumphs. I loved each and every character by the end. Even the bad guys; that\u2019s how well they were depicted.\\n\\n\r\nOne who especially deserves mention, though, is Kayano. I mentioned in my season one review that I had really been expecting more from a character who was so heavily featured in all the opening themes and treated as an MC, when in reality she was hardly shown at all. Boy did I eat my words in season 2. Now I see why she was so important, and just how cleverly the anime was put together. Kayano really was a major focal point of the show \u2013 even though we only see it in season 2, it underlay the entire anime. I can\u2019t go into more detail than this because it would cause major spoilers, so if you\u2019re curious you\u2019ll have to go watch it yourself. \ud83d\ude0a \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the anime changed so much throughout the season. It became altogether more serious, and explored far deeper themes than in the first season. Koro-Sensei\u2019s advice was always mature and profound, which sometimes seemed weird coming from a character who himself stated his main purpose was comic relief. Honestly though, I think anyone who\u2019s seen this anime should try and take away a few lessons from it. We could all do with a teacher like Koro-Sensei.\\n\\n\r\nDo not give up on this anime before the ending. The entire story builds up to this climax, and personally I don\u2019t think it could have been handled better. (Besides the space episode that is. That one was just stupid). But I was sobbing by the end \u2013 me, who didn\u2019t even cry at Clannad After Story \u2013 totally full of emotion. I think I felt as proud of those kids as Koro-Sensei did.\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of those fantastic rides that at times I wished would never end. I can\u2019t praise it enough. If you liked season one or are just trying to decide whether to give this series a go, then ask yourself: Do you want to watch an anime that is comedic yet deep, nonsensical yet clever, and inspiring enough to make you want to change who you are? If the answer is yes, then you know what to do. XD\\n",

            "content": "Probably some spoilers, sorry:\r\nArt (9)/Sound (8): I really don't get it when people say the animation of this show isn't good. Most of the time, the art style looks awesome and is incredibly appealing. And when the animation  needs to be awesome, it is. Koro-sensei's tentacles look awesome when they need to, and the stylized character designs lend themselves to a wide variety of expressions and emotions for the characters to display. The sound is pretty good. Both EDs are kinda sad and slow (not very fitting for the tone of most of the show) but are a great foreshadowing for the later partsof the show. Both OPs are pretty good, though I way prefer the second to the first. The ENG dub isn't very good. Most of the characters feel miscast (except Koro-sensei, who is hilariously played by the same guy who played Hughes in FMA). But the JP dub is pretty awesome. The voice actors do a good job of getting the character's emotions and personalities across. Karma's voice is the best in my opinion. Though, I'm probably biased because I love Karma. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9): I have to say, that the story definitely gets better as the season goes. It starts pretty much exactly where the last one left off, then jumps back into it's episodic format after the whole Itona conflict. I'd say the story gets awesome again at about episode 14. Not that it's bad before that. The structure of the show usually lends itself to occasional serious and intense stories interjected with light and fun episodic stories. None of these episodic stories are necessarily bad, it's just the parts where the story is really allowed to shine are the best. And that is episode 14. \\n\r\nAfter this episode, the story is pretty awesome for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): The characters have pretty much always been my favorite part of Assassination Classroom. Karma reigning as the king. I LOVE KARMA. Which is probably one of the reasons I like this season more than the last one. Karma is given a lot more screen time, and an entire mini-arc is dedicated to his relationship with Nagisa. Probably my favorite three episodes the ENTIRE SERIES. OMG! These episodes are amazing. It shows just how well they know each other. That hesitation that Nagisa shows at the end of their fight, because he knows how tricky Karma is, how Karma doesn't take his opportunity to beat Nagisa because he knows he wouldn't listen if he beat him that way. It adds new layers to their relationship and shows how close they really were before they drifted apart. OMG! I love this mini-arc! But Karma and Nagisa aren't the only good characters. Koro-sensei is as awesome as always. Kaede gets her own little mini-arc. And I still love Sugino. Though not all the characters are created equal. Not many of them get major focus, which is sad, but the ones who do are amazing.\\n",

            "content": "Koro sensei is one of the best teachers, even now 2 days after completion of the series, I still feel emotional whenever I think back about it.\r\n( This is review of both the seasons of assassination classroom)\r\nAs you can see(synopsis) this story is about a octopus monster(koro sensei) who suddenly appears out of nowhere and threatens to eliminate the earth unless the students of class 3-E assassinate him while him being a teacher to them.\r\nThis class consists of students who are of low IQ and made to go to a class which is abandoned out of main school building. All the students have no motivationand feel like the scum of the earth.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest this anime doesn't have much of story, nor does it have many twists, it's pretty much straight forward and simple, but it does give you suspense feeling until the end for sure.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this series looks like students learning assassination skills to kill the teacher, but the thing is, this makes us look in the perspective of a teacher, who uses all his efforts to train his students, impart the knowledge to them in best possible way.\\n\\n\r\nI mean in general weak students don't listen to the teacher, also many teachers try to force children to their method of study, but koro sensei, does make them both study easily as well as develops their talents and makes them the future citizens of the country who know what their responsibilities and ideals are.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch the anime and learn the past of koro sensei and how he trains the children and how they compete with the top students of the school in both studies and other school activities like games etc.\\n\\n\r\nI'll forever cherish the memories of koro sensei and class 3-E, cos it was a emotional journey, they did everything what I couldn't do in school life and enjoyed life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2:\\n\r\nAlthough this series is wonderful, it had lot of drawbacks, like all the school life and stories end by 12 episodes, the rest of the series is all about the history of koro sensei and the tentacles and the conclusion of the junior high school. Many episodes felt for half the duration like filler episodes, also whatever character development was done in first season was not fully utilised in second. And the ending felt a bit dragging but it was worth.\\n\\n\r\nMany a times, when someone else other than the children try to kill koro sensei, the children try to foil them as they want to kill him instead, I always wondered why won't they let him die as killing him saves the earth no matter who kills. But then I realised they are middle school children, and they have na\u00efve ideals which suits the way they think.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this series is wonderful, although it had potential to have another season instead of ending with just 2, but the writer didn't try to beat around the bush and plunged directly to the end quickly. Even the back stories of everyone are believable without much dragging.\\n\\n\r\nWell the animation was good, which is better than danganronpa, also the op and Ed songs were good to listen. There are some good soundtracks too, but the I was so immersed in the story I couldn't observe them.\\n\\n\r\nThis is wonderful series which tells how even though life maybe unfair, you need to deal with them accordingly, leave the past and move on to become a better person to society.",

            "content": "I don't usually do things like this, but seeing as this is now my favorite anime of all time, I figured I would give it a shot. This will not contain any plot spoilers; however, I will say that this is written strictly for those who have watched season 1. If you haven't, GO DO IT NOW.\r\nStory (9):\r\nLet's start right from the beginning of the season which continues after the summer vacation section of the school year. By now you have learned how much potential each of the students has, what their roles are in the classroom and  what their specialty of assassination styleis. So why do we want to be invested in the story in season 2? Well, for two reasons: one, we want to find out Koro-sensei's backstory; two, we want to see what shenanigans happen to the students. As I said, there will be no spoilers here, but the story gets itself turned on its head with some of the plot twists, which for the most part all well placed. If you don't like sci-fi, you probably won't enjoy a lot of Korosensei's backstory. You will see plenty of new developments with the antagonists we've met in this part of the anime, but also one new one. The story is heart-wrenching at points, but if you like having your heart-strings pulled you will enjoy the ending, even if it was fairly predictable at points.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nSo, why not give Assassination Classroom a perfect score for art? Well, it's a nice and clean art style that drastically shifts depending on the tone of the plot, but for the most part, if you've seen lots of shounen anime before, the fight scenes don't stand out that much; not even the climactic, final battle. \\n\r\nThe stylistic black outline gives it a manga feel that really makes the characters pop. The lighting and shadows are pretty standard, but there's nothing that really stands out. It's amazing, despite its deliberate inconsistency at points, but it cannot be called perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite memorable in season 2. The opening songs: \"Question\" and \"Bai Bai Yesterday\" really match the steadily changing tone of the plot which is always a plus. The background music for the anime itself is always fitting, as are the sound effects for the action sequences. So where does the anime lose most of its points? The English. Whether deliberately cringe-worthy or not, the Japanese voice actors (specifically Karma) speaking English while understandable is as bad as (if not arguably worse than,) in season 1. Actual English speakers speaking English during a school competition is also cringe-worthy. It does add to the humor in the show so it may be deliberate, but it's still painful to endure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\r\nThe strongest part about this anime is the investment you have in Koro-sensei and his class, and the character development that we see in this season is very nice. The coming of age element in this school anime is spot-on and paced well for Nagisa in particular, who is our main focus, but we also see how far the students have come as a now-harmonious class despite adversity and their differences. The tension between characters and the mediation of Koro-sensei and Karasuma-san make this season even better than last season, since we see the students finally use their assassination skills obtained over the school year in their final mission. Plus, we see some very drastic changes in some of the antagonists, who would otherwise have been quite flat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): \\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this was a comedy-action anime, and Assassination Classroom delivered in spades. There is PLENTY of action in season 2, from parkour, to combat, to travels taken throughout the plot. The dialogue is extremely well-written for each of the characters which made me quite invested in most of them and my friend and I had quite a few laughs watching it together. Koro-sensei does more than teach his class, he teaches everyone around him and also the viewer to always take different perspectives and not to get lost in our anger or anxiety. He's more than just an anime character, he's a real teacher.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10):\\n\r\nI believe both seasons of this anime are special, and should be visited by everyone who wants something completely obscure to watch or likes weird anime. Season 2 does what season 1 does with a more serious tone at points (similar to the end of season 1) but is only more enjoyable for it. You will only enjoy the anime more by watching season 2.",

            "content": "\"Exams are an opportunity to teach correctly the meaning of winning and losing, of strong and weak. Students soak up heaping helpings of successes and setbacks! Take in now what it means to win, what it means to lose!\" - Koro-sensei\r\nStory (10/10): The story is about a group of students in the class of 3-E, or the failure class, who gets isolated and excluded from the rest of the school, however, is tasked to assassinate a potentially dangerous creature that could destroy the world.  \r\nI think I can totally relate to the class of 3-E, when the students of 3-E gets bullied to noend by the rest of the school, in the first season, when Akabane Karma, a student who used to be in the A class, helps out a student from 3-E because he was getting beaten up, Karma got punished for helping him just because he was from 3-E, saying that he beat up a student with bright future and helped a student who didn't have a future. The 3-E system reminds me of my school years, with the system of regulars, honors, and AP classes. Those who got put in regulars were often teased by the higher level classes, and they never wanted to associate themselves with the regular classes. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): The art is pretty nice, at first I thought Nagisa was meant to be a girl, didn't know about his background story then. Akabane is nicely drawn, a redhead really suits him, since redheads are usually pretty awesome in animes. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): The sounds weren't really that memorable in Assassination Classroom, especially the opening sounds, but I found it alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Here are some of the most notable characters for the 2nd season:\\n\\n\r\n1) Akabane Karma: in short, he's a guy who loves to pick fights, right or wrong, he doesn't care. \\n\r\n2) Nagisa Shiota: He is a natural born killer, he's got the eyes of a killer too. In the first season, when he fights Takaoka, he was pretty badass in that fight. He's almost always mistaken for a girl because of his hair.\\n\r\n3) Asano Gakushuu: He kind of developed from the first season, he's definitely the spitting image of his father (the principal), but he finally admits that his father's education is wrong.\\n\r\n4) Principal Asano: He wasn't really that noticeable in the first season, however, in the 2nd season, when he messed with his son's friends and the whole A class, it seems like he's got some super powers in him. His past shows us why he became the man whom he is today.\\n\r\n5) Koro-sensei: Didn't change much\\n\r\n6) Itona: Used to always want to charge in and kill Koro-sensei, but in the second half of season 2, he became a student under Koro-sensei and fit in nicely with the class.\\n\r\n7) Irina: SPOILER! She develops a crush for Karasuma\\n\r\nThese are all the characters that I think had developed\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): I've really enjoyed watching Assassination Classroom both seasons, however, I think I enjoyed this one even more bc of the tear-jerking ending. It was a lot more intense and epic than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): I think this anime was really enjoyable, it's too bad that it ended. Would recommend this to my friends.",

The character development continues. The season doesn't end with a cliffhanger either. The ending is nice and clean and I think if you watch until episode 24, you will feel sad and satisfied with what happens.\r\n\u2665 Art \u2665 : The art has an interesting thick and thin line animation stylewith great cel shading. The consistency is there and they certainly put a lot of effort into it.\\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Sound \u2665 :  I LOVE the opening theme QUESTION and Bye, Bye Yesterday. They give me chills down my spine because they are so quality and give a sort of hint at what will happen later on in the series. The ending themes are nice and give a peaceful ending to some of the intense episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Character \u2665 : The characters are very diverse and you see all types of cool classmates and interesting supporting characters all around. They all get their character development and their fair share of lines and opinions in situations. \\n\\n\r\n\u2665 Enjoyment \u2665 : I very much enjoyed this anime and I am glad it made it to a second season to finish everything up~!\\n\\n\r\nI would reccommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something interesting for a change!\\n\\n\r\nA 10 out of 10 rating may be unfair, but this anime really dashed a marathon into my heart..\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for this review.

From the very first season, we have been introduced to every students of the End class, including their assasination mission, and not to forget, their unique and funny teacher, Koro-Sensei.\r\nAll their attempt to kill him failed, and that makes the first season interesting.\r\nAND BECAUSE OF THAT, THAT MAKES THE SECOND SEASON BECOMES MORE INTERESTING.\r\nA lot of plot twist, that would be a spoiler if I said it, adds an upheaval of the story. The second season show us, there's something more than just the student's killing mission. Thereis more. There is secret, and those secret waiting to be revealed in each episodes.\\n\r\nSo, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt, well, it's almost perfect. I can't say anything about Studio Lerche who made this marvelous anime. The animation is fluid, the color is bright, and the drawing style was really my type.\\n\r\nI can't give other than 10 from 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound, it's the same. How they complete all those great scene, makes me fall to the depth of the anime as I watch it. And you know, at the end of the series, about episodes 22, 23, and 24, I almost cry, thanks to the background music.\\n\r\n10/10, if I must say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. This is something I can't ignore, but I can't say much because they had explained about half of the students of E class at the first season. So I understand if they didn't put any more character development for the supporting character, but I must admit, they do very well for Itona, Nagisa, Koro-sensei, and Irina.\\n\r\nNot full score, but still great. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe last, enjoyment. I REALLY ENJOY WATCHING THIS SHOW. I can't explain how great it is, but eventually you'll when you experience this by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, I can give this Anime 10/10, perfect score for perfect show. The fusion of Action, School Life, Sci-Fi, and Comedy gives us a masterpiece, a show entitled Ansatsu Kyoushitsu.\\n\\n\r\nSo i really recommend this to all of you.",

            "content": "I may be a little bit naive giving this show a perfect score, but hear me out:\r\nThere are so many animes in the world that attempt to have a huge cast, and so rarely do they succeed. Usually the primary focus falls short and somebody gets the shaft. But never once does it feel that way in Assassination Classroom. They are one of the few exceptions to this rule. The class has 3 teachers, and 28 students. Now of course, not every character gets their own episode, but everyone of them DOES get a moment or two. It may not be much, but it's enoughto give us an idea of who each of these individuals are. The show is really masterful in the art of character design, both writing and artistically. To really emphasize on this, I'm going to dive into the deep review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The show grabbed me from the moment it started. A bunch of junior high school kids trying to kill their yellow octopus teacher? Hell yeah. It's obvious the show is meant for humor, but ends up containing so many more levels of emotion in it. There are so many laugh-out -loud moments, but also nerve-wracking, disheartening, and truly upsetting ones. We see a majority of our characters experience real change, especially ones like Nagisa, Karma, Kayano, Terasaka, KoroSensei, and even Karasuma and Ms. Bitch. We see them begin this series as either hot-headed, cocky, or just lacking in any sort of self-esteem or confidence. They all manage to find a happy medium in the end, which was truly so refreshing to see. So much so that I really want to go into some of these characters more prospectively: \\n\r\nNagisa is obviously our main protagonist. Like most animes, he's a small, misunderstood, lacking in confidence, young boy. But he by far exceeds any norm of a typical anime boy. First of all, he's essentially androgynous which is lovable in it of itself. But we also see Nagisa truly transform as a person. he gaisn confidence, self-respect for himself and from the people around him (his wacky mother), and he becomes a leader and one of the strongest assassins in the classroom. We see a real steady growth throughout the show with him, and the pacing of it is down right perfect and believable. It isn't an overnight change, it's a natural one. \\n\r\nKarma is also pretty stereotypical on the surface. He is the average \"cool guy character that gives no fucks and becomes everybody's favorite character.\" He was definitely mine at first, but whenever we reach the episode where he fights Nagisa about killing Korosensei, my heart stopped. That episode was a little gut-wrenching to me in the best way. It reminded me that Karma too, was an imperfect being and seeing him really screw up like that honesty angered me. But in the end I (just like everyone in the show) forgave him. I think that;s what really makes these characters so likable... they are so REALISTIC. They aren't your run of the mill fictional characters, they are your run of the mill PEOPLE. Minus the assassination skills of course. This show takes people who (in the show and in real life) appear to be the scum of the earth. The lowest grade students who might as well be dropouts. In the show they had that reputation and lets be honest, they would if it was real life too. So this show takes those kinds of people and reminds its audience that they still are in fact, human beings. They too posse feelings, emotions, strengths and weaknesses. They aren't bad people, they are misunderstood. And Korosensei is the ideal teacher to help them fix that. Obviously no Korosensei can exist in the real world, but the ambitions he has can... and should. It is a teachers job to do everything in their power to help enlighten students young minds and help lead them down the best paths. No human can go mach 20, but they should follow the example left by this show. sometimes it takes other people to really bring out the best in us. That is one of the ultimate messages within this show. It's a beautiful and enlightening one at that. \\n\\n\r\nArt: the style of this show was phenomenal. I personally loved the unique physical attributes of each character in this show. Nagisa and Kayano stood out the most of course, but each student had their own unique quality and appearance quirk to them. And of course, Korosensi is a big smiling octopus man. Overall, I think the art and style of this show really shine. Its the best kind of animation style in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I've already talked a lot about the characters but I do want to add one more thing. This show is masterful at averting our expectations. As I said before about Nagisa and Karma, they are very different than what we would initially expect them to be. That's a good thing, but boy I got to say, the character arc that shocked me the most by far was Kayano. I did not expect her to be the one to shake things up, but her sudden change really sparked the show up. From the very beginning she was a sweet and adorable girl. She had the class make a giant pudding for gods sake. But underneath that mask lied a truly bloodthirsty and revengeful girl, and when that girl finally made an appearance, I along with the other characters, was stunned. It just goes to show how misleading people can be. How at the end of the day, no matter how happy someone seems to be, they too can have real demons in their hearts. It was a really powerful arc for Kayano and the entire show in general. and of course, another fine example of good writing. Anytime you can shock the audiences with an unexpected character quality, it;s a win.  \\n\\n\r\nThis review is a little all over the place, sorry about that. But the last thing I really want to touch on is the ending of the series. But I will do so WITHOUT spoilers. \\n\r\nThis show was a whirlwind of a ride. I personally watched both seasons in a week. It was a short ride for me, but an extravagant and memorable one as well. Again, this show made me laugh so many times. It fascinated me, it filled me with pure enjoyment and amusement, and in the end... it really all fit together in the best way it could have. I've never had an anime make me cry before, but this one sure as hell did. But no in the usual sad-sap sort of way. I cried when the other characters cried because I felt I was alongside them. I too, felt like I was losing something grand and amazing. This show was able to evoke such strong emotions from beginning to end for me. That is truly the sign of well-made art. The ones that leave a lasting impression, the ones that make us as audiences feel apart of something, the ones that fill us with an emotion. Assassination Classroom seems to be one thing on the surface, but in reality, it is a combination of so many beautiful things. From the characters to the art to the music to the style, the message of this show is beautiful and positive.",

            "content": "The continuity of Assassination Classroom Season 1. Note that I have not read the manga and will not compare it. Assassination Classroom will be shortened as AC for the rest of the review.\r\nWhat I enjoy about the anime is the fluidity of the story. While it is somewhat episodic, it does tell a little of the growth of the students for every episode. The second thing I like from AC is the teachings that does not go directly towards the students in the anime, but to us, the viewers as well. It plays well between serious moments and comedic moments. The story is unique, thoughbeing a generic school life anime, it doesn't stay that way very long. The second season of AC is where the \"feel trip\" will start - towards the end of the anime. I was told that it ended where the manga ended, and I think it wrapped up well on episode 24, being episode 25 a slight glimpse to what have happened to the students afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the disappointment of the anime. Apart of the main 4 characters, Akabane Karma, Shiota Nagisa, Kayano Kaede, and Koro-sensei, none of the other characters are truly fleshed out. Was it due to the number of characters they have? Did they have something from the manga that was not aired out? I do not know. Each one of them have their talents and unique personality, though not quite explored well. I don't think there's a true antagonist to the series, but the lack of antagonist does not affect the story in any way. \\n\\n\r\nArt is decent, not particularly noteworthy of, but is pleasing at best. Each character has their own unique appearance, making it easier to determine each character, and the one character that has similarities to the other was explained in the anime. There's not much to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP of AC is catchy for both seasons, and I like them very much. The lyrics are also related to the story, to my surprise. The use of sound is good. Nothing much to say about this either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it because it did well in juggling comedic and serious moments. A unique story told through a generic setting, it did well to stand out from the others with the difference of one overpowered character being the teacher and the students are required to kill this character. While the character development is lacking, the story is filled with characters conflict and their ability to overcome it makes it admirable and noteworthy of.",

            "content": "This is by far the most enjoyable anime of all time. If you are a school student, this series has got to be the most relatable for your time. If you aren't a school student, then you may relive your moments as a school student.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story may seem out of this world initially, with the concept of assassination within a classroom setting preposterous. However, the values that lie therein strike me deeper than other anime. Being a student in Singapore, the pressure of school is immense, with the concept of \"The Survival Of The Fittest\", which is exactly what this series tackles, surprisingly. Ontop of that, there is an element of strategy; the way you should think in order to outsmart somebody stronger than you. What could be better than all that packed nicely into one comedic anime? This is certainly one you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWell, I am sure that the art is good enough for its time period. Characters are drawn well enough and the action scenes are beautifully created, balancing out the serious moments and the hilarious moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is flawless. On top of the opening and the closing songs, the inserts used invoke the moods of those scenes. Songs like Gekkou and Tabidachi no Uta are crucial in allowing the characters feelings to be felt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nWith the characters in place, the anime tackles issues such as teacher-student relationships, student-peer relationships, and to a lesser extent family relationships. As the class is a big one, it would naturally be true if not all the characters get enough showtime, and that is perfectly fine. By focusing on two of the class members and having the rest as actively supporting them, you can feel that it is exactly like a classroom setting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this series, being a high school student myself. With the values taught in this show, as well as the continuously funny scenes which never bore me out, this has got to be the best anime ever created.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nStunning, just stunning. You have got to watch it for yourselves to find out. For those who have read this far, here's a piece of advice: take it slow, you don't want this series to end that quickly.",

            "content": "Many people have heard the saying \u201cThe book is better than the movie.\u201d Heck, I\u2019ve said it quite a number of times when watching my favorite books get transformed into movies or TV shows. I just never thought I\u2019d say the same about an anime, excluding One Piece. It might be because I never thought I\u2019d ever finish a manga series before it was fully adapted into an anime. But that\u2019s what happened with Assassination Classroom and I have to say I\u2019m disappointed in the adaption I just finished. The manga is indeed better than the anime.\r\nStory: This series is interesting in many regards. Itforces you to suspend your disbelief at a number of plot points, but in doing so it is able to paint a picture of a group of kids rising above many expectations. It\u2019s truly a joy a watch these kids grow over the course of the series and defy those around them to be able to lead lives that they are proud of. At its core, this isn\u2019t about assassination at all, it about a group of teenagers growing and maturing with the guidance of a truly remarkable teacher. \\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the second season, we pick up at the tail end of the summer vacation plot and the story progresses through the fall and winter terms and ends with graduation. The kids get into a number of problems relating to school in the first half with a sprinkling of assassination here and there, but the second half revolves exclusively on assassination plots. The first half was fairly enjoyable for me, though, as a filthy manga snob, I would have liked to see some plots done differently. The second half was poorly done though, culminating in a terribly adapted and awful final battle and death scene. And it is here where I need to explain my utter loathing of this adaption to any non-manga readers out there. The first season adapted 73 chapters in 22 episodes. The second season adapted 107 chapters in 25 episodes. The manga wasn\u2019t even finished when the second season started airing! They condensed plots that should have been expanded on, left in unimportant plots that could have been cut, and completely left parts of the final battle out of the anime entirely. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I really have about the first 16 episodes is that I would have cut some of the school related storylines to make room for a better adapted Reaper arc (13 chapters in 2 episodes?), Past arc, and second half. I was disappointed that they left out a three chapter plot revolving around glasses guy, but it wasn\u2019t important to the story as a whole so I understand why they cut it. Episodes 17 through 24, however, were boring and poorly adapted. Plot points that were exciting to witness in the manga were glossed over in the anime. I wasn\u2019t excited, I wasn\u2019t entertained, I was bored. It doesn\u2019t help that two of my most hated plot points happen in this back half as well. In episode 19, the kids train to go into space. What the heck is this? It\u2019s terrible. There\u2019s suspension of disbelief and then there\u2019s just out of left field ridiculous. There is no goddamn way a group of kids can train for a month and be ready to go into space, especially on a space shuttle that is still being tested for human survivability. And then there\u2019s Kayano\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d. At least in the manga she wasn\u2019t resurrected in the same chapter. In the anime she dies and ten minutes later she comes back to life. It\u2019s nice that Korosensei has this kind of backup plan, however terribly contrived and medically inaccurate it may be. But, as I was just saying, he lets his students go into space, far away from him, on a space shuttle being tested for survivability. Korosensei being able to resurrect Kayano is just a terrible plot device so that we the audience aren\u2019t sad. Also, why does the badass Korosensei need Kayano to sacrifice herself to be able to beat the bad guys? Some say it\u2019s hearkening back to her sister\u2019s death; I say it\u2019s bad writing on the Mangaka\u2019s part. \\n\\n\r\nBut I would have been able to overlook all of that if they had tried to adapt the final battle properly. But this adaption is absolutely terrible. In the manga, a group of mercenaries is protecting the mountain and these same mercenaries capture the kids and lock them up. These mercenaries are hyped up to be the biggest threat these kids have faced. In the anime, the people protecting the mountain are nobodies. In the manga, the kids aren\u2019t entirely certain that they\u2019ll be able to meet Korosensei and say goodbye. They are locked up and trapped, and it\u2019s only through Irina helping them that they are able to escape and go to him. Along the way, they have their own final battle on the mountain and are able to use their tremendous skills to beat the mercenaries. In the anime, this is a piece of cake for them. There is no question about whether they\u2019ll win: they are winning. This is my biggest problem with the anime: it doesn\u2019t give the kids a proper final battle. There is no respect for their skills or all of their hard work, it just happens because they have to get up to the classroom and there\u2019s no extra time because we have to spend an entire episode on Korosensei dying. The pacing of this last arc is terribly done as well. We only get an episode of Korosensei fighting his student, Kayano dies and revives in the same episode, and episode 24 was just a pile of drawn out garbage. At least episode 25 was well done for the most part. I understand that they wanted to finish the series, but if you can\u2019t properly adapt the ending of a beloved series, don\u2019t be so ambitious and do a third season!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is a series about a group of thirty children coming together to kill a threat to the world, with three teachers imparting the skills needed to achieve that goal. The series tries very hard to focus on each kid and give them some characterization, but in this season (heck, in the first season too) many characters are thrown by the wayside in favor of advancing the story. It\u2019s obvious throughout this entire series that Nagisa and Karma are the main characters of the kids, and it certainly shows. Throughout this entire series, if you had held up a picture of this class and asked me to name them all, I would have gotten Nagisa, Karma, and Terrasaka every time and Kayano, Isogai, and Sugino some of the time. I probably could have pointed out some members of Terasaka\u2019s gang, glasses guy, the snipers, and the computer girl and the white haired guy. But the others? I have no idea who they are. They don\u2019t get any time for character development or any type of personality as far as I know. The show doesn\u2019t build up any of these kids and then suddenly expects us to care about a battle we know is going to boil down to Nagisa and Karma? It expects us to care about who\u2019s going into space when we know it\u2019s going to be Nagisa and Karma? I don\u2019t care about any of these kids! At least in the first season, when that hotel battle happened, the mangaka had the sense to whittle down the cast with \u201cfood poisoning\u201d. Don\u2019t even get me started on the snooze fest that was roll call in episode 24. Seriously, I. Don\u2019t. Care. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t even really care about the bad guys in this series. The Reaper and Kayano\u2019s crazy brother in law both made it very clear that they don\u2019t care about putting kids in danger as long as Korosensei dies as a result. It\u2019s a very simple way of putting the audience firmly against them, but do we really need that when they\u2019re trying to kill a very beloved character? Can\u2019t the villains have a little more depth to them than just they\u2019re evil? I know I\u2019m asking a lot of a shounen manga, but the Asano\u2019s were done very well as villains, even if they do seem a little cartoonishly evil. Kids aren\u2019t idiots, I\u2019m sure they would be able to understand more than one complex villain. They try to give the Reaper a bullshit motive for doing what he did (Oh, I\u2019m sure he just wanted you to notice him!). Whatever. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I think what really did this anime in is the fact that they didn\u2019t actually have a complete ending until March and had to rush the ending because of it. I think both manga and anime suffered from this second season airing so soon. When I was reading the last few chapters, it seemed like the mangaka rushed the ending because the second and final season was airing so soon. What creator wants an anime to finish their series for them? I wish that they had waited for the mangaka to finish the series before they aired the second season; maybe then it wouldn\u2019t have felt so rushed at the end. Maybe they could have actually created a decent piece of work, instead of the rushed ending that we got. Even with a rushed ending, the manga certainly treated the cast, especially the kids, with more respect than the anime did. \\n\\n\r\nI think that if you haven\u2019t read the manga, you will probably really enjoy the second season of Assassination Classroom. Just don\u2019t finish the manga before you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: While the first half is decent and fairly faithful to the manga, the second half becomes boring and the ending is rushed and terrible because the manga wasn\u2019t even finished when the season started airing. Most characters are bland and underdeveloped and most of the villains are one dimensional. If you haven\u2019t read the manga, you will probably enjoy it. \\n",

Especially Koro-sensei. \r\nWatching this anime, It gets awfully hard sometimes to stifle all that laughter inside me.\r\n And it's even harder to swallow that lump in my throat and stop my eyes from welling up with tears.\r\nThe development of characters, as they grow and learn, perform and strive to work hard, and Koro-sensei's compassion as a teacher, is really moving. It was fun how much his students improved physically, mentally and in every other field in which they wanted to gain skills. I have had many wonderful teachers, but I can't help butwish I had one like him too. Hopefully, you'll enjoy this anime just as much as I did.",

I Would recommend it to anyone and everyone!Its a must watch anime and it deserves to be one.\r\n{Spoilers}\r\n{Story 9/10}\r\nStory wise it was amazing! They spread it out so it didn't feel rushed and instead of forcing you to enjoy the anime, it allowed you too. It really made me feel like I was apart of the classroom and thats not just my opinion.\r\nThe reason the story is a 9/10 though is because of the protagonist and some of the vocab they used. They call the classroom assassination classroom when they aren'treally killing anyone. They say they are assassins but never hurt anyone until the last episode. They have a target so technically they are, but still makes me wish they had a different name that would be more fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSecond point is Nagisa. They say he has a talent for assassination but they only show that talent 4-5 times! I wish they had more battle scenes because i was somewhat deprived of them. \\n\\n\r\n{Art 10/10}\\n\r\nAmazing art! At first I watched the anime because it reminded me of Danganronpa and I thought thats why I liked the anime. But after getting to the second season i realized thats not the case. It unique the art and the character designs are so so so cute/hot *cough*.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound 10/10}\\n\r\nThe music was Incredible!\\n\r\nThe openings are so catchy and cute and I love them! And the sad music at the end just made the feels even bigger!\\n\\n\r\n{Character 10/10}\\n\r\nAmazing characters! I love them all! Nagisa, Karma, Koro-Sensei, Bitch Sensei. They really make it feel like its a classroom. They focus on ever character, and give a lot of them some screen time. They only thing I wish was that they showed more of the actual protagonists and maybe a little bit less of the side characters.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment 10/10}\\n\r\nI Loved this anime! I didn't feel bored and I watched it for 2 days straight. When i was at school the only thing I really though about was going home and continuing watching it! It hits you with the feel at the end and was one anime that left me sobbing. And when ever i think about it i still feel like sobbing. Its just so good.\\n\\n\r\n{Overall 10/10}\\n\r\nAmazing anime! I wish it showed more of Nagisa, and sometimes i wish it never ended but I know that would ruin the anime. It actually followed through with the main plot unlike a lot of western tv shows and movies.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch it you shall not be disappointed! :3\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Might contain spoilers) Overall rating 10\r\nsidenote: this is my first ever review so I doubt it is perfect hoe u guys don't mind much ^-^\r\nWell then oh boy what was this a show! A rollercoaster of both fun and sad moments. overall I think you should really watch this show just to start of your anime watching expiernence because it is a mix of both fantastic art, great story , good developed characters and a good mix of both shounen, school and slice of life. Also because it is a school anime you can always relate to at least one of the students and thatis what I had with Nagisa Shiota the main protaganist.\\n\\n\r\nStory | 10: So the story is not what it seems at first sight because the title (Assasination Classroom/Ansatsu Kyoushitsu) sound very violent but I would not say it is not violent because it is but its not as violent as you think it might be, but the story is really fun and entertaining since it features a octupus like creature (Koro-Sensei) that wants to destroy the world but gives earth a chance by teaching a class of teenagers to assasinate him. This formula really makes it interesting to see how these kids will develop and so I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt | 8: I will keep this one rather short, I really like the artstyle but it isn't the best I have seen but I don't think art is a big factor anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSound | 10: I really really liked the soundtrack not to mention both the openings were fantasic! I still listen to all of them to this day, but the point is the soundtrack was I think really something I have not heard before and so I give it a easy 10!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter | 10: The characters in this show are really likeable, lets take Karma Akabane as an example, he is a really smart and strong boy whilst at the same time he is a real culprit since he always jokes around with his victims. Overall the whole class has good development as a whole and individual, obviously the main characters have more development although I think without the two main students this anime would still have been an absolute masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment | 10: I loved this anime its still my favorite and it will stay for the time being, I really enjoyed the show because as I already mentioned all the class studensts gone through enough development, the soundtrack is great and the story is fantastic, thus I really enjoyed watching the anime because it was both really funny and serious at the same time!",

I knew with about 10 episodes left I was probably gonna end up giving this show a 10/10 as my criteria for 10/10 needs to leave me with some sort of lasting effect and at the time I really needed to see how this series stuck its landing. It did with flying colors. This show knew exactly when to change its emotional tones when it needed to and did it perfectly. The comedy, the drama, the seriousness of itall was immaculate.\\n\\n\r\nThings tend to not make me cry especially when they are played up but in the 2nd to last episode I was balling my eyes out over everything the class had gone through. It was one hell of a ride and I wish i could stay on for longer, but things have to have an end. Having a plot where there is a clear end goal in sight is a great if not necessary tool to have so the series never spins it's wheel forever. This show knew the outcome of the question it had laid out and delivered it in a way I wouldn't want any other way. Still highly recommend the dub.",

            "content": "My first review, so sorry if it\u2019s bad but I just had to express my thoughts!\r\nSo I will assume that, since you\u2019re looking at the second season of the series, you are already familiar with the story of the first season and I might put some minor spoilers from the first season.\r\nWell the anime in question is undoubtedly one of the best that I\u2019ve seen so far. It\u2019s the second season of the anime Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. To start off, the first season was more focused on the comedy aspect of the show and it succeeded quite well at it. The second season however is awhole another story. First half might remind you of the first season with its cheerful episodes and comedy, but the second half takes a dark (more like sad) turn for the better as the shows ending would\u2019ve been much worse if it didn\u2019t end as it did. If you want a quick tl;dr you will find it at the bottom of the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 10\\n\\n\r\nStory gets a 10 from me for a couple of reasons, first one is: it\u2019s the first anime to make me genuinely cry, second one is: it\u2019s a good continuation to the last season and the quality of the story doesn\u2019t get worse and comedy didn\u2019t get stale. However, there are times when comedy felt a bit forced, for example a touching emotional scene was interrupted by a bad and not necessary gag.\\n\r\nThe first half of the story is pretty much the same as the first season with our 3-E students trying their hardest to kill their teacher. Towards the middle when Korosensei\u2019s past is getting revealed, story takes tone shift. Sadly the introduction of two characters in the final few episodes felt unnecessary in my opinion. \\n\r\nEnding? Well I knew what was going to happen but I did not want it to happen but it still happened. And I was pretty damn sad. It was the first anime to make my cry and if you didn\u2019t know the context you would be pretty weirded out lol\\n\r\nOverall pretty solid story, above average for sure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nArt in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is very nice with many different colors which gives it a nice colorful aesthetic. As the show progresses towards the final episodes, colors get toned down a bit and take more serious tones with a lot of black and grey. \\n\r\nCharacters have a nice look to them and designs match the designs from the manga quite well.\\n\r\nAnimation honestly isn\u2019t anything special, fights have a nice and usually fluid animation with effects that make the atmosphere much better, but overall animation doesn't exceed average with low framerate and non detailed backgrounds and background characters.\\n\r\nSound : 10\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know much about sound and music theory, but music felt fitting and opening songs were pretty good. On that stands out to me the most is the last opening which felt very fitting to the overall tone of the second half and lyrics were great.\\n\r\nOverall nice soundtrack with a few really great songs/compositions\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10\\n\r\nCharacters may as well get this high of a score just because of Korosensei. His character was simply amazing and his growth as a person or an octopus was great. There are a few other characters that stand out such as Karma and Nagisa but I can\u2019t really tell more because I am not experienced enough.\\n\r\nShow really makes you care for the characters, especially for Korosensei after his past reveal. You may not know every single characters name but you will know what kind of a character they were and what was their personality was as the show makes every character unique in some way.\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nBinged the whole season in only a few days and I\u2019m in the process of reading the manga because I don\u2019t have enough of it and I don\u2019t want it to end!\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr \\n\r\nIf you liked the first season you will definitely like the second one as well especially. The second half will get your feels completely. Worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nCongratulations, you got to the end of my review! I hope it wasn\u2019t bad for the first one but I enjoyed writing it!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I would give the series as whole a 9 out of 10 but I will give the last season 10 as it did what I liked about Full Metal Alchemist which was have a satisfying conclusion which cuts the loose ends and stuck to good pacing. When I write this review I will act as if I am reviewing the series as a whole. Assassination classroom was in its first season your average Shonen series with an interesting concept of having the students try to kill the teacher.\r\nIf you don't know what this series is basically the concept is a class of forty studentswhich are our main characters must band together to assassinate their teacher before they graduate. Seems easy except their teacher is overpowered in the concept of defence which makes him difficult to kill let alone hit. While trying to avoid death every episode the teacher tries to help their students cope with the problems of middle school. In its first season classroom can be repetitious with each episode focusing on certain groups of students trying to make an attempt on the teacher\u2019s life or trying to get through some problem at school with help of their teacher. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it does seem like a comedy the show has its share of feels at points in the story where the students are in conflict with their school and personal lives. This is especially in the second season where the students are graduating soon and must plan their future.  While the story is mainly arcs of assassination attempts there are some main arcs which affect the overall story for the student and teacher. The best of these arcs shows up in the second halve of the series and is where the show shines the most. The series has what many anime don't have and that is a solid conclusion that does not leave the audience wanting more or leave loads of loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in assassination classroom is very shiny and bright. Everything seems really smooth and the characters don't look ugly or bland for a show that cast 50 main characters. The character designs are skewed amongst the students, some look pretty average or normal while others could stand out because of mostly their hair colour or where some personal item that is not part of the uniform. There are a few adult characters that are designed pretty well which include agent\u2019s teachers and assassins. The most stands out character would have to be Koro Sensei the teacher who has unique look but changes to disguises a lot of the time and the fact he is something that does not look human.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Music in this series does not have much of a presence and not much is playing in the background noise of the show. They do use some music for key moments but that is really all in their use of music in the actual show. The opening theme is the only thing unique about the sound. The opening themes are always performed by the voice actors of the students who all sing together.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of characters in classroom so I will generalize the students to give a quick description of what kind of characters they are. The school in classroom have a strict policy where the lowest performing or most awkward students are put away into a separate classroom away from the good students the school praise while cursing the students in separate classroom as failures who will be nothing after school just to make the favourite students feel better. Our main cast are these separate students who have a very low self-confidence in themselves because of this. \\n\\n\r\nThey actually are not bad students it is just some of them are very smart and have learning difficulties or they are students who have a lot of pressure from their personal life at home. Those are the majority while a very small few where trouble makers and transfer students who joined in the second year. In the series two characters stand out as the leaders amongst this group of students which are Nagisa and Karma. \\n\\n\r\nNagisa is the character telling the story in Classroom and is seen as the main protagonist amongst the students. He is pretty much one of the worst off students in E-Class when it comes to confidence. I won't say why he has such low confidence but it being so low is why he is so low on grades when he is smart when he wants to be. As the series progresses he becomes a better character by trying to cope with his problems by assassination. If you were to have a favourite character amongst the students of classroom it would either be Nagisa or Karma for different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nKarma is the other central student in classroom who was a friend of Nagisa before they both ended up in the classroom. While Nagisa has low confidence and calm kind demeanour Karma is somewhat the opposite. Karma for starters is a genius and likely the most intelligent student in the school. However he is very sinister and has had a lot of bloodlust entering the classroom as he loves having the opportunity of killing a teacher. \\n\\n\r\nThe teacher Koro-Sensei is probably the best teacher we will ever get to see in anime. While being the target who is constantly avoiding death by student, Koro-Sensei shows a lot of care and support for his students and makes you wish they were not trying to kill him as he loves them a lot and will help them when they are in need. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Classroom it was a good series with a satisfying conclusion and interesting characters. Despite its humour and lightness it really dives into personal conflict which I like seeing in anime. If you want any reason to watch classroom you should just watch it for the conclusion as it is really satisfying for a 40 episode shonen. I would give the series a nine but I will give its final season a ten.    \\n",

The story is very unique, a class trying to assassinate their alien teacher, sounds cool so I would give it a 9. The art captures all the moments flawlessly so 10 in my book. The soundtrack is amaze so 10. The characters are all very memorable even with a butt load of them so another 10. I loved watching it but for example the baseball episode felt boring so I have to give it a 9. Overall it is a beautiful showthat I recommend all of you watch.",

            "content": "I'm going to write this review as a review of the full show - with this, I mean I will talk about season 1, so if you're reading this as you're watching season 1, please stop - even though I won't spoil anything, come back after you watch at least season 1.\r\n\"Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\", also known as Assassination Classroom - a friend of mine, whose name is hackwxz, here on MyAnimeList - go check her out - talked about this show in school. When I was in 9th grade would be my best bet, but that doesn't really matter.\r\nShe just said: \"I started watching this anime,and it's so crazy! You have to watch it!\". She didn't even know the show's name, actually, so she just said she would go search for the name and then tell me, so I could watch it. She talked about \"a monster who ate 70% of the moon and decided to teach a group of students, who have been assigned to kill him\". Obviously it seemed something out of this world, who could've have imagine something like that?\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let's just start with the actual review!\\n\\n\r\nPART 1: PLOT/STORY - 9 out of 10\\n\r\nI mean, in my honest opinion, I actually started liking the story even before I started watching the show - killing an awful teacher? That's every student's dream! Even still, I didn't actually know that I would end up wanting to have Koro-sensei - the teacher and monster - as my teacher.\\n\r\nWhat I can say is that: according to the Government, Koro-sensei needs to be killed, and assigns the miserable Class E - I'll let you find out why I used the adjective \"miserable\" when you watched the show - to kill him.\\n\r\nThey will try, oh, boy, they will try... And it will be funny as hell, at least, it was for me!\\n\r\nAt the same time, they'll find out that the monster that teaches them isn't, in fact, that much of a \"monster\".\\n\\n\r\nPART 2: ART - 8 out of 10\\n\r\nIt's really good for this type of show. The plot is as simple as the animation. It fits the overall tone of the show, and it's well done! I liked it!\\n\\n\r\nPART 3: SOUND - 7 out of 10\\n\r\nI mean, I skipped all the openings, none of them actually caught my attention, you know? They seemed pretty normal; however, it's undeniable that they fit the style the show has: it's for teens, for young adults, high school students!\\n\r\nThe voice acting is actually pretty great, and since the whole theme of this show is assassination, death, murder, whoever chose the voice actors did an outstanding job!\\n\\n\r\nPART 4: CHARACTERS - 9 out of 10\\n\r\nI already said that the plot is actually quite simple. If you were paying attention, you must've seen that I rated the plot with a 9 out of 10... That's a really high score, isn't it?\\n\r\nWell, let me explain why.\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are just the purest, the realest characters I ever found in a comedy anime in a long time, you know? And even though they don't develop some of them, it's still quite honorable that they managed to develop the characters the way they did. I just loved it, you know?\\n\r\nAlso, Koro-sensei is the best fucking teacher ever, and he's the most pure and genuine \"antagonist\" I've ever seen!\\n\\n\r\nPART 5: OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9 out of 10\\n\r\nThe score is actually an average of the scores given above (I rounded 8,6 to 9). The show is great, I really liked it! I hope you like it too.\\n\r\nAnd let me just give you a headstart to say that season 2 is the last season of the show, so you don't get surprised like I did when I got to the 2nd part of  the last season.\\n\r\nYou could say that the idea of this show is so ridiculous that actually works really well! But hey, see for yourself!",

            "content": "Okay, now I'm going to review a season 2 of a masterpiece that Matsui-Sensei created, here we go:\r\nWAIT!!! Before I move on, there will be major spoilers!!!!!\r\n~ Story: 9/10\r\nAhh~ where to start with the plot. It's freaking amazing! Like some other people stated, it's really unique than most of the anime you've (probably) ever seen. Though some parts are predictable, most parts contain kind of plot twists, like how Koro-Sensei himself didn't destroy the moon. Also, the ending was really sad. ;3; Rest in peace, Koro-Sensei, you'll always be in our hearts! I also like the fact that the focus of the show is notonly killing Koro-Sensei. There's also fights with other antagonists, like the Reaper 2.0. I also really like the fact that they show Koro-Sensei's past. Also, they show the pasts and futures of most of the students at the end, too. Alright, done with the plot!\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Art 9/10\\n\r\nThe art here was amazing as well! I love the design of Koro-Sensei and how Nagisa was a 'trap' for a girl. x3 (Though his past was really chaotic and depressing.) I also would like to add that I love the style of their eyes. It's simple, yet really intriguing (Yes I know it sounds weird.) I loved the eyes of Karma and Nagisa when they were about to fight. It's like snake vs. karma. I also love the tentacles of Kayano when she was in beast mode. (I liked that part, especially the french kissing! :3)\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound 10/10\\n\r\nLook, I really don't judge an anime based off of sound, so let's skip this one. (But I loved the voice actors/actresses on this anime though. <3)\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Character 10/10\\n\r\nOkay, I usually don't give 10/10 on characters on anime, but this one HAS to be an exception. The characters were really built up well, from their pasts to their futures. First off, in season one, there was nothing mentioning about the pasts about the characters, but now that I've seen it, I would say it's brilliant. I liked the part that Kayano's sister was Koro-Sensei's 'lover', and how Kayano was acting so she could get revenge on Koro-Sensei for supposedly killing her sister. I also love how Nagisa's past was shown and why he has to grow his hair out because of his mother. So 10/10 for me!\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\n(I really enjoyed this anime, and like I said, R.I.P. Koro-Sensei. <3)\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Overall 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's just say that I'm really excited for the 2 spin-offs coming on November 19th! <3\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime plays with your emotions too, it questions you how you want the story to play out that keeps you on edge.\r\nThis goes for both the 2nd season and the first.\r\nThe ending was absolutely perfect, I onlywish there could be more.",

How a teacher had guided his students to a better path in life and how the students loved their teacher in return. \r\nIt has the same trend with the preceding anime of the same name. a target who has a bounty of 30 billion yen and a teacher who defended the rights of his students in ways heis capable of and the assassins to point their guns against their target and save the world as well as students who respected and loved the only person who believe that they can pull anything. It was still the same group of leftover students discriminated by those who believe that they are superior and battled together with their teacher until they had proven their worth. \\n\\n\r\nThe rumors and bonds continued throughout the stretch of the story. But the ending.... was really something. The pain mixed with longing and satisfaction were there. the target had fulfilled his mission as a teacher and the students had accomplished their roles as assassins. I had shared the pain of the students as Korosensei bade goodbye with happiness and contentment. saying... \"Congratulations for graduating\" \\n\\n\r\nMay all those who watched the series shared the emotions that i had for this anime and for those who haven't watched it, you my as well. Assassination Classroom is the best for me. I love it so much!!!",

            "content": "STORY: 5/5\r\nA large factor in making a great story versus just an alright story is how original it is. It doesn\u2019t have to be something completely new so long as it\u2019s a breath of fresh air and may very well be a twist on a common theme. Ass. Class may be another story about a teacher and their class, but this story revolves around a group of junior high students being trained to assassinate their teacher before their school year ends. Their teacher also just happens to be a super-creature able to fly at Mach-20, said to be responsible for destroying 70% of the moonand will destroy Earth come March\u2026 and he also enjoys busty women. \\n\\n\r\nDespite his threat, Koro-sensei proves to be the best teacher Class E has ever had by touching his precious students\u2019 hearts, helping unlock, support, and nurture each of their unique gifts, bringing the class together as one team as he prepares them for his assassination and their academics all the while teaching them life\u2019s most important lessons.\\n\\n\r\nTwo-cour series (24-26~ episodes) usually provide a reasonable amount of time for pacing and development of the story and for the most part, Ass. Class S2 delivered well. Just like with assassination, you shouldn\u2019t let your guard down because matters can escalate from 0 to 100 real quick and catch you completely off guard with this series. This often provides excitement for the viewer and seldom does the series stagnate for every episode has substance even if it seems like just a light-hearted episode. However, it is not without faults and is occasionally guilty of just a few sudden rushed development pacing with generic depth. Fortunately, the overall picture of things greatly outweighs those incidents.\\n\\n\r\nThe number of plot twists and when they happen will not be revealed here, but there are most certainly surprises that will make you realize the foreshadowing that was subtly used. On the contrary, many \u201csurprises\u201d are simply answers to unanswered questions and teasers from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending will be kept a secret, but I personally have mixed feelings about it. I was hoping for a particular ending. Instead, a combination of the series\u2019 nature to go from 0 to 100 and occasionally rushed development was what it felt like. I am aware it was being foreshadowed leading up to it though and while it wasn\u2019t my desired ending, it was still delivered well for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nART: 4.5/5\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to this series\u2019 art, it is most certainly Yusei Matsui\u2019s unique and quality style. What keeps this Art rating from a 5/5 is the characters\u2019 body proportions. While Class E are junior high students and it is understandable for them to have short proportion body builds, those same body proportions are applied to even adults of the series. Class E\u2019s other two teachers in particular, Irina and Karasuma, look like they have the bodies of high school students. Do not let that 0.5 missing point throw you off though as that is purely subjective. It may very well just be Yusei\u2019s art style and some individuals may actually enjoy it or be bothered by it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is great about this series\u2019 art is its color choices usage and overall quality being vibrant and pleasing to the eye. A unique art trait which is also satisfying is how characters are outlined with thicker borders. An added plus is during serious battle scenes, the animation, color, and art quality all jump higher to bring out the scenes\u2019 effects to their fullest and draw in the audience. \\n\\n\r\nBackground art wasn't anything breathtaking nor was it ever so bad that it was a distraction. It did its job well of being a setting, and well... a background, for characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, much of the humor comes from characters\u2019 reaction shots/scenes which helps enable gags, comic relief and light-heartedness effects to be fully brought out. Lastly, while not all of the characters get as much screentime as others, the students all possess unique character designs appropriate for their character and avoid looking like just a background character. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERIZATION: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nThe difference between great characters and boring characters is their depth (excluding purely gag series). With 25 episodes and the series being the second season, it seems like there\u2019s good enough breathing room for character development and reveal. Ass. Class S2 continues to deliver, but only in certain areas/characters. There\u2019s 28 students, 3 teachers, plus rivals and enemies as the series\u2019 cast so despite the two-cour setup and much of the students\u2019 personalities already being revealed in the first season, there\u2019s a limit to how much one can go into the depth of characters with the allotted air time. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, there isn\u2019t tremendous depth for everyone and there are characters that are shown and developed more than others like all main vs side characters in any story. Although Nagisa is technically part of the main character crew, Ass. Class S2 does a good job at not solely focusing on Nagisa\u2019s POV all the time by giving side characters their chance to shine throughout the series and more so making the class as a whole the \u201cmain character\u201d. Rest assured there is development still in this season and seeing characters grow and how far they\u2019ve come since season 1 was a basket full of good feels indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s always interesting to see how characters are connected to each other and when done well, can serve as great twists and spices to a series. Part of this lies with once again with answering mysteries of season 1. That\u2019s all that will be said for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn most series, the protagonist and his team are usually given the most attention and receive the most character development and depth. However great stories often include development or depth for antagonists/villains. Unfortunately, one of my few cons for Ass. Class is failing to deliver this. For both old and new enemies, the typical evil scumbag hungry for power or greed is played out but stays superficial. While the characters themselves are flat without any depth, it is their relationship and history with other characters and how it affects those other characters that\u2019s actually important. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nAs far as soundtracks go, the opening and ending songs were enjoyable but not anything astonishing. There is also some engrish that\u2019s used. Besides that, music and sound effects throughout the episodes served their purpose well\u2014 enhance the effect of the scene whether it\u2019s for a gag, intensity, drama, or feels. Sound and music are seldom the focus of a shot, but rather are meant to be supporting and enhancing aides to further bring out the actual focus and Ass. Class delivers above-average quality. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go out to buy the soundtrack, but I wouldn\u2019t mind having it on an anime playlist for background music.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable/distinct voice actors are Koro-sensei and Karma. Everyone else sounds close to the average anime seiyuu (voice actor/actress). It\u2019s not to say everyone else is bad at voice acting, but simply they didn\u2019t leave a distinct impression to me. They all fit their character well. The reason Koro-sensei and Karma stick out is due to their voice tone (obviously different sounding) and voice accent in the sense how they talk. What I disliked most was the horrid cringe-inducing engrish especially by Karma. Karma\u2019s engrish not only sounds like your typical anime engrish, but like he\u2019s continuously out of breath. Setting aside the engrish moments, I was not turned off by anything else voice related. \\n\\n\r\nThere is actually one other seiyuu that I enjoyed more than the others because of their exceptional ability to shift from one persona to another. They won\u2019t be revealed due to risk of spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Assassination Classroom Season 2 does an exceptional job of continuing and closing out the series. It is a series that will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions and really make you feel like part of the class. I hope Koro-sensei will be able to touch your heart as he did mine. I enjoy most series I watch, but Assassination Classroom has earned its spot into one of my all-time favorites due to its ability to draw me in, keep me thoroughly entertained every episode, deeply move me, please my eyes, and deliver a heap load of laughter and feels.\\n",

Sometimes I don't agree with anyone's opinion either but you just got to remember that it's theirs. ANYWAYS LET'S GET ONTO THE REVIEW!\r\nStory: 10\r\nI gave this a 10 because I really loved the fact that they are middle school students that must kill their teacher. I'd like to be in a class like that xD but nah. \r\nArt: 10\r\nI usually don't like anime that have lots have detail in it. I honestly prefer anime thatsorta have a \"western cartoon-ish\" kinda art to it. I know it seems weird and all but that's what I like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI didn't really know what the meant by \"sound\" but I'm assuming that it means the characters voices, opening and ending, ect. I think that everyone's voices fit all the characters and that's including the subbed and dubbed too. As for the openings and endings, I loved them! I loved the fact that the openings were sung by the voice actors/actresses! It just made me love the anime even more!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 \\n\r\nI loved how each student in the class had a special part in each episode and not a single student in their class was forgotten. They all were shown throughout season 1 & 2. Unlike most anime, they tend to focus on a couple of the students in their class, but Assassination Classroom did the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime made my laugh so much! It has a lot of humor which I love and it also has most of my favorite genres in it (Action, Comedy, School, Shounen)! This anime took me less than a week to finish with both seasons and usually that means I love the anime. It's a nice anime to just for the laughs and also feels.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nThis is probably an anime I'll just go watch at random times of my day because of how amazing it is. I'll always love this anime because of how entertaining, lovable, laughable, and amazing Assassination classroom is. I can't believe it's over already ;-; It's time for me to get me some more merch (but it's not like I already have Assassination Classroom merch already  ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n",

            "content": "When I watched the first season of AnKyou, I was completely enthralled both in the unique storyline and in the OUTSTANDING character development. I honestly thought that there was nothing that AnKyou II could do within this story that could make it better. \r\nMan was I wrong. They pulled no punches with the second season, and had me feeling more emotions than I've felt in a while, despite this show not being a drama or a romance (though there is certainly some here and there). \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nFirst off, watch the first season! This isn't like White Album II where you can just skip ahead. Thereis valuable information and development in the first season and I cannot stress that enough. I gave the storyline a 10/10 overall because it was both creative and well-done, plus it had me on my seat every other episode. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is more childish for 90% of the show, and the other 10% is only when there is something crazy going on. While the art was incredible, it's very difficult for me to give shows a perfect score without the show essentially being centered on the art.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThey handle all forms of sound very well, not just music. You'll find if you rewatch this that most moments have their own unique sound, and the only repeated sounds or background musics are for evoking a sense of nostalgia from the first season.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI could give this show an 11/10 for its outstanding character development. Really, counting just the students and teachers, we have 31 characters, and I not only recognize them by name, but also know their pasts and their quirks, which is an incredible thing to do in just 47 episodes (counting season 1).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't really expand on this much. It made me feel pretty much every emotion in the book, for almost every character. I would hate or be irritated at a character in one episode, then be thoroughly entranced by them a few episodes later. One example is the principal of the school, which I will not explain, but those who have watched it will probably understand.\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI rated the first season a 9/10, but this season blew me away with almost every episode. It reminded me of things that I hadn't even consciously picked up on, but I knew they were there somehow. All the characters have the ability to act cool and perfect, but they all have flaws that show their humanity (even the ones who aren't even human)!\\n\r\nThis show is a must-watch, not just  for any shonen fan, but those who want to feel raw emotion too, emotion that can only come from making real connections with the characters. A truly amazing show!",

It greatly depicts how society works.\r\n4.) All characters are interesting with a clear motivation and backstory.\r\n5.) Each episode will keep you hanging until the end.\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu is one anime you should never miss out. I am always on the edge of my seat everytime I watch this anime. No wonder I finished 2 seasons in 2 days. There is no boring scene, nor an irrelevant scenario just to fill the anime. Every episode guarantees you a time of enjoyment, contentment and emotions.Each characters will spark your interest as they all have their own backstory. No characters are left out, each individual has their own development. Intense villains with a clear motivation as to how they block the protagonists will make you abhor them. Teachers who always gives lessons and values on how to solve your own obstacles by not stepping down to anyone. The students who I believe you will all get attached to, and watch as they build their individual characteristics as the series progress. I strongly recommend this anime as it brings out the fun in education and gives you hope in life while showing off action-filled scenes, and emotional episodes until the end.",

Assassination Classroom has two seasons where first season focuses the fun part and second season covered up the cruel reality. In this review I am just covering the second season only. \r\nWe all know from the first season what the main story is and I am skipping the specific parts like plot, characters, ost, animation and all those things because the second season continues to provide the excellent and unique touches that the first season showedus. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 has introduced many characters and many plot twist that I haven\u2019t saw it coming, the switch between comedy and serious part was truly one of the most strong point of this series. There is also one thing that stands out for this anime and that are this series has some stand out characters with Koro Sensei being the number one. As I said before, for ost and animation they are pretty unique so no need to discuss anymore in those parts. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: I think I will miss this series for a lot of reasons; it has comedy, great action and most importantly that emotion that can drive you in. This series has surprised me and finally they also wrap up the things very well. Assassination Classroom Season 2 is by far one of the best anime of the year. Finally, one thing to say, I will definitely miss Koro Sensei. \\n",

            "content": "The school bell rings and another session starts! Korosensei returns to Class-E to begin his lessons with a second season. While watching this anime I cannot help to remember my school days as an assassin. Yup, that\u2019s what Assassination classroom is all about: students of Class-E are assassins in the making and their target is their homeroom teacher, Korosensei. If Class-E fails to kill their teacher by the end of the year, they will all say good-bye to the earth because Korosensei will destroy it. \r\nStory: 10\r\nSadly being limited to only seasons contrary to how many of the fans had thought, the wild hunt continuesas Korosensei still tries to avoid his students\u2019 traps as they become more ingenious causing him to reveal more of his so rare weaknesses. It shows more creativity from the author\u2019s behalf already coming up with such a unique story.\\n\r\nAlready having the first season that focused mainly on plot we started off with season 2 slipping a bit away from the assassination in the first few episodes, light was given to the bond that was being formed by the students and their teacher. It has definitely lightened the mood since season 1 focused primarily on the traps and gimmicks on trying to defeat Korosensei. Despite what it may seem at the beginning everything got back on track until the grand finale that made this anime one deserving of a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThroughout the time period of the first season, the anime had little focus on the characters\u2019 backgrounds as it was only an introduction of the class. However, it was evident that the second season had more to it than continuing the teacher hunt. Season 2 began focusing on each character individually demonstrating their strong points and in which ways it could benefit the assassination. Well made characters were fleshed out. It\u2019s nice continuing the friendly vibe of how Class-E gets together to accomplish one objective.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are quite distinguishable and the colors used are vivid and vibrant. Really eye-catching. It was difficult to get any characters confused.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe music was well suited for the anime. Both openings and endings done were well suited for assassination classroom. The childlike voices that were used from 3 nen E-gumi Utatan was perfect to set off a good mood as openings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime that it has become one of my favorites, one that unlike many others reach out to me. It gave me memories of how I was back when I was a student. The story was much more meaningful than it appeared to be. Real lessons learned and to live by. If only our teachers back in school wouldn\u2019t have been boring and would have been more amusing like Korosensei. It would be a hell of a great time!",

After a certain point, you get so invested in the story that you cannot stop watching.\r\nThere are also several good plot twists that do seem to have a certain justification. They are not the typical \"let's shake theviewer\" plot twists. They're pretty well explained later on and they just add to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters just get a development so good that you can't help but love them all. They're all unique but not too unique. Realistic to bits, each one of them has to offer something.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the animation and the music, I don't think it got any better. It pretty much stayed the same as the first season, meaning that it was okay. Nothing exceptionally good, but it did make a good atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is one of the most satisfying ones I've ever watched. It really wraps up the story so greatly. It's certainly heartbreaking and touching but you can't think anything else than \"that's just how it had to end, no better way to do that\". Perhaps I shed one or two tears along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although a long one, it was a great journey with many great morals and awesome characters, plot and ending. Absolutely recommended to those who are not afraid to taste something weird and funny.\\n\\n\r\n\"The tentacles asked me what I wanted to be...\"",

The humor is pretty good, it had me rolling my eyes and laughing a lot. \r\nI enjoyed the art style immensely,especially the vibrant colors that you don't get to see that much in anime.

I loved every single piece. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked is that every character is a character - and in a classroom of some twenty kids, that's hard to achieve, but the show manages to make most of them very memorable. I also loved the fact that the show brought up some very heavy topics and discussed them, such as gender identity, parental and peer pressure, even mental illness. I loved it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I bawled like a child when it ended.",

It's probably one of the few shows that can balance its outlandish comedy with meaningful character interactions and plot progression, and have everything come full circle while delivering on simple themes.\r\nWhatever tone AssClass decides to take on, it handles it well. The serious moments are full of tension and engagement, the comedy moments are full of hilarity and great situations and the emotional momentsreally make you empathize with the characters and their backstories. I've gone so far as to recommend this show to non-anime watchers who come out loving the show. I feel there's something for everyone in this show, whether you're just trying to have a fun time or looking for a show with a great cast of characters that have amazing chemistry and really develop from start to finish. 10/10, rewatched 3 times, and one of my top 5 shows of all time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "----- Contains spoilers ------\r\nOverall a good series which is absolutely worth watching. The premise of the series is the best part, where you follow the students through a year after a monster with extreme speed and intelligence becomes their teacher. There is no authority in the world that can stop him from being their teacher, because they simply have no way of killing him. From there on out, its a free for all where the students at any time can try to kill him during school time. Meanwhile, he turns out to be an extremely good educator, and it is funny and touching to seehow the students grow as they become better in both academics and assassination.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel like the series could have been done better. I wish they spent more time developing some of the secondary characters, as I felt half of the class was just fill. Furthermore, I think the series would have been better off as a full-on comedy, rather than bringing some rather half-assed backstories for the drama. It was almost like the series didn't get comfortable with any genre in specific. Some might say this is a good thing, but myself it almost left me confused, because the balance wasn't there. Perhaps it could've worked better if done differently, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I felt the series had a very good ending. The last episodes were done beautifully, and it was a nice touch with the prologue episode at the end, which shows how the characters went on with their lives. What I would do to see a spin-off with Nagisa as a teacher in Scumville during the day, and assassin by night; but I guess thats not how the character turned out in the end.",

            "content": "If I must highlight the most outstanding point of this anime is not the comedy or the cast but rather the conveyed meaning behind this work. Behind the comedy-filled antics of the diverse cast, Assassination Classroom is a very good critique on education and society overall.\r\nThe story continues the premise of the first season, expanding onto the universe and the relationships within the classroom. The story is well-written. It is by no means a psychological meta-drama seinen, but for a shonen show it has a very direct story that never over convolutes itself, but still allows for development. \r\nAssassination Classroom is exceptional at pointing outmany issues within the educational system at surprisingly insightful level. From general concepts of high-pressure academically oriented asian cultures to minute details how in STEM memorization is not key to understanding. They are not basic concepts such as \"everyone has different strengths\", I must say they are truly meaningful.\\n\r\nThis part really stuck to me as someone who grew up in 3 very different education systems and found many flaws in them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is not exceptional, however action scenes are very well drawn and use of choreography, positioning and angles is certainly above the average. From assassination attempts to simple silly gag moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST to be honest is mediocre except for the last opening and ED. This show really has much better EDs than OPs for both seasons. But it works when it counts, during action scenes and the sound effects are very appropriate and only enhance the experience. In that sense, the sound fits the show well.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not every cast member is treated with the same screen time, enough was given that by the end of the show, no characters feel unfamiliar and the relationships between them feel natural. They are not complicated characters, but with such a wide cast they are just different enough to enjoy the show.",

            "content": "The second season of Assassination Classroom was one of the best anime experiences I've ever had in my life. I actually finished the show back in January but, I always rewatch every anime I watch to nitpick but, I had such a strong emotional connection to the show that I decided to take my time with it and, I can honestly say that it is just as good as I thought it was.\r\nThe story of Assassination Classroom takes place immediately after the ending of season one and, more or less, has the same plot. The students of class 3E are trying to kill their teacherKorosensei, while also trying to ace junior-high. The story explores various themes such as family and, doing the right thing but, this show does in such a unique way that differentiates them from any other show that's done this. The show also, does an incredible job of balancing comedy and, drama and, the transition to a more serious tone by the end of the show was seamless. The story brought out so many emotions ranging from shock to laughter to sadness. I firmly believe that this is the best school anime I have ever seen in my life and, like they said in the show there is no place like the Assassination Classroom. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in the show was beautiful. I absolutely love the character design in this anime, each character has their own distinct look making them immediately recognizable. The action sequences in this show are of cinematic quality matter of fact its miles ahed of whatever DC is trying to do with their movies. The music inboxed this show really surprised me because, season one only had one memorable song but, here we have two openings and, two ending and, all four songs are a joy to listen to. My personal favorite out of the four is the second opening Bye Bye Yesterday which I've probably listened to over a thousand times in the fast five months. The ending songs are also super soothing and, relaxing matter of fact they are the perfect song to listen to on the beach or before going to sleep they can make anyone achieve a zen like state.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really impressed me about Assassination Classroom is that they were able to balance all the characters. With twenty eight students, teachers and, others it could have been a disaster but, the show gave prominent development to almost every character some prime examples of development are Korosensei, Nagisa, Karma, Kayano, Professor Bitch, Itona and principal Asano just to name a few. Most of the characters experience growth throughout the show and, it shows how they progress from the start to the finish. Watching that was just beautiful. Also, when that final roll call is taken it is one of the most emotional moments I have ever seen in my life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Assassination Classroom more than anything Ive seen this year. The only thing that come close in terms of enjoyment was Infinity War. I loved the animation, I enjoyed having these characters be a part of my life for the past five months. I like how the comedy and, drama are balanced, the self awareness of the show, the characters and, most importantly I love how relatable this show can be not just to students but, anyone who feels down. My past college semester was a nightmare on a astronomical proportions therefore, I'm thankful that I had Assassination Classroom to shed some light during that time.\\n\\n\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "I swear, it's always the animes with the most off the wall premises that turn out to be great ones.  Assassination Classroom is no different.  The premise is absurd: a bunch of junior high kids are tasked with killing a goofy looking octopus monster who plans on destroying the world like he did the Moon.  It sounds silly and absurdist on the front of it, and at first, that's what Ansatsu Kyoushitsu plans to be.  Absurd humor, unrealistic plots and just a goofy, mid-level comedy about kids being trained to kill.\r\nBut, as it goes further into the story, it morphs intoso much more than that.  The backstories of several characters are amazingly well done and very dramatic.  Especially that of Koro Sensei himself.  Nagisa's back story also provides a good deal of drama and even a few tears with its resolution.  The bond that they grow to share and these stories provide good character depth so you're emotionally invested into the later episodes of the anime.   \\n\\n\r\nMost of all, with these types of absurd comedy animes, you have a certain, rather predictable conclusion for how things turn out in the end.  This anime will not conclude like you think it will.  Or, at least it didn't do what I thought it would do, and that's possibly the best part of the entire thing.  With most animes, it is hard for them to bring about gripping conclusions.  They start off well and then fizzle out into a mediocre finish.  Assassination Classroom is the opposite.  The humor is mediocre in the first couple of episodes, then increases in hilarity as the show goes on, then adds high levels of drama to the comedy, and then crescendos into an excellent finish.   \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend for fans of both comedy and drama to watch this series.  It may seem goofy on the surface, and it is goofy, but it is so much more.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter -10\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10\\n\r\nOverall - 9",

AC might not even prove such an all-time classic as Great Teacher Onizuka. For all its crudities, GTO was raw, rude and real. The very ingenuity of of AC's science-fiction plot renders it ever so slightly niche, and artificial, even as it engages those who buy into the premise much more strongly. As a story of education, we all know that the ex-bike ganger comes rather nearer to cold reality thansuperhuman tentacles. Of course, Naruto and Bleach have supernatural junk all over. But their strength is not in plots, which must always be slightly artificial, but in character. As Koike said, character makes or breaks.\\n\\n\r\nNot that characterisation in AC isn't exceptional. Koro-sensei is an excellent 'drunken master' character, with both powerful and hilarious moments; his design and physical comedy are a joy. The Principal is a charming and brutal villain. Most of the class could never be developed in depth; distinguishing each pupil with at least a few traits is impressive, and the overall appeal of the E-class is great. The series' comments on life, youth and education can be quite thoughtful. For a sample educational message, the E-class are painted as academic failures, but many are exceptionally talented, and all show individual skills. Rule-breaking, personal circumstances, and personal weakness, rather than simple laziness or idiocy (as confirmed by extra-series materials in more detail) are their real 'crimes'; with a teacher who really wants to help them, they can put a rocket into space, and overcome practically anything.   \\n\\n\r\n The key students are well characterised...but not quite well enough, especially in their relationships with each other. Nagisa and Karma have nothing like Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry. Nagisa shows himself early as a troubled soul, but the source of his trauma isn't explored or developed until almost the final act. The same goes even more for Kaede. The Principal's backstory is completely at odds with his insanely callous and perfectionist character, in my opinion. Irena could never deserve so much disrespect. And Koro-Sensei might make us laugh, but he simply doesn't have the sympathy or sense of struggle needed for a first-class Shonen protagonist; the main character of Naruto was not Jiraya. Quite simply, the focus of this series is plot, while shonen's real strength is in character. \\n\\n\r\nEven if the plot is original, dramatic and emotionally invested as only schoolkids overcoming adversity can make it...overcoming adversity is essential to Shonen as well. If only the characters doing it were a bit better developed. Though Karma's voice acting (and indeed Koro-sensei's) are stand out, Nagisa should have been an excellent character. Something about a quiet and troubled girly-boy who is in fact a 100% steel-nerved, danger-crushing lady-killing MAN rather appeals. His english voice actor is rather good as well. In short, the many anime fans who would take an original, dramatic plot with a great deal to say, over another episode of Bleach, will almost certainly love this very good anime series.",

Pretty straight forward story. Following the story you'll learn that its easier said then done, and you might trying to see these students try to kill there teacher over and over again is boring but how they do it and how they think of a new ways to do it is enjoyable in it self. That's not all the showteaches you, it also shows you that each person has their own specialties and that even if you can find your talent, you'll be able to see it if you have a unkillable teacher looking out for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great not bad, It had its own style and its wasn't to detailed, but the show isn't  as serious as it sounds to be. Its something fun and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, I loved each opening and ending. The background sound was also fitting and nothing really to complain about. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, man there are a lot of characters in this anime, its like theres a classroom full of em... But each character had there spotlight and you keep learning new things from the characters as the show goes on. How they interact with each other is also enjoyable to watch. Each character has their strength and weakness and you'll learn on your way. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime, I loved the message it had and how it brings a different light to the world around you, it show you that working with a team and a strong bond will help you in hard times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a really good anime, If you want to learn something like all the students in the class or just want to hang around for the funny moments then I recommend this anime to you. Don't worry if you like seeing action scenes this anime has that too. So everyone gets something they like.",

            "content": "STORY - 9\r\nART - 8\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nHonestly, before starting this season, Assassination Classroom didn't really stand out to me other than the oddly thematic combination of student and assassin. However, Season 2 will never cease to amaze me in exceeding all of my expectations towards it.\r\nOne year. The time to kill their teacher. A single year is small on the grand scale of the universe but when you narrow it down to a human perspective, then things will really start to become more significant. That was the backbone that made this season so memorable. All the times spent by the characterswith their teachers to hone their skills, develop stronger relationships with one another, and learn lessons together in the assassination classroom added up into creating an unbreakable bond of eccentric personalities. It was not a simple cruise as they encountered heaps of obstacles on their journey, whether that'd be other assassins or the discrimination from the main campus, but their development proved to be crucial all the way towards their final assassination. Now, let's ask some questions. How long can the facade of a student and assassin keep up? What constitutes a good education? What about assassins? The second semester not only answered the long-standing mystery of Koro-sensei, it brought new light into these themes through the use of backstories. Probably one of the key factors other than the great transition between light-heartedness and action is in the shock factor. Through subtle usages of foreshadowing from the first season and this one, the anime successfully pulled off dramatic execution on a couple of episodes. Romantic subplot is also included too and though it wasn't focused a lot, it was more than enough to become important to some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThen there was the technical section. The colors of a vivid, bright, and radiant tone definitely matched the comical side. Approach also changed to match the other side of this anime which was the assassin-related episodes that had considerably more darkness. With the blending of colors outlined by the bolded stroke, the art style justified in giving off that popped out feel in the characters, making it easier to focus on them and their actions. The action scenes were great, utilizing strong animation to get the energy across. While the character expressions may seem childish in nature, in the face of a fight, their expressions turned into that of an almost menacing determination. It is this opposite difference that really showed that their identity is that of both a student/teacher and assassin. All the learning experiences to find their own assassin style have not gone to waste. Apart from his uniqueness as a character, Koro-sensei can also be treated as a separate entertainment on his own because even his voice acting was uniquely entertaining to hear. There was a range of soundtracks that were used and although I didn't really paid attention to it until the end, the variance did placed all kinds of scenes in harmony. Like in the first season, I really loved the ending songs and the visuals that came with it. The blackboard and the chalk drawing reminded me of my younger days, and also the memories of the time spent with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nComing full circle, they are students at heart. Assassination is their bonds towards their not only beloved, but best ever teacher. All the education and lessons that this season gave to me was definitely a precious gift. Thank you Assassination Classroom, thank you Koro-sensei.",

            "content": "Before even watching the first season of Assassination Classroom, I didn't really know what to expect. I had only ever heard about it and decided to give it a chance. As this is the first review I've ever written for any anime, I have to say that Assassination Classroom really has had an impact on me. I loved the characters, they all grew on me with all of their quirks and flaws and endearing characteristics, I just kept wanting more. Koro-sensei's lessons to his students applied not only in their fictional lives but could be applied in real life as well, with his lessons aboutliving life to its fullest, supporting and being supported. When I finished that last episode, my heart felt like it was in such a funny place, a melancholic feeling of missing the characters and show immediately but also knowing that the show had ended in the perfect place, that there couldn't be any more to the story. \\n\\n\r\nAssassination Classroom personally was a rollercoaster, having bits where I just laughed with and at the characters, where I fell in love with the characters, the plot, getting completely immersed into the story, and crying along with the characters during tear-jerking moments. There are a few stories in any media, book, movie, or show, that have left me with such a feeling as Assassination Classroom has and it is safe to say that this show has ingrained itself into my life and will be remembered for years to come. It's hard to say what has made Assassination Classroom such a ride for me, but all I can say is, it will surely leave you feeling something if you watch this show to the end.",

            "content": "This might just be the best teacher-student relationship anime i've ever watched.I can hardly find the words to express my overflowing emotions at this moment. \" A great teacher , opens the mind and touches the heart of the students\" , as a student myself , never have i been able to find such dedication in a teacher , the one who puts his all to connect with his students on a personal level, one who brings out the potential which lies deeply within the student , one who resolves conflict and delivers endless encouragement. That is Koro-Sensei. I'll be writing an overall review forthe 2 seasons since i assume it only make sense for those to watch the 2nd season after the first.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nA bunch of misfit students gets streamed into a class . specifically \" E class\" , through the woods and bumpy hills ,  situated far away from the original campus , the students are discriminated in every way possible and are forced to endure their agonising school life through harsh and dilapidated environments. These students are however tasked with rather unorthodox job, by the government , of killing a yellow , slimy octopus with a scholars cap, whom it's super speed match that of mach 20, and will blow the world in a year's time. little did they know , that \"monster\" turned out to be their homeroom teacher. Whoah ,now that's \\n\r\nnot what you see everyday. And from there, everyday adventures and life take it from there. Sci-Fi , Romance , Comedy . name it all , albeit Assassination classroom is themed with cliche genres . the premise however takes a stab to it , and added spice of originality to it. Despite it's contradictory title , the main attraction of the series is actually its comedy , executed at precise times and unexpected moments with essence of freshness with minimal blood and gore which is to be expected from \"assassination \" type themes. Koro-Sensei's variety of expressions are rather amusing and hilarious which i find it always quite delightful and appealing to watch.  This series crafts a \"slice-of-life\" mood as the story pointing randomly at different directions at time ,  whereby students are taken to places they've never explored beyond the school. Once again, i would like to emphasise the originality of the plot and for \\n\r\nthat , a 10 is very well deserved . \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI prioritise graphics a lot , it's one of the factors that make plays a decisive role in whether i drop and anime or not. The characters and scenery are outlined by dark and bold black lines which sets a rather pronounced contrast to the bright light and colourful gradient inside the outlines , very much like the art in \"Attack of Titan\" but more distinct in the shading. The animation is fluid with smooth frame rates , like like Koro-Sensei's wiggly tentacles. The art its able to fit with its current situation , making characters look eerie/hideous and scary during dark moments , or setting a mist of monotonous yellow/beach-ish colour when reminisicing the past. but since I benchmarked the art of notable Anime such as Steins Gate or Kotonoha no Niwa to this , i'll have to limit it to 9 points.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the ending , the build-up is so intense and sentimental that my overflowing emotions erupted at the climax point , makes my hair stand up and goosebumps everywhere as i think about all that they have gone through, the fun they had and the adventures and journeys they ventured. The OSTs were fitted perfectly , flowing smoothly with every scene. Unfortunately, i did not find it's opening to my appeal except for it's over-enthusiastic signature dance that was repetitive throughout. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation : 9\\n\r\nThe premise is exceptionally good at characterising as it brings out the inner personality , monologue and the past for most characters . Especially Nagisa , Koro-Sensei the principal and so on. It manifested the dark/ conflicted past which becomes the reason for the behaviour of specific characters while successfully displaying the weakness and strength of every individual. Each one has a distinct trait of its own and made each individual stand out. Assassination classroom focuses heavily on the characters and does a decent job with it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :9\\n\r\nIt made me laugh so hard , made my tears flow( It doesn't happen to me often) , sympathise with the protagonist and sometimes the antagonist , or even want to give the character a good punch in the face. I really enjoyed this show , it made me feel like i was part of the class. I could relate and connect with each and every characters , it has definitely been a wonderful journey , and will become an anime i would still enjoy watching even after years.  It left me a sense of nostalgia of my primary school days and a post anime depression syndrome which i am trying hard to cope with right now . Thanks for the emptiness , for that , i had one point deducted ;) \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9 \\n\r\nAs ludicrous as the synopsis may seem , i used to think that this anime could be one of those typical stereotypical cliched themed classroom , and was wrong to judge it . Its has definitely made it to my top 10 best anime list and strongly recommend it .influenced the way I will live and think  for the rest of my life . It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse , as  In that sense, no other anime can compare, as no other anime has provided an equivalent reaction on my part. Now then , would you embark on a feels trip ? :)",

This last episode was very nice, seeing everyone grow up and following their dreams, it's just as Koro-sensei wanted. I was hoping they could save him somehow, but whatever now, I'm not going to complain as this outcome was just fine.\r\n-Art (9/10)\r\nNothing unusual from the first season, The characters are well designed, the backgroundswere blending amazingly with the atmosphere, Nothing here to complain about.\\n\\n\r\n-Story (9/10)\\n\r\nMid-schoolers are assigned to a mission to save the world, simply killing their teacher before the next march, the students grew attached to their teacher with time, as they were always consulting him asking for help and advice more than they practiced assassinating him. The plot progression was really good, nothing too rash or cheesy (not most of the time at least).\\n\\n\r\n-Characters (9/10)\\n\r\nLots of unique characters, where we see an even greater character development from that of season 1, Seriously, the initial class E is no more, everybody got an enhancement in their characteristics and treats,\\n\\n\r\n-Music (7/10)\\n\r\nNothing remarkable here, just like season 1, the music fits the atmosphere, the openings and ending tho were beautiful, all of them, the sort of songs that you hate at the Begining, but grow loving them later.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI started this series as a silly show based on somewhat a joke, but I discovered what was shadowed beneath the continuous humor later on. I loved every single reference, especially One Piece's, the humor was great, and the feels were as hard as someone using Bosushoku Haki ;),\\n\\n\r\n-Overall (8.6/10)\\n\r\nI'll never regret watching this, I had it on my list for months now, and I've been avoiding it on purpose fearing that it might disappoint, but have I been deceived into jumping to conclusions, I absolutely adored this show, it had many influences, and definitely would recommend it to people.",

            "content": "This anime doesn't need another review by me seeing as how I am also going to be praising the living shit out of this show like all the other people on MAL. \r\nBut honestly who could blame us? This show was fucking amazing, it knew what its strong points were and went with it. It didn't waste time trying to make something out of their weak points, and just stuck to what it was good at. \r\nIt stuck to the amazing character development that this show had going for it. In the span of around 50 episodes, you build such a deep and strong bondwith the characters that you almost feel like as if you're a part of the class. This probably has to do with how well the characters are executed in the series. Their interactions, and everything about them. All those side characters aren't just side characters, they have their own back story and their own reason for why they're in the \"End\" class. It makes you start feeling so deeply for the characters, that when shit does go down you can root with them. \\n\\n\r\nThis strong point of Assassination Classroom only gets stronger in the 2nd season, and you're also able to see more depth in various characters. Also showing the characters displaying various emotions, making them feel more like actual characters. Another added bonus of the series is the other elements of the 2nd season. The thickness of the tension, the heaviness of the subtle drop in mood, it all steadily comes together to prepare you for how real this story gets. \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the characters feel, you start to feel it too. I don't want to spoil much for those who haven't seen it so I won't say more. But let's just say that everything that this show gives you starts to bundle up and wrap itself neatly towards the very end. All those feelings that you didn't know were culminating while you were watching the series starts to bubble up, and you start to physically feel it. \\n\\n\r\nAnother element of the 2nd series is that the boring gaps in between character development segments with enjoyable and humorous scenes. This happens more so late in the 2nd season though, not too much in the 1st.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also teaches you valuable lessons. It shows you that these group of kids, despite being put in the \"End\" class and being called \"losers\" and stuff actually had valuable worth in them, just like everyone does. Not to mention Koro-sensei's lessons but most of his lessons went over my head to be honest. Still though, because Koro-sensei was always teaching the kids various lessons, it was still able to create this bonding feeling for the characters in the show and for YOU, the viewer. You might not even realize it but trust me you will when it gets to be later in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, this show isn't perfect. It did have its weak points, the art COULD be seen as something bad as it isn't how most animes are drawn. The plot was pretty weak, but the thing is is that the show knows this. It doesn't try to make it grandiose and try to save its already weak plot, it instead builds around it so that it suits the shows strong points. And honestly, it actually gives you a twirl for a pretty big surprise towards the very end in terms of the characters all coming together nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThis show simply knows what it's doing, and knows what to build on and what not to. Because of that I highly commemorate this show for anyone searching for a show about character development. Although that sounds simplistic, in essence, that's what made this show great and after you watch it, you'll understand why too. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Whether we enjoyed them or not, the years we spend in the classroom are some of the most influential times of our lives. This is where we mature, being taught both from the lessons of others as well as from the mistakes of our choices. Koro-sensei's assassination classroom is no different, but unlike the mundanity of the daily routine we call school, watching the students of Class 3-E grow up and tackle the extraordinary challenges that face them was an absolute joy. \r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu's second season continues the story of Class 3-E as they sharpen their skills in order to assassinate the yellow-tentacled teacher Koro-sensei.While the first few episodes follow a similar format to the anime's first season\u2014being a more episodic approach generally focusing on the individual students and how Koro-sensei teaches them\u2014the second season seems to have a greater sense of focus. Having given most of the students their time to shine, the story instead focuses on the greater narratives of the classroom as a whole. Though I did enjoy the more disconnected tales of each student in the previous season, I believe that this stronger focus on the overarching plot makes this second season much stronger narratively than the first. For the most part, I feel that this season did a fantastic job on the execution of its story, though the second half is definitely a bit stronger than the first. Most importantly, as this season does reach the ending of the series, the climaxes of both the education and the assassination sides of the story were excellent; the former made a solid conclusion to two important rivalries, while the latter was so full of emotion that I was moved to tears. It was an extremely enjoyable ride, and I was enthralled almost every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I say almost because it wasn't perfect. The biggest flaw of Ansatsu Kyoushitsu's second season is in its pacing, specifically in the first quarter of the series. It is noticeably rushing to get to the meat of its story, and though thankfully it finds its groove by around the second quarter, it's a shame since some of the stories seem genuinely interesting; unfortunately, the time just isn't given to flesh it out and make it as good as it could have been. \\n\\n\r\nWhile we're on the topic of flaws, the anime's other greatest weakness is in one of its villains, who comes across as fairly shallow and one-dimensional in his portrayal as a completely unlikeable character. This is only emphasized further in that the show's other villains bring with them a fair amount of depth and complexity to the narrative and that he is technically the \"main villain\" during the latter half of the series. Thankfully, by that point he's paired up with one of the more interesting antagonists, so it becomes a bit balanced out in the end. Though I've dedicated a whole section to these flaws, they actually weren't all that detrimental to my enjoyment of the show, since the former is dealt with fairly quickly, and then the latter takes a backseat to everything else going on. \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the shallowness of one of the antagonists, I really enjoyed the rest of the character work in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. Though it doesn't spend each episode developing a different character like the first, the greater focus of the narrative allows it to spend more time on the six characters we're most familiar with, being the main student trio\u2014Nagisa, Karma, and Kayano\u2014and the three teachers\u2014Karasuma-sensei, Bitch-sensei, and most importantly, Koro-sensei. One of the anime's greatest strengths is most definitely the focus on Koro-sensei's journey as a teacher as he comes to terms with the mistakes of his past, coming together with an extremely satisfying conclusion at the end. Moreover, the other five characters receive strong development as well, and I feel that this tighter focus on fewer characters has made Ansatsu Kyoushitsu's second season stronger in turn. But just because the focus is on these six doesn't mean the rest of the characters are ignored. Many of the other characters get their moments as well, and though some stand out more than others (as expected of a cast this large), none of them just get thrown completely under the rug. Outside of the classroom, some other characters shine as well, including Kunugigaoka's principal, his son, and an assassin that gives the class a run for its money. All in all, I really enjoyed the time I spent with most of the characters in this show, and I feel it did a pretty good job at balancing its cast in spite of its size.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the show doesn't particularly stand out, but it does its job well. The animation from what I could tell was well done for the most part, lacking any serious dips in quality. In the same vein, the soundtrack, while lacking any particular track that completely stood out, did its job of enhancing the emotions during the scenes effectively. While there's nothing groundbreaking here, the show definitely isn't held back by any artistic faults, and it effectively uses both aspects to enhance the experience, rather than showcasing them in any way.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately though, just running through the different aspects of this show can't really say just how much I loved Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. In spite of its flaws, the way everything comes together to produce something so enjoyable is amazing. Watching these students grow up as they take on the seemingly impossible tasks in front of them is a thrill, and every plot thread has a satisfying ending to boot. An improvement from the first season in almost every way, the second season of [i]Ansatsu Kyoushitsu[/i] was a joy to experience, and just as they will for the students of Class 3-E, the teachings and antics of Koro-sensei will stay with me forever.\\n",

            "content": "Wow, how do I start with this one? For me, Assassination Classroom is one of those shows like Gintama. It's a comedy, you get to laugh a lot for the most part. But, the walls start to thin out, it shows the core of it and that's where you just lose it.\r\n If you told me I'd shed tears for an octopus and his students before I got to this show, I'd call you crazy. Koro-sensei is truly the heart of this little series. If you ask me for my opinion, the animation and the music score aren't all that great but what kept mewatching for these two seasons are the characters. Like Koro-sensei, they've undergone so much growth and development, and seeing that bond with their beloved teacher, I don't understand how someone who has watched this show would not feel any pain or sadness. \\n\\n\r\nThis series made me feel like I'm a part of the classroom, bonding and uniting with all the others. If you think of how they first started, all divided and disoriented, you're just going to be crying in amazement and pride that this is the Assassination Classroom they have all worked hard to become. In the end, it is a bittersweet story that would surely touch you if only you allow it. Rest in peace, Koro-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode, for me, was the best finishing touch they could ever give. And, it's also pretty realistic how they weren't all able to get together. Life makes people grow apart physically perhaps but it is in one's choice to stay emotionally connected. The way they showed how they've grown would really make you feel emotional and just ultimately satisfied with how they've become.\\n\\n\r\nMore than anything, what's important for me when delving into a story is the heart. If mine isn't in it, then I'd likely give it a low score. Emotion is key and this series about growing and learning is nothing but exactly that.",

            "content": "The first season of Assassination Classroom was good, but I didn't really like it as much as this season. That's because this season was greater than its last season. Of course, this is the conclusion of Assassination Classroom. Thus, all questions are answered in a good way (Not half-ass).\r\nI maybe reviewing its second season, but there'll be a bit of comparison between this and its first season to convince some people to watch this series now.\r\nSTORY/CHARACTERS:\r\nThe story starts of with Koro-sensei (Not his real name), chops the moon down to a permanent crescent. He then became a teacher at Kunugigaoka Middle School's Class 3-E, becausehe wanted to. The students on that section were assigned to kill this mysterious creature and they will be awarded TEN BILLION YEN. However, the mysterious creature is simply indestructible (Or is it?). By the time they graduate, Koro-sensei will destroy planet Earth (Or will he?).\\n\\n\r\nLet me just clear this up - Koro-sensei is not a villain. SURPRISE? Not really. Clearly he isn't judging by his actions in the first season. My complaint on the first season is that I didn't really see on where the story is going, but this season really answered that and I totally understood everything on why this and that happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't only focus on Koro-sensei. The story also tries to focus on other characters like the students and even the principal of the school. The series tries its best not to leave anyone behind. However, there's one thing that I'll admit - some characters on this series are forgettable. Again, the flaws I found on the first season can still be found here. The characters I'm referring to are the students. Despite the story trying to give them time to shine, they're pretty much forgettable (I'm not talking about Nagisa, Karma, Kayano, etc. of course. They had a lot of big moments on the story).\\n\\n\r\nNot a lot of manga readers will be at least satisfied from its second-half of this season because there are indeed parts of this season that were skipped from the manga. I never read the manga, but I heard it was skipped. For me, I don't think you should complain about that. This wasn't badly adapted. The essence of the story is still there and because of it, the story still had sense. I'm pretty sure they only skipped the minor parts from the manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\r\nI thought the animation is amazing. The coloring of it and the fight scenes are pretty great. For the soundtrack, it's pretty good. It has it's ups and downs. There are some soundtrack that are good while some are decent. For the opening, the first opening which is QUESTION was good, but the second opening is better. I just felt more attached to it and that's probably because on how the second-half went down. The first ending theme is okay, but the second ending theme however is freaking emotional. It is one of the best ending themes. You can feel my heart strings being played because of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show. Though its comedic moments are okay (Some are a hit while some misses. It isn't the best comedy show), the drama of this show really stood out. No, I'm not one of those people that gives a show a 10/10 because they cried buckets *Cough* Angel Beats *Cough*, but the execution was good and I do admit, I cried which is rare (I don't cry a lot when I see sad scenes). It's amazing to see the student's journey with Koro-sensei until the end.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10",

            "content": "Story: the premise is interesting on its own, though when you  delve further into the 2nd season... this anime is breathtaking. The story is full of twists and turns, some I will admit that I didn't see coming. The pacing of the story did well compared to many other animes out there. 10\r\nArt: I watched this anime with my mother in the room, who despises anime, and even she complimented the way this looks. It is absolutely stunning! From the character designs to the scenery... I just loved it! 10\r\nSound: I believe that the soundtrack for the second season beats out the first. Ilove Question and Bye Bye Yesterday. (One makes me cry more than the other...). It isn't my all time favorite soundtrack but it is definitely up there! The music goes quite nicely with the scenes. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is something that I could go on about. Firstly, you are able to learn more about the past of Korosensei. (That made me cry too).  I was impressed with the fact that they were able to introduce little things about the background classmates, even if it was one simple fact. The final thing that I loved was that you could feel their bond. Heck, even I thought that I was apart of class E-3. 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I binged the entire series (excluding Koro Q!) in the span of five days. I think it goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. Its perfect. It goes about and beyond for me. It is such a shame that whenever I ask people if they have seen or read it that they haven't.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The more the story goes, the more I was entranced by it. It was SO good that I refused to watched the final 5 episodes because I didn't want it to end. In fact, every time I hear the opening songs to the series (the second last and the final openings), I would burst into tears because I was THAT attached to it. \r\nAfter watching tons and tons of animes and rewatching a few masterpieces I really enjoyed, Assassination Classroom is definitely placedin my Top 3. This anime makes you feel like you're part of the classroom and Koro-sensei is your teacher. In fact, I've even learnt a few things from Koro-sensei because of this anime. And it sounds silly, but I really wish a teacher like Koro-sensei exists in the real world. It would benefit students a lot from an amazing teacher like him. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, this series takes the cake and you won't regret watching it.",

It was very well done and touching. I feel that i felt the same nostalgia from watching their one year together when the students started thinking back. The last ep was also a nice conclusion. 7yr skip to see what the students would be doing. yea it\u2019d be nice if theres a side story on nagisa and his students or something.",

This is an exciting anime that you can definitely recommend because of the battle scenes, school stuff, personal life, motivations, ambition and many more. It brings action and school genre into a higher level which could make you say \" Hey,I want to be part of Class E and be  the one to assassinate Koro Kensei\".

Like deepening it. Even though the failing E class is having rough times, and hard opponents they still strive for a better grade so that they may live a successful life. Since the start of season two, lots have already happened.\r\n     I liked how each and every character gets a piece of thespotlight.

I usually meet good teachers), this anime certainly hits home and deserves a special mention.\r\nAs the students of  the good-for-nothing Class E continue their attempts at \"assassinating\" their teacher, Koro Sensei, they come to realize not only the skills they gained during the endeavors, but most importantly their deepened relationships to their peers and their teacher. With Koro Sensei and each other as guidance, they start to learn their own differences and strengths, cherishingtheir newfound confidence and moral values. But as the old saying goes: \"All good times eventually come to an end.\" -- what are the last remaining life lessons that lie in store for Class E, and how do they plan on going about their \"assassination\" of their beloved teacher?\\n\r\nWith a good mix of banter and profound moments, the anime skillfully juggles around a whopping 30 or so characters, protraying each of their personal growths and their relationships with the rest of the class, including the different teachers. The anime wastes no chance to provide advices for life here and there while not sounding too patronizing.\\n\r\nOn the technical side: The series is well-animated with its own unique drawing style. Also props to Fukuyama Jun for doing a stellar job voicing the mischevious Koro Sensei.\\n\r\nThis anime definitely made me realize the little things and relationships I have around me and reminded me that I can learn from each person I meet. It definitely highlighted the sense of accomplishment when you see someone that you have been helping grow-- something that I personally resonate with-- and at the same time, the reciprocity of learning something from someone else.",

            "content": "I write this review with a hole in my heart. It exists because I just finished a series I have adored for over a year, and what a finish it was. I am so happy to have gone on this wild ride, as it happened to be one of the best of 2016 to this point, and I'd wager a bet it will remain one of the best.\r\nI began this series on a whim. I was about to travel halfway across the United States and wanted something that would satisfy me for the 4+ hours it would take. I had heard some great thing aboutseason one and decided I'd give it a shot. At first, I can't say I was too impressed. I enjoyed the first 7 episodes, but there wasn't enough to leave me wanting more, so I took an extended break from continuing. When I resumed, I realized it was a much better show than I was giving it credit for. I finished the first season, and while I thought the ending was poor, and some characters were barley given any screentime, I really enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 greatly improved on the things I didn't like, and took all the things I loved and made them better.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 did an amazing job of capturing the emotion of knowing that a beloved mentor and friend of the kids in Korosensei wasn't what they thought he was, and that his deadline was quickly approaching. The comedy was still around and was used in ways that didn't damper the serious moments that come throughout the second half of episodes. Twists and turns abound, as many unexpected things are revealed to help develop characters and teach us of their motives and desires. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show shines is in it's characters. Every character is given a likable personality, as well as personal conflicts that need to be resolved. Some characters take center stage, but all the characters are integral to the overall story and how the emotional payoff is delivered. Korosensei in particular is amazing in the sense that no matter the situation, he has a lesson prepared for the students he so greatly cherishes. All of the characters have varying traits to them, and sometimes they clash, but in the end, they all end up banding together and becoming a tight knit group when the final moments are upon them. This series makes you care about it's characters, every single one of them, making the ending an emotional ride.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnsatsu Kyoshitsu (Assassination Classroom) Season 2 is one of those series that get better and better with every episode, and the emotional payoff at the end is so bittersweet, that it makes it a must watch for anyone that likes this type of genre. Weather it be Comedy, Action, Sci-Fi, or even Drama, this show has you covered and then some. It is no doubt a 10/10\\n",

Season 1 initially wouldn't catch much attention, but after all the story buildup, season 2 is a blast. Koro-sensei is definitely a sensei many would like to have. Not only it has comedy to laugh at, the whole story-line is well carried out, except for slight rush at the ending. Still, the ending has it's proper impact it made my eyes water.\r\nI am particularly amazed at the character development. From the normal plain looking student to main characters in class 3-E, they are all well developed, insteadof black or colored shadows or still images for the school mates or classmates, each student in the class of 28 and even their schoolmates and rivals has proper airing space for development.  The art is also well drawn, unlike those of naruto shippuden in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe mix of genres for this anime is just great. I really enjoyed both seasons, and the anime is really worth the time.",

            "content": "It's finally end. The assassination class must graduated and they left me with tears running from my eyes. Yup. I'm crying guys. I'M CRYING. After two seasons attached to this series, I must say good bye to our beloved teacher and class 3-E.\r\nThis second season started with a little quick paced story of first cour to give the second cour a foreshadow. Just like the first season, this season's first cour started with small stories to add the fuel for the second cour. Sadly, for me the first cour felt a little bit rushy. I really wished for new character developments from the minor characterof class 3-E but in the end, I didn't get too much of them. What I'm thinking is that for an anime revolving around a class where the whole class taking the role of assassinating their teacher, they should really have more characterization for each class member even its small. Say, we might have a major character development in Itona Horibe and his gang (Terasaka's gang) but we didn't have any development in other minor character like the spectacled boy (I think his name is Takebayashi) or that Kouki Mimura guy. Nevertheless, this series still made me cry with major character shift in the second cour which affect the ending really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this second season is worth to watch because they nailed the ending perfectly and perfectly made me cry like a baby in episode 24. I wish they make a spin-off story of 3-E after junior high school life, but I heard that won't happen which make me kinda sad but a bit grateful because I'm okay with leaving the series end like this. I think this is a very great ending to do some fanfiction! Hahaha...",

            "content": "Somehow the simplest and most ridiculous of premises can weave into such a moving tale. I watched Ansatsu Kyoushitsu straight from season 1 to finish, and this series really takes you through a journey like you're one of the students in the classroom. First you share the skepticism of the class when they encounter a beast of a teacher, then you revel in their progress and the light hearted comedy that ensues throughout the first season. The show then unravels the deep, inner motivations behind the characters in the seemingly carefree classroom drama - even its villains - and even its wrap up is asovercompensatingly complete as Koro-sensei's to his students. \\n\\n\r\nI've rated the typical categories, and so have many reviewers, but let me give a few special reasons why this anime has overtaken Cowboy Bebop to become the best anime of all time in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\n1. It knows how to take its time. Animes these days are either too slow (those infinite episode ones where every dramatic development takes up a full 20 minutes) or too fast (those 12 episode 'testers' that squeeze the drama into a limited time frame, usually at the expense of a complete ending). Ansatsu Kyoushitsu speeds up and even omits various processes we can fill up for ourselves, but more importantly knows when to linger on moments that are very important. One particular moment has every single member of the class featured with a reaction shot, differing from student to student. Perhaps not every student has their own feature episode, but their characters are visibly rich, dynamic and developed.\\n\\n\r\n2. It's highly relatable and relevant. Lots of themes explored that school-going youths can identify with. How children feel paralysed in the choice between fighting for individual freedom and feeling indebted to an overly controlling parent. The zero-sum game of unhealthy competition - academic or beyond. Even how to deal with a society that never seems to go your way. Every episode is a lesson both for the students and the viewer - and I have never seen these complex issues delivered so easily before. \\n\\n\r\n3. The genre is so hard to classify - a ridiculous setting which coaxes you into taking it seriously - that at a certain point of time you are compelled to suspend your judgment, and thats when things get really funny. Sometimes you will pull yourself out to ask yourself 'why the hell is this happening in front of me' and that weirdness contributes to the show's hilarity. \\n\\n\r\n4. This show really sells the profession of teaching. What amount of power and conviction it takes to subdue and educate a bunch of unreceptive students? The 1st season had me wondering. Its like Saitama deciding to use his powers to teach. But the 2nd season also illustrated that no amount of power is 'enough', but just going in that direction - to teach and fail and learn and wait, and embrace the meaningful journey for both yourself and those around you - is what makes a good teacher out of anyone. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, its a light-hearted, interesting and utterly complete dramedy that anyone can enjoy.",

Why is it terrible you may ask? Because even though we are all hoping and praying, we know what is going to happen.   This season however did lose the majority of its hilarity that made season 1 so great, and they try to develop more of an emotional attachment to the characters, that happy go lucky first season, which if i had to say, would be my second complaint of the season.  ThoughI understood why they switched gears, I personal grew more attached to the characters from the shenanigans of season 1 which made me watch the entire season in 2 days.  \\n\\n\r\n Though i'm sure its wasn't the first (my first to go this route),  I call this the Trigun effect.  You start with nothing but jokes and crazy adventures and slowly move into the more serious tones that ultimately highlight  the main undertones and premise of the show.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it was a solid show that i will never forget and because I wish we could see more adventures from Koro-sensei, this is why this is a terrible season.   If i got my way, it would be a top 20 show for me",

The plot wasn't really predictable although you could've got an overall idea to where it was going, especially with the identity of our favourite teacher, but it isn't really that deep, comparing to Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood or something. It is of course more depending on the characters and the humour.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a really well-fletched out Anime with great animations, art, sound and story, which you really can enjoy and have a laugh with if you are not searching for a heavily story-driven Anime.",

            "content": "Let me give you a quote from my review of season 1-\r\n\"I imagine that the next season is going to be even better. Knowing that the second season wraps it all up, stories will be told, attempts will be made and bonds will be broken. I can only hope that it ends well\"\r\nHa....Haaaa...Haaaaaaa... Well f*ck.\r\nSeason 2, in my opinion, is far superior to the first season. There is depth, character development and it refined many of the faults I mentioned when reviewing the first season.\r\nNow, I could gush over how amazing I thought this was, but I can tell I'm gonna do that in theupcoming paragraphs... So lets get right into it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nHoly mother of f*ck. I thought that the story in the first season was a bit like Roald Dahl's book 'The Twits'. If you haven't read it, basically, 2 parties prank each other over and over, without any significance to the big picture. The second season of Assassination Classroom is completely different. The plot is fast moving and on point. Not only that but it concludes (which doesn't happen often with these kinds of shows). \\n\\n\r\nActually, the plot is so fast-moving that its actually kind of hard to discuss. Just know that everything that happens has the absolute payoff that you wanted from the first season, even the school stuff, which I bashed in the first season for overriding the general plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nThe art and sound are as ace as the scoring indicates. While there isn't any time when they completely take control but they do an incredible job of adding context to the story.\\n\\n\r\nCan I just say for a second: The second opening is probably the most in depth, crushing and fantastic opening for a number of reasons besides taste in music. For starters, it just screams conclusion, the whole thing is a massive roller coaster of sentiment and nostalgia. It tells an entire story, first page to last, without even spoiling a moment of it. As well as this, the illustration does such a good job of slipping in so many snippets of history that you can't help but feel sad that its spelling out the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nThis season is swelling with character development. To describe it all in depth would take an eon. The class are so much than they were when season 1 started. There is also a lot more focus on Nagisa, Karma and Kuro-Sensei, however they all deserve credit for being diverse, interesting, intelligent and for all having their moment in the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about Kuro-Sensei independently, the 'nice guy' build up really pays of in this season. They really push the fact that he cares about his class and it forces you to question how or if they could go through with killing him if they needed to. Kuro-Sensei is one of my favorite characters, one you can actually learn from and appreciate. He becomes a role model... Something that makes this show that much better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nEnjoyment is something you have to appreciate in the long run. I loved every minute of this anime despite the fact that when graduation season comes around it can really sting. Really sting. There are only a few things that have stung me in the past. This is one of them, because the ending is executed so flawlessly and satisfyingly. Yet, in the long run, after all the stinging, you know that you enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nI may give many things a 10, I love a lot of shows, I watch a lot of good shows. I like a lot of cheesy things. But this... this is something that everyone can get behind, with its comedy, its story, its characters. I genuinely cannot recommend anything more confidently.\\n",

            "content": "Assassination Classroom Season 2, arguably there's a low bar to reach here from season 1 so without anything else said let's get into it:\r\nStory\r\nSo there's a very solid outlined story with some true potential in here, a tragic helpless man turned monster who tries to push through it all. A boy struggling to grasp for confidence and stuck in the middle of it all with his mother and school and a whole cast of supporting characters that have their own little nuances.\r\nHowever I stop my praise there because while it has solid foundations the issues in the details, Koro-Sensei has at best a basic storyof falling for Aguri which did move me however didn't blow me out of the water and his supposed flip-flopping in feelings was strange. Overall this story was acceptable if 1 dimensional with the new Reaper having nothing to contribute past being the poor victim turned villain by an evil mans actions. Bland\\n\\n\r\nNagisa has a decent story arc that balances his issues at home with his mother and school in a fairly raw light. She is so awful to him that she is willing to slam his head against a desk in response to him wanting a different school, that's fine it just shows how evil she is now will she change? Oh yeah she does after a quick 30 minute chat with Koro Sensei because he's the great good guy now, remember? We can't be having this character show split feelings no, everybody is completely evil then the wonderful Koro-Sensei turns them completely good and great that's how things work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the character of class 3-E or should I say the individual quirks that take your mind off the basic templates that are there, cool confident bad boy who secretly cares for others. Bully turned good, Girl everybody likes and nobody at all can ever have an issue with, Poor Kid paying his way through school while supporting his family. Give me something new.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this it truly is an outline issue that could be clearly fixed and so I won't rag on it too hard even though I maybe have. Story + Character, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't something that usually bothers me so I'll keep it snappy, the art style is nice and crisp if not a little expected of the shonen genre. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP 1 didn't really stand out to me but OP 2 was great and makes this category the best in my review 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this, it was paced acceptably with a few minor issues at the end, it had some moments of emotion and a couple cool fights the one's coming to mind being Karma vs Nagisa and of course the ending fight. If you just want action there's better suitors but if you don't need much this will suffice\\n\\n\r\nI think that moments despite being possibly 1 dimensional are kept dramatic and tense. The actual factor of whether I was bored with this show is a no. There were certain unexpected plot twists that provided these and just all around wholesome moments. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't watch this kind of stuff normally it won't get you started but if you want a run of the mill school shonen it's not the worst thing you could land on. If you watched season 1 and thought it was alright you will probably prefer this more but don't hold out if you don't like season 1. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\r\nIt's case by case but for a fan of the genre you will be satisfied and yeah I would probably say it's not a bad experience, you will feel for characters and some parts of the story are interesting but don't expect to be crying your heart out. \\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly what I'd call fine, it's not really good, not really bad. You'll enjoy it for the time of watching it but you won't be thinking about it in years and that's OK.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

I don't think anything will top the emotional investment that I had by the finale, and man did the finale know how to bring back the nostalgia. \r\nThis show actually taught me a lot, even if I don't know it. There are many great themes of acceptance, tenacity and love all throughout the show. No other show has done this for me as much as Assassination Classroom. Koro Sensei is just such a complex and emotional character that is the embodiment of the model teacher everyonewishes they had. (He actually made me want to be a teacher a little bit.) \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with this show was the animation, although a very small one. I felt like it was lacking in some places and isn't anything to write home about. I think that if this show were to have some top notch animation It would be a contender for my favorite anime. Again, a very small issue but one that was noticeable for me throughout the length of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Koro Sensei.",

The story is fantastic and everything it throws at you, even if it doesnt makes sense at the time, has some sort of logical reason. It keeps you hooked in and doesnt let go. The art is very good at all times and is never bad. It can be a little better but its still great and fits very well into everything else. All of the sound tracks and effects and all of it are just great and are putin the right places at the right times. You get to feel for each and every character to an extent that you can feel for them and understand it. The entire anime was a blast first and second season with the second season keeping me amazed and happy and then i cried for an hour. Watch this.",

            "content": "Some light spoilers.\r\nI am reviewing both seasons together.\r\nThis review has been copied from my blog so that's why it starts off weird, lel.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGUESS WHO\u2019S BACK TO WATCHING ANIME?! THAT\u2019S RIGHT. ME! AKHAKHAKHAKHAKHAK!\r\nOr, more like, \u2018Nyu-hu-hu-hu\u2019 which is the catch-laughter of the famous tentacles swinging teacher that is Koro-sensei from Assassination Classroom.\r\nSeriously, though, I hadn\u2019t watched any anime since October. With the death of my desktop computer, I had thrown myself into dreaded extra studying and catching up on manga and some Western TV shows. Now that exams are over, I\u2019ve gotten back to business and by \u2018business\u2019, I mean consuming 10 episodes of anime everynight. I started out with the second season of My Hero Academia and then hit the second season of Assassination Classroom \u2013 which I\u2019ll be reviewing right now.\\n\\n\r\nDespite watching the first season last year, Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu in Japanese and Ass Class in my fake Texan accent) still remained fresh in my mind. Hell, why wouldn\u2019t it? It has the downright absurd plot of a monster, who is threatening to destroy the planet in a year\u2019s time, teaching the special education class of a renowned junior school how to assassinate him. Even if the story would have turned out to be a disaster, I reckon one would still remember the uniqueness of the plot. Anyway, I had no trouble getting back into the mix of things with the beginning of the second season and thus this review will cover the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe main question viewers ask themselves when they read the synopsis or watch the first few episodes (which are, admittedly, rather slow) is whether Ass Class is worth it in the long run. Both seasons together come up to 47 episodes. The plot may be unique but who is to say that it wouldn\u2019t be repetitive or falling back heavily on tropes? Well, Ass Class actually fares somewhat well in the story department.\\n\\n\r\nAss Class is mainly a comedy anime with a number of serious scenes sprinkled throughout in true slice-of-life fashion. The writing isn\u2019t top-notch but it is still remains more or less very good for a shonen by introducing many bizarre yet fitting situations for the rag tag group of students of class 3-E. You get the many frustrations of school exams which the students treat as a way to get back at their teacher and rivals. Literally. Then you have a vacation trip to an exotic island where the students plan an elaborate military assassination. There are even heavy sci-fi elements introduced late game. Ass Class is not afraid of telling its story how it wants to. It knows that the plot armor it has donned is ridiculous and makes full use of its strength to portray a fun and hilarious show that teaches the viewers life lessons in a way that isn\u2019t forced. If I ever have demon spawn then this anime is one I\u2019ll be sure to have them watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say, though, that Ass Class\u2019 story has just few faults. In fact, it has many. A decent amount of them are cleverly hidden behind the plot armor but that is to be expected. The point of the armor is to push the craziness to the extreme without making it absolutely implausible. But there are still some glaring flaws that personally annoy me. For instance, Koro-sensei tutoring the twenty or so students of class 3-E one-on-one altogether at the same time. Sure, he can do that given his speed and all but how do the students even manage to hear let alone understand him with such ease? Another case would be the moon. In the beginning of the anime, we are told that Koro-sensei destroyed more than half of the moon. How has this not majorly fucked up the Earth\u2019s climate and how are common folk so damn calm about it (lol)?\\n\\n\r\nClearly, Ass Class does not shine in the narrative department. Like a disgruntled college student trying to pay for college via prostitution, it just works. The dialogue is still wonderful, though. There are many sides-hurting and wonderfully nostalgia-inducing lines. One of my favorites has to be what Koro-sensei says in the climax of the show: \u201cAll good things must\u2026 come to an end. That is what a classroom is all about.\u201d The timing and emotion behind that single line just beautifully sums up the whole show. It reminded me of my own junior days with all the wacky stuff I was up to and the fantastic (and some urgh) teachers that I had met. Speaking of the climax, it was simply excellent. All the hijinks of the students and the teachers lead up to it with a neat wrapping up of most plot points to give a powerful conclusion that might have you shed a tear. Having a solid conclusion even despite many plot-related flaws is a rather huge win in my book and Ass Class literally belongs in my bookshelf. I\u2019m not kidding. I\u2019ve actually bought what few volumes of the manga I could find here to support the mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point for Ass Class is the characters. They aren\u2019t deep. On that thought, I might even consider some of them to be straight up caricatures. The thing with the cast is that while they may be acting on a base of a few traits they still manage to play off each other well. Their interactions, for the most part, aren\u2019t forced. The couple of moments they go about as robots are handled with enough care to not bring the quality down. An example would be Bitch-sensei having the hots for Karasuma-sensei. It could basically be described as rape at first but develops rather well in time. I also like how the only seemingly main characters are Koro-sensei and Nagisa. Pretty much all of the cast gets individual development. Some so much that they even manage to bring themselves permanently into the spotlight. So, expect many twists.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get to the final specifics, I would like to talk a bit about Nagisa. As a main character he starts out with the usual cliche of being annoyingly weak and growing stronger without himself realizing it. Standard stuff. The thing about him is that, if you disregard his appearance then he becomes the most normal of the cast. That was a nice way to contrast him with the other characters and use as a stepping point for delving into both his backstory and development. Kudos to the mangaka for thinking of that and for the animation studio for not fucking it up. That\u2019s right, people, HE LOOKS LIKE A TRAP FOR A REASON!\\n\\n\r\nAh-hem. Anyway, studio Lerche did a pretty damn good job. I actually found out about their existence today when I looked up Ass Class on MyAnimeList for the synopsis. Their most notable works are this anime, Carnival Phantasm, and the many horrendous Danganronpa adaptations. Thank God they didn\u2019t mess this up. Whoever decided on Fukuyama Jun for the voice of Koro-sensei deserves a pat on the back. They both do, actually. Jun\u2019s performance is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the music. The sounds of Ass Class are energetic and fit the show quite nicely. Koro-sensei\u2019s theme song of blaring trumpets based on his laughter is going straight into my music folder. As are the ending songs which all are calm and soothe the ears. The first ending of the second season called \u2018Kaketa Tsuki\u2019 performed by Shion Miyawaki is my favorite. The opening songs are rather meh. I didn\u2019t like a single one.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as I have mentioned that I own several volumes of the manga it is properly obvious that I would recommend Assassination Classroom to folks. It\u2019s wholeheartedly fun and devoid of crappy fanservice to boot. My personal score would be a 9/10 but I think my \u2018objective\u2019 rating would be an 8/10.",

This is one of the series I enjoyed for teaching values in a fun way. A viewer of this series can learn like an actual student of Korosensei. I liked this overall, especially the plot and the characters.\r\nI view Korosensei as an ideal educator, who shared joy, poured pure emotions, fulfilled his duties until the very end. He is a great assassin, who decided what was righteous, cleverly avoided unnecessary head-to-head battles, and fought with every last ounce of strength for the good cause.He was a character greatly designed. He is a clever character I'll soon remember in some point of my life.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was as emotional as any other class graduation. It was an end that inevitably approaches yet still hard to fully accept. It was the true purpose of the E class known as the Assassination Classroom. It was the best way to end such greatness, such great life. However, among the teacher's students, born a new teacher who continues the great legacy, which made the story end satisfyingly. There were no plot holes unless one forced himself to find one.",

            "content": "Season 1 of Assassination Classroom was very good, it was fun, enjoyable, and set the stage for its concluding season. It wasn't perfect however as it still left us wit many questions that hadn't been answered yet, most notably Koro-Sensei's past. If season 2 could answer al these questions while still being fun and enjoyable, then it'll be no shocker that this season would end on its highest note possible. But did it do it, after finishing all of it here's what I think.***contains MINOR spoilers***\r\nStory:9/10\r\nSlightly better and satisfying. Lemme start off by saying that the show does a brilliant job at balancing its comedyand drama, it's funny when it tries to be funny and serious when it wants to be serious. The first half was like watching season one, it was fun, lighthearted, and had another epic exam battle. Because of this the first half felt repetitive, that's until we reached the second half. This is where the series turned very emotional and dark and delivered amazing background storytelling. It also led to unpredictable moments throwing us scenes that would catch you off guard and made you question, \"Is Koro-Sensei gonna be assassinated or not?\" it also gave us important interested themes like, \"What makes a good teacher\" or \"How to raise kids properly.\" The conclusion was great and satisfying and really put the icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nGreat once again. What's impressive here is that the animation was able stay consistent for majority of its episodes. The show's look was able to match with the tone such as using vivid coloring and brightness for its comedic and lighthearted moments. The CG backgrounds are once again handled very well and the animation was great in the fight scenes(final battle in particular).\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nI was hoping for the OST to fit my liking better this season but it didn't. Like season one I wasn't crazy about the music here, there's just not one song that I can see myself listen to over and over again. However I gotta give the music points for being diverse as it had tracks to match its serious and comedic moments. As for the dub it's very solid, Sonny Strait stays great as Koro-Sensei and is so funny\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the series heavily improves. It did an amazing job fleshing out some of the characters' backstories(most notably Koro-Sensei and Kayano). Now that we were given Koro-Sensei's past and motives, it makes sense why he's the OP tentacle creature he is. It made his character better and more understanding. Kayano was the most improved character here, as she was sort of a background character previous season to being a HUGE focus this season. Her role and emotions made a big impact to the series 2nd half. As for Nagisa he was developed more and it was great to get more of his personal life. Itona was the biggest disappointment as he had a badass entrance to the show but then sadly fades away here. The villains here were also very good and had impacts on the protagonists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nWhat a great show. Assassination Classroom is one of the most enjoyable shows Ive seen and it really stepped up in this season. Koro-Sensei was the highlight of this show and made you question if he's a good or bad guy kinda like Light Yagami from Death Note. Although this show wasn't as dark and violent as I thought it would be, I'm very glad that it focused on being a fun show. Great storytelling, great characters, Assassination Classroom is one 2016's best works and I recommend this to anyone who wants to be entertained.",

            "content": "I would definitely say that this anime easily cracks my top 10, probably makes it's way into even the top 5. The reasons are fairly simple:\r\nThis anime was thoroughly enjoyable with its characters, in both personalities and development. It was quite interesting to learn new details about my favourite characters as the season progressed and definitely made this a truly extraordinary experiment.\r\nThe story was without question a 10/10 in my humble opinion. It was really well executed and any issues that I had with the first season with pacing, or plot arcs that I didn't really care about were all solved completely in this season.Without going into any spoiler territory, I will say that if given the opportunity to change anything in the plot to improve it, I wouldn't. A very unique experience.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I do not pay as much attention to art and sound as I probably should, but I definitely can say that the two OPs and EDs were my two favourite for this show (Although I did not really enjoy the first season's.) and are definitely something that will make me nostalgic in years to come.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall, I would definitely rate this anime a 10/10, and recommend it to anyone who has watched the first season. To those who haven't, I would definitely recommend the first season! This anime, and the messages it sends have truly changed my life, and Koro-Sensei's great attitude, and teaching skills/dedication are definitely some of the reasons as to why I decided to study to become a teacher!\\n\\n\r\nI was quite fond of this anime, and hope that many others will be too.",

The way they built up each characters personality so that its audience would get attached to each and every one of them was amazing.  The art work and attention to details was just as great.

I found the original issue of killing your teacher so you do not destroy the land and reward you with millions of yen.\r\nThis anime is a great example of the great education that Japan has since teachers there care about the future of their students. At present, I think education has fallen a lot. In my first year of FP I have witnessed the misconduct that some teachers have with students, not empathic and that there aremore professional and competent people who deserve the position more than them. I myself lived as an English teacher called us fools, the class to pellets and even our tutor had to talk to her to solve the discrepancies we had with the teacher (which did not work).\\n\\n\r\nI think the teachers should see this anime to better understand the students because, Koro-sensei helps them, gives them advice and lessons wise and cares for them. Koro-sensei is the perfect teacher, the ideal teacher that every student should have.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, students evolve, face their fears and decisions which will not be easy. And the series, never bores you.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are very good, at all times you want to know what is that mystery that surrounds Koro-sensei, who he is and why he wants to destroy the earth. His story is tragic and that ending, THAT FINAL ... I cried.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault I've seen is that very few comedy scenes have made me laugh and some characters have had more prominence than others. Even so, the anime is fun and very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, this is an anime that everyone should see.\\n\\n\r\nNote: 8\\n\\n\r\nHave you seen the anime? What did you think?\\n\\n\r\nI invite you to follow me on my blog to create more content ^^\\n\\n\r\nhttp://sbernacalvo.blogspot.com.es/\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time! ^_^\\n\\n\r\nSONY",

It was a great series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:   I'm glad I watched it, the last few episodes had me crying lie I often do, but I'm so happy that I saw this that I wouldn't ever give up the memories.

            "content": "Assassination Classroom (Season 2)\r\nThis chapter filled in the gaps from the previous season and did an exceptional job in doing so. Initially the second season opens up to quite a few fillers, but actually these episodes are meant to fill in story line for much of the less emphasized characters. It's important to provide a background for all characters involved, and the season does a tremendous job of doing so.\r\nThe worst part of this anime, as I've been thinking for awhile now while watching it, is that the teacher is building such a strong, strong connection with the students. The students laugh, learn,  andchallenge this teacher every day.  It's like having a best friend accompany you. What's so bad about that?! Nothing! In fact, it sounds fantastic all up until the moment that you realize in the end that you will have to kill this teacher, and he will have to leave this life forever. Those strong bonds.. gone. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the incredibly traumatic dilemma that the students are in, the show does a great job of teaching the viewer many moral lessons. You will become a student to the show. If you are a fan of overcoming hardships and learning from experience than this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 11 - The purpose is very clear. Assassinate the teacher, except somewhere along the lines, the rules will change and you will be along for the ride with full understanding as to why.\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Very well done using modern graphics. Nothing to blow your pants off, but you will find that these scenes were very creative.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10 - Intense, playful, heart-felt, soothing.. you name it. The soundtrack really up'd certain moments and added to the enthusiasm of the encounter.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 9 - A good subset of characters realized their flaws and acted upon their strengths. \\n\r\nCharacter Voiceovers - I began the anime in Japanese and switched to English half way through. I found Koro Sensei ( the yellow tentacle monster ) to have an awesome Japanese voice. I almost regretted switching to English just because of it, but the English version displayed better on my new TV setup.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - Very entertaining anime with a solid story line and good moral values.\\n\r\nRecommended - Absolutely. You may even feel a good heart squeeze at the best moments!",

            "content": "'This world is full of absurdities as a matter of course, if you have the time to be resentful and resign to that, have fun fighting those absurdities instead.'\r\nAnsatsu Kyoushitsu... I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I started watching it. Thanks to Koro sensei, I found myself learning together with 3E, bit by bit.\r\nI've always regarded myself as a 'good' student, good grades, rule-abiding, close relationships with classmates, not getting into any trouble. And even though I was vaguely aware of how those typically labelled as 'bad' students or delinquents had their own troubles, I've never actually made myself to consciouslythink about it. Upon entering university recently I started becoming a volunteer tutor for children not doing that well, and that's kind of where I started to really want to understand them and their backgrounds. There are just things that we are vaguely conscious of, but never being aware enough to act upon, and taking lessons with Koro sensei gave me insight into what I could do, not only as a tutor, but also as a person constantly learning through life. This is one of the things I loved about watching this anime (along with the magnificent ending episodes, and Koro sensei himself). Three terms with Koro sensei and 3E felt like a fruitful journey by the end, with so many of his ideals and beliefs that I can revisit upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and the beliefs, those are the two main things that I think were done really well in this series. With other aspects however I wasn't really that impressed, one of them being the characters. While Koro sensei was a fantastic character through and through, loved Karma (though this is probably mostly because he's so sassy), Nagisa was mediocre as the MC and fell flat for me, and plenty of other character developments and introductions felt forced and didn't seem to be well thought out. It felt like things just happened (unnaturally) because of plot necessity, to add a bit of spice, to try and bring things to a full circle, to try and connect all the characters in one big picture. Character-wise, this season was relatively weak, and this affected my level of enjoyment as well, especially from around episode 15, with the exceptions of the last couple of episodes, which were brilliant of course. Art and sound, nothing outstanding, but sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I definitely like this series, and I gained a lot from it. It had a great premise, but could use better execution.",

            "content": "This is the first review I have ever written. I have never intended to write any reviews for any animes or shows that I have watched because I have always felt that it's unnecessary and just a waste of time. But AC really ignited an impulse within me, so here I am. First of all, to make me tear up watching an anime/show, had been almost impossible. The closest an anime has ever gotten me, was at most, the feeling of tearing up, nothing more. And that only happened once. I have watched AC twice, and I cried both times. BOTH TIMES. This has neverhappened before. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the story, it was unique, and you could tell the author had really put in lots of effort in writing it. Though, I have conflicted feelings about the ending. The ending was not what I wanted it to be, but it was because the ending was the way it was, it was able to bring out the emotions in people. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not really satisfied with the art. There are other animes with better art. The characters do not look very appealing to me, except for Korosensei. The art in AC reminds me of Danganronpa.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music brought out the feels better than most animes I have watched. The opening suits the anime well. Voice cast was perfect, especially for Korosensei. I can't think of anyone who is able to portray the character better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely LOVE Korosensei. Korosensei is my favourite anime character. Of course, I like all the other characters too. Each and every one of them are thought out well. They all have different personalities and their own character development.  This is the part which I admire most about the author. He has done it better than other animes. To be able to feature all 31 of the characters (Korosensei + 28 students + Karasuma and Irina). If only better art could complement it, it will be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI have never been dissatisfied with any episode (Season 1 + 2). I truly enjoyed this anime. And I wish there is a season 3 about Nagisa. But I know it's not possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to everyone. It is one of, if not, my favourite anime.",
