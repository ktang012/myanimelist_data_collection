            "content": "\"If you flip the 10, it becomes a 01!\" -Some Jerk\r\nLet me preface this pre-review by saying this, I am in love with this series, but for all the wrong reasons. Black Clover, or, Black Clover as the gringos say, is the sophomore effort of mangaka Yuuki Tabata, and it is a far cry from his debut work, Hungry Joker. Hungry Joker had the unfortunate fate of being axed by the higher-ups at WSJ, thus is the fate of most new kids on the block who don't have a proper sense of what they are doing or are given little time to spread their wings.I'm not attempting to white-knight Hungry Joker or anything, but the politics at WSJ are as murky as the Academy Awards Committee. While it wasn't exactly a Dostoyevsky or Hemmingway, Hungry Joker on a conceptual level at least had a fun gimmick to play around with. Couple that with some pretty unique character models and a good sense of panel-work, it easily had the potential to grow into something much greater than it ever did. \\n\\n\r\nI imagine Tabata's frame of mind when conjuring up the idea for his follow-up was one of both pragmatism and...a cheeky disregard for creativity. Black Clover is one of the most creatively bankrupt series I have ever had the pleasure of watching or reading. I am utterly convinced that Tabata wrote this as a cheeky retaliation/statement against the higher-ups at WSJ, and no amount of rationalizing or fanboying can change that perception for me. Black Clover is terrible, it's like the shonen equivalent of The Room except it gets away with convincing people that it's good. The only thing Black Clover is good at is highlighting how by-the-numbers this style of series can get. \\n\\n\r\nBriefly touching on the technicals of this series, the voice acting is god awful. Asta's voice actor has one setting and one setting only, although that has been covered ad nauseam. He makes Junko Takeuchi's work as Naruto seem warm and inviting like Morgan Freeman. It is probably the only time watching a series that it actually elicited a physical reaction from me. Although, as a small caveat, if you attempt to watch this series from the perspective of someone knowing what they are signing up for, the subbed version adds an extra layer of grease to this disgustingly satisfying sandwich. I.e. if you want the genuine Black Clover experience, the voice acting is like icing on that cake. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in a middling ground of both extremes. It can be good when it wants to and it can also skimp on its budget when it needs to. I feel that Tabata's art style wasn't properly translated from panel to screen. I have conflicting feelings on the animation though. Had the source material been in more capable hands like Bones or Madhouse, I feel that it could've been leaning more towards \"beautiful spectacle\" territory as opposed to \"beautifully terrible\". So despite my compliments to Tabata's art style, the mediocre animation mostly serves to its benefit. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the technicals are out of the way, I feel I shouldn't even have to harp all that much on the story and characters. If you've watched Naruto, if you've watched Fairy Tail, if you have even a basic knowledge of writing propensities when it comes to shonen and fantasy, you've already gotten a taste of Black Clover. The story is bereft of shallow gimmicks and instead opts to stuff itself full of cliches and archetypes. The overarching storyline and subplots all have parallels to other works and the characters all have doppelgangers floating around in some other manga. \\n\\n\r\nSo why the 10? Honestly, I'm not even really sure myself. They say that there are certain series that require you to take a step back or a dumbed-down open mind to enjoy. I don't even really feel either of those things are required to watch and enjoy Black Clover. I've seen what it looks like when it earnestly feels like Tabata is trying, and he has a lot of genuinely good qualities to the way he draws and writes his manga. In fact, I have no doubt that this series has the potential to grow into something greater than the sum of its parts considering that it hasn't been given the axe at this stage. Black Clover was not a labor of love or a passion project, that is apparent to me. From my perspective, Black Clover is a frustrated and rebellious statement on the current status of shonen manga and the politics that goes into publication. Because honestly, it takes a real genius to write something this stupid. Or perhaps I'm just reading too much into it? \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the case may be, Black Clover is my ultimate guilty pleasure and I wave that 10 with pride. \\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nUNBIASED REVIEW TO BALANCE OUT THE HATERS\r\nAre there many shounen clich\u00e9s here? Yes. Is it a groundbreaking anime that will have the anime elitists praising the very ground the characters walk on? No. Is it still a fun, comedic, action-adventure/magical-fantasy and enjoyable shounen? Yes. I give this anime a 7, good on the MAL scale, because it is. \r\nTo start: Personally I don't think that cliches are all that bad if done right. There is a reason that cliches, or as we call them in the business \"genre stereotypes\" exist, and that reason is because they work, they are enjoyable, and peoplegenerally like them when done right, and Black Clover does it right. It is true that it's nice to see something break the mold from time to time, but without a mold to break in the first place, then nothing would be ground breaking. In this way, not everything is meant to push the boundaries of the anime elitist's groupthink (ironic I know), some things are simply meant to be fun, easy, enjoyable, and follow our expectations. Again, there is nothing wrong with a \"mold\" a \"cliche\" or \"genre stereotypes\" when done right and Black Clover does indeed do them right, so far. And finally TO BE CLEAR! In my reviews, I never judge an anime by another anime, I never compare the anime I am reviewing to other anime, and I immediately disregard ANY REVIEW that does so. Period. I always judge an anime on it's own merits as I see them. Anything less, to me, would be disrespecting the time, energy, and effort that the creators put into creating a TV show to entertain us, as well as disrespecting you, the reader, as you are looking for a review on THIS anime and not a list of my favorites, as you can check out my profile for that should you so choose. To put it quite simply, you, the reader, deserve an impartial analysis of this anime based only on this anime, and not how it compare to others.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7, good: Interesting world and magic mechanics. I am eager to see how it plays out given the backstory about the wizard king destroying the demons and how it resolves itself with the fact that Asta (one of the protagonists) utilizes a demonic grimoire.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7, good: Nothing really more to say here, it's pretty standard for a 2017 shounen. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7, good: Enjoyable opening and closing songs. The foley sounds are well done, and voice acting is good. Regardless of what the haters say I find Asta's voice and antics amusing rather than annoying (though this is just opinion, cannot be objectively verified, and thus everyone is entitled to their own. So I hold nothing against those who do find it annoying). Asta is a good counter point to his more serious brother/rival which brings us to. . .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7, good: There is character development in this show, and the characters have a good motivation for doing what they are doing. The only reason that some don't like it is because it's been done before, but that doesn't make something bad. There is nothing wrong with a good underdog story when done right, and when you realize that they (Asta and his brother Yuno, the two protagonists) are not simply fighting for themselves, but fighting for their class of people (the poor peasants vs the rich nobles) their character motivations are very clear. I really do think that the reason the elitist haters hate this is because they are comparing Black Clover to other animes instead of on its own merits, because this character motivation is a very honorable one that makes sense given where our heros Asta and Yuno come from and the world they find themselves in. In other words, the world, story, and characters are all internally consistent which is exactly what you want to see in any work of fiction. You see, there is a reason that the underdog story and fighting for others is a genre stereotype. It's because people like it. The final character (and third protagonist) we will talk about is Noelle. Her story is different and interesting (minor spoiler), as she is a noble who (presumably) chose to join the worst/lowest of the magic knights squads. Unlike Asta and Yuno, her character and backstory is not completely revealed yet, but it appears that she too has something to prove, untapped potential, and may just end up developing into a noble who is worthy of the title unlike so many other nobles in this series, who seem to be just horrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8, Very good: I give the enjoyment an 8 because all of these other good factors come together to craft a story that I can't wait to see the next installment of in the coming weeks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: No, this anime isn't going to be a game changer, or win any awards, but it is a fine addition to the shounen genre and if you like magic action adventure comedy fantasy shounens that are light and don't try to hard to be something that they're not, then you will likely enjoy Black Clover as I am.",

            "content": "We used to have Big 3 when it comes to anime including shows like Naruto, One piece, and Dragonball. Throw Fairytail in there also. Now as those shows are going away we look to replace them and this show was supposed to be one of those shows hyped to the point it crashed streaming websites when it released. The thing is all this show has are the bad parts of the Big 3. The story also wants to be compared to them and since it is I'm going to compare them here.\r\nThe story is about a boy who can't use magic but through some strokeof determination and luck gets a powerful magic only he can use. I purposely manipulating this to sound like Boku no hero academia. Both main characters don't have something commonplace in this world just to get one of the strongest options somehow. Now we can compare it to Naruto, where all they did was replace Hokage with Wizard King as that is our main characters main goal to be the one over them all. Then you have Fairytail's magic elements on top of the fact he basically joined the Fairytail guild and yada yada yada. You have probably had these comparisons drilled into your head by now. All you need to know is this show doesn't do any of things nearly as well as the others except for maybe Fairytail that one is being debated by everyone. And before I move on when the second episode is filler that tells you this show isn't going to have good things to come. The pacing of the show is horrendous as it starts off super slow then starts moving very quickly and slows down again. They even negate some things turning some episodes into nothing but filler that added nothing to the characters development. (No saying it won't make you like a character more or not but objectively it adds nothing.) \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. I don't love it but it's not bad at all the magic looks really good but that's the only thing I really like about it everything else I find around meh.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is all that special to me either. No songs still out to me as good or bad because I can't even remember them as it really isn't anything special. But there is one thing that I will get into with characters. The japanese voice actors are perfectly cast and that's not exactly a good thing. ( more on that later.)\\n\\n\r\nTime to let loose the characters. \\n\r\nAsta is the main character of this story and like I said before he can't use magic but you need magic to pretty much do anything in this world as people without it are unheard of except for him. Honestly, all he knows how to do is scream at the top of his lungs I mean listening to him makes me want to blow my brains out. This makes Dragonball look tame and people joke about that all the time. You might grow numb to his voice over time or you might not, either way, you might want to seek out the dub instead. But he is determined although he can't use magic he trains his heart out all day working on his physical abilities and ends up with a grimoire something signifying magic in this world. But his is special as these books all have clovers 1-4 usually 4 being very impressive but our magicless protagonist gets a 5 leaf which means he as the power of the devil or something like that which lets him use a huge sword like another story we know that cuts down magic and negates it completely. Overall his character is super annoying and his ability just leaves me bored as this isn't the first useless main character is actually useful story and I would rather watch any one of those at this point.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character I'm going to go over is our token overpower rival character Sauske... sorry I mean Gray, No Yuno, yeah Yuno. Yuno gets a 4 leaf is naturally good at magic and our main character uses him as a motivation get stronger. He is a rather emotionless character that looks up to Asta determination because he saved him this one time. I'm just going to cut it there and say this character means nothing to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters (guild members.) can be very similar to fairytail, We have a chick that drinks a lot and wears rather lewd clothing like kana. a overbearing and energetic character like natsu. a powerful and serious like gildarts occasionally can be, etc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, unless you love shonen anime do not touch this with a ten-foot pole. Watch the shows this wants to replace instead at least you don't have to wait for new episodes. and you have watched them watch them again. This show has nothing redeemable so far maybe it will and I'm going to keep watching because I'm shonen trash. But so far this is a complete garbage can of a show. I'm not saying you can't enjoy this but it's really not good.\\n",

I love anime were the mc is just so badass and everyone thinks so too. Too bad thats not what everyone thought in the beginning but it does get better especially the recent episodes. Just give this show a chance and watch it the whole way through. Its just so cool how the mc has the power to negate all magic!!! And in future episodes everyone is going to know that and either think ofhim highly or eventually fear him when he gets more power. All I'm sayin is that most people need to give this show better credit and imagine the future of this anime and how far it will go. This anime is definitely in my top 10 favorite out of about 100  anime I've watched. And it will stay there if this show continues to show the greatness and power of Asta. I'm pretty sure the makers wont screw it up and make him weak. He might still be neglected to everyone who hasn't seen him in action for being strong for a while, but soon he will be seen as the True Wizard King!!",

I enjoyed the manga alot, and to be fair i did like different things like the art and how everything was animated, that wasn't bad. However the sound, the progression, transitions were all disgusting for what this could have been.\r\nSound \r\n- it felt like the voice actors came cheap and they picked whoever offered to do it. It sounded terrible it didn't feel like most of the voice actors even fit with the characters\r\n-The sound gets irritating as well from basically how bad it all played out. Especially if their shoutingor screaming is annoying, ASTA.\\n\r\n-music decent, wasn't bad\\n\r\nProgression\\n\r\n-There is no feeling of progression that you typically see in these types of shounen animes where the main character grows with experience. we're just left with some kid who bring out some swords from a book, feels like the real progression are left with the side characters.\\n\r\nTransition\\n\r\n-this mainly ties in with the sound, but adding onto their terrible voice acting the way it shifts lines from character to narrator to character is stupid, i hate it.\\n\\n\r\nStory- it's your typical generic shounen type of setting of hoping to achieve something great with hard work and overcoming obstacles. It is not a bad type of story and has alot of potential to be interesting.\\n\r\nArt- The magic looked really cool, the fighting was well animated and smooth.\\n\r\nCharacters- generic but interesting characters, tsundere good for nothing rich girl, naruto like attitude big sword wielding kid, OP do it all magic rival, etc. yep, not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- really low, the voice acting just totally strips any type of immersion. you start to get into it \"maybe it's not that bad\" terrible voice acting, bad transitions, and Asta annoying screaming \"nevermind\"",

An anime doesn't have to be original. In my opinion, it should just have a good story, characters, and animation in general, which Black Clover has! There is a reason why animes like Naruto succeed, it's a story platform that works and appeals to the audience. To me, this show is the ideal sh\u014dnen anime and everyone should give it a chance. So everyone who gives this show bad ratings should just stop their whining anddeal with it.",

            "content": "Let me make it perfectly unequivocally clear that this anime, Black Clover, is a gargantuan pile of hot hot salty garbage. It is also perhaps one of the most successful unintentional comedies it has ever been my pleasure to enjoy. Or is it intentional? After 41 episodes, I still find myself unable to say. That, ladies and gentleman, is the magic of Black Clover. \r\nStory: \r\nImagine the most basic Shounen anime ever. Congratulations, you have just imagined Fairy Tail. Now make that just a little more seedy, and you have just gotten a good handle on what Black Clover is like. Fairy Tail but withmore violence and sexuality. \\n\\n\r\nThe Clover Kingdom is a country that is ruled by a Wizard King and maintained by his Magic Knights. In dinky little bumblefuck village of Hage, two orphans named Asta and Yuno dream of becoming Magic Knights and one day the Wizard king. Yuno is a magic prodigy, Asta is completely devoid of even the smallest shred of magical power. But of course that is no impediment to a main character, and soon he acquires a sword that is able to totally cancel the magic of anybody else. The two rivals set out on a competitive dick-measuring journey to become Wizard Jesus.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is the prototypical hero's tale, a young determined country bumpkin rises up against all odds and becomes OP as fuk very quickly. Lots of fights, some playful with friendly rivals and some against crazy people who can make lizards out of jelly, ensue. It is comforting in its simplicity and derivativeness. Nothing that requires you to think for a second. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nStarted off completely terrible. Really boring and bland, and kind of lazy with a lot of repetition. As the show went on it started to improve dramatically, to the point that the fights in the later arcs actually look really cool. Even the look of the slapsticky comedy moments improved over time, although they still look shitty enough to be lovably awful. The art is a small part of what makes this show such a campy gem.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOh boy. Here we go. \\n\r\nThere is one central element of this show that simultaneously makes me hate and love the fuck out of it; it is what both repulsed me and kept me coming back for more. There is no way around it. The voice of the main character, Asta no last name, is the single most annoying sound that it has ever been my pleasure to endure. It is so mind mindbogglingly irritating, it haunts my dreams at night. If it is a genuine attempt to do a serious voice worthy of the protagonist of a long running Shounen battle anime, it is the single worst performance since Ashley Simpson did that hoedown on SNL. If it is an intentional joke, either by the voice actor or the director, it routinely makes me laugh so hard I cry. \\n\\n\r\nAsta screams 100% of the time. He thinks his biggest curse is that he has no magic, but it is really that he has no inside voice. This cat quite literally ends most of his sentences with WHHHAAAAAAAAAAA! Swap him out for Waluigi, nobody would kind the difference. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly average, but the OPs have been getting better and better. The first was eminently forgettable, but they have improved to the point where I watch them every time. The endings are universally not worth the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFrom the get, the first thing we learn about this world is that everybody sucks. They are all maddeningly childish, most of the time they are being huge dicks to each other, nobody has any concept of personal space, nobody behaves like a human being in the slightest. While this pissed me off royally at first, I have reached a level of Stockholm Syndrome with this show that has left me rather warmly disposed toward almost everybody. Asta is a total spazz, screams all the time, is very dumb, an has no consideration for other people's feelings barring the rare times he can pull himself together and focus. His sword cuts through anything, it is Kryptonite and everybody else is Superman and also made of paper. Yuno's crazy-strong power is air, and that is fitting because he is also completely invisible as far as a personality goes. He wants to beat Asta and become wizard king. It is the only thought he has ever had, it is the only emotion he has ever expressed. Also there is a girl who is there named Noelle, who has water powers and confidence issues and likes Asta and that's about it. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters are so aggressively quirky that I kind of expect to side with any villain who manages to do a nice thorough job of murdering them all. I do have to admit that I kind of love them for it though. Special shout outs to Charmy, a chibi whose magic is to conjure sheep and who is basicaly moe-blob Gluttony from FMA, Luck, a sociopathic child made of lightning and bloodlust, and Sally the mad scientist evil girl who makes salamanders out of Jelly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhy'd you have to go and make things so complicated? I really should rate this show a 2 overall, because objectively it is poorly made, annoying, and is covering ground that has already been much more competently trodden by a million shows before it. But the amount of fun I had watching Black Clover leaves me giving it a 10 in enjoyment and an overall 9 for the experience I had following its story's devastating fall down the world's longest flight of stairs. I laughed harder watching this than at anything I can call to recent memory. It is so hilariously inept that is really should be seen and cherished for the shiny, polished turd it is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if the phrase \"so bad it's good\" means anything to you at all, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not watching Black Clover. As Asta always screams, his magic is not giving up, and I am so glad he inspired me not to give up on Black Clover just because it was terrible. I am eternally grateful that he did, and my life is richer for the experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to finish in true Black Clover style, WHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!",

            "content": "Black clover is really underrated on MAL. Let me explain befor you judge. The story starts a lot like naruto and fairy tail but thats only the start.\r\nBlack clover is about a boy who is really special. He has no magical power in a magical world. Just like the guild he will join he is strange. The story is about people who have strange personalitys or powers and overcome it or even use it as an strength.\r\nThere are guild members who cant control their magical power (even when the power level is really high), are addicted to fights and can get really violent because ofthat, are shy as fuck, can only use defense magic, have an unhealthy crush on their sister, are just lazy to do anything, are left alone, cant stop eating, cant stop drinking...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of black clover are really unqiue on their own. So there are many ways to combinate them and they do it pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the show you will maybe think its just another underdog show with a MC who was born poor and weak and becomes the strongest in the world with working hard. No, you are totally wrong. Its about characters who are special and work on their problems. Yeah Asta wants to become the wizard king who is the strongest wizard in the country but does he want to become wizard king because he wants to be the strongest and beatt everyone? No! He wants to become wizard king give the church where he grew up more money and help them.\\n\\n\r\nThan to his rival: The guy was often compared to saske from naruto. He isnt... Not a single bit. He is the only one who aknowleged Astas power from the start on and believed he could become wizard king. Does this sound like the I-hate-everything-Saske from Naruto? Hell no! He wants to become wizard king because Asta inspired him.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system of the magic is really cool so far. Its about the wizard books and they use the 4 elements water, fire, earth and air but also combinate them in really diffrent ways. Than there is the demon race with unknown power and asta probably gets his power/clover from somewhere there. Than there are 4 levels of strengths of the wizard books. Astas rival has the 4th level book. Than there are later implemanted gods of elements who choose the strongest of each one element. Next to this there are magics you cant really put in the 4 elements its not clear until now why they are there but they are rarer as fuck and really strong. Its mutch better as the power system in fairy tail.\\n\\n\r\nSo is it as good as naruto, one piece or bleach (I didnt watched bleach yet)? No, but it could be in the future. Is it as good as fairy tail? Yes, it is and you can compare them.\\n\\n\r\nBlack clover is definitly worth watching. Dont let the haters go in your mind. The start of black clover is not that good. You can compare it there like dragon ball super and boruto. The start of them is really not good but it gets better with the time.\\n",

I just want to say but this is the first review I have ever done. \r\nI am going to make this a quick review and to start of, I want to say to the people who hate on this anime because of the main character's shouting, you are stupid. As generic as Black Clover is, it is still very enjoyable and I am going to continue watching each new episode as it airs. \r\nI don't really want to go too in depth into talking about the story, but I will say it is very good, it is not amazing but it isvery good.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I do think that so far it has some good ones. A huge complaint about the anime for Black Clover is the main character Asta and his consent shouting. Like I said, if you are hating on this anime just because of that then that is very low. I find Asta as an interesting and hilarious character. I do hope to see most of the other characters and Asta get character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the anime is pretty decent too, Studio Pierrot are doing a good job there.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't really got much to say about the sound, but it is very good once again. The first opening and ending songs to the anime are very nice too.\\n\\n\r\nSo far I am enjoying this anime a lot and I do recommend it. Just be prepared for it to be pretty generic, but trust me it is still enjoyable. Asta's shouting is easy to get use to, it was only in the first episode where I thought the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I give Black Clover a 9/10 \\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI will not be making a full review when the anime finishes.",

            "content": "Black Clover is one of the worst battle shounen I have seen. \r\nLets start with the two things that where obvious from the start:\r\nI: the main characters voice is really annoying.\r\nII: the pacing is horrendous. The first 13 episodes cover the first 10 characters of the manga.\r\nFortunately both of these things improve with time, unfortunately the same can't be said about the numerous other problems.\r\nThe animation is bad and for some reason got worse during the final battle. Which is weird because that's where you normally see the best animation.\r\nThe soundtrack is used so rarely that I can't remember a single tune despite having watched51 episodes of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course if Black Clover had good characters and a good plot it would still have been good, unfortunately both are bad.\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters have one or in rare chases two gimmicks that defines them entirely. Once a character who has some problem witnesses the main character Asta's drive to never give up they will immediately change their mind and get over there problem, if said character is a girl she will also fall in love with Asta.\\n\r\nNone of the villains have good motivations or interesting character traits and are therefore completely boring. Sure there are some hints that they might get more development later, but the potential to get better later does not make something good.\\n\r\nNot that the villains have ever a change of succeeding, because whenever a important character is about to be defeated they learn a new spell to save themselves. Because who wants tension anyway?\\n\r\nThen there is the rivalry between Asta and Yuno. It's gets set up in the beginning, but because they join different magic knight squads they rarely meet so it doesn't feel like a reel rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nI could name a myriad of other problems with this anime, but it would quickly devolve into nitpicking and spoilers so I won't, instead I'll talk about the positive.\\n\r\nLike most battle shounen Black Clover occasionally has jokes. While some of those jokes are boring there are some that are really funny. It is far from enough to make Black Clover good but it is better than nothing.",

This show is about these two orphans who grow up in a small village in the Clover Kingdom. This world is full of magic and people are usually born with it. However, Asta one of the main characters is born with no magic and struggles to keep up with the others as he grows up. Yuno is the other orphan that was born with magic power and alot of it.  These two are always competing andboth want to grow up to become the wizard king. The most powerful wizard in all of Clover Kingdom. As the story continues, Asta continues to never give up with all the obstacles that he faces along his journey as well as Yuno. I think this show is quite entertaining and it made me want to keep watching. The characters care about each other and so far there has been significant growth in several of the characters. I definitely will continue to watch this show to see where it goes and how it ends!",

            "content": "As of writing this review I have only seen up to Ep.10, mild spoilers may occur containing information up to that point. \r\nTL;DR: The story is nothing unique but is still solid. Characters and the fact that Studio Pierrot are the ones adapting this are Black Clover's biggest flaw. Black Clover, despite these flaws I do still find very enjoyable though.\r\nIt's disappointing to see how lowly ranked this is and some of the stupid reviews that just call it trash. Yes, Black Clover has many flaws (just as any anime have flaws), simply based on these flaws i took a guess at what studio madeit, and to no surprised I was correct. Studio Pierrot strikes again with its bad adaptations!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10) Mediocre\\n\r\nThe main area of Black Clover's flaws lie in its characters. This is not limited to Asta and how he yells approximately 37 times per episode, but nearly all the characters with some sort of gag. What I mean by this is they use and reuse the same jokes with each character to the point where it is no longer funny. Some anime struggle with having every character act differently, this one however greatly over-dramatizes each character with the same jokes. \\n\\n\r\nThis however by no means makes it a terrible anime, in fact Black Clover has quite a few of those moments that get you excited and make you want to watch the next episode. Moments like when you first see the demon behind Asta and him using his sword, and when Asta gets his Magic Knights cloak had me pumped and super excited. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10) Fair, Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nThe story itself so far is pretty basic and doesn't stand out as unique, its just a typical but solid story and world, but as mentioned above does have big moments which make me really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) Good, Sound (7/10) Good\\n\r\nThe art style and sound track are nothing special and pretty normal but tie into whats going on well, the OST is not good enough that I would listen to it in my free time. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters, one big complaint I do have though is that you are treated to repeated scenes prior to the opening that just goes over the setting or what happened in the previous episode, this basically makes me feel like Studio Pierrot was lazy and stalled out 40 or so seconds of content and new animation every episode. They also reuse a picture of Asta twice in the opening, while some may find this silly, it just makes me feel like the studio was lazy and simply tried to limit the amount of work they had to do.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I believe having Asta be able to do more than just swing his sword would make the anime much better, since I dont see him growing or changing as a character. Maybe if he learned a spell (but of course he cant use magic so maybe the sword/demon would come into play and increase his physical capabilities or something.) At one point in the anime, they mentioned that when a magic user matures, grows emotionally, or so forth they will \"unlock\" new spells from their grimoire, I would like to see something like this for Asta's case.\\n",

Me personally, I would give this anime a 8/10 so far in its current state. If it follows the manga to an extent, and improves on its characters emotional stances, I will recommend it to other people. With all that happens in the manga it will be an interesting ride, for anyone willing to watch it. However peoplethinking this is the next Naruto, you are in for a ride. No, Black Clover has its own unique stances on the trying to accomplish becoming the Wizard King. In Black Clover Yuno and Asta are having a competition in who can become the Wizard King first. Yuno doesn't discriminate against Asta because he has 0 magical ability like the others, because Yuno knows all the work and effort Asta has put into his dream. Asta works towards a goal even though he doesn't have the status to do so. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI would give the story a fair 6/10 though that's being harsh. Considering I have read all of the manga to the current release. I look forward to watching the anime through and through. I don't know what you've heard, but nothing bad has happened so far, we have an interesting story getting set up and from the reviews I have been seeing, people act like all anime has a 100% unique story line. Yes, I can understand how easy it would be to set up a story that is 100% unique but having an evolving main character is very difficult in its own right. Considering this, the anime itself follows the manga pretty well so far, and if it continues it will most likely get more and more people to come watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI would give the art a 6/10 and that's being lenient. I personally love the art style of the background, environment, characters, etc. However I do not like how they set up the way the abilities look. When you come across them, they seem abstract and as if they are cut from something else. This being said, I get past it and love a good story. Considering I watched another anime not giving names with even worse special fx.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound fits well, sounds good however there is delay you can tell in some spots. I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacter development is going to be a huge factor in depending if this will become a good hit. I loved the personalities of the characters in the manga, however I hope that occurrences like in episode 16 don't happen too often. When one of the somewhat cutoff main characters(Luck) has a somewhat touching event and brushes it off like it was some sort of stupid happenstance. It bothers me very highly. I don't know if that was a fluke or some sort of, \"meant to be\" scenario. However,I guess whatever, and that was my only issue while watching so far.\\n\r\nI give character development a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIn the end this is the only thing that matters. The enjoyment of an anime. I love Black Clover so far, I hope they make it to the current issue its at in the manga. So many good arc's they can mess around with. Good character development, good everything. The anime seems to tie in with the manga so far with some filler content on the way. As well gives us viewers something good to look foward too after a long day at whatever the heck your doing for a day job.\\n\r\nI give it a 9/10.",

I think that the story is good even though there are many other animes that are similar. I think that art is done nicely and I liked the voice acting even though some people thought that it sucked. I don't know why but people hate this anime because they think that Asta's annoying. Sure he screams a lot but that's what makes me like Asta more. I personally think that Asta's fun and likeable and is not annoying just because he screams alot. I also hate how people review the anime and hate it when they are barely 10 episodes into it. Sure the anime started out slowly but as the story progressed it gets better and I also love how the anime has many mysteries that aren't solved yet. Like why the grimoire chose him and who's Asta's parents. The fights are really good too and make you want to watch more. The character development in this anime is also really amazing. You get to look deeper into each character's past and they also have their own moments to shine. The anime also never takes a break and always have something interesting happen. I don't get why people hate the anime so much but I 100% loved it and will continue to watch it!",

            "content": "\"If you flip the 10, it becomes a 01!\" -Some Jerk\r\nLet me preface this pre-review by saying this, I am in love with this series, but for all the wrong reasons. Black Clover, or, Black Clover as the gringos say, is the sophomore effort of mangaka Yuuki Tabata, and it is a far cry from his debut work, Hungry Joker. Hungry Joker had the unfortunate fate of being axed by the higher-ups at WSJ, thus is the fate of most new kids on the block who don't have a proper sense of what they are doing or are given little time to spread their wings.I'm not attempting to white-knight Hungry Joker or anything, but the politics at WSJ are as murky as the Academy Awards Committee. While it wasn't exactly a Dostoyevsky or Hemmingway, Hungry Joker on a conceptual level at least had a fun gimmick to play around with. Couple that with some pretty unique character models and a good sense of panel-work, it easily had the potential to grow into something much greater than it ever did. \\n\\n\r\nI imagine Tabata's frame of mind when conjuring up the idea for his follow-up was one of both pragmatism and...a cheeky disregard for creativity. Black Clover is one of the most creatively bankrupt series I have ever had the pleasure of watching or reading. I am utterly convinced that Tabata wrote this as a cheeky retaliation/statement against the higher-ups at WSJ, and no amount of rationalizing or fanboying can change that perception for me. Black Clover is terrible, it's like the shonen equivalent of The Room except it gets away with convincing people that it's good. The only thing Black Clover is good at is highlighting how by-the-numbers this style of series can get. \\n\\n\r\nBriefly touching on the technicals of this series, the voice acting is god awful. Asta's voice actor has one setting and one setting only, although that has been covered ad nauseam. He makes Junko Takeuchi's work as Naruto seem warm and inviting like Morgan Freeman. It is probably the only time watching a series that it actually elicited a physical reaction from me. Although, as a small caveat, if you attempt to watch this series from the perspective of someone knowing what they are signing up for, the subbed version adds an extra layer of grease to this disgustingly satisfying sandwich. I.e. if you want the genuine Black Clover experience, the voice acting is like icing on that cake. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is in a middling ground of both extremes. It can be good when it wants to and it can also skimp on its budget when it needs to. I feel that Tabata's art style wasn't properly translated from panel to screen. I have conflicting feelings on the animation though. Had the source material been in more capable hands like Bones or Madhouse, I feel that it could've been leaning more towards \"beautiful spectacle\" territory as opposed to \"beautifully terrible\". So despite my compliments to Tabata's art style, the mediocre animation mostly serves to its benefit. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the technicals are out of the way, I feel I shouldn't even have to harp all that much on the story and characters. If you've watched Naruto, if you've watched Fairy Tail, if you have even a basic knowledge of writing propensities when it comes to shonen and fantasy, you've already gotten a taste of Black Clover. The story is bereft of shallow gimmicks and instead opts to stuff itself full of cliches and archetypes. The overarching storyline and subplots all have parallels to other works and the characters all have doppelgangers floating around in some other manga. \\n\\n\r\nSo why the 10? Honestly, I'm not even really sure myself. They say that there are certain series that require you to take a step back or a dumbed-down open mind to enjoy. I don't even really feel either of those things are required to watch and enjoy Black Clover. I've seen what it looks like when it earnestly feels like Tabata is trying, and he has a lot of genuinely good qualities to the way he draws and writes his manga. In fact, I have no doubt that this series has the potential to grow into something greater than the sum of its parts considering that it hasn't been given the axe at this stage. Black Clover was not a labor of love or a passion project, that is apparent to me. From my perspective, Black Clover is a frustrated and rebellious statement on the current status of shonen manga and the politics that goes into publication. Because honestly, it takes a real genius to write something this stupid. Or perhaps I'm just reading too much into it? \\n\\n\r\nWhatever the case may be, Black Clover is my ultimate guilty pleasure and I wave that 10 with pride. \\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nUNBIASED REVIEW TO BALANCE OUT THE HATERS\r\nAre there many shounen clich\u00e9s here? Yes. Is it a groundbreaking anime that will have the anime elitists praising the very ground the characters walk on? No. Is it still a fun, comedic, action-adventure/magical-fantasy and enjoyable shounen? Yes. I give this anime a 7, good on the MAL scale, because it is. \r\nTo start: Personally I don't think that cliches are all that bad if done right. There is a reason that cliches, or as we call them in the business \"genre stereotypes\" exist, and that reason is because they work, they are enjoyable, and peoplegenerally like them when done right, and Black Clover does it right. It is true that it's nice to see something break the mold from time to time, but without a mold to break in the first place, then nothing would be ground breaking. In this way, not everything is meant to push the boundaries of the anime elitist's groupthink (ironic I know), some things are simply meant to be fun, easy, enjoyable, and follow our expectations. Again, there is nothing wrong with a \"mold\" a \"cliche\" or \"genre stereotypes\" when done right and Black Clover does indeed do them right, so far. And finally TO BE CLEAR! In my reviews, I never judge an anime by another anime, I never compare the anime I am reviewing to other anime, and I immediately disregard ANY REVIEW that does so. Period. I always judge an anime on it's own merits as I see them. Anything less, to me, would be disrespecting the time, energy, and effort that the creators put into creating a TV show to entertain us, as well as disrespecting you, the reader, as you are looking for a review on THIS anime and not a list of my favorites, as you can check out my profile for that should you so choose. To put it quite simply, you, the reader, deserve an impartial analysis of this anime based only on this anime, and not how it compare to others.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7, good: Interesting world and magic mechanics. I am eager to see how it plays out given the backstory about the wizard king destroying the demons and how it resolves itself with the fact that Asta (one of the protagonists) utilizes a demonic grimoire.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7, good: Nothing really more to say here, it's pretty standard for a 2017 shounen. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7, good: Enjoyable opening and closing songs. The foley sounds are well done, and voice acting is good. Regardless of what the haters say I find Asta's voice and antics amusing rather than annoying (though this is just opinion, cannot be objectively verified, and thus everyone is entitled to their own. So I hold nothing against those who do find it annoying). Asta is a good counter point to his more serious brother/rival which brings us to. . .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7, good: There is character development in this show, and the characters have a good motivation for doing what they are doing. The only reason that some don't like it is because it's been done before, but that doesn't make something bad. There is nothing wrong with a good underdog story when done right, and when you realize that they (Asta and his brother Yuno, the two protagonists) are not simply fighting for themselves, but fighting for their class of people (the poor peasants vs the rich nobles) their character motivations are very clear. I really do think that the reason the elitist haters hate this is because they are comparing Black Clover to other animes instead of on its own merits, because this character motivation is a very honorable one that makes sense given where our heros Asta and Yuno come from and the world they find themselves in. In other words, the world, story, and characters are all internally consistent which is exactly what you want to see in any work of fiction. You see, there is a reason that the underdog story and fighting for others is a genre stereotype. It's because people like it. The final character (and third protagonist) we will talk about is Noelle. Her story is different and interesting (minor spoiler), as she is a noble who (presumably) chose to join the worst/lowest of the magic knights squads. Unlike Asta and Yuno, her character and backstory is not completely revealed yet, but it appears that she too has something to prove, untapped potential, and may just end up developing into a noble who is worthy of the title unlike so many other nobles in this series, who seem to be just horrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8, Very good: I give the enjoyment an 8 because all of these other good factors come together to craft a story that I can't wait to see the next installment of in the coming weeks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: No, this anime isn't going to be a game changer, or win any awards, but it is a fine addition to the shounen genre and if you like magic action adventure comedy fantasy shounens that are light and don't try to hard to be something that they're not, then you will likely enjoy Black Clover as I am.",

            "content": "We used to have Big 3 when it comes to anime including shows like Naruto, One piece, and Dragonball. Throw Fairytail in there also. Now as those shows are going away we look to replace them and this show was supposed to be one of those shows hyped to the point it crashed streaming websites when it released. The thing is all this show has are the bad parts of the Big 3. The story also wants to be compared to them and since it is I'm going to compare them here.\r\nThe story is about a boy who can't use magic but through some strokeof determination and luck gets a powerful magic only he can use. I purposely manipulating this to sound like Boku no hero academia. Both main characters don't have something commonplace in this world just to get one of the strongest options somehow. Now we can compare it to Naruto, where all they did was replace Hokage with Wizard King as that is our main characters main goal to be the one over them all. Then you have Fairytail's magic elements on top of the fact he basically joined the Fairytail guild and yada yada yada. You have probably had these comparisons drilled into your head by now. All you need to know is this show doesn't do any of things nearly as well as the others except for maybe Fairytail that one is being debated by everyone. And before I move on when the second episode is filler that tells you this show isn't going to have good things to come. The pacing of the show is horrendous as it starts off super slow then starts moving very quickly and slows down again. They even negate some things turning some episodes into nothing but filler that added nothing to the characters development. (No saying it won't make you like a character more or not but objectively it adds nothing.) \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. I don't love it but it's not bad at all the magic looks really good but that's the only thing I really like about it everything else I find around meh.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is all that special to me either. No songs still out to me as good or bad because I can't even remember them as it really isn't anything special. But there is one thing that I will get into with characters. The japanese voice actors are perfectly cast and that's not exactly a good thing. ( more on that later.)\\n\\n\r\nTime to let loose the characters. \\n\r\nAsta is the main character of this story and like I said before he can't use magic but you need magic to pretty much do anything in this world as people without it are unheard of except for him. Honestly, all he knows how to do is scream at the top of his lungs I mean listening to him makes me want to blow my brains out. This makes Dragonball look tame and people joke about that all the time. You might grow numb to his voice over time or you might not, either way, you might want to seek out the dub instead. But he is determined although he can't use magic he trains his heart out all day working on his physical abilities and ends up with a grimoire something signifying magic in this world. But his is special as these books all have clovers 1-4 usually 4 being very impressive but our magicless protagonist gets a 5 leaf which means he as the power of the devil or something like that which lets him use a huge sword like another story we know that cuts down magic and negates it completely. Overall his character is super annoying and his ability just leaves me bored as this isn't the first useless main character is actually useful story and I would rather watch any one of those at this point.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character I'm going to go over is our token overpower rival character Sauske... sorry I mean Gray, No Yuno, yeah Yuno. Yuno gets a 4 leaf is naturally good at magic and our main character uses him as a motivation get stronger. He is a rather emotionless character that looks up to Asta determination because he saved him this one time. I'm just going to cut it there and say this character means nothing to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters (guild members.) can be very similar to fairytail, We have a chick that drinks a lot and wears rather lewd clothing like kana. a overbearing and energetic character like natsu. a powerful and serious like gildarts occasionally can be, etc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, unless you love shonen anime do not touch this with a ten-foot pole. Watch the shows this wants to replace instead at least you don't have to wait for new episodes. and you have watched them watch them again. This show has nothing redeemable so far maybe it will and I'm going to keep watching because I'm shonen trash. But so far this is a complete garbage can of a show. I'm not saying you can't enjoy this but it's really not good.\\n",

I love anime were the mc is just so badass and everyone thinks so too. Too bad thats not what everyone thought in the beginning but it does get better especially the recent episodes. Just give this show a chance and watch it the whole way through. Its just so cool how the mc has the power to negate all magic!!! And in future episodes everyone is going to know that and either think ofhim highly or eventually fear him when he gets more power. All I'm sayin is that most people need to give this show better credit and imagine the future of this anime and how far it will go. This anime is definitely in my top 10 favorite out of about 100  anime I've watched. And it will stay there if this show continues to show the greatness and power of Asta. I'm pretty sure the makers wont screw it up and make him weak. He might still be neglected to everyone who hasn't seen him in action for being strong for a while, but soon he will be seen as the True Wizard King!!",

I enjoyed the manga alot, and to be fair i did like different things like the art and how everything was animated, that wasn't bad. However the sound, the progression, transitions were all disgusting for what this could have been.\r\nSound \r\n- it felt like the voice actors came cheap and they picked whoever offered to do it. It sounded terrible it didn't feel like most of the voice actors even fit with the characters\r\n-The sound gets irritating as well from basically how bad it all played out. Especially if their shoutingor screaming is annoying, ASTA.\\n\r\n-music decent, wasn't bad\\n\r\nProgression\\n\r\n-There is no feeling of progression that you typically see in these types of shounen animes where the main character grows with experience. we're just left with some kid who bring out some swords from a book, feels like the real progression are left with the side characters.\\n\r\nTransition\\n\r\n-this mainly ties in with the sound, but adding onto their terrible voice acting the way it shifts lines from character to narrator to character is stupid, i hate it.\\n\\n\r\nStory- it's your typical generic shounen type of setting of hoping to achieve something great with hard work and overcoming obstacles. It is not a bad type of story and has alot of potential to be interesting.\\n\r\nArt- The magic looked really cool, the fighting was well animated and smooth.\\n\r\nCharacters- generic but interesting characters, tsundere good for nothing rich girl, naruto like attitude big sword wielding kid, OP do it all magic rival, etc. yep, not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- really low, the voice acting just totally strips any type of immersion. you start to get into it \"maybe it's not that bad\" terrible voice acting, bad transitions, and Asta annoying screaming \"nevermind\"",

            "content": "Let me make it perfectly unequivocally clear that this anime, Black Clover, is a gargantuan pile of hot hot salty garbage. It is also perhaps one of the most successful unintentional comedies it has ever been my pleasure to enjoy. Or is it intentional? After 41 episodes, I still find myself unable to say. That, ladies and gentleman, is the magic of Black Clover. \r\nStory: \r\nImagine the most basic Shounen anime ever. Congratulations, you have just imagined Fairy Tail. Now make that just a little more seedy, and you have just gotten a good handle on what Black Clover is like. Fairy Tail but withmore violence and sexuality. \\n\\n\r\nThe Clover Kingdom is a country that is ruled by a Wizard King and maintained by his Magic Knights. In dinky little bumblefuck village of Hage, two orphans named Asta and Yuno dream of becoming Magic Knights and one day the Wizard king. Yuno is a magic prodigy, Asta is completely devoid of even the smallest shred of magical power. But of course that is no impediment to a main character, and soon he acquires a sword that is able to totally cancel the magic of anybody else. The two rivals set out on a competitive dick-measuring journey to become Wizard Jesus.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is the prototypical hero's tale, a young determined country bumpkin rises up against all odds and becomes OP as fuk very quickly. Lots of fights, some playful with friendly rivals and some against crazy people who can make lizards out of jelly, ensue. It is comforting in its simplicity and derivativeness. Nothing that requires you to think for a second. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nStarted off completely terrible. Really boring and bland, and kind of lazy with a lot of repetition. As the show went on it started to improve dramatically, to the point that the fights in the later arcs actually look really cool. Even the look of the slapsticky comedy moments improved over time, although they still look shitty enough to be lovably awful. The art is a small part of what makes this show such a campy gem.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOh boy. Here we go. \\n\r\nThere is one central element of this show that simultaneously makes me hate and love the fuck out of it; it is what both repulsed me and kept me coming back for more. There is no way around it. The voice of the main character, Asta no last name, is the single most annoying sound that it has ever been my pleasure to endure. It is so mind mindbogglingly irritating, it haunts my dreams at night. If it is a genuine attempt to do a serious voice worthy of the protagonist of a long running Shounen battle anime, it is the single worst performance since Ashley Simpson did that hoedown on SNL. If it is an intentional joke, either by the voice actor or the director, it routinely makes me laugh so hard I cry. \\n\\n\r\nAsta screams 100% of the time. He thinks his biggest curse is that he has no magic, but it is really that he has no inside voice. This cat quite literally ends most of his sentences with WHHHAAAAAAAAAAA! Swap him out for Waluigi, nobody would kind the difference. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly average, but the OPs have been getting better and better. The first was eminently forgettable, but they have improved to the point where I watch them every time. The endings are universally not worth the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFrom the get, the first thing we learn about this world is that everybody sucks. They are all maddeningly childish, most of the time they are being huge dicks to each other, nobody has any concept of personal space, nobody behaves like a human being in the slightest. While this pissed me off royally at first, I have reached a level of Stockholm Syndrome with this show that has left me rather warmly disposed toward almost everybody. Asta is a total spazz, screams all the time, is very dumb, an has no consideration for other people's feelings barring the rare times he can pull himself together and focus. His sword cuts through anything, it is Kryptonite and everybody else is Superman and also made of paper. Yuno's crazy-strong power is air, and that is fitting because he is also completely invisible as far as a personality goes. He wants to beat Asta and become wizard king. It is the only thought he has ever had, it is the only emotion he has ever expressed. Also there is a girl who is there named Noelle, who has water powers and confidence issues and likes Asta and that's about it. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters are so aggressively quirky that I kind of expect to side with any villain who manages to do a nice thorough job of murdering them all. I do have to admit that I kind of love them for it though. Special shout outs to Charmy, a chibi whose magic is to conjure sheep and who is basicaly moe-blob Gluttony from FMA, Luck, a sociopathic child made of lightning and bloodlust, and Sally the mad scientist evil girl who makes salamanders out of Jelly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhy'd you have to go and make things so complicated? I really should rate this show a 2 overall, because objectively it is poorly made, annoying, and is covering ground that has already been much more competently trodden by a million shows before it. But the amount of fun I had watching Black Clover leaves me giving it a 10 in enjoyment and an overall 9 for the experience I had following its story's devastating fall down the world's longest flight of stairs. I laughed harder watching this than at anything I can call to recent memory. It is so hilariously inept that is really should be seen and cherished for the shiny, polished turd it is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if the phrase \"so bad it's good\" means anything to you at all, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not watching Black Clover. As Asta always screams, his magic is not giving up, and I am so glad he inspired me not to give up on Black Clover just because it was terrible. I am eternally grateful that he did, and my life is richer for the experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to finish in true Black Clover style, WHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!",

            "content": "Black clover is really underrated on MAL. Let me explain befor you judge. The story starts a lot like naruto and fairy tail but thats only the start.\r\nBlack clover is about a boy who is really special. He has no magical power in a magical world. Just like the guild he will join he is strange. The story is about people who have strange personalitys or powers and overcome it or even use it as an strength.\r\nThere are guild members who cant control their magical power (even when the power level is really high), are addicted to fights and can get really violent because ofthat, are shy as fuck, can only use defense magic, have an unhealthy crush on their sister, are just lazy to do anything, are left alone, cant stop eating, cant stop drinking...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of black clover are really unqiue on their own. So there are many ways to combinate them and they do it pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nAt the start of the show you will maybe think its just another underdog show with a MC who was born poor and weak and becomes the strongest in the world with working hard. No, you are totally wrong. Its about characters who are special and work on their problems. Yeah Asta wants to become the wizard king who is the strongest wizard in the country but does he want to become wizard king because he wants to be the strongest and beatt everyone? No! He wants to become wizard king give the church where he grew up more money and help them.\\n\\n\r\nThan to his rival: The guy was often compared to saske from naruto. He isnt... Not a single bit. He is the only one who aknowleged Astas power from the start on and believed he could become wizard king. Does this sound like the I-hate-everything-Saske from Naruto? Hell no! He wants to become wizard king because Asta inspired him.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system of the magic is really cool so far. Its about the wizard books and they use the 4 elements water, fire, earth and air but also combinate them in really diffrent ways. Than there is the demon race with unknown power and asta probably gets his power/clover from somewhere there. Than there are 4 levels of strengths of the wizard books. Astas rival has the 4th level book. Than there are later implemanted gods of elements who choose the strongest of each one element. Next to this there are magics you cant really put in the 4 elements its not clear until now why they are there but they are rarer as fuck and really strong. Its mutch better as the power system in fairy tail.\\n\\n\r\nSo is it as good as naruto, one piece or bleach (I didnt watched bleach yet)? No, but it could be in the future. Is it as good as fairy tail? Yes, it is and you can compare them.\\n\\n\r\nBlack clover is definitly worth watching. Dont let the haters go in your mind. The start of black clover is not that good. You can compare it there like dragon ball super and boruto. The start of them is really not good but it gets better with the time.\\n",

It's kind of annoying beccause he always shout every time, but it's just a little bit mistake of this animation.

I just want to say but this is the first review I have ever done. \r\nI am going to make this a quick review and to start of, I want to say to the people who hate on this anime because of the main character's shouting, you are stupid. As generic as Black Clover is, it is still very enjoyable and I am going to continue watching each new episode as it airs. \r\nI don't really want to go too in depth into talking about the story, but I will say it is very good, it is not amazing but it isvery good.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I do think that so far it has some good ones. A huge complaint about the anime for Black Clover is the main character Asta and his consent shouting. Like I said, if you are hating on this anime just because of that then that is very low. I find Asta as an interesting and hilarious character. I do hope to see most of the other characters and Asta get character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the anime is pretty decent too, Studio Pierrot are doing a good job there.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't really got much to say about the sound, but it is very good once again. The first opening and ending songs to the anime are very nice too.\\n\\n\r\nSo far I am enjoying this anime a lot and I do recommend it. Just be prepared for it to be pretty generic, but trust me it is still enjoyable. Asta's shouting is easy to get use to, it was only in the first episode where I thought the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I give Black Clover a 9/10 \\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI will not be making a full review when the anime finishes.",

            "content": "Black Clover is one of the worst battle shounen I have seen. \r\nLets start with the two things that where obvious from the start:\r\nI: the main characters voice is really annoying.\r\nII: the pacing is horrendous. The first 13 episodes cover the first 10 characters of the manga.\r\nFortunately both of these things improve with time, unfortunately the same can't be said about the numerous other problems.\r\nThe animation is bad and for some reason got worse during the final battle. Which is weird because that's where you normally see the best animation.\r\nThe soundtrack is used so rarely that I can't remember a single tune despite having watched51 episodes of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOf course if Black Clover had good characters and a good plot it would still have been good, unfortunately both are bad.\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters have one or in rare chases two gimmicks that defines them entirely. Once a character who has some problem witnesses the main character Asta's drive to never give up they will immediately change their mind and get over there problem, if said character is a girl she will also fall in love with Asta.\\n\r\nNone of the villains have good motivations or interesting character traits and are therefore completely boring. Sure there are some hints that they might get more development later, but the potential to get better later does not make something good.\\n\r\nNot that the villains have ever a change of succeeding, because whenever a important character is about to be defeated they learn a new spell to save themselves. Because who wants tension anyway?\\n\r\nThen there is the rivalry between Asta and Yuno. It's gets set up in the beginning, but because they join different magic knight squads they rarely meet so it doesn't feel like a reel rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nI could name a myriad of other problems with this anime, but it would quickly devolve into nitpicking and spoilers so I won't, instead I'll talk about the positive.\\n\r\nLike most battle shounen Black Clover occasionally has jokes. While some of those jokes are boring there are some that are really funny. It is far from enough to make Black Clover good but it is better than nothing.",

However, Asta one of the main characters is born with no magic and struggles to keep up with the others as he grows up. Yuno is the other orphan that was born with magic power and alot of it.  These two are always competing andboth want to grow up to become the wizard king. The most powerful wizard in all of Clover Kingdom. As the story continues, Asta continues to never give up with all the obstacles that he faces along his journey as well as Yuno. I think this show is quite entertaining and it made me want to keep watching. The characters care about each other and so far there has been significant growth in several of the characters. I definitely will continue to watch this show to see where it goes and how it ends!",

            "content": "As of writing this review I have only seen up to Ep.10, mild spoilers may occur containing information up to that point. \r\nTL;DR: The story is nothing unique but is still solid. Characters and the fact that Studio Pierrot are the ones adapting this are Black Clover's biggest flaw. Black Clover, despite these flaws I do still find very enjoyable though.\r\nIt's disappointing to see how lowly ranked this is and some of the stupid reviews that just call it trash. Yes, Black Clover has many flaws (just as any anime have flaws), simply based on these flaws i took a guess at what studio madeit, and to no surprised I was correct. Studio Pierrot strikes again with its bad adaptations!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10) Mediocre\\n\r\nThe main area of Black Clover's flaws lie in its characters. This is not limited to Asta and how he yells approximately 37 times per episode, but nearly all the characters with some sort of gag. What I mean by this is they use and reuse the same jokes with each character to the point where it is no longer funny. Some anime struggle with having every character act differently, this one however greatly over-dramatizes each character with the same jokes. \\n\\n\r\nThis however by no means makes it a terrible anime, in fact Black Clover has quite a few of those moments that get you excited and make you want to watch the next episode. Moments like when you first see the demon behind Asta and him using his sword, and when Asta gets his Magic Knights cloak had me pumped and super excited. \\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10) Fair, Enjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nThe story itself so far is pretty basic and doesn't stand out as unique, its just a typical but solid story and world, but as mentioned above does have big moments which make me really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) Good, Sound (7/10) Good\\n\r\nThe art style and sound track are nothing special and pretty normal but tie into whats going on well, the OST is not good enough that I would listen to it in my free time. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters, one big complaint I do have though is that you are treated to repeated scenes prior to the opening that just goes over the setting or what happened in the previous episode, this basically makes me feel like Studio Pierrot was lazy and stalled out 40 or so seconds of content and new animation every episode. They also reuse a picture of Asta twice in the opening, while some may find this silly, it just makes me feel like the studio was lazy and simply tried to limit the amount of work they had to do.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I believe having Asta be able to do more than just swing his sword would make the anime much better, since I dont see him growing or changing as a character. Maybe if he learned a spell (but of course he cant use magic so maybe the sword/demon would come into play and increase his physical capabilities or something.) At one point in the anime, they mentioned that when a magic user matures, grows emotionally, or so forth they will \"unlock\" new spells from their grimoire, I would like to see something like this for Asta's case.\\n",

Me personally, I would give this anime a 8/10 so far in its current state. If it follows the manga to an extent, and improves on its characters emotional stances, I will recommend it to other people. With all that happens in the manga it will be an interesting ride, for anyone willing to watch it. However peoplethinking this is the next Naruto, you are in for a ride. No, Black Clover has its own unique stances on the trying to accomplish becoming the Wizard King. In Black Clover Yuno and Asta are having a competition in who can become the Wizard King first. Yuno doesn't discriminate against Asta because he has 0 magical ability like the others, because Yuno knows all the work and effort Asta has put into his dream. Asta works towards a goal even though he doesn't have the status to do so. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI would give the story a fair 6/10 though that's being harsh. Considering I have read all of the manga to the current release. I look forward to watching the anime through and through. I don't know what you've heard, but nothing bad has happened so far, we have an interesting story getting set up and from the reviews I have been seeing, people act like all anime has a 100% unique story line. Yes, I can understand how easy it would be to set up a story that is 100% unique but having an evolving main character is very difficult in its own right. Considering this, the anime itself follows the manga pretty well so far, and if it continues it will most likely get more and more people to come watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI would give the art a 6/10 and that's being lenient. I personally love the art style of the background, environment, characters, etc. However I do not like how they set up the way the abilities look. When you come across them, they seem abstract and as if they are cut from something else. This being said, I get past it and love a good story. Considering I watched another anime not giving names with even worse special fx.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound fits well, sounds good however there is delay you can tell in some spots. I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacter development is going to be a huge factor in depending if this will become a good hit. I loved the personalities of the characters in the manga, however I hope that occurrences like in episode 16 don't happen too often. When one of the somewhat cutoff main characters(Luck) has a somewhat touching event and brushes it off like it was some sort of stupid happenstance. It bothers me very highly. I don't know if that was a fluke or some sort of, \"meant to be\" scenario. However,I guess whatever, and that was my only issue while watching so far.\\n\r\nI give character development a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIn the end this is the only thing that matters. The enjoyment of an anime. I love Black Clover so far, I hope they make it to the current issue its at in the manga. So many good arc's they can mess around with. Good character development, good everything. The anime seems to tie in with the manga so far with some filler content on the way. As well gives us viewers something good to look foward too after a long day at whatever the heck your doing for a day job.\\n\r\nI give it a 9/10.",

I think that the story is good even though there are many other animes that are similar. I think that art is done nicely and I liked the voice acting even though some people thought that it sucked. I don't know why but people hate this anime because they think that Asta's annoying. Sure he screams a lot but that's what makes me like Asta more. I personally think that Asta's fun and likeable and is not annoying just because he screams alot. I also hate how people review the anime and hate it when they are barely 10 episodes into it. Sure the anime started out slowly but as the story progressed it gets better and I also love how the anime has many mysteries that aren't solved yet. Like why the grimoire chose him and who's Asta's parents. The fights are really good too and make you want to watch more. The character development in this anime is also really amazing. You get to look deeper into each character's past and they also have their own moments to shine. The anime also never takes a break and always have something interesting happen. I don't get why people hate the anime so much but I 100% loved it and will continue to watch it!",

            "content": "I'm not sure if this is a review as much as it is a rant. If you're still interested in reading what I have to say after being told this, thank you. Thank you for reading. Gratitude is one hell of a virtue, and cultivating virtues should be a part of learning how to live in a civilized society. Patience... other great virtue, but extremely overlooked in MAL. People seem eager to \"being opinionated\", which is not the same as \"being knowledgeable\". \"Knowledge\" is pretty much subjective when you're watching an anime, though. Evidently, it helps to know a few things about Japanese contemporary culture/historywhen you're watching something like Gintama, which is full of small fast jabs and complex relevant references alike... but Black Clover? Not so much. So that leaves us with \"opinionated\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter this short introduction, which we'll go back to later on,  let me begin with something that should be conspicuously clear from the very beginning: Black Clover is mostly a fast paced battle shounen (especially the manga, since the anime seems to be stretching some parts to slow it down a notch... which, in my opinion, might be actually a nice thing in the long run).\\n\\n\r\nSet in a fantasy world, where magic is everything, our protagonist is a boy named Asta, who, as far as we know, might be the only person in that place who can't use magic. At all. His dream? Becoming the \"magic emperor\", which seems like an impossible task for several reasons:\\n\\n\r\na) He's an orphan, raised by a church in a village situated in the outskirts of the kingdom of Clover (we progressively get to know exactly what that means).\\n\r\nb) The \"magic emperor\" is the most important person in the kingdom, apart from the king himself, and having that position means you're the most powerful mage in the whole country.\\n\r\nc) Did I already say Asta can't use magic?\\n\r\nd) At all?\\n\\n\r\nThis story is pretty simple, and it uses a great deal of anime tropes, something that many other reviewers have spoken about, stressed, underlined, discussed extensively, etc. Going back to the introduction, it's all about \"having an opinion\". I would even go as far as saying that their assessment focuses almost solely on the \"lack of originality\", which baffles me. Perhaps Black Clover is, ostensibly, a story that follows the formula popularized by other famous shounen like Naruto, Bleach or Fairy Tail. There's no subtlety in the premise, characters, world-building, and plot development. Again, this is an unpretentious battle manga, which people who like the genre might find enjoyable. It's not a masterpiece, by any means, but it's pretty solid, and it has its own merits. So, please, keep all the pretentiousness and elitist fanfare to yourself when you're watching something like Black Clover. If you take a couple of minutes browsing its background, you should know pretty well this is not artsy, clever, philosophical... nor it tries to be. But original? Let me ask again, originality? In 2017? Let alone in shounen? Good luck with that. Good luck finding the \"1 in 1000\" anime, the one that brings something completely new or fresh to the table, and stick with it. Maybe it's Inuyashiki this year... but someone who watches Black Clover might not necessarily like Inuyashiki. Which is perfectly fine as they bring pleasure to different palates. Enjoyment *should* be a big priority when watching anime, because this is mostly a hobby for the majority of us, and hobbies are all about leisure. Putting yourself through a chore, that gives you no enjoyment, in a field that tends to serve entertainment, is called masochism. Pure, uncut, raw masochism.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I must say, Black Clover does have some flaws, even if you like the genre. Firstly, and as I mentioned before, this adaption slightly differs from the manga. In the future, it might be seen as a good thing, since there are parts of the story where the author clearly lacks refinement in the way he puts together the story arcs, and even in how he structures the character development. Sometimes it feels way too forced, or even clunky. Hopefully the anime will make things smoother. Nevertheless, the first few episodes were too uneventful, and they might be a bad way to introduce someone to Black Clover, since they stretched the events a bit too much. The introduction of the Black Bulls and the subsequent arcs that follow this rowdy group of mages is where Black Clover begins to shine.\\n\\n\r\nYou might also be put off by Asta's voice acting, and... I guess most people are. The seiyuu's pitch is particularly annoying, and I just hope he improves... it's his first gig, so he has a lot of room to grow. As of now, he's got a long, long way to go, and easily wins \"Worst VA Performance\" of all time, as far as I'm concerned. I can't remember someone having such an unpleasant voice doing such an high-profile role... so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, if you like this genre, you'll probably like Black Clover. Give it time, have some patience. Many characters have nice backgrounds, the art and animation seem decent comparing to the average shounen, and the action is pretty cool. Overall, it's not mind-blowing, but it's pleasurable. Don't expect it to be as good as One Piece or HxH and you'll probably find yourself enjoying BC.",

            "content": "Black Clover is a Shonen that feels like it was written 12 years ago and has taken none of the lessons of its predecessors. \r\nMost of my time watching Black Clover was spent watching it to mock it and laugh at how bad it is. Because this show is bad. Really, really bad. The nicest thing I could say about it is that it's painfully average and has one or two good moments but they're not worth sitting through the rest of this dreck for unless you can have a chuckle at it.\r\nStory is bare bones Shonen plot. I wasn't exactly expecting a stellar andcaptivating plot for this kind of show but but it's clearly not trying that hard. It's a simple setup that allows for various fantasy missions, usually involving the villains and ending in big stupid fight scenes. It doesn't ever get too complex, the world building is pretty lackluster likely due to holding onto key information for twists later on such as why the Diamond and Clover kingdoms are at war. As is it's not hugely engaging and doesn't throw you for any loops or if it does try to fool you, it usually gives no buildup at all, or it kills the tension afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is awful. The animation has numerous errors in continuity and in lip syncing, the fight scenes lack good choreography and often resort to lazy shortcuts to avoid putting the effort in. There may be occasional bursts of good animation but for a series releasing an episode every week with no breaks, it's hardly a surprise. Studio Pierrot doesn't have the best animation reputation either. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is bad. By now everyone has heard Asta's infamous screaming voice and whilst it does get better the further you go, it doesn't exactly become anything near quality. The music is pretty forgettable and none of the other VAs stand out or exhibit anything particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? What character? This show doesn't have characters, it has one note stereotypes and cliches that pretend to be characters. I'd say there's only two to three actual characters in the show, the rest are just one note cliches that barely emote and their interactions consist of them reminding you what their trait is before moving on to someone else. The protagonist suffers from this immensely, they try to go the 'boundless determination' route but it never feels earned and they hardly emote beyond that so it hardly matters all that much. At best, the characters are simply boring, at worst they're insufferable. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the only enjoyment I get out of this show is ironic. It's just kind of entertaining to watch and laugh at for how much the show runners misunderstand about the tropes of Shonen anime and just throw them in there for the sake of them rather than giving them the time or buildup they deserve. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a mess. I've been told the manga is better but I honestly don't care. Unless you want to get into Shonen and see one of its worst examples, steer clear.",

I get the same feeling like  when i watched naruto for the first time and then followed because of it being too awesome, or like wathing bleach in the arrancar arc, couldn't stop watching it. The plot is very intriguing, you can't stop from watching it, waiting for the next episode every week.Most of the characters are a bit developped, almost no characters are left aside. Overall 10/10, the next successor of Naruto IMO!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "Black Clover has a large problem that seems endemic to the Shonen category in general, it spends entirely too much time trying to make things easy to understand. Whenever anything happens on screen, the exact way you should feel about it is conveyed by dialogue specifically addressing it. Rather than building up context to form a straightforward underdog protagonist, the writers would rather just have enough people say it in enough circumstances for us to believe it to be the case. Like, Asta did not just pathetically get rejected by a girl that he likes for the Xth time in a row, he needed todo it in front of an audience that kept reminding him all the different ways he was pathetic, and how Yuno was way better than him at everything. Asta is not just hellbent on becoming the Wizard King, he is constantly screaming at nobody in particular why he feels this way. The villain character is not just a villain, they have to lurk menacingly, say vaguely menacing things, then outright explain that he is a deplorable person before he does evil things. \\n\\n\r\nI could keep going, but I think my point should be clear by now. These scenes feel like they are happening to complete a narrative rather than something that could actually happen to a real person. Because every scene has no faith in the viewer to be able to interpret events without being told what to think about them, the viewer cannot assume the scenes to be anything more than what they declare themselves to be. This is particularly dangerous for an introductory episode since this is supposed to be what convinces us that the characters and the world are interesting enough to be worth exploring. \\n\\n\r\nI will continue watching Black Clover, but I'm already convinced that this story is not for people who like good storytelling techniques. I feel like despite the hype, Black Clover is setting itself up to be an extremely forgettable series. Not horrible, but definitely below average",

The characters are pretty much like other shounen but some are really special (i won't say why and who because I would spoil). If you like battleshounens this is an anime for you, you could start watching from like episode 35ish for the action but i suggest you watch from the start so the story makes sense and learn about the characthers stories! Overall its a good anime like dragon ball, one piece, fairy tail, naruto (not boruto) so watch it if you like these kind of anime!",

            "content": "BASIC STORY AND PLOT SPOILERS BELOW\r\n- BE WARNED - \r\nThis is a timeless, archetypal story about a boy awkwardly becoming a man, it's a Shounen trope that relies on ankle break plot twists, and gotcha moments but that has a solid japanese subtitle cast, good consistent sound & animation quality for a shounen, and that which delivers on enjoyment consistently. At least for my 26 year old male self, i find that i can identify with Asta and Yuno, friends who are the main protagonists of the show, and rivals of one another.\r\nYuno is good at everything, Asta is well, not. In the past yunowas supported by Asta, who at the time before they had magic to seperate them, the former was the weaker of the two. As they get older, we see Yuno clearly assuming the mantle of prodigy with exceptional mage for his age, Asta with no magic whatsoever. They grow up together, and are friends and Asta never once is shown to resent Yuno for having magic. Instead of wallowing in despair for his lack of talent born, he makes up the gap in hard work.\\n\\n\r\nYuno is no pushover though, and they grow in character from taking lessons in one anothers conduct. Asta is the model of work ethic, who motivates Yuno to work hard despite his innate talent. They both want to become the strongest mage in the land, the Wizard King.\\n\\n\r\nYuno, the quiet & conscientious one,  acknowledges Asta, the rambunctious persistent one, ever since an event occurred in which Asta saved Yuno from bullies due to his drive to never give in, and to protect his friends. He may not be the most attractive character, but throughout the show he showcases Grit, which makes the viewer want to see him succeed.  Asta and Yuno build relationships on top of a solid foundation of integrity, for two orphan boy who is fighting and struggling to find his place in the world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI am a veteran of many, many anime seasons. I've seen most shounen anime tropes, and like most of us who have seen similar protagonist character tropes, i see sampled elements in Asta that i've undoubtedly seen before. He's got that never say die attitude common to a spunky main character who starts off with nothing, and is all about his bonds of friendship. Deku from my hero acadamia for a recent example, or very similarly to Ichigo in Bleach. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOften, for most people trying is not enough, but for these characters they will make you reflect inwardly on things maybe in your own life you could be putting more effort towards. This is where i find the value in watching the show. Driving myself to get better, aswell as valuing my relationships more.\\n\\n\r\nA great show to watch for a procrastinator, and the plot is sufficiently different from its source material brother and sister animes that it makes it it's own \\n\r\n8/10",

So I told myself do I really want to invest time on this anime ? I've been watching Anime my entire life so why waste time on this? Well it was a Saturday and I was pretty bored, didn't have anything good to watch so I tried watching a 6/10 anime. Yeah the first episode was really slow, but I still had time to spare so I watched 3 more episodes, the main character Asta's voice is just annoying! I gave it other episode,wow I got interested all of a sudden. This anime builds up slow! REALLY SLOW! The first 5 minutes of an episode is showing what happened on the last episode and the intro, so that's a waste of 5 minutes already, not sure why the producer did this. Anyway give this anime a chance, yeah Asta can be annoying but you will eventually like him, there are other characters that you will love. I created an account just to review this anime.. I don't read any manga, I just watch, so I this review doesn't reflect whatever is on the manga. GIVE IT A CHANCE!",

Would recommend watching it, you just have to get past the first few episodes of screeching before it tones down.\r\nI really like the series due to the interaction between the different characters and the apparent and delightfull fourth walls breakage going on in some of the fight scenens.\r\nIt is very fast paced and rarely tones down, other than for the mandatory cute/sweetsegments. Unlike the old dragon ball Z series where a fight could last atleast 30 episodes.\\n\r\nThe female cast is also quite waifu-able, which i guess is nice for the true weebs and otakus out there.",

I just wish that the episodes would come out faster. I love everything about this anime from the soundtrack to the backstories. The animation is beautiful, well-done, smooth, and breathtaking. The story is your typical shounen cliche, but is that such a bad thing? I don't think so. I think we all love the typical shounen anime, and this is no exception. The anime pulls you in and never lets go of you. The characters and their backstories are amazing, they pull at the heartstrings and make you feel sympathy even for the bad guys. the soundtrack is amazing, the songs of this anime make me feel what the anime is all about. Overall, I love this anime along with many other shounen anime and hope you will agree.\\n\\n\r\n\"If it makes you happy, enjoy it\" - Koranai 2018",

            "content": "(tl:dr at the bottom) I just want to start with the fact that I simply do not understand how or why the score for this show stands at 6.54. I really don't think that it's a fair rating for this show, and would highly advise against avoiding this anime because of it. Onto the spoiler-free review (As of 20 episodes I feel that I have a good enough grasp on the different aspects of the show to write a review for it. That said, I will update the review if anything changes)!\r\nArt&Sound: 9&9\r\nI don't really like to talk about these when reviewing a show, becausefrankly everything that comes out now has both great art and great sounds. By default I give these categories both a 9, unless I find them to be exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. In the case of Black Clover, I think that they are both great, and not really worth expanding on. Essentially, I don't think that Art & Sound are going to make or break this anime for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nAs of 20 episodes, the overarching story for the show is not entirely established**. The show so far has made use of many 3-4 episode story arcs that they use to develop characters (more on that later) and develop the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Black Clover is fairly expansive and it is interesting to learn about. The anime does a good job of introducing new aspects of the world at a reasonable pace, so the viewer never finds themselves confused nor like they have to take notes to keep up. In addition, the anime gives enough information about the various things it introduces to explain to the viewer what is happening, but hints to the fact that there is more to discover. In doing this, the world of the show becomes dynamic, and one of the reasons to watch it becomes to learn what the show is withholding from us.\\n\\n\r\n**So far, the biggest problem with the anime is the fact that it has not established its overarching story. We know that Asta and Yuno want to be the Wizard King, but that's about it because the show has yet to engage in its first major story arc (like more than a couple episodes). I am not saying that the current style of 3-4 episode arcs is bad, because they aren't. These arcs are all necessary to build the world and develop the characters, and they are enjoyable. Without those two things, the first major arc would be plagued with out of place explanations and last minute flashbacks to develop characters; effectively, it would become very difficult to enjoy. Once we have enough of the world built, it will be very important for the anime to establish the first major arc/antagonist/etc so that the show has more direction than \"its protagonists want to become the Wizard King.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nSo far, the show has done an excellent job of introducing and developing characters. It spent the first couple episodes teaching the viewer about the 2 main characters, and has used various story arcs to begin introducing various members of the guilds. One thing that black clover does that other shows don't is employ 2 main characters. What I mean is that both Asta and Yuno are the center of the story at different points, and the show seems as though that will continue. Watching the two very different characters grow from their respective perspectives at the same time is very interesting and very well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go, the show has introduced quite a few, but only gotten around to actually developing a handful. Most the characters are very quirky and unique, and I can't wait to learn more about them. As far as the developed characters go, the show does a good job of making sure that no two characters are entirely alike. The anime succeeds in having characters from many different walks of life. One of the most enjoyable parts of the show is watching how these very different characters come together to overcome whatever challenge faces them. It helps that the developed characters are all done so well, and stay with the shows theme of giving the viewer enough information to care about and enjoy the characters, while hinting that there is much more yet to be revealed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI very much enjoy this anime, and think it does an excellent job of staying entertaining. The anime is funny when it wants to be funny, serious when it wants to be serious, etc. and everything is introduced in an enjoyable way.\\n\\n\r\nMany people want to discredit this anime because it is similar to other popular shounen series, such as Naruto. While it is true that Black Clover has some aspects that are similar to other shows, I think that that can be said for all shounens (and anime in general), and I don't think you should let it stop you from giving the show a chance. If you enjoy other shounens, you will probably enjoy Black Clover. If you dislike shounens, then this show might not be for you. If you are somewhere in the middle, then I would highly recommend giving this show a chance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9    (****tl;dr****)\\n\r\nBlack Clover is an enjoyable anime with an expanding world and interesting characters, both of which have much more that is yet to be discovered. Even though it might not be the most original series of all time, it is different from other anime and very entertaining, and you should definitely give it a chance if you don't hate shounens.",

            "content": "Black Clover - does it really deserve the low score? Should temporary reviews influence your decision in giving some anime a chance? \r\nRead a bit below on why you should not let others make that decision for you.\r\nPersonally I'm always happy when new anime shows appear. I'm aware that while a few will succeed, many of them will end up average or below. REGARDLESS, I am grateful for all of them. Without average or bad anime, there wouldn't be any good or awesome anime. And while we wouldn't mind masterpieces like Full Metal Alchemist at every turn, we have to understand that it's not alwayseasy to get the formula right.\\n\\n\r\nHere's an example on why to not let others make the decision for you.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover had a rather promising review score after the initial episodes, but then the score started to plummet. I'm not really into watching ongoing anime, but I do check series scores from time to time when looking for finished series to potentially watch. It was disappointing to see the score went below 7, and I was left with the impression: \"Oh man.. that's too bad. The synopsis sounded pretty interesting, but I guess everything went down the drain now...\".\\n\\n\r\nRecently I was really in the mood of watching some shounen/fantasy/superpower series. Boku no Hero Academia season 3 still ongoing, so I'll have to wait until October. MEH....\\n\\n\r\nAnd I ran a couple of times into Black Clover. Noticed that there were over 40 episodes released, so I said \"Hey - I'll break my rule to not watch ongoing and watch some episodes\". But I kept looking at the score, I kept noticing a top rated negative review so I avoided doing that for a while.\\n\\n\r\nUntil one day when I was doing my usual search and said: \"Well, how bad can it be? If it's really that bad, I'll waste 1 or 2 hours of my life and that's it. Not like I haven't wasted a lot more in my life\". So I started watching the show, with low expectations and here were the results:\\n\\n\r\n- It's true that the show starts a bit slow\\n\\n\r\n- It's true that the MC is not as cool or complicated as some would want him to be\\n\\n\r\n- It's true that the MC is rather annoyingly dumb in the start\\n\\n\r\nBUT\\n\\n\r\n- After the first 10-15 episodes, the show starts ramping up. \\n\\n\r\n- The story opens, gets more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\n- MC becomes less retarded. Sort of. And shouts less.\\n\\n\r\n- New characters, new powers, new fun stuff! \\n\\n\r\n- Also, some nice comedy moments! :)\\n\\n\r\n- In my opinion, the show has some nice EDs (first 2 being even better than the OPs), and a really awesome 3rd OP.\\n\\n\r\n- But going back to the previous statement - YES - it gets A LOT BETTER. I was watching the show by myself, when it had caught the eye of my gf around ep 15. The show got her attention, she got hooked and we ended up devouring the show together until ep 39. Now we have to wait for it to finish, although our thirst for more Black Clover needs to be restrained for now.\\n\\n\r\nWas I a fool to trust temporary negative reviews and it's overall score? Yes, I was. A BIG ONE. Because in the end, this anime turned out to be a VERY ENJOYABLE ride. \\n\\n\r\nAs bad as anyone may claim it to be, this is not the worst anime of all times.\\n\\n\r\n*CONCLUSION*\\n\\n\r\nIf you're willing to go through 10-15 slow episodes, you might just be very happy that you decided to watch this show. It start slow but gets a lot better along the way! As for me, I can't really wait for more! Even if it's not a masterpiece, it's an enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\nDon't be a blind sheep and jump on the hate train with people who haven't even watched the show properly. Use your own brain, eyes and ears to make decisions if you love anime. If not, GTFO and go watch Westworld or w/e.\\n\\n",

Okay so most people review this anime after watching only a few episodes, the animation starts of as \"okay\" but with time it's animation keeps getting better. The story line is actually pretty good, I for one really enjoyed it and I'm kind of sad that it does not have any more episodes. This is an anime similar to naruto in a way because the story-line progresses slowly but with time it only gets better. \r\ni would suggest watching it, even if you dont think it's the best anime in the world,you'll still enjoy it.",

As an adaptation of Successful Manga of Yuki Tabata along with Similar Shonen Tropes seen in Popular Shonen Titles like Iconic Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach etc. \r\nStory: \r\nBlack Clover focuses on the rivalry between Asta and Yuno, their journey to become Wizard King along with Squadmates & dangerous missions. Also it is battle of Inequality i.e Noble Vs Poor. \r\nArt:\r\nStudio Pierrot done better with this anime using nice story pacing and moderating their animation resources for some truly standoutaction sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEnjoyable \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNothing Special, Each Character we have seen already in Many Animes like few animetards says Asta is reincarnation of Naruto in Black Clover World. Asta, Yuno & Noelle are quite good (MCs) characters who across inner motivation to surpass expectations of Others. Asta & Yuno who simply fights  to make their class of people like Poor Peasants by becoming Wizard King while Noelle who is from Noble Family has to prove her potential to them by becoming powerful but still all goes in Vain due to inability to control her magical powers. While Rest Characters are nice & adequate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs Big Shonen Fan, I like this Anime too because of nice action sequences & my favorite trope that \"ANY ODD OR CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS 10000 TIMES DANGEROUS, THEN ALSO HERO WINS WITH UNEXPECTED TWIST OR ATTACK\" as which we watched numerous times in DBZ, Naruto etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis has many genres covered like MAGIC, ACTION, ADVENTURES, COMEDY ----> SHONEN. Please leave your logical brains & enjoy show at fullest.\\n\r\nDon't think abt Chakra, Ki, Haki, etc\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS\\n",

Why are you even watching anime??\r\nLike stop bieng  a fucking bitch and just watch and enjoy. There's no reason for you to focus on every second of the anime, just ENJOY. Its not like itsa death or life situation its just an anime... \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gets a 10/10 and definitely recommended.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry if i spelled something wrong dont take it seriously.",

He also have a great rival Yuno. He also is an orphan and was found in front of church together with Asta. So both have same birthday, also Yuno excels in everything and is better than most of the people and so is different from Asta. However on his 15th birthday Asta got a Grimoire which have mysterious powers (basically a sword; watch Black Clover I don't want to spoil it by telling it's powers) and have never appeared to anyone before.\\n\r\nI don't think that the story would have been better if the background is not like this\\n\r\nNow as you might have guessed it it is similar to Naruto and Sasuke from NARUTO SERIES (2002- 2017) and Boku no Hero Academia series (2016-20??).\\n\r\nThat is the reason for its so many negative reviews!\\n\r\nIn my opinion You must watch it if you are a big fan of both the series mention above. As it is soo much interesting now than it was before(since even I found it copied at first). ALSO I DO RECOMMEND IT!",

Not to mention he is super annoying in the fact that almost every sentence he says is screamed. It makes it an awful watch for someone who is actually trying to just enjoy anime. The story is decent however the character makes it a hard watch. Until an episode comes where Asta shuts up with all his yelling then this anime is only going to become garbage. I personally do not enjoy this anime, and do notsee how or why it is getting 52 episodes. If they wanted a good story they would spend more time focusing on the brother of Asta, Yuno. Whose character definitely seems more interesting and less annoying.",

            "content": "Firstly, I feel the need of making something clear.\r\nThe anime doesn't deserve the amount of hate it gets. It has very obvious flaws, some of them being the anime productor's direct fault and some not, which, mixed to babyrage and personal opinions disguised as facts cause an immense ball of rage that spins around Black Clover.\r\nI am impressed on how the most voted opinion on this Anime is basically \"it is trash and I don't care about other peoples' opinions, I am the only one right\". And other people agreed, surprisingly, specially when it comes from a guy who only watched 10 episodes. It's reallylaughable, plus the anime does get better later.\\n\r\nI please ask you not to get carried away by such empty and brainless reviews and critics about the anime made by people who don't actually care about proving a point on where the anime could improve and instead just assume that the fact they didn't like the anime makes it trash.\\n\r\nThat said, I can start trying to point out actual pros and cons of the anime.\\n\r\nHonestly, it has very obvious flaws that I can't avoid mentioning, such as the weak animation, that makes it look like they couldn't afford better animations, which gets even more obvious when they try to mix in completely tridimensional objects within a 2D scene, and it completely stands out. This happens more often on the first episodes, and overall the graphical quality increases after the first few, which is *not* enough to ruin the anime experience, but seems to be enough to attract 50% of the hate the anime got.\\n\r\nAlong with that, I can undestand the people who say the anime is cliche/generic. They do have a point (when they decide to actually speak instead of crying) on the fact that the anime isn't a new genre, but really, what is? That also still doesn't mean it's bad, and doesn't ruin the anime experience. If you are not interested in the anime's genre, don't start watching it, first of all. But if you do, the anime *can* be entertaining and fun if you ignore minor details such as graphical imperfections.\\n\r\nThe third and last major complaint people make that I want to address is the anime not being like the manga. I do agree that most changes from the manga that happened were likely unecessary, but, really, this is something that just happens, and happens to almost any anime, no matter how big or small it is. I do admit it being another negative thing, but you *still* *can* live with it.\\n\r\nBelow all those layer of dirt, in which I really hope Pierrot Studio ignores the hate it got but actually improve out of it, there IS good stuff on the anime. It has plenty of good elements, wheter they are good enough to suit your likes or not. It has plenty of action, magic, fantasy, very funny scenes... It can be fun to watch if you're into it and into the mood for it.\\n\r\nTo sum it up, the anime might be cliche but still has positive points, if you let aside your huge ego and don't freak out if one line of the anime is different from the manga. And if you don't mind the main character screaming all the time. :)\\n\r\nHave a nice day",

I have seen the first 100 episodes of Naruto before I dropped it, I watched halfway into the second season of MHA before dropping, and I am currently 100 episodes through One Piece and I am making very slow progress through it.  But despite everyone saying that this show it a mish-mash of shounen action shows, it is the only one that continuously captures my attention.  Black Clover does not take a lot of time to slow down the action, and when it does,it is charming one or two slice of life in a fantasy world episodes between major story arcs.  This show does not waste your time.  I even picked up the manga and I am now caught up (the first several chapters have horrible translations but after a while it gets way better) and I am very excited for what is to come the anime.  For anyone who judges this show on just the first few episodes (which bored the hell out of me with how much they flashed back), you are missing out on THE BEST shounen action anime out there with some of my favorite fight scenes from any anime (although some of the fight animation is an insult to anyone with a brain).",

Although that his personality can tick us off, we have to admit, other anime that has this kind of protagonists tick us off too.\r\nIt is just that, this anime tries a bit too hard sometimes, like when it comes to battles, we only get to see Asta in action and others being the support, but recent anime episode shows otherwise andthey are catching up with him in terms with new spells.\\n\\n\r\nWith Yuno, we already know he is too powerful thanks to his 4-leaf clover grimoire which is apparently rare, but development wise, we still need to know more about him, he still has the same behavior from the beginning.

I really did tried to continue following the show thinking \"Maybe it will be better.\" (fyi I havent read the manga and Im writing this review based on the anime adaptation)\r\n   Where do I even start? Okay... first, \r\nThe story: Its generic. In a bad way. I know most, if not all shonen have this plot where a weak protagonist trains and becomes  stronger, blah blah blah. but this show... It just fails to captivate me. \r\nSound: It's forgettable. its somewhere in the middle, Its not that bad and it's not that good either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Protagonist is freaking dumb and annoying af. and most of the characters are uninteresting and direct copies from other similar shows.\\n\\n\r\nArt style/Animations: Now this! Is the main freaking reason that i'm now dropping the show. Such a turn off! Instead of getting hyped for a fight instead I get really pissed because of the sh*^y animation. The fighting scenes, like... seriously? CGI golem and like 3 frames fighting scenes. It feels so clanky and cheaply made. Every damn episode the animation just keeps getting worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe watch these genre primarily for the action. But this show cant even do that one right. Save your time and watch something else.\\n\\n\r\nand I apologize for my English.",

            "content": "Before talking about Black Clover, let me tell you about my anime taste. I like Shounen. Actually, I love Shounen. I only prefer to watch Shounen anime and trust me if you are anything like me then you will like Black Clover. Please read the reasons given below:\r\nBlack clover has been inspired by many other Shounen animes but, trust me when I say this, it is not just a copy and paste job. There are a lot of things which is original to this anime. Like the overall setting of the anime and the MC fighting with swords even though its a magic related anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere is an original story in this anime. It may feel a little slow paced but the story will eventually become great and I can bet on it. There are so many mysteries in this anime that you will find yourself often questioning and those mysteries will be enlightened in the future. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIts a typical Shounen where you have an MC and the rival of MC which is exactly opposite to him. Asta is a great character. Even though he cannot use magic at all in a world where is aiming to become the wizard king, he has a tremendous physical strength which he achieved by rigorous training.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing to write home about but it is good enough for this show. \\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nNo shounen would be called a shounen without action in it. Trust me if you like DBZ, Naruto and One piece or Fairy Tail. You will love this. This anime has a fight on every fuckin corner. This is one of those Animes which made to show people some good battles. Though none of the fight so far say is awesome or epic but this anime is in early stage and I am sure a great battle is on its way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI am really optimist about this anime and I am sure this is going to be one of best anime in the future. I would suggest every shounen fan to watch this anime and trust me, you guys will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "If you've watched just episode 1 of this anime, you already know that you can't possibly give it a 10. In fact, you can't even give it something above a 5. To put it lightly, this anime is hot garbage. The two main issues of this show is its pacing and it's insane levels of cliche.\r\nThe main idea behind the overall story, is interesting. In a world of magic, someone is born without it. It's a spin on the age old premise of outcast or lowly being turns hero. But it does add in an interesting plot aid in terms of a non one-sided rival.And the concept that the show would be about the main character's constant struggle without any powers in a world of magic, would have been excellent. That, however, doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThis show struggles incredibly with pacing. The first episode is an intro to world and its characters, but is going at mach 10. \\n\r\nSLIGHT SPOILER ALERT\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI say, mach 10 because in just 1 short episode we are introduced to the world, main characters, the premise that our hero has no powers, his rival has powers and is talented, his rival is chosen as \"the one\", and he isn't, but his rival is in danger so he tries to save him, not he's in danger, power up power up power up he is \"another chosen one\".... And with that, the show is dead before it really began. The main character doesn't have magic, but he has \"powers\". This puts him on equal grounds with everyone, and he no longer really the underdog even if the show wants to make him out to be that.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I mentioned cliche earlier, I'm not talking about one or two points that make this show very cheesy and cliched. This show took a dump truck full of cliche and keeps dumping them in. You've the supposedly underdog hero, everyone keeps powering up against baddies, tsundere, cool guy, serious guy who is actually a nice guy, an ikemen, power up power up power up, screaming that you won't \"give up\" and you have \"nakama\".... This anime tries too hard to be shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this is not a 1 is that the animation is pretty good and there's some entertainment value in the combat scenes as long as there's no \"powering up\" and shouting about never giving up.\\n\\n",

It's easy to drop it but once you get to ep 11/12 each episode gets better. \r\nEach episode ends leaving you wanting more. So far some story arcs can last over 3-4 eps.

The rivalry between Asta and Yuno seems rather artificial. \r\nBut what saddens me the most is the quality of the drawings in some episodes. The work is sloppy. The fight of episode 63 is so poorly drawn that it totally ruins an episode that could have been very good.This episode is an experimental animation with poorly animated battle scenes and with bad choices for the background. It's unfortunate and shameful!",

            "content": "Black Clover is a Japanese fantasy shounen manga series, which was written and illustrated by Yuuki Tabata. The series is published in Shueisha's Weekly Shounen Jump magazine in Japan, and Viz Media is publishing it in their Weekly Shonen Jump digital anthology magazine in the US.  At the Black Clover Jump Festa event on December 18, 2016, an anime television series adaptation by Pierrot was announced. It is directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, with Kazuyuki Fudeyasu writing scripts, Itsuko Takeda doing character designs, and Minako Seki composing the music. The anime premiered on October 3, 2017.The series was initially listed as running for 13 episodes,but was later expanded to 51 episodes, which is one of the mistakes this review will center on, but later about it.\\n\\n\r\nAsta, a kid living in poverty is determined to become the next Wizard King of his country. The problem is, in the world where magic is everything: it determines your position in society, Asta has absolutely no magic at all. However, his determination to become top 1 in the kingdom helps him get into the kingdom's elite defense forces, the Magic Knights. He, together with his brother, start their journey to become the most respected, as well as the kingdom\u2019s most powerful man. \\n\\n\r\nHow one should assess a story-line that crawls with clich\u00e9s and unoriginality?  While it is not a bad thing, it is not a good thing either. Many anime series have done this before, but the problem here is that putting all these overused clich\u00e9s together is a very difficult thing to pull, because you will have to get rid of these clich\u00e9s and make your work original. There should always be something your viewers will remember you for. Black Clover, however, does have originality about its story-line, but it is not enough to call its story-line original. Those who are not new to the industry will have a \u2018I have seen this already\u2019 feeling, when watching Black Clover. And at some point it gets somewhat annoying, because you already know what is going to happen. Of course, it is not the only negative side this anime has, there are far too many, I would like to touch upon another thing, which ruined this series. As I have already mentioned in the first paragraph of my review, the series was initially listed as running for 13 episodes, but was later expanded to 51 episodes. This is the biggest mistake this anime has made: you are being shows far too many unnecessary details and nothing really happens. Black Clover has only enough material for 13 episodes. With 13 episodes it would not be that bad as it is right now. \\n\\n\r\nFor any anime that has magic as its main theme, I would hope for a simply flawless, charming animation that will make my heart stop beating for a second. Black Clover\u2019s animation is sometimes fluid and dynamic, but it happens not as often as one would love to see. Indeed, the dark color schemes of the animation help promote the idea of the type of the world full of darkness and evil, and it is really awesome, however, character designs leave much to be desired. There is also nothing to comment on the sound. It does not have any memorable music pieces and voice acting is just\u2026 listen to Asta\u2019s voice actor and you will know. It is like you want to relax and you constantly hear \u2018Leeroooooy Jenkiiiins\u2019, which drives you mad. \\n\\n\r\nTo my big disappointment there is nothing original about any character in this anime, even supporting characters are full of clich\u00e9s. The main duo of this anime resembles Dragneel Natsu and Fullbuster Gray: their design, their ideals, their attitude towards each other, they are very similar. And not only do the main characters have clich\u00e9s, but also the whole supporting character cast: there is absolutely nothing original about them.  Imagine Dragneel Natsu constantly screaming with no reason, imagine Kamijou, Touma ability to nullify magic, and finally imagine Luffy, wanting to become the pirate king. Bingo, that is the whole concept of Black Clover. \\n\\n\r\nAwful, what a disappointment! Even after 27 episodes this series is still bad. As it has already been mentioned many times in my review, there should have never been 51 episodes; this anime has enough material for 7-11 episodes. Okay, even 13 episodes will do. But, for some reason, the creator decided to make it 51 episodes. In result, most of the time you are being shown some absolutely pointless and unnecessary scenes, with jokes that are just dramatic because of the fact that they are absobloodylutely not funny. On top of that, this series is absolutely unoriginal; it has bloody nothing to offer its viewer. However, this anime is great for kids and for those who are totally fine with clich\u00e9s and are able to literally \u2018turn their consciousness off.\u2019 This is a number one quality to watch and to finish this anime. I, alack, do not have it and I will have to give up on it after watching the 27th episode today. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am sad to give this anime such a low overall score, but I have not found anything good, anything original about it that will help me appreciate this series, there is nothing good about it. If you want a good battle-shounen, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, and Fullmetal Alchemist are ready to help you. Black Clover, however, is nothing but a guide on what you should not do to make a good battle-shounen. \\n\\n\r\nGrade-\\n\r\nOverall (sub): 1\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nAnimation: 5\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nMusic: 5\\n\r\nVoice acting: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2",

The anime could be shrink down to roughly 52 episodes so far without all the recap . Spare the audience from the same intro \r\n\" Humanity was saved by the great single mage\"\r\nStory wise is very interesting and is appealing, art is average when compared to standard anime post 2016. Sound however is poorly done and mainly over used (we get that Asta is a loud brat, but you don't have to make allhis line scream based.... it just pissed off the people and you wonder why this anime is so underrated)",

            "content": "Haha, I can't really write this review without laughing.\r\nWe can start with the fact that each episode has a massively long prologue (the same for every episode), has 3 minutes dedicated to repeating the previous episode, 1 minute dedicated to a spin-off, a long halfway-through animation, 30 seconds of next episode preview, and of course an OP and ED. Each episode only introduces maybe 15 minutes of actual content, and even those few minutes is just very little actual content stretched out as long as possible through meaningless dialogue, the characters repeating their catchphrases, crappy animation of generic side characters, or some other technique.\r\nThis justgets progressively worse. I have never seen something as blatantly lacking in actual story as this.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I even need to comment on the characters. They're all bad, and annoyingly so. And I don't mean simply that they resort to tacky anime tropes. No, its worse than that. Their tsundere is the most boring, typical tsundere copied off of the most overused tsundere template, and not a shred of originality was added.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dreadful. Way too often they resort to CGI to render spells, but it's obvious that no effort was invested to at least make it blend with the rest of the art (or even make them more than just spheres or generic projectile shapes). The sound effects are also the most typical ones, by which I mean it's clear that they use the same sound over and over for most of the magic.\\n\\n\r\nHaha, and it pains me to say this: at first I somewhat enjoyed the show, but over time you just feel like you've sunk deeper and deeper into the mud.",

The problem with black clover is there literally nothing there OTHER THAN the cliches.  \r\nThe characters are very hollow, 1-dimensional and completely unrelatable representations of your usual cliches. Not one character brings any unique flavour to the anime. They are merely sock puppets repeating the same lines every episode, who were made only to complete the typical character checkboxes to get the series funded. You have to watch this for many episodes to reallyappreciate how dreadful they are, as nothing has changed in the 22 episodes released so far.  THEY STILL RINSE AND REUSE THE EXACT SAME 1-liners AS THE FIRST EPISODES.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting becomes uninspired as there is no reason for the voice actors to become invested in these excuses for characters.  The back stories are shallow, the main character is as bland and boring as you could imagine with a dreadful screaming voice used for 95% of his lines.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation gets worse with every episode- to the point that poorly drawn stills are used for \"action\" scenes in what is supposed to be the CLIMAX fight of the arc. Frames are reused on loop to save time and money. The fights are terrible and poorly conceived.  I recommend the viewers save their own time and money and stay away.\\n",

            "content": "Black Clover...what happened??\r\nYou were supposed to be the next big shounen, to fill the void Naruto left, to kill my time until Boku No Hero Academia season 3 came out, to make me feel better about Dragon Ball Super's unexpected demise, to push shounen forward as a genre. You were supposed to be my weekly ritual. Black Clover should have and could have been a lot of things, but it saddens me to say that it is none of those things and beyond. This show is flawed on a very fundamental level, it is no doubt trying to replicate the feeling of Naruto but itdoes that so shamelessly that it reeks of unoriginality, this is a forgettable and irredeemable show not worth anyone's time.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover's story is the definition of basic, it introduces a derivative shounen setting, a world of magic where the more mana you have the stronger you are. So far the story arcs in this show are forgettable and bland, they serve as exposition for the large land of the Clover kingdom. There's a good amount of flashbacks which attempts to flesh out characters and make them more empathetic but goddamn is it just so badly done and overall kinda cheap since it comes out of nowhere and feels pretty irrelevant. There's a big problem with the narrative, especially since the protagonist, Asta is endowed with probably the most overpowered ability in shounen history, it requires no mastery, it doesn't carry any risks, it doesn't introduce an intrigue as to the origins of such a rare ability, it's just there as a bat for Asta to wield making fights uninteresting since it has the overpowered ability to repel all magic and makes the fights last not more than a minute or so since it entails sword bashing everything, requiring no strategy. The protagonist is way too strong rendering even respectable \"magic knights\" and well-feared villains of the Clover kingdom useless in front of Asta this not only makes fights pointless but also will no doubt be a detriment to the protagonist's character development since he doesn't need to evolve beyond a sword-wielding barbarian. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover's animation and art seem cheap and unbecoming of a modern show, especially since it only has a limited amount of episodes, you'd think more time would be put into making the show look beautiful but goddamn there's no effort put at all in presentation. It has washed out and muted colors making any landscape look drab and forgettable, the art style is a bit rough in my opinion, it might be a stylistic choice but it doesn't captivate me in any way. There is seemingly no animation work done at all for this show, as I already mentioned, the fights are short and require no strategy or hand to hand combat it entails sword bashing a bunch of badly rendered CGI stuff for maximum 30 seconds, so there is no need for complicated movement animation and zero sakuga animation. This is extremely disappointing especially for a battle shounen where fights are supposed to be highlights. The most animation you'll see are recycled walking animations, most of this show is filled with close-ups for talking.\\n\\n\r\nSound design is decent, you can hear clangs of swords. Soundtracks are forgettable for the most part except for one piano piece which plays at the climax of each fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are one-dimensional clich\u00e9s that don't build on this genre at all. Asta is a loud annoying brat complete with a never give up attitude and a simpleton that knows nothing of strategy in combat, he's not smart at all and is way worse than most shounen protagonists, like even Goku and Luffy aren't really smart and so dense but when it comes to combat they are geniuses, Naruto wasn't really even stupid. Yuno, his brother is introduced as his rival but it doesn't make sense since they don't even try to compete with each other and Yuno doesn't really act as his rival at all, they are more like friends, I don't know why he's even introduced because they do their own thing and no one really affects the other. The side characters are just one clich\u00e9 after the other, wholly forgettable, I barely remember their names. Black Clover isn't a shining example when it comes to character writing, it's derivate of other shounen shows but somehow does them a lot worse. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a terrible shounen show that shouldn't have been even hyped up to begin with, it reeks of unoriginal and derivative writing, an uninteresting, overpowered and rather stupid protagonist in a group of walking clich\u00e9 side characters that are mostly irrelevant and lazy animation work. This show is irredeemable. I am surprised it is rated so high as it is. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

First off alot of top reviews that negatively review this anime have barely scraped the barrel of the anime. They usually have only watched 10. I can see how some people might hate this anime, but this is a anime where you have to bare through the first couple episodes for the real jackpot later in the series. The beginning gives you a bad feeling about the anime, but slowly that hate grows into love as you porgressthrough the anime. To all who wonder if you want to watch this or hated it, I want you to try at least half of the series and go through from there. I do say Asta can be obnoixious sometimes (hence the memes involving his screaming) , but that shouldn't draw you from this anime, which disguised as horrible, but is actually a solid anime in the hiding",

            "content": "[spoiler-free review from a female's standpoint]\r\nSince anime for girls and women over the age of 12 are still somewhat of a rare good (unless you count the umpteenth music or reverse harem without plot anime - which I'm not a fan of), I've been checking out shounen and seinen anime as well. I'd like to encourage the female audience to give this a try, so I will be talking about some aspects girls and women may be more sensitive about when choosing anime/manga. Of course my review may also be of help to guys - I just chose to mention aspects that might not popup in a guy's review but be important for girls.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't stumble upon Black Clover until I was bored and was looking for an anime that would keep me somewhat entertained for a while.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a woman in her 20s, so I'm not the target audience of this anime, but I found it pretty decent and got hooked on the story. I'm rather picky when it comes to art, story and voices. So if the cover image or trailer of an anime doesn't appeal to me aesthetically, chances are I'll never touch it.  Despite BC being a shounen anime I found myself trying it out because I sort of liked the art and the synopsis seemed okay to interesting-ish.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: I didn't watch/read Naruto during my childhood and when I wanted to give it a try a while ago, I just couldn't get into it, so I can't offer comparisons between the two. I think a lot of hate this series receives is due to the people clinging to their childhood \"ideal\".As this doesn't apply to me, I might be more unbiased.\\n\\n\r\nPacing & story\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing of the first episodes is pretty horrible because it's so slow and filler-esque you want to fast-forward, it gets better after that. There are still a lot of unnecessary fillers but they're endurable because you want to know where the story is going after that. \\n\\n\r\nTo keep this entirely spoiler-free, I'll use a totally different set-up that has nothing to do with BC:\\n\r\nIf BC had an episode playing in an amusement park, you'd get to see about 2-3 minutes of background happenings i.e. roller coster action, people lining up to buy food or goodies etc. A good 20 seconds would have sufficed to give the viewer that amusement park feeling and understand where the characters are etc. \\n\\n\r\nThat is certainly something that got and still gets on my nerves. I'm not entirely sure why the production company employs this techinique as the anime is nowhere near to catching up to the manga and every animated minute costs a lot of money. On top of that, this practice is certainly not endearing the anime to some viewers and can be considered \"shoveling ones own grave\" in some cases.The current season is set to get 51 episodes. 46 (i.e. series short the unnecessary, over-long fillers) would have probably sufficed to create the world while toning down the annoying-ness. There's a 30 seconds world-intro at the beginning of every episode and, depending on the episode, a good 2-3 mins recap of the last episode shown. Add an intro and outro and a bunch of over-the-top long filler scenes, you end up with about 15 minutes of actual content (not yet excluding acceptable or necessary fillers). From a business standpoint it just doesn't make sense to waste so much animation time=money. I blame the powers that be of this production. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways.. try to endure it. The core story and world are worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nCharacter voices (Japanese)\\n\r\nSummarized...they did a great job.\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, I thought I'd have to start throwing things around every time Asta opened his mouth buuuuut 1) the screaming got a bit less frequent (which is also the same in the manga... so they were just being faithful to the manga in a way) 2) I got used to it and at some point started thinking of the voice to be a pretty good fit for a character like Asta. He is supposed to be a wild child and a bit on the duller/devil may care side of the spectrum.. So having him portrayed with a calm, \"reasonable\" voice would not be a good choice either. Now, I can't even imagine him being voiced differently. And let's be honest here.. Compared to the DBZ characters, Asta at least manages to shout words occasionally instead of only \"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" all the time... haha I just accepted this at some point as being part of a shounen anime. If I could get through the DBZ Namek/Frieza saga, I can get through Asta screeching that he's going to become Wizard King.\\n\r\nThe other characters are voiced by well-known seiyuus also popular in shoujo anime like Free, Nijiiro Days, Kamisama Hajimemashita, Diabolik Lovers, Shounen Ai anime like Junjou Romantica or Super Lovers or other Shounen Anime females enjoy (Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu). You'll find one or two of your \"favorites\" in BC, I can nearly promise you.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are always realistic and the background music is nice. The OP and ending are also quite nice for a shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nTropes, tropes all around. But then this is a WSJ anime. What do you expect? WSJ is supposed to cater to the masses with general tropes galore and somewhat catagorizable characters. There's always the nerd, the cool guy, the stoic/stern one, the jokester, the overeager fighter, the tsundere characters and the love/hate interests. Such tropes exist for shoujo magazine mangas/anime as well. Maybe I can endure these tropes better because I got fed up with shoujo tropes before? Who knows..\\n\\n\r\nWhat always turns me off shounen manga/anime is the blatant fan service that is pretty tasteless at times. While there is fan service in the form of a drunkard D-cup witch lazing around in underwear most of the day and Asta being the love interest of at least 3 girls, it never gets to a point where there are panty/chest shots every episode or the guys actually groping/molesting the women. That really annoyed me in Magi for instance. But that's another review for another time..The women/girls in BC can more or less pull their own weights and have their own strong powers not inferior to guy characters. Sure, some are portrayed as being a bit weaker mentally and needing encouragement from the guys to unleash their whole power but meh... I've seen worse in shounen. While the women are all on the \"regular to a bit larger to big scale\" when it comes to tatas, so far, none of them has been so disgustingly obvious tata-fanservice and no character has experienced a sudden explosive expansion in the chest region either (I'm looking at you, One Piece) and they wear decent clothing in most cases. Thank god for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOnce I caught up on all the episodes, I was eager enough to read the manga, so I guess that is proof enough that there's something going for this anime/story.  Since the content aimed at females is very limited and at some point I got sick of indecisive girls spending half the series coyly oogling their guy(s) and stuttering \"A-....anoooo......\", I searched and found another shounen series that is enjoyable for me. Since it received so much hate previously, I wanted to offer another positive review.\\n\r\nIf I could make a wish, it would be for this series to get another season but have someone else responsible for the plot per episode division. Well, Jump Festa is coming up, so there's hope for that.",

Your 9-year-old nephews are gonna love Black Clover. Your friend who barely got into anime this year will be into Black Clover. Every discussion online will now be DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and Black Clover.\r\nMiserable, right?\r\nBlack Clover is what happens when you hire a guy to just take all the most marketable parts of the shonen giants of the 2000's and slap it all together as quickly as possible for merchandising. Naruto had the Akatsuki,the bid for hokage, and Black Clover has the Captain Brigades and bid for wizard king. Same with how Bleach had the Soul Society Captain squads.\\n\\n\r\nAn orphan kid with sealed-away superpower, raised humble and constantly humiliated for being different/unskilled, wants to become an exemplar of his world to show everyone it's about effort, not talent. But then it becomes about talent as he had a latent ability this whole time. Whoops! Did we mention he had a black-wearing \"brother\" who's also immensely talented, jealousy-inducing, and a shoe-in for exactly what our orphan hero wants to do with his life? Yeah, I read that story before, too, so I didn't think it was worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely believe the author is undergoing some kind of punishment for a misdeed with the WSJ higher-ups. How can you pride yourself as a creator if your most successful work is frankensteining precepts together until your abomination is just barely different enough to register? Especially when his first work was so different and stand-out?",

            "content": "43 episodes in, I can say I am completely hooked on this anime, but with a horrific sub, lazy animation, and cliche character design, it makes me wonder what about it is so compelling.\r\nFirst of all, don't watch the sub. Its first episodes consist of so much screeching that you'll immediately give up on it. The dub matches the banshee wails from the sub with more tolerable shouts that convey Asta's energetic character.\r\nSecondly, the animation is somewhat lazy (lack of frames), however for someone like me who can't watch anything before 2009, it's manageable. The individual frames are exceptional.\r\nThe story is overly cliched at first,and reviews complaining about the basic shounen formula likely haven't watched too many episodes. Eventually, the story shifts into a magic-based campaign which involves a unique use of the soft magic system; for example, characters now appearing where I am use song magic and even dance magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot progressively becomes more and more compelling, as new challenges introduce new magic styles and a captivating subplot around Asta's mysterious sword and grimoire. This is good compensation for the slowed pacing after the first few story arcs. If you are a fan of complex fight scenes, the pacing likely won't even feel slow to you.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this anime is worth your time if you're a fan of shounen. Just make sure to watch the dub and let the plot play out.",

            "content": "Personally, I really enjoy this series however, I think that this is one of those series where if you like a faster pace, read the manga because it flows a lot quicker. The anime has many filler moments which I think give it more depth and a fuller understanding of things. A manga has no time for filler crap, it needs to get down to business. Unlike the filler in Naruto, this has a purpose to the series and isn't just there for the hell of it. This is why I would suggest reading the manga and watching the anime together because I feel theycomplement each other nicely.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I wish the pace was faster because it will be episode 14 until the really good crap happens and I think that's ridiculously slow but this series also has a large cast and for many of the episodes your getting to know a lot of different characters as well as an understanding of the hierarchy within the world.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest complaints I have heard since episode one of this series aired is Asta's voice. I suggest that people listen to Funimation's dubbed version which is 11 episodes in so far as Asta's voice is much more pleasant to listen too dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I really like about this series is the animation, it's beautifully done and it's like a rainbow for the eyes. The opening and ending are also really well done. \\n\\n\r\nI love the relationship between Yuno and Asta and not as toxic as a lot of other series. These two characters genuinely love one another and believe in each other. It's so positive it makes me all warm inside. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is a combination of Naruto and Fairy Tail. With it being about a land filled with magic and guilds of magic knights like the magic guilds in Fairy Tail however much like Naruto we have protagonists who want to be the magic knight emperor, the strongest of all the magic knights, like the Kages in the Hidden Villages. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I highly suggest reading the manga even if you don't like the anime because you can avoid the annoying voice acting and the slow pacing and enjoy a wonderful story. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(SPOILERS FOR AIDS)\r\nBlack Clover: A series hated by many, loved by slightly less but still many (apparently)\r\nI started watching Black Clover because I heard Black Rover (OP3) and thought it was soooo good, and that surely the series would be good too. I grinded out like 30 episodes in like 3 days and was really confused as to why SOOO many people were bagging this series so much, and why it had a score of under 7 on MAL. I didn't really find Asta's voice actor that annoying after like 2 episodes, and I thought although the story was a little unispiring and cliche, itwas still entertaining. I defended this show extensively in comments, reviews forums etc. Hell i even scored it a 9 for a while on MAL. Let me just say that (obviously) I know longer think this at all.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the good: black clover's sound design. The OP's and ED's of this show are incredibly good, like ridiculously good in my opinion. Haruka Mirai, Black Rover, Guess Who is Back just to name a few are all ABSOLUTE BANGERS with sick videos to accompany them, and the others are all very good as well. I also think that for the most part, the VA's have all been casted very well, and do a very good job in spite of horrendous lines they are given at times. A Special Shoutout to Asta's VA, he got a lot of hate for screaming and what not, but I think it actually really fits the character and Asta for the most part is one of the only redeeming parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the bad; excluding the Yami vs Licht fight, Studio Pierrot's animation for this series is absolute dog shit, and anyone watching the current Royal knights arc will agree with that. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters are the most boring ass shmucks ever put to the screen. In now 77 episodes, excluding Asta and Yuno our two mains, none, I repeat not one, of the black bulls and other side (but very prevalent) characters has gone any sort of development or change throughout the series, except for maybe vanessa. Every time someone does something, hearing all the character 1 by 1 say there same cliche line is the most aids shit i've ever watched, Finral says something about dating, Noelle says bakasta or some stupid shit about him, Luck wants to Fight, Vanessa is a drunk, Yami doesn't care, Gordon is quiet and weird, Charmy wants food, Gauche loves his sister more than anything - It is so fucking cancerous. Couple that with more cookie-cutter reactions from our other characters, Yuno being edgy and not caring, Wizard King just wanting to see cool magic, EVERY ONE OF THE CAPTAINS BEING JUST A SINGLE PERSONALITY TRAIT.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the story, Whilst quiet unoriginal as a typical shounen, it is a functional plot I suppose, But the main problem is that the plot pushes the characters  for nearly the entire series, and god is it boring to see them follow it so mundanely.\\n\\n\r\nAs per Enjoyment, The show has some really great highs in terms of enjoyability, i.e. Asta in early days overcoming shit (before he became OP and the story got boring) such as magic knight trials, Licht fight, and Black Asta Reveal, which are incredibly entertaining for me personally. But the lows are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring and uninspiring, and let me tell you there is a lot less highs than lows (Filler xd).\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly where the point was that I stopped defending this show, nor am I sure the point where it became a fucking chore to watch this show, but Jesus do I hate it nowadays... pce out",

            "content": "As this is my first review on MyAnimeList, I'll keep this brief. First off, I'd like to say that overall, the series so far has been pretty good. I must admit I am not particularly familiar with the manga, although I have read maybe a few volumes, so I can't really compare between the adaptations, so bear that in mind.\r\nDespite the poor art style and animation graphics, the characters and the various situations the story presented to us pretty made up for that. The comedy aspects of the story brought several smiles to my face and there were even times I would be shaking myhead and wondering: \"what is he doing?\" This is what I thought was pretty enjoyable about the story, it does have its own charms, although I would perhaps question its pace per episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe various main(s) and supporting characters' personalities can be quite invigorating. Which I believe is quite a valuable asset to the anime series. It rather lifts the comedy aspects of the story. Character relationships are quite amusing as well, such as Yuno and Asta's strange brotherly/rivalry friendship they have. On top of that, the story presented us a few female characters taking an interest in Asta, which may sound like a harem genre, but is not at all, for Asta is completely oblivious and the girls won't so much as hint like in our usual harem genre anime. All these added onto the story's amusing aspects, which contributed to its little charm.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and credit sequences contributed to my continuation of the series. Most series would either stick to one opening or have two or three depending on the story arc. Usually, after seeing it once, it would bore me and I would walk away for a minute or so. However, although Black Clover is not the only one having several different openings and credit sequences, this is the first series that I've seen (which is not a lot) that has this much. It's a refreshing pace for me, for the progression in each arc may become a drag every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I would recommend this series to others and give Studio Pierrot a chance, for though it may be mediocre at best, it still has its own unique charm to it. But... I do have one question that was brought up during the series. The latest arc's credit sequence (starting at episode 28) presented a much finer art style and animation graphics. The eyes and body frame were more in proportion and it still roughly presented the original art style from the manga. So I wondered why it could not have been the art style for the anime series entirely? It would have attracted perhaps more viewers if they were looking for good animation graphics and art styles (which I'm sure there are quite a lot of them out there).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, considering the various aspects of the series, I'd rate this an 8/10. Very good.",

            "content": "Hey boys and girls, this is my first review about a series, the reason i'm actually making in in the first place is cause, in my opinion the series is not as bad as some reviews make it sound(like the top review rates it  \"1\").\r\nOk, so starting with the beginning you have 2 orphans, one cant apparently use magic and the other is pretty damn good at it, at some point both of them inspire to became the Wizard King, both having some OP powers(so this feels like Naruto all over the place, naruto and sasuke, and hokage, although asta's reason to became wizardking is different from naruto's ). Ok, sure that's a cliche, not original at all, but let's be honest, naruto is  a copy cat of some other series as well, i mean the originality thingy shouldn't be a a reason to rate the series with 1. The reason u should rate it with 1 is, for example, the little brat with white hair, aka Asta, who is annoying as fk(yeah he is annoying but that's also kinda fun in my opinion, he is like this idiot person who can't really do anything else besides fighting, but he is pretty damn good at that, he is also pure, good and nice, he is the IRL \"good guy\"). That can be a real reason for rating the series bad. \\n\r\nWhat so ever, talking a bit more about the series, both characters have some unique powers, which is pretty much again a cliche(damn, i'm  trying to praise the series and i'm almost burying it LUL), but come on, would u watch an anime with a shitty main character who is always losing or something like that? \\n\r\nA really strong point about this anime, are the secondary characters, you will say, yeah but they are all the same, like the silver hair dudes are the \"superior dudes, rejecting the plebs\", the other nobles are the same etc. Well, are they tho, the same? The cool thing about that is that is just like in real life, some of them are the kind ones and the others are the shitty type of people, the idea is that even tho they are shitty or kind, they both work for the same goal, and that is protecting the citizens, a thing that i liked happened somewhere between episodes 20-27, the captain of the guys with silver hair said something like this \"I will revenge you for what they did to you\", he was talking about another captain who was the nice guy kinda type,  was that something that u would've hear from someone like him, i will tell you it was pretty fking unexpected. \\n\r\nThe fights are pretty decent, enjoying to watch, the story is moving at a decent pace, with medium character development, yeah that's not really a good thing. In the end, the show is not a must watch, it's not Neon Genesis Evangelion, but if u watched a shit load of anime and u rate  them based on enjoyment this show is deserving a shot. Honestly the worst thing about it, is definitely Asta being really loud.",

Watching it weekly is a pain in the ass because of the recaps and some fillers. 26 epsiodes and we are only at the 37th chapter in the manga shows how the pacing in the anime is bad. But that doesn't mean the whole show is trash like what most MAL users are saying! (Those weeboos are good for nothing) The story is good (if you have patience), characters are fun and the setting and overall plot of black clover isinteresting to say at the least. Also if you have been a fan of shounen anime well this is really a perfect anime to add in your bucketlist! As cliche as it is (what shounen anime aren't?) It still a fun ride. So I suggest try binge watching this like a seasonal anime you might appreciate it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you are really curious on how this series is also dub as the next big thing alonh side MHA well read the manga and see for yourself!",

The characters are not the best in the start but they get better  as the show progress. And honestly Asta's screaming is not that annoying anymore.

Yes, the beginning was off putting and Asta is a extremely loud person but besides that it's a well put together shonen with a cool concept on magic. Much like Naruto it makes the protagonist strive for a high place in the hierarchy of the world and deep down thats how everyone feels on life and hence why it appeals to everyone. Regardless, beyond happy with how the story is going now and glad I stuck to this. Solid 8 overall.",

            "content": "I think this is a really good \"light-hearted\" fantasy shounen.  Not a genius masterpiece like HxH, but quite a bit better than average.\r\nI think the art is very good, professional, though not really creative or new like, say, Grimgar.  The sound is good, the American voice actors are very good so the dub does not suck compared to the sub like some anime (I'm looking at you, HxH).  \r\nI think this would be rated significantly higher (7.8 or so?), but for the superficial similarities to other shows.  The plot sort of invites claims of copying.  The main character is aboy born without magic who insists he wants to be the Wizard King, seems very much like Izuku Midoriya born without superpowers who wants to be the greatest superhero, and also even more like Naruto, a boy with crazy determination to be the next Hokage but who (at least to start) is a loser when it comes to harnessing his chi power or whatever they call it (I have not seen the Naruto shows in years).  Despite these similarities, let's face it -- having a fantasy shounen sort of requires you to have a weak MC who, through determination, gets stronger, so I don't know that this is a fault.\\n\\n\r\nFor the genre, it is refreshingly good.  I consider it a step above Naruto, about on par with My Hero Academia (though in a fantasy setting rather than superhero setting), and a couple steps below HxH.  The problem I found with Naruto was it got too formulaic and simultaneously contradictory because we are to believe Naruto and Sasuke are so gifted and strong (once Naruto finds his strength after the first couple arcs), yet every arc they introduce new ninjas who have some crazy power that rivals them.  Over and over.  And simultaneously, all of Naruto's classmates and buddies are variously featured in battles where they find a way to defeat stronger opponents.  And pretty soon, Naruto does not seem special at all. \\n\r\n And every battle is predictable.  And Sasuke leaving to get more powerful by letting an evil ninja poison his soul was really a stupid notion, and the show \"jumped the shark\" around then.  Anyway, I got annoyed with some of the contrived, contradictory and predictable stuff that kept happening in Naruto after about 50 episodes, and lost interest.  Frankly, I could see the same thing happening with Black Clover, but it hasn't happened yet.   Thus, to me Black Clover is a better version of Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nI also have regularly laughed out loud during Black Clover, which I cannot recall doing for any other show, except maybe One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100. Black Clover has a very good sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I don't see anything super original about it, but it seems like it borrowed a lot of tropes I like from fantasy shounen, blended them into an original product, and so far have made that product as high or higher quality than the shows it borrowed tropes from.   I'm on episode 44, we'll see if this keeps up.",

I can only say that the first 10-15 episodes will be really tedious but I urge you to pull through(you'll know what I mean in episode one...it doesnt last). the animation is all in all, what you would expect from a low budgeted anime with artists and designers with only a year or two of experience. I wouldn't call myself the best person at reviews but after watching the first half of Episode 63 all I can say is i'm disappointed. One of the best moments for me in the mangathat was adapted into this episode was absolutely dreadful, it was some of the worst animation I have seen in a long time not only that but it was absolutely dreadful in terms of continuity and pacing. certain moments where the animation was meant to be slow and artistic came to my eyes as connection issues with my stream site. I was not only shocked by how badly the animation in this episode is but I noticed myself having a headache trying to follow the characters in a somewhat bland and ever changing scenery of of the land that I was wondering if I'd ever be able to understand how you go from beautiful background to what I can only compare as a person splashing buckets of different colored paint onto a grey canvas...\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry for the bible review but I'm hoping that someone that can actually contact the people in charge of this animation to hopefully up its game, there has to be a change with that animation for upcoming parts of this story. because I have been looking forward to and enjoying/enduring this animated adaptation. I was revolted by this episode but if I can't submit future reviews I want to say that this anime is a 10/10 just in terms of how the story leads you and what's in store in this anime (if they get the hint) if not I suggest reading the manga, it has wonderful art and along with the voices you hear in this I have no doubt you will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nthank you",

And I don't understand all the bad reviews either.\r\nBlack Clover is the best adventure anime you can get recently. If you want to see a pure trash, last year's UQ Holder was. I had a high hope for a fun adventure in that series, but it turned out to be a horrible meaningless ecchi. Yet, Black Clover restored my love in fantasy.\r\nAsta is not your avenge shonei protagonist. He's very balanced. Not hothead like Natsu, or a pervert like Naruto. He's energic, passionate,dumb yet reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd his rival Yuno is not your asshole Sasuke. Under his cold apppearance, he cares deeply to his friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the best part of this series is, we don't have to eat tons of shit ecchi or harem. Good job.",

Yes it's basically Naruto. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. The English dub is fantastic, and the the story begins to suck you in with it's nonstop action and high stakes fights. What sets this apart from most anime in this genre is the rivalry between Asta and Yuno. and the mystery and false flags of a greater threat looming over the cast that has yet to make it's self known. \r\nMy only complaint so faris the Female cast members are all love sick for some dude, even when it doesn't make since. I like romance in my shows as it's a nice bit of flavor and adds reasons for characters to even want to interact with each other, but it's super annoying when its out of place and almost EVERY female character has her eye on some male in the show. \\n\r\nWorld building needs some love in this show as well as side plot with some of the other character more than just 1 or two episodes. \\n\r\noverall its fun, exciting and gets you pumped up. Bing worthy indeed.",

            "content": "This anime is a mystery. Maybe an experiment even. And we are - the viewers - the guinea pigs. Take the young main hero for example : after only a few minutes of the very first episode, I wouldn't be surprised if you confess it took all your strenght and willpower to avoid screaming at him to - please, oh please ! - just ... shut up. \r\nGod he's yelling, this young boy. All the time. Every 10 sec (average, at worst : it's 2 sec), he's yelling because he's happy, because he's sad, because he's in love, because he's hurt, and whatever he does,itbegins with him yelling at something or someone. \\n\r\nAnd he's the hero. So he's already a painful experience all by himself.\\n\r\nI honestly have no idea what sort of creativity it takes to create a character so uniquely unable to express himself in any other way than yelling. \\n\r\nTo add to this incredibly annoying main lead comes the setting : the world this hero and others characters are evolving within. There it becomes better, maybe even a lot better (at last !) because it's a strong world, simple, plainful, with its own rules and the dangers that lies ahead.\\n\r\nBut strangely, again, this anime in its whole looks as if it was \"computer-generated\" : it feels as if an AI had tried to come up with a good setting and script to back up these characters, and doing so by making a mashup of others shows. Unfortunately, with very uncertain success.\\n\r\nAnd then here lies the mystery about this anime : each episode becomes a standalone anomaly, each episode could get its own MAL score, from a lowely 2 to 3 to an unbelievable 6 or 7 (maybe even a 8, sometimes). \\n\r\nI'm not saying this anime is confusing in any way (on the contrary, it's quite simple to follow), but there's just an incredible mismatch of qualities between each and every episode.\\n\r\nSo... should you watch this show ? I don't know. Should you not watch this show ? well, I have no idea either. Did I enjoy it then ?\\n\r\nSeriously, I still have no idea, but I can tell this : I've watched (so far) 54 episodes so this might be watchable (in a fashion). There's no way I would have put up with this annoying brat during 54 episodes without finding something to see for myself, \\n\r\nand maybe you will, too. If you're patient enough.",

(maybe)\r\nI don't usually write review's, but after seeing how much hate this anime is getting, i feel like it is my duty to write a review. \r\nTo start off, i was one of the haters of this anime because i thought this anime was gonna be great, so i managed to pull through 5 episodes while enduring all those ear-bleeding screams of our MC. After the 5 episodes, I was so disgusted by it and immediately stopped watching the anime and then someone told me that Black Clover is actually a great anime and all you needed to do to patiently keep watching.After many month of pondering, I was like alright i will only give it one more chance. When i began watching i realized that what i saw was basically the \"tip of the iceberg\". Black clover is like an Orange the skin is bitter but after you patiently peel it, you will reach the sweet and juicy core. I realized that in the 5 episodes i watched and judged, all i paid attention to was Asta screaming but what i didn't notice was how hard Asta works because he was apparently born without the ability to use magic, all this just to keep up with everyone who can use magic. Throughout this time he is insulted, laughed at and looked down upon even by the ones who he care about. No matter what people said about him, he Never gave up. This anime is basically all the Shounen tropes all mixed together in one anime. In conclusion i am saying i am on episode 54 and its already amazing but if people still insist that the anime is too mainstream and bland...... then suit yourself....",

I have finished the first 13 episodes yesterday and I am waiting now for the 14th. \r\nIt is understandable if you hate the character Asta (main character) who is screaming all the time, but the fact that he hasn't any magical power makes it more interesting. Yuno is a genius who excels at everything and doesn't have an annoying character trait.\r\nThe story so far is not good, but not bad either, because the anime has just begun, but I think it is goingto be even greater later in the series. A lot of people say this anime is relatable to Naruto, because he wants to starts of scrap and push all his way to the top which is the wizard king. Naruto is also a good of nothing in the beginning but he made to hokage in the Boruto anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty basic, because you see a lot of these arts recently with the new anime, so this isn't original, which is why I gave it an 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall enjoyment I gave it an 7 because of the not good not bad story, the so so art, 1 pretty annoying character, but original and an 7 for good intro and outro.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this is helpful and let me know if you will start to watch it.

Let me start by saying im currently caught up to the Manga and that im considerably biased towards it as it is probably one of my favourites (I mean, I dont tend to read manga I dont enjoy, my mean score is above 8 for Manga lol) So I will likely refference that in this review, Your obviously free to takethis review any way you please however understand that this is all my OPINION and its meant for people like me, or who want a review from someone who read and enjoys the Manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ill start this review off by saying this score is a 6 for 1 reason and 1 reason only, I know what happens through the mangas story and hope the anime will at least follow closely and not pull a Tokyo Ghoul on us, As far as the first 11 episodes go, its decent at best, Things that have been shown did not need to be, or took up far to much time, to be honest, the entire second episode basically never happened in the Manga, there was no walk no nothing, they cut straight to being at the city, litterally in Chap 2. I found this very displeasing as it not only wasted my time but it also shunned me from enjoying the show as I knew if they were doing filler like that it would not be a good series starting out, So far, that holds true, it doesnt even start to pick up until Epsiodes 10, and even then it barely does so, the pacing they decided to make this series obviously will go on to have a second season, under the stipulation it gets better. which I again hope it will. the story for the animation is not whats keeping me watching, that much must be made clear. so overall, 6/10 with knowledge on the future, fix pacing and will more than likely feel better, dont fill with scenes that never took place. :)\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have art also at a 6, The main reason for that is I just dont enjoy it as much as other shows, its got some nice flair to it but overall it could be done better, The characters and scenery dont look nearly as fluid to me personally as the manga and the magic elements are definetly not what I was hoping for, However as previously mentioned, Ep 10 does make it feel a little better, Maybe not for 1 thing but it doesnt look horrible, so, 6/10 make things more fluid and there would be improvment (Bonus: Its not nearly as bad as DBS has been :D )\\n\\n\r\nSound: In my original review made around Ep 7 I had sound listed as a 7, Here I have changed it to a 4. for the most part this change was caused by 1 thing. Asta, His voice is neigh unbearable for a large portion of the story, constant screaming constant annyoance etc, this is FAR from what I would have thought whed reading the manga, I never got the impression he was THIS level of loud, basically -3 points for Asta alone. The rest of the sound in the animation, honestly they arent bad, most voices feel fitting to characters, the sounds in the atmosphere feel appropriate and the OP and ED are actually fantastic. Not my favourites but most certainly enjoyable. so 4/10 Remove Asta voice <3\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Overall I cant say I even want to give more than 5/10 for characters, they just dont feel right, they are undoubtedly the same characters from the manga, however I dont get the feeling of attachment for their animated versions. I know what happens to all of them and yet knowing that its going to be animated doesnt make it feel great, It just puts worry that they will mess up some crucial parts for characters in the future, It's not that they arent neccisarilly true to the manga its that I dont feel anything for them, not to mention WAY to much focus was put on Asta and Yuno when there is more than just them. The nice part, They kept the first real backstory you see damn near perfect and im so happy for it, For obvious reasons I cant say who but just know its there. All in all 5/10 Please make them feel like they do in Manga senpai !\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Finally, As a certain LOL youtuber would say, the only real catagory that matters, My personal enjoyment, 3/10 Yes, it is a very pitiful score, I am severly dissapointed in this adaptation and I wish they would have scrapped the script, gone over it more and made Asta way less annoying, genuinly find a different voice actor.. seriouslly..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 but... why 51 episodes? pick up the pace at least !\\n\\n\r\nOutro: All in all it isnt the worst thing you could watch... there are so many better things but at the very least its not Green Green and for that I commend it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of this is going to be a read, so sit down grab yourself some popcorn and a drink, and lets get started. Also this review is solely based off MY OPINION about the show. \r\nAlright so far what I've seen from reviews are people who have only seen 10 episodes. I've seen all 47 that are up, and i plan to watch the rest. This is actually a very good anime, First of all, MY OPINION (I feel i should capitalize this because everyone will be like well your opinion is wrong even though we all have different opinions.) Is you cant base ananime just off 10 episodes if its going to have 51. If i did that, I would have stopped watching clannad after episode 10 and woudnt have continued to watching all 48 episodes. Because lets face it, it didnt get good until season 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways back to Black Clover, Black Clover is all around a very good Anime. The fight scenes are amazing. The main character is basically a nobody with no magic abilities, in a world where everyone has magic. He also is someone who surpasses everyones expectations, and has the fighting spirit to never give up. Everyone is giving it a bad rap, because they are expecting more out of it then what they want. They think is going to be the next Fairy Tail or Naruto. \\n\r\nYou cant just compare those anime together and be like, \"Oh yeah this is what it supposed to be like, but its not.\" If you do that, you're just going to end up hating it like everyone is. \\n\\n\r\nIf you plan to watch this anime, go in without judging it first. Forget what people compare it to and just watch it as its something brand new. You cant judge a book by its cover. Judging this anime based off Naruto, is basically the same thing as if you were to judge Death Notes anime to Live action Death note by Netflix. You are just going to hate it and never want to pick it up again, then hoping it burns in a fire, and hoping that fire somehow erases it from existence, only leaving Willum Defoe's Ryuk scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSo to close this review off, give the anime a chance. watch more than just 10 freaking episodes. Don't come in comparing it to any other anime right away or you will just hate it. Push through it even if you are hating it, it gets so much better. Unlike Watome, which was a complete waste of time. Again this is MY OPINION, cant stress that enough, even though i am still going to get people arguing with my about MY OWN OPINION.",

The art style is not the greatest but it still can be pretty good. The music and sounds for the anime I find really good, especially the 3rd op. The main story and protagonist Asta are pretty basic for shounen but the way they present it will is good enough that you probably won'tnotice how basic they are. I get that it starts off slow but get past the episodes, trust me it's worth your time.",

            "content": "Review (reuploaded)\r\nThis is my first review so here goes\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af (*Contains minor spoilers*)\r\n\"In this world, magic is everything\" - Miyazaki Hayao\r\nBlack Clover (TV) is an adaption of the manga of the same title created by Tabata Yuuki and the studio in charge of its production is Studio Pierrot (Naruto, Bleach, Tokyo Ghoul...). \r\nDespite being heralded by Crunchyroll as the \"new king of shounen\", does the anime adaption of Black Clover live up to the hype?\r\nThe short answer is no, not really. Where should I start?\r\nStory - 4/10 \r\nThe premise of the story is that two kids (Asta and Yuno) promise each other they will be thenext Magic Hokage. However as they grow up they realise that while one of them is a prodigy with magic (Yuno), the other one can't shut up.... At the grading ceremony where each person gets a grimoire based on their natural talents, Yuno gets a cool book while Asta gets none. But it turns out that Asta did get a book, and it turns out he got a super powerful anti-magic book.\\n\\n\r\nIf this premise seems to you like a complete generic shounen mashup of other series like Naruto and Blue Exorcist, then we'd be in the same boat. Even if these shows tend to centre around \"I wanna become stronger to protect my friends\" I don't think there's anything wrong with liking these type of so-called clich\u00e9 shows . The story of Black Clover fully embodies the essence of shounen to a fault, which is that it can be fairly predictable and uninteresting at times, although this isn't the main problem. The big  issue so far (to me) seems to be the pacing and large amount of filler.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the initial attractions to the Black Clover manga is how fast-paced it is. Despite the large amount of clich\u00e9s and simple characters it is still somewhat entertaining (if the premise interested you at all I highly recommend reading the manga rather than watching this) \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime has managed to slow down the pace until everything starts to feel dragged out. Moments that don't need elaborating on as well as the amount of filler in the first few episodes occur way too often to be healthy, especially at the start of a show. [As I read someone point out, filler should be in the middle of a show to take advantage of the audience that the start of the show has already garnered, not the other way round. (The first 6 episodes of the anime cover 4 chapters from the manga? Seems about right.)] \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I pointed out earlier, there is a lot of filler early on in the story and it seems to revolve around the characters. The characters themselves are all defined by their traits, and somehow that means that until future development in the story happens, they can only repeat what we know about them so far. This is especially evident in the other members of the Black Bulls. E.g. in episode 8:\\n\\n\r\nDid you know that Gauche is a siscon loves his sister after hearing it for the 20th time?\\n\r\nDid you know that Charmy really likes food after hearing it over and over?\\n\r\nDid you know that because Noelle is royalty she doesn't like doing menial tasks after hearing her repeat it over and over in the same episode?\\n\\n\r\nRepetition does not constitute for character development and it shouldn't. This does occur in the manga, but nowhere near as often is it mentioned in the same scene. At some points its painfully obvious that the animators are padding for time, and it's a lot more irritating than endearing.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nThe background art looks remarkably good, and the character designs and drawing style stays quite close the original manga art style. The animation is mostly smooth and doesn't feel unnatural or out place. The only real issue I could see was the fight scenes;  if you paused at some points during the action shots there was a lot of poorly drawn scenes. I found this out accidentally when I paused at the wrong (right?) moment. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nThe first opening and ending aren't particularly memorable, but I think they fit the 'feel' of the show quite nicely. \\n\r\nVoice acting - do I even need to talk about Asta's Japanese VA? One may get used to it after a while, but it can be a really big turn-off for people to hear that guttural screaming. IT does seem to fit his character, but it's a little too annoying for my taste. I have no qualms with the other characters' voice actors, and the background music is decent, but not particularly memorable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10 \\n\r\nI'm honestly quite close to dropping the series. So far the pacing has been rather slow, and the story has put a lot of focus on very mundane scenes from the manga\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nIn hindsight, this review feels a lot more like a comparison between this adaption and the manga, but honestly if you were interested by the premise, I highly recommend you read the manga instead of watching this. \\n",

I think the anime has a bit of a slow start but after a couple of episodes I found myself having watched multiple of them in a row without being able to stop. I enjoy watching anime where you have a main character who develops and becomes stronger while fighting stronger and stronger enemies.\r\nI like the characters, they have a vast amount of differences in their personalities and many different variations in terms of looks which makes iteasier to keep track of who is who. The actors also do a great job I think with forming the personalities and traits into a nice rose thats grown in the already lovely green field. I love the humour aswell, it's so simple and i LOVE it haha.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I also think the story is nice, it has a definite goal which paves a path of endless possibilities which means I have no idea what will happen next. And that makes it exciting to me.\\n\\n\r\nI am sad to see that there aren't many episodes left... :( I quickly got used to the yelling and I think it subsided aswell rather fast, it's not much yelling at all anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's a great anime. :) The only bad things right now is that it's slightly confusing to me with the enemies goal and I have some questions still that I hope I will get an answer of in the oncoming episodes.\\n",

            "content": "This will be one of the few times where you should DEFINITELY watch the dub.  Asta's voice is irritating and everyone I know couldn't make it past the first episode.  I read the manga and I loved it so I was looking very forward to the anime, but was really disappointed how far the Japanese voice went for Asta.  The dub is still a bit extreme, but that's also just Asta in general.  However it is much more bearable and the overall cast is fairly good for the dub.  \r\nThe story is great and if you catch all of itsinspirations, you can actually see that it's rather satirical and making fun of the typical shonen tropes. You got the Naruto:  \"I want to be Hokage\" but replace it with Sorcerer King.  However it's a good trope, gives the character a goal that means there will be a more clear ending as Asta either becomes the king or he doesn't.  It doesn't leave it a mystery so that it can drag on for almost decades.  Speaking of....  Bleach:  If you liked the rival captain, but allies concept, you'll like this. There's even a big sword!  There's the cool aloof and noble captain who is very handsome and powerful.  There's the meathead, I can go on.  But if anything it leaves a sense of nostalgia instead of eyerolls. Fairy Tail:  Yeah.  Just less fanservice.  But yeah.  One Piece:  main character is very simple, yet very charming and loveable (once you get past the yelling).  They easily make allies with anyone.   \\n\r\nWhat makes this different:  \\n\r\n1. The Relationships.  When you think of rivalries, you probably imagine Naruto and Sasuke, being friends/rivals but with a sort of animosity.  They aren't at all on the same side.  Asta and Yuno have a perfect rivalry (in my eyes ok).  They both completely support each other, believe the other to have an upper hand and they must get stronger, and truely acknowledge the other as a legitimate rival.  While it is clear that Yuno is stronger than Asta, he never once looks down on him and is proud to be his rival.  They compete with each other, but would rather their achievements speak louder than power fights with each other.  \\n\r\n2.  The Squads.  They might be unified the same way guilds in FT and squads in Bleach are set up, but unlike in those, there are clear power differences.  Asta's squad is a literal joke.  They are so bad that they have negative stars, but they're all really powerful.  That part is basically a copy of Fairy Tail, but unlike in FT, you don't get the direct choice at which squad you join.  The Captains decide if they want you or not and you might never get to be a magic knight. That part is what I find unique as it shows that all the magic knight squads work together, but instead of each having a specialty, it's more like they each have different levels of popularity/social class.  \\n\r\n3.  It's done well.  Despite the clear inspirations/copies, it never truly takes away from the story, which as it develops, becomes more unique.  Secrets are unfolding and it's far more sinister than the lighthearted tones suggest.  I think the inspirational elements provide nostalgia more than anything.\\n\r\nI look forward to watching the story take its own shape.  Also Yami is the manliest and hawt.  *sighs*",

Whole Black Clover is correct good anime, but is one reason why people give so low score. This anime was advertised as great title or new legendary title. From begining people search reasons to hate this anime. But when you look at this with neutral perspective, you will change your opinion. Story is better than Fairy Tail, types of magic are better than other similar animes. One thing is not stable, and this is animation. In one episode animation is very good, butin nxt episode animation is very low. In my opinion so far, only animation is reason to give little lower score. Black Clover deserves for strong 8 score.",

Sure it may contain the most cliched mashups of all of the past shonen anime, and there is a REALLY DAMN annoting child screaming his head off with a big ass sword, BUT overall, its really not that bad.\r\nStory: A mashup of every shonen anime that was popular. Basically...\r\nA boy who wants to be the very best and wants to be the MAGIC KING although he doesn't' have any magic. From there, he will train really hard, yell a lot and reach bankai to do what it takes to beat his rival, whois your typical talented anime boi. OH WAIT, DID I MENTION THEY WERE ORPHANS? 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: ehh, i guess it has its own unique art style. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Apart from all the yelling, you will hear some occasional explosions and magic casting. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Asta's yelling from DBZ, Yuno is basically emo Sasuke, etc, you get the point. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As cliched as it is, it was strangely okay for me. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "I guess I just don't get all the hate.  For those wondering what this anime is about, I will make it extraordinarily simple for you: It's Fairy Tail with a slightly different premise.\r\nThere really isn't anyway to sugarcoat it.  Even the style of comic relief is exactly the same.  If you liked Fairy Tail, you will like Black Clover.  If not, then what are you doing watching a show anywhere remotely near this genre.\r\n\"But it isn't original.\"  No story is truly original.  Even Shakespeare heavily borrowed elements from previous plays.  Black clover puts enough of a spin onthe genre that it stands alone.  I think Asta's lack of magical power leading him to be attracted to the book of anti-magic has a nice symmetry and logic that shows the world's magic system was well thought out.\\n\\n\r\n\"But Asta just yells all the time.\"  Watch the English Dub, it's much better.  This isn't the 90's.  There are some amazingly talented English voice actors.  We've come full circle, and the dub blows the sub out of the water on this one.  Asta still yells, but not as often, and it isn't as grating.\\n\\n\r\n\"But the art and graphics.\"  That should never matter.  It's not like this is Kingdom here people.  Stories survive on their own merits.\\n\\n\r\n\"But there's no character development.\"  You're mostly right.  There is some, but it's very minimal.  This show, much like Fairy Tail, is based on action and character interaction.  We want the characters to be familiar, so when they act the same stupid way we expect we can laugh and roll our eyes.  The characters aren't going to change much, or if they do, it will be slow and gradual over many dozens of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone can bring on any additional complaints or concerns, I'll gladly edit this to address them.  Otherwise, I see no reason why Fairy Tail consistently remains above an 8 average score while Black Clover struggles to maintain a 6.5.",

This anime is somewhat predictable, but I think it's paced at a well tempo and I like the timings where the jokes come in. I also find that the characters in this anime are great. Asta, the main character, is a little loud and annoying at first, but as the story progresses, many likeable aspects of him are shown. \r\nThe only disappointing part of this anime, I would say, is the art and animation. I wasn't bothered by it at the beginning, but somescenes are not very effectively shown and drawings became sloppy. In some episodes, there were scenes where they have a stopped image, used multiple times, while the characters speak. Or the characters' face parts were disoriented and/or not detailed. I think if, instead of one 51 episode season, it was two 25 episode seasons they could have polished up the artwork better. \\n\\n\r\nBut, despite the art flaw, I still like this anime and will definitely keep watching it.",

However, the concept of Black Clover is something amazing! Unlike Naruto and Natsu, who already are extremely powerful, Asta possesses no magic at all. This makes the show quite interesting to watch.\r\nYuno and Asta's relation is also quite unique. This gives the anime drive.\r\nShounen animes may be saturated. However, animes like 'My Hero Academia' and Black Clover are trying to gain entry into this genre. \r\nIt is not at all bad.

It's the usual shounen trope but what makes it different is that these two don't have any hostile behaviour towards the other and both are at different places but still believing in the other while continue bettering themselves healthily. There aren't any petty fights that would stronger their bond because their bond is already at peak.\r\nMy complaint though is that how bad or hard to watch some of the animations look. The mouth sync is so bad and the fights aren't flashy at all. There are even somedrawing oopsies in some scenes that I couldn't overlook. Also how slow the story progresses (well since it's a long non seasonal anime it can't be blamed). But it definitely gotten considerably better after 30ish episodes and the fights began to look smoother.\\n\r\nI have no complaint whatsoever at the story itself soif you don't mind the bad animation do give this a try!\\n",

But what makes this anime good is something you don't see in others a lot is the secondary characters probably pull the show.  They give you a reason to like main character and makes you more curious what else hislittle black book can do.   \\n\\n\r\nThe story story starts of generic and kinda played out but if you look closely it kinda isn't.  That's the reason some people probably likened it to a Naruto or Bleach but it has its own aura that just drags you into liking it after they flush out the protagonist and deuteragonist  Yeah i know i gave the story a 7 and yeah most of the other ratings ain't as grand either but it just has that spark that leaves you wanting more.  \\n\\n\r\nLike i said my first impression wasn't all that, there was even a time where i left it so i can binge when its done ('cause i ain't the type to just go up and leave an anime) but when i looked around and the rest i had up to offer weren't giving me a jump in my step i started to binge and well wasn't that a  bad idea.  After all the episodes that had been released i couldn't wait for the next it kept me wanting more and really that's what good anime do and suppose to do.  \\n\\n\r\nFight scenes can improve and they could probably throw us a bone or two to what his powers really are, but besides that is a great anime probably worth another look by some that wrote it off in the first episode.",

            "content": "This review is available in English and Brazilian Portuguese:\r\nENGLISH:\r\n*This review does not contain spoilers and has slight comparisons with the original product (manga). Will be treated in this text episodes 01 to 10, equivalent to the first volume of the Blu-Ray/DVD of Black Clover, which goes on sale on 02.22.2018.\r\nAnime of a battle shounen of Weekly Shounen Jump. Black Clover shouts this phrase in every way, from the personalities of the characters, motivational shocking phrases, to the comic bias and action fights full of special powers, without doubt the main characteristic that accompanies the successes of the genre. The story follows the journey of twoorphans named Asta and Yuno heading to their dreams of being the Wizard King (the supreme and most powerful Wizard figure) in a world where magic is absolutely everything.\\n\\n\r\nThough full of those cloying clich\u00e9s that haunt almost every major production of the popular battle shounens, such as a teeming show of friendship, friendly rivalry, a certain background drama and main character with noble intentions and brave heart, we can not rule out the fact that such characteristics are essential and need to be shown before the age of the target audience: children and young people (especially boys aged 9 to 15, true devourers of that kind series).\\n\\n\r\nWith the adaptation for anime, Black Clover gained something of great importance that, in its original material, the manga, was almost totally left out: the development and deepening in the history of the characters. The director earns points in showing through the hated fillers (that plays a very good and necessary role here, although some are purposely elongated to fill the minutes of the episode), the past of the characters in a way that the viewer creates a bond affective much larger than the existing one in the manga series. In it, Yuuki Tabata, original creator of the work, sins a lot in this respect, showing his immaturity as a writer in presenting these elements (which could be constructed in a much more worked, without the horrible characteristic hurry of the illustrated work) so important in three or four pages.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Yoshihara Tatsuya, it is impossible to talk about anime animation without mentioning it. Tatsuya is an experienced and recognized animator (much more competent in this area than as a director, a profession in which he still needs to improve), and although he is not directly involved with the artistic direction itself, his contact list is full of names extremely efficient. After all, what can we expect from an anime in which the director has already been key animator of such series as Ano Hana and Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge? Of course, wonderful footage and some breathtaking action scenes, far above the average of almost all fighting animes from recent years (citing, especially, points from episode 01, 02, 04, 06 and 10, striking with wonderful sakuga) .\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is, even under his influence, that we have reached the point of greatest prominence of this first part of Black Clover: the ending. Dismissing the song comments (made by the duo Itowokashi, which had already been perfect in Sousei on Onmyouji, and here do not let the quality fall), it is all directed, scripted and animated by the prodigy animator Ryu Nakama. Both he and Tatsuya are youngsters of the same generation and have worked together in the past, culminating in a special invitation for the ending of this was done by Ryu. Watching or not anime, it is more than recommended that you go check this wonderful production. A pity to have only a minute and a half.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also correct and striking in strategic moments, making the hype present and rising as the viewer gets excited about what they are watching. And since the subject is the sounds, how to not mention one of the points that most caused dissatisfaction to the public? Yes, I'm talking about the voice actors (specifically, one voice actor).\\n\\n\r\nPopular figures of great talent and renown are present in the team, such as Nobunaga Shimazaki (Nanase Haruka of Free!) And Fukuyama Jun (Lelouch Lamperouge of Code Geass), but the center of attention, and unfortunately not in a positive way, is the inexperienced Kajiwara Gakuto, interpreter of the Asta. His screams that are three times more constant than necessary have an extremely loud and aching sound to the ears, a fact that makes the character memorable and unique, even if not in the positive way that we would like. Here, it is not the voice that does not match the character (because it is perfect for him) or the intonations are not applied correctly, but rather the volume in the sound control is extremely high and the actor's sharp note, when shouting, \"dirty\" way. If you endure the first three episodes, there is a noticeable reduction in volume and number of cries, and your ears will be at least almost accustomed.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover is an anime without any innovation, animation bordering the perfection in the first two episodes, but with inconsistent quality in the remaining, characters that fulfill what is expected from a battle shounen. For the 10 episodes seen, little actually developed and the supposed real villains gave a cool background at the end of the last one, in that old and good intention of making the public curious about what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, the series is a perfect commercial move (being blatantly treated as \"epic adventure\" in the trailers, by high publicity and investment) to work and become the worldwide success that is today, remembering that it's manga premiered purposely shortly after the end of NARUTO, taking full advantage of its similar vibe and catching the orphaned fans of the show. Advisable to those who want an authentic and pure fighting anime, without complex dialogues or plot twists unimaginable.\\n\\n\r\nPORTUGUESE:\\n\\n\r\n*Esta cr\u00edtica n\u00e3o apresenta spoilers e possui leves compara\u00e7\u00f5es com o produto original (mang\u00e1). Ser\u00e3o tratados neste texto os epis\u00f3dios 01 ao 10, equivalentes ao primeiro volume do Blu-Ray/DVD de Black Clover, que sai \u00e0 venda em 23/02/2018.\\n\\n\r\nAnime de um battle shounen da Weekly Shounen Jump. Black Clover grita essa frase de todas as formas, desde as personalidades de seus personagens, frases impactantes motivacionais, passando pelo ligeiro vi\u00e9s c\u00f4mico e pela a\u00e7\u00e3o com lutas repletas de poderes especiais, sem d\u00favidas a caracter\u00edstica principal que acompanha os sucessos do g\u00eanero. A hist\u00f3ria segue a jornada de dois \u00f3rf\u00e3os chamados Asta e Yuno rumo aos seus sonhos de serem o Rei Mago (a figura suprema e mais poderosa de mago) em um mundo onde magia \u00e9 absolutamente tudo.\\n\\n\r\nApesar de repleto daqueles enjoativos clich\u00eas que assombram quase toda grande produ\u00e7\u00e3o dos t\u00e3o populares battle shounen, como a demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o farta de amizade, rivalidade amig\u00e1vel, certo drama em segundo plano e personagem principal que possui nobres inten\u00e7\u00f5es e cora\u00e7\u00e3o valente, n\u00e3o podemos excluir o fato de que tais caracter\u00edsticas s\u00e3o essenciais e precisam ser mostradas perante a idade do p\u00fablico-alvo: as crian\u00e7as e jovens (em especial os garotos de 9 a 15 anos, verdadeiros devoradores de s\u00e9ries como essa).\\n\\n\r\nCom a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o para anime, Black Clover ganhou algo de grande import\u00e2ncia que, em seu material original, o mang\u00e1, era quase que totalmente deixado de lado: o desenvolvimento e aprofundamento na hist\u00f3ria dos personagens. O diretor ganha pontos em mostrar, atrav\u00e9s dos t\u00e3o odiados fillers (mas que cumprem um papel muito bom e necess\u00e1rio aqui, apesar de alguns serem propositalmente alongados para preencher os minutos do epis\u00f3dio), o passado dos personagens de maneira que o telespectador crie um v\u00ednculo afetivo muito maior do que o existente na s\u00e9rie em quadrinhos. Nela, Yuuki Tabata, criador original da obra, peca e muito nesse quesito, mostrando sua imaturidade como roteirista ao apresentar esses elementos (que poderiam ser constru\u00eddos de forma muito mais trabalhada, sem a horr\u00edvel pressa caracter\u00edstica da obra ilustrada) t\u00e3o importantes em tr\u00eas ou quatro p\u00e1ginas.\\n\\n\r\nFalando em Yoshihara Tatsuya, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel falar da anima\u00e7\u00e3o do anime sem cit\u00e1-lo. Tatsuya \u00e9 um experiente e reconhecido animador (muito mais competente nessa \u00e1rea do que como diretor, profiss\u00e3o em que ainda precisa se aprimorar), e por mais que n\u00e3o esteja diretamente envolvido com a dire\u00e7\u00e3o art\u00edstica em si, sua lista de contatos \u00e9 repleta de nomes extremamente eficientes. Afinal, o que podemos esperar de um anime em que o diretor j\u00e1 foi key animator de s\u00e9ries como Ano Hana e Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge? Claro, imagens maravilhosas e algumas cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o de tirar o f\u00f4lego, muito acima da m\u00e9dia de quase todos animes de luta dos \u00faltimos anos (citando, especialmente, passagens do epis\u00f3dio 01, 02, 04, 06 e 10, marcantes com maravilhosos sakuga).\\n\\n\r\nE \u00e9, ainda por influ\u00eancia dele, que chegamos ao ponto de maior destaque dessa primeira parte de Black Clover: O encerramento. Dispensando coment\u00e1rios sobre a m\u00fasica (feita pelo dueto Itowokashi, que j\u00e1 haviam sido perfeitos em Sousei no Onmyouji, e aqui n\u00e3o deixam a qualidade cair), ele \u00e9 todo dirigido, roteirizado e animado pelo animador prod\u00edgio Ryu Nakama. Tanto ele quanto Tatsuya s\u00e3o jovens da mesma gera\u00e7\u00e3o e que trabalharam juntos no passado, culminando assim, num convite especial para que o encerramento desse fosse feito por Ryu. Assistindo ou n\u00e3o ao anime, \u00e9 mais do que recomend\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea v\u00e1 conferir essa maravilhosa produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma pena possuir apenas um minuto e meio.\\n\\n\r\nA trilha sonora tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 correta e se mostra marcante em momentos estrat\u00e9gicos, fazendo com que o hype se fa\u00e7a presente e se eleve na medida com que o espectador se empolgar com o que est\u00e1 assistindo. E j\u00e1 que o assunto s\u00e3o os sons, como deixar de citar um dos pontos que mais causaram insatisfa\u00e7\u00e3o ao p\u00fablico? Sim, estou falando dos dubladores (em espec\u00edfico, de um dublador).\\n\\n\r\nFiguras populares de grande talento e renome est\u00e3o presentes na equipe, como Nobunaga Shimazaki (Nanase Haruka de Free!) e Fukuyama Jun (Lelouch Lamperouge de Code Geass), mas o centro das aten\u00e7\u00f5es, e infelizmente n\u00e3o de uma forma positiva, \u00e9 o inexperiente Kajiwara Gakuto, interpretante do Asta. Seus gritos triplamente mais constantes que o necess\u00e1rio possuem um som extremamente elevado e dolorido aos ouvidos, fato que torna o personagem memor\u00e1vel e \u00fanico, mesmo que n\u00e3o da maneira positiva que gostar\u00edamos. Aqui, n\u00e3o se trata da voz n\u00e3o combinar com o personagem (pois \u00e9 perfeita para ele) ou as entona\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o serem aplicadas corretamente, mas sim do volume no controle de som ser extremamente elevado e da nota aguda do ator, ao gritar, sair de maneira t\u00e3o \u201csuja\u201d. Caso aguente os tr\u00eas primeiros epis\u00f3dios, h\u00e1 uma not\u00f3ria redu\u00e7\u00e3o no volume e na quantidade de gritos, al\u00e9m de que seus ouvidos j\u00e1 estar\u00e3o, pelo menos, quase que acostumados.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover \u00e9 um anime sem nenhuma inova\u00e7\u00e3o, anima\u00e7\u00e3o beirando a perfei\u00e7\u00e3o nos dois primeiros epis\u00f3dios, mas com qualidade inconsistente nos restantes e personagens que cumprem o que se espera de um battle shounen. Pelos 10 epis\u00f3dios vistos, pouco realmente se desenvolveu e os supostos verdadeiros vil\u00f5es deram um background legal no final do \u00faltimo, naquela velha e boa inten\u00e7\u00e3o de deixar o p\u00fablico curioso com o que acontecer\u00e1 mais pra frente.\\n\\n\r\nAcima de tudo, a s\u00e9rie \u00e9 uma perfeita jogada comercial (sendo descaradamente tratada como \u201c\u00e9pica aventura\u201d nos trailers, pela alta divulga\u00e7\u00e3o e investimento) para que funcionasse e se tornasse o sucesso mundial que \u00e9 hoje, lembrando que seu mang\u00e1 estreou propositalmente pouco ap\u00f3s o final de NARUTO, aproveitando totalmente sua vibe semelhante e pegando os f\u00e3s \u00f3rf\u00e3os da obra. Aconselh\u00e1vel \u00e0queles que querem um aut\u00eantico e puro anime de luta, sem di\u00e1logos complexos ou plot twists inimagin\u00e1veis.",

It's might true that there are other anime is pretty much similar to this. But this is also adaption from manga too. This story might surprise you when it goes to climax! I believe in that not judge it because each story have own reason and different characters. I know this would getting interesting with story.\r\nArt- well, i don't care if art is great but as long as it can see better such color. Nowadays, technology is used so it means artis great. That's all I have saying.\\n\\n\r\nSound -  I don't use to hear sound and just prefer to read the subtitle. Because sound is not my preference. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -  that is gonna be great or climax because each character have crazy reason or want to accomplish their goals such become Magic King. For example, Asta is magicless and unable to obtain the magic book but surprised to have black clover which is five clover. Both characters have greater obstacles in their way to reach their dreams and goals too! That would be interesting for me!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I am gonna say that is great but depend on my mood and especially if it is climax i would hurry to watch next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8. I really satisfy their works and gave a great story with different overall for this anime.  I would recommend you if you love magic and fantasy or adventure. This is gonna long travel to see more story of ahead time.",

It take a lot elemnts shonen fans like. It is for that reason I enjoy this show.\r\nSome people might say it's stupid. At first I believed that as well, but I gave this anime a shot and it was totally worth it. Sure, some of the first episodes might have been kind of \"awkward\", simply sput, not very good. But as soon as you get through these episodes the anime will most likely \"suck\" you inif you are a shonen fan. The story gets better and better with time as so do the characters. I wouldn't say that this anime is top notch, but it definitely got me interested. Most of the newer episodes are pretty darn good. You should definitely give it a shot, trust me :)\\n\\n\r\nWhat else to say? Overall I thinjk this anime has a great potential and I enjoy it a lot. Seems like the story will go on for a long time. Well, we can only watch and wait what will happen in the next episode, right? I am giving this anime 9/10 with all of my heart. <3\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of me talking. Why are you still here?

So you need to give the guy some slack.\r\nOKAY! Let's get into this.\r\nStory 7/10.\r\nI gave it this score because after I got into the show, the story got much better, for me personally, I know a lot ofyou won't agree, but that's how I see the show, the flow of the plot fits and it's just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the artstyle really nice, I honestly don't know what to say about it, the lighting and colouring is really MAGICAL in a way. I also like how everyone has consistent hair colour, such as White, Brown, Black, I haven't seen many people with CRAZY insane colours like how you normally see in most anime shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I don't know what to say the music is very Medieval, so it fits very well with the theme of the song, at moments of intensity, they give it a nice JOLT or excitement, or that nice whimsical moment music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique in my eyes and fun, in Asta's case (the Main Character), he's incredibly unique, albeit his screaming is consistent so it gets annoying, but I did get used to it in the end. Yuno, (Asta's Rival) he's calm and collected, wields powerful magic, and very \"Cool\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do enjoy the anime, I know what people are on about when they say, they're incredibly annoyed by the show and it has no consistency, but I beg to differ, it is amazing, the story gets good and the action scenes are amazing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'd like to preface this by stating that this is the first anime review I've ever written, but after reading a few reviews post-finishing the currently aired episodes (64), I felt the need to contribute. During my time watching Black Clover (that time being under a week, as I did binge watch the series) I overall found it a decently enjoyable series, one that I will most definitely continue. Like other reviewers I've read, I don't think it is fair to compare Black Clover to and base its credibility on other anime. While Black Clover shares similarities in plot, character tropes, and stereotypical genre qualitieswith other popular shonen, such as Fairy Tail and Naruto, it is very likely that this is due to the popularity and success of the aforementioned (both the shows and their repeating characteristics). Even if this were not the case, the recycling of the qualities does not necessarily make the show bad. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the story, which I gave a 7 for good. The plot revolving around Asta's dream and wholesome rivalry with his childhood friend Yuno is one I enjoy, being it essentially requires the story line to revolve around the character development of not only Asta, but also of Yuno, and their competition. Through this we get to see not only Asta and Yuno develop, but many of their comrades. The underdog story line, while common, never feels to get too old, and with this, Black Clover brings an interesting approach to it with its multiple scenarios in which the under dog rises (one I especially like in the case of Noelle). Aside from those, I did find the fight scenes to be too drawn out, as the antagonists seem to suffer from mild plot armor just for the benefit of the protagonists more than a utilized furthering of plot, becoming somewhat tiresome. However, I did find the class difference effects on perspective of physique and lifestyle a tad bit surprising, in a good way. The show, reflecting reality, depicts the higher class scorning the hard work and low magic of the lower classes, multiple remarks being made on Asta's physique being unappealing and gross (which may also just be a part of Japanese culture) with him being low born. While this may not be particularly ground breaking, it was intriguing enough to provide decent food for thought. The questions and interest I garnered from plot alone was enough for me to find it good, while it still being not outstanding because of the mediocrity in excitement and satisfaction through the battle scenes, which tend to be long for the major fights.\\n\\n\r\nI gave both art and sound a 6. While I enjoyed the animation in the battle scenes, it seemed to lack throughout non essential parts, noticeably enough that it could tend to become visually displeasing, particularly if you are someone that values the artwork of an anime. I will admit to being fairly irritated at the beginning of this series with the voice acting of Asta(sub). The constant yelling of the main character was, at first, an audible nuisance, however, as the show went on it turned into being more endearing and comedic as we get closer to Asta's character. In all, I didn't find any of the voice acting particularly moving at any point in time, but did enjoy how some of the voice actors really personified their character through their voice (Magna being a personal favorite).\\n\\n\r\nBoth character and enjoyment received a 9, or great, from me. The characters would have to be my favorite part about Black Clover, and really pick up in places the story itself can be lacking. I particularly enjoy the development of Asta and Yuno's teammates, because it creates more dynamic characters, and I personally enjoy learning about their diversified struggles, mindsets, backgrounds, and even magic. There were very few characters that I disliked, and even in those characters, there were qualities and behaviors that made me want to know more about them. Individually, each character is fairly well rounded, and I love watching the teammates and friends of the main characters grow and develop alongside them. This highly contributes to my enjoyment the show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not very picky with the anime I watch and what I like. I enjoy pretty much any show with a decent story line and fun characters. That being said, I am no anime elitist, nor do I really analyze the anime I watch. However, Black Clover provided both decent story line with fun characters, and intrigue that made me think while watching the show. This affected my watching and enjoyment, as it did drive me to continue on with the show with an increased vigor. Combining this with my love of the characters, fantasy settings, and the evolving story line, I very much so enjoy Black Clover.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I rate Black Clover, so far, with a 7, or a good. While in my heart it's more of an 8, because of how much I did enjoy the show, realistically it is closer to a 7 because of the somewhat mediocre story line, as well as the okay art and decent sound. The hate Black Clover receives is kind of understandable, but could most likely be avoided if it wasn't held to the standard of other more successful and popular anime. I am excited to see where the show will go, and hope that Black Clover makes a name uniquely for itself.",

The character development in the story is amusing which creates many interesting events which i'm sure many viewer would love. I would give the enjoyment max point 10/10. \r\nIf you are one of the naruto's fan, this anime is quite similar in term of concept. A main character, which born with a handicap, need to his work his ass off in order to become stronger then gradually gain respects from others and have a lotof friends who loves him. This is similar to the Naruto which i think it is quite a drawback since there are no innovative in the plot. However, I think the events which takes place in the story is worth watching since there are many surprises occur. For this, I will give it an 8/10 for story category.\\n\\n\r\n The art of the anime is acceptable, did not expect something which blow my mind from the beginning so i was not too surprised. Rating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLastly, character design and quality of the story is just on point. If you are looking for a main character who is energetic, flat headed, and reckless; this is the one for you. Also, the side characters of this story is surprisingly funny which makes you fall in love with them slowly. Rating: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would give this anime a score: 9/10",

Charachters are really getting good backstories that are in my opinion very interesting and the manga andanime treats it's charachters very well.\\n\\n\r\nI must say that manga really is way better, anime dose not have the same impact as it's rival, MHA, which has masive popularity not just in Japan but i whole world. Anime dose have some ishues but it can be fixed and i hope it really will\\n\\n\r\nSo if you can endure all of this, just sit back and enjoy the anime, you will not regret it.",

            "content": "OK ish...where to start for Black Clover...hmm...\"The new Shounen for a new generation (just like Boruto)...\" oh wait, Studio Pierrot...the masters of Shounen anime for decades past with the Big 3 and aiming for the same result with this and Boruto? Absolutely NOT working.\r\nGetting the sense out of watching something like this, it's no stranger to overhate and fuzzy-loving people, comparing to the decade earlier with the big 3 anime (Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail (should I add One Piece also?)).\r\nNot even the prior realization that from a 1 cour 12 episode to a 4 cour 51 episode count (like Sousei no Onmyouji which was alsodone by Pierrot) could save the production.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with 20% done (10 out of 51 episodes), how does it compare to the production values and the manga adaptation?\\n\\n\r\nIn a word: CHEAP. Abso-tainting-utely mediocre and painfully slow. But in all honesty, with the Shounen treatment that Studio Pierrot has done over the years, a little bit of credit is due. That's not to say that I like this show or not, it's just that over on YouTube and forums everywhere, this has been covered a million-over times and I cannot emphasize this enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with Episode 10 out of the way, I've gotta say that the story AT LEAST is back on track like a proper pacing episode, and it's by far the best episode with the same \"meh\" conditions that plagued the first 20% of the show, and actually am a bit excited about how the progression will live on towards the remaining 40 episodes (since this is a 4-cour anime), but expectations will vary.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are really the same quality as what Pierrot unleashes nowadays, just standard but nice sorta cel-shading art to cover the inequalities of the manga adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST however is another story. Aside from Asta's VA (or CV for otakus) (which is a newbie), I'd say that while his character stands out the most, earlier on it's all for the wrong reasons, and combine with the show's pacing, it's no wonder why people who watch this show give up almost immediately. But as I've said, give the show a second chance to deliver, and opinions may vary, but it's each and everyone's call. The other VAs did an OK job in delivering the show's aspects, and they're the usual Pierrot standard. The OP and ED are not horrible honestly, and is really quite catchy that sets the mood for the new-fangled Shounen troupe.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, it's up to Studio Pierrot to live up the standards of what make the Big 3 standout in the past decade, and to copy that tried-and-true formula into making Black Clover from a horrible, slow-starting show to one that is at least decent to viewers (or fans) of the Big 3 (especially Naruto since the formula is spoiler alert)\\n\\n\r\nThis review only pertains to the 1st 10 episodes, and I'm gonna release every progressive review from every 10 eps down to cover every new cour's offerings.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, blessed are those who watch (or dropped) Black Clover and your hate is overdue and your love is shallow. Either way, love or hate it, it's just a show with decent, if not mediocre production.",

It probably deserves some of the hate it got atleast when it comes to the first 10 episodes. But i'll give this a solid 7. To break it down\r\nSTORY:6 Fair, Nothing groundbreaking. Its as generic as it gets being weak MC fights the odds to make it to the top. You know the drill. The pacing can be frustrating at times. But as generic as the story is, its well executed and the overarching plot is interesting. \r\nART: 7 Good. Art is not very obvious to meunless its exceptionally bad or good. I thought it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:7 Good. Ah yes,Asta's screaming is infamous and probably what drove people away from the show. Honestly it was terrible at first and thats saying something becuase i generally am not very critical about voice acting and this was bad enough for me to notice it to the point i was forcing myself to sit through episodes. But credit where its due, it becomes significantly better, sounds okay and actually suits Asta well. The score is good and i like the OP's.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:8 Very Good. It's what made me persevere through the first 10 average episodes. They are likeable, the side characters are interesting, compelling and more than just passing characters. For the short time they are on screen, they are well fleshed out and elevate the story\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8 Very Good: If you get past the first 10-12 episodes, it's a fun series. It has some good humor and action and moves quickly through the story but i do wish the action scenes were a bit more dynamic because there is a lot of standing around.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:7 Good: It wont win any awards, the story is generic but well executed with likeable characters and is a fun ride. As a reader of the manga, the next couple of arcs are something i'm looking forward to seeing animated.\\n\\n",

Good stuff never comes. Animations feels like you are watching a fan made animation. I give it like a 3/10\r\nStory is generic, but it's set in a mystical-fantasy world, so meh, it can be interesting I guess.Generic \"hero\" moments throughout the series; you can feel something when you are watching this series, only if you try really hard to get into the story and empathize with the characters, but the series itself doesn't help at all in making you feel anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, all in all that's what I feel about the series, there are some ok moments, but most of the scenes are dissapointing.

            "content": "The subbed version is nearly unwatchable due to the voice acting of the main character. The way he screams every five seconds that he's on screen in the same high-pitched tone is, while impressive on the part of the voice actor, highly annoying. It's almost like they just copied and pasted the same scream in over and over again. The dubbed version offers an easier watch. There are going to be a lot of familiar voices, but they're much easier on the ears. The story so far is bland and mediocre at best. Many have said that a comparison can be made to the originalNaruto series, and they're not wrong. The unpopular character wants to become the leader, he has a dark-haired rival who excels at everything that he does not making him a prodigy, they grew up together, they're orphans, and he is stubborn to the point of idiocy. As the story progresses, he utilizes the \"power of friendship\" to defeat seemingly invincible enemies, all while getting seriously hurt in the process. The stereotypical character tropes abound in this anime. You have the tsundere (a couple of them, in fact), the loner, the sis-con, the drunk hot chick who always makes suggestive remarks, the scary leader, the tiny girl who eats like an elephant and is entirely controlled by food, the hothead, the happy battle-freak, the fat guy, the quiet creepy guy who's actually probably friendly but everyone still ignores, the \"ladies' man\" who isn't really liked by the ladies, the arrogant jerk who turns out to be caring and overprotective, the elitists, the whiny King, the childhood crush who rejects the main character, children who are entirely too realistic and intelligent for their age, the ex-goodguy, the over-powered good guy who is nearly killed shortly after revealing how \"powerful\" he is, the mad scientist/crazy doctor girl with an obsession over dissecting and experimenting on the main character, the serious guy, the serious girl, the girl who says very lesbian-esque things, the tomboy, the powerful old lady, the crazy witch who steals people's youth and wants people to tell her she's \"beautiful\" but goes absolutely insane when someone calls her \"old\", the mysterious leader, the reptilian leader, the sleepy leader, the wise leader, the muscle leader, the serious leader, the somewhat shady leader, the silent leader, the scarred bad guy, the laughing bad guy, the laughing-while-being-useless good guy, the tough guy, the weak guy, the sad guy, the happy guy, the innocent little girl, the mischievous little boy, nearly EVERYONE expect for a few characters have ridiculously stupid hair and/or outfits just to make them unique and stand out, and dozens more that I've yet to uncover or have simply lost track of. Every character has to shout the name of their spells whenever they cast them, which gets aggravating. But the most heinous, most infuriating, most unforgivable trend that this anime follows is the flashback/recap trend. Almost every episode has at least two to four minutes of recaps from the previous episode along with innumerable flashbacks in the most aggravating places. Everyone has some kind of backstory and traumatic history. A typical episode is 20% recaps, 20% flashbacks, 10% talking about how friendship is the key to winning, 15% screaming, 15% characters thinking about how something is \"amazing\", \"incredible\", \"impossible\", or \"unbelievable\", 10% powering-up, 5% power move failure, 3% gasping, 1% action, and 1% plot progression. If you cut out the internal monologues, flashbacks, recaps, gasping, stares of disbelief, repeatedly failed attacks, side-stories, and action-background moves, you MIGHT have one or two decent fight scenes. The fact that this anime is getting 50+ episodes is pathetic. A full season of 26 episodes would've been more than enough had they cut out all the unnecessary bullsh*t and actually progressed the story. Then again, you can probably blame the commercial success of series like Naruto or Dragonball for carbon-copied animes such as this. However, even the studio behind Naruto and Dragonball eventually realized these mistakes and improved. I could see this series being popular during the late 90's/early 2000's, but in 2018 these mistakes are simply inexcusable. The constant explanations of why \"this move is impossible to block and is going to defeat you no matter what\" that ultimately fail, almost without failure, make even mediocre stories seem drawn out and overblown. Every character has one or two moves that they rely on constantly and are almost without exception weak and make no difference in a fight. The final blows are almost always physical and mostly non-lethal, regardless of how hard they hit. Sword slashes rarely produce a serious wound. The production is spotty, too. There are a few scenes where you can tell they cheaped-out on the still shots because of the cost of animating action. You suddenly go from consistent, somewhat mediocre art, to disproportionate faces/heads that hardly resemble the character and look like they were drawn by the studio's interns/trainees/amateurs. There is too much filler/dialogue and not enough action and story progression. There is a great deal of comic relief in the unfiltered comments of one of the leaders, but this show's main plot does not revolve around this character, unfortunately. I honestly feel sorry for the manga artist because this anime is going to make people hate this series. I'm not sure how popular this series is, but it's a huge miss for me.",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nI don't care whether or not it's \"just another shounen,\" or if the manga is better, or if it's better to watch weekly or in one big session.  The story is starting out at \"okay\" and promises to get a little better as time goes on and new elements of the plot and character abilities are revealed; as a shounen often does.  It's meant to be stuck with for the long-haul, and I'm okay with that.\r\nWith that said, I can't give the story a better score for now because, well, it's just not good.  Black Clover the anime has undoubtedly hammeredin its ideas of classism and \"Magic is EVERYTHING in this world,\" but that's about as far as we've gotten in what is supposed to be a fast-paced story.  21 episodes in, so far, and precious little has progressed in the overall narrative.  I really think the word \"peasant\" will continue to be used as a slur in this show at least until the first big time skip.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nThe animation is bad.  Like, Berserk (2016) bad.  I literally can't go 3 minutes per episode without thinking \"how can the art be this lackluster?\"  Basic movements like eating, speaking, casual gestures, they're as minimal as can be, as far as I can tell.  But when it comes time to ramp up the action, OH BOY LOOK OUT, sometimes they use god-awful smoke effects that look like shadowy low-res FMVs from 1997!  How about those wind effects on that mighty wind magic?  Boy howdy, sometimes they draw more than 2 frames of a whirlwind, ain't that a treat!\\n\r\nThe art is bad, possibly one of the worst parts of the anime so far.  It isn't slick like Bleach or Naruto; it isn't unique like One Piece; it isn't risque like Fairy Tail, it doesn't quite have the character diversity like Hunter X Hunter.  There's no charm to any of the designs, no visual flair that makes it a joy to watch.  \\n\r\nI genuinely wonder where the production budget went, because clearly the art wasn't even close to high priority.\\n\r\nBlack Clover might be infamous for its voice work, but even that has tapered off to tolerable; the art and animation, however, has a long, LONG way to go to properly improve.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nCan you think of two cool themes from One Piece?  Good.  Two more from Naruto?  Easy enough.  One from HunterXHunter?  Exceptional.  What about Dragon Ball Z, back from it's Toonami run?  Not as easy, but I expect a few of you can recall a tune or two after some thought.\\n\r\nNow, think of the music in Black Clover.  Go on, try to really cudgel your brain for this one.  Not nearly as simple, is it?  The music is forgettable, and I would argue that that's WORSE than being outright BAD.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEveryone is a stock character, and they play their part well enough.  There are hints that each one is a certain way because reasons, and considering that we're only 21 episodes in, as of this review, I suppose it's fine enough to bide my time and just say everyone is \"okay\" for now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nAs much as I dislike everything else about this show, I can't outright hate Black Clover.  Hell, maybe I just have a soft spot for inoffensive trash.\\n\r\nI kept watching it, eagerly, even though I knew everything about it is just not good; I'll keep watching it, if only long enough so that I can pick up another seasonal show that's not terrible and put off Black Clover for some weeks.\\n\\n\r\nGrand total: 22/50\\n\r\nBlack Clover isn't going away anytime soon, so as long as I don't have anything better to watch, I guess it'll do.  Damned by faint praise.  \"I don't hate it\" is the nicest thing I can say about this, and in this day and age, that's not nothing.",

            "content": "This review if for all those who've looked at the reviews of Black Clover and seen the insults. But I am here to let you see my point in all this.\r\nHonestly, Black Clover isn't as crappy as some people say it is. The storyline is pretty good and has a lot of potentials. The so-called \"Trash\" this anime is, are just people who've said it's cliche or it has no character development but then I'm like, isn't that like every shounen anime ever. I mean, you can't say Naruto is \"original\" because I'm a 100% sure there were tons of shounen animes before Naruto, socouldn't you claim Naruto is cliche. And the no character development, really, it only has 21 episodes for frick sake. Naruto has over 100, Naruto has plenty of time to develop in the 100 episode but Black Clover only has 21, and from what I've seen so far I'm pretty sure Black Clover isn't going to be short. \\n\\n\r\nThough I must admit, Black clover can be repetitive, it gets better, maybe it's like Akame Ga Kill and the manga is so much better than the anime.(So try the manga). Also, the anime gets better, maybe it was like crap in the beginning but honestly, it's becoming better. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't think Black Clover is Crap. It's a good 7 and will get better. You just have to watch through all the bad parts. Like watching through all the fillers in Naruto Shippuden. Everyone is just judging it so harshly because they're comparing it to all the \"good\" animes already out there. I'm not here to make you think that Black Clover is DA BEST I'm here to have you endure it and see if you still like it. If you don't then you don't, but at least try it out before saying \"The reviews say it's shit so I'm going.\" \\n",

            "content": "As of this review, I've seen 20 episodes of the anime, aswell as read to the same point in the manga (around chapter 24). Most of the top reviews on this page haven't gotten past 10 episodes, and I realise that if they didn't enjoy then they're probably gonna stop, but in my opinion Black Clove has really turned things around. Black Clover has garnered a bad reputation due to it's clearly bad start, but particularly from the beginning of the dungeon arc onwards (about episode 13 or 14) there has been a pretty huge leap in quality.\r\nStory - 8\r\nI mean, if you like yourtypical shounen setup you're gonna enjoy Black Clover. For me, I've found the super long series such as Naruto and One Piece extremely difficult to catch up on due to the very slow pace and huge amount of content to get through. Black Clover's unique quality is the extreme fast pace, compared to other shounen anime. A typical arc that could take 15 chapters in the likes of Naruto takes 3 or less in Black Clover. It uses the cliches of the genre to it's advantage, it understands that the reader can fill in the blanks and not everything needs to be gone over, as everyone knows the tropes of shounen at this point. If you enjoy My Hero Academia, I'd feel you'd enjoy this, the setups are pretty similar, a hero with no powers in a world where everyone has different abilities. In this, it's magic rather than quirks. I won't disassemble the story, but if you like shounen you'd definitely enjoy this. Oh, the studio was obsessed with filler for the first like 12 episodes, so i'd reccomend looking up which episodes can be skipped. Since the pace is so fast, they tried to slow it down by adding lots of extra scenes and expanding on flashbacks which do nothing for the story and bring the story to a halt (at one point we were at 1 chapter spread over 3 episodes), but now we have gotten to a point where it is about 2 chapters per episode which is perfect if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5 (before episode 14, could be a 4 or 3, nearer to episode 20 it could be a 5.5/6)\\n\r\nThe artwork is extremely lazy at first. Constant reuse of animation, constant recaps just to save time on the episode (recaps often up to 5 minutes), and very poorly implemented special effects for the first arc. There is a pretty big jump in quality at the dungeon arc, but it's jumping from bad to average (and slightly above average in fights), so I can understand that art is not a selling point, and it never really is in a long running series like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nJust a typical shounen soundtrack, I thoroughly enjoy the EDs and OPs though, and particularly the little changes they make in the OPs to represent whats going on in the story, which is a nice little thing to notice. There's been many complaints about Asta's voice actor, about his extremely annoying voice which i AGREE is an issue, but this is the VA's big break. He's made huge leaps and bounds of improvement in later episodes, and he deserves to be commended.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nThe main characters are all very likeable, there's not one Black Bull I dislike, and their unique magic styles are very interesting to learn about as well as their backstories. The villains are typical for a shounen, Mars is literally Zabuza from Naruto, but they're not the focus. The focus here is on teamwork combat, which i think is done amazingly, and all these characters have good chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI personally really enjoy it, although if shounen is not your thing you definitely wont.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give it a 7. It had some difficulties at the start but it's really made improvements and i can acknowledge that.",

You must watch it, i have read the manga but I really love this anime.

She is also the second daughter of the Clover Kingdom's House Silva, one of its royal families. Having been born into the royal family, Noelle can seem arrogant and vain, which can be seen when she denies Asta's act of friendship while proclaiming that she has not given him permission to talk to her. This also leads her to have difficulty on admitting her mistakes as she tries to find excuses or blames her mistakes on somebody else. After finally coming out of her difficulties in admitting her mistakes, Noelle can also be seen as very reserved on expressing her delight over her achievements where she would rather suppress those feelings and shows her usual stern expression. She has a supposedly high sense of taste for items when she says that Magna Swing's broom is lame. However, due to having been rejected by her own family who had noticed her lack of control over her Magic Power, Noelle developed a slight inferiority complex to her more accomplished brother. This inferiority complex leads Noelle to try and prove them wrong to the point where she'll overexert herself during training. Additionally, she is skeptical of the people around her since she expects them to react the same way that her family did. Despite disliking him at first, Noelle has developed feelings for Asta, but constantly denies it.",

And every single Character has a really important role in the whole anime. unlike in Naruto or my hero academia and co. Character development, Action, one of the best animations,  very good Story (manga experience). The story is actually really fast and they don't make that much filler. \r\nAnd it's definitely not even close too Naruo. Naruo wants to be Hokage yeah exactly like Deku want to be the strongest hero and Goku the strongest fighter in the universe. Soma wants to be the best cook. Boruto wants to be the greatestninja. Gon wants to be the best hunter. And there are hundreds of examples more. If anyone is really thinking that these aims are the main point of anime plot then he just misunderstood the whole anime scene. \\n\r\nAnimes are about character development, emotions, friendship, love, and dreams. Every character needs a dream but this is not the main plot. You have to be pretty stupid if you think that all about \"Naruto\" is how he wants to be Hokage. \\n\r\nPeople are just mad because a new anime is ranked immediately as the new king of shounen that's all. They want to see their main anime as the new king like my hero academia or Boruto or attack on titan or other animes. That's why they hating it so much. Even if that happens subconsciously. they are not objective rather delusional",

It's typical shounen anime and I think for now I like it more than Bleach, Fairy Tail, One piece... Maybe Naruto exceeds it because of deeper characters personlities and co. \r\nStory: 9\r\nIt has a lot of coping from other animes. Asta and Yuno wants to be Wizard Kings(To be the best) and they join Magic Knights. Asta is the one that no one believes that will achieve that and co. There are captains and squads like in Bleach, but that made it even more enjoyablefor me. That was something that I liked the most in Bleach and was looking forward for anime with that kind of story.\\n\r\nThe other part of story is very interesting and that is why I hate people saying its same as others. There are new enemies and different back story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOverall sound is good. But I hate Asta and Magna being that awfully loud. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThere is bunch of characters and they are all unique. Asta and Magna are awfully loud and that is only flaw of this anime. Every character has his perosnality and belief. Their development goes slow, but that's to be expected in shounen. After all in this type of anime most of them stay the same during whole time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt got me excited to see some familiar stuffs again. I was waiting for anime which will have all those things that I love in one place and I have great expectations with every new episode. For now I'm not dissapointed at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

If you're looking for originality... this isn't the story for you, however, unoriginal doesn't mean unenjoyable.  If this was the only fault I'd easily give this a 7 or 8.\r\nThe REAL part that grated on my nerves from the very beginning was Asta... if this show had been 90-95% about Yuno and occasionally bring in Asta for comic relief we could have a decent show here.  Instead, now we have a main character who has nocharacter back story aside from being annoying and obnoxious (as the anime called it... lively... or spunky).  And this flaw is constantly reinforced by the shrill voice of the voice actor playing him, and the fact he is screaming in a supremely irritating fashion for probably 3-4 minutes (combined) of each 24 minute episode.  (I refuse to go back and time it, but the first 2 episodes felt like half the show was just his screaming)\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, the manga is better (you don't have to hear his screams constantly) but since this is a review of the Anime and not the manga, it is a moot point.",

Well... I'm sorry to say that you've come to the wrong place. This anime isn't \"horrible\" as some would put it. It's obviously not just shit out to make a quick buck. It's your classic Naruto spin-off, It'll never be as good, it will never live up to the hype. But honestly, unless you make an entirely new genre of anime out of thin air. Which mind you, is close to impossible by now. Therewill always be a comparison, there will always be people who are pissed off because of the similarities, and there will always be a group of people to try and give a reason why it's different. It's not. It's the same as any anime in its genre, just as the next hundred anime to be made will be as well. Does that mean its a bad show? No, its very simple why it doesn't actually. Because at the end of the day the same people who hate it for being the same old same old. Will hate any anime that actually changes things up. You've got a solid story, good animation, acceptable sound quality, good fight scenes, characters you'll love and characters you'll hate. And it does this well, it builds on a well maintained formula that's honestly really hard to fuck up. So don't go into this anime expecting something different, don't judge this anime for sticking to whats safe and making it work. Enjoy this anime for what it is, a good 51 episodes of an anime that'll give you something to watch, and wont make you want to blow your brains out.",

            "content": "Its a great show. it has its flaws but its just picking up the momentum. Its the story of two orphan trying to become a Wizard King (aka the baddest MF around). But they have to pass a test to be in the contender list of becoming a magic knight and climb the ladder to become the Wizard King. Its a great setup but it somehow not used to its potential.\r\nStory: I like the story because it can be stretched very far and still keep the viewers. The first the i look in a story is its flexibility. How can it be manipulated so thatit may be interesting even after putting it in another genre. Like suddenly introduce comedy in horror or romance in action. Second thing is just that if it clicks to your taste and my taste is attracted toward these kinds of shows\\n\\n\r\nArt:The art is good but not great. Its sometimes bland and its not the anime's fault. We have been spoiled by shows like Naruto which contains many flashy things apart from pain vs naruto fight. We just have to give them time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:In earlier episodes Asta's voice was too much how should i say this annoying to the point i want to tear my eardrums but now he doesn't shout at everything and it's a more mature voice which doesn't want to smash your lapto against the wall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Its been 53 episode and they have still not given importance to the other main character Yuno. It was supposed to be a battle of who becomes the wizard king first but now it looks like Asta's Chronicle and way to become Wizard king. Please this anime can get alot better if you give Asta a reason to fight to become Wizard King. The two options you have are YOUR OTHER MAIN PROTAGONIST YUNO or marrying sister Lily\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've been pretty entertained by this especially when Asta uses his anti-magic sword to save Yuno against Mars. Its got comedy,romance,superpowers etc. But its thanks to Asta because his character is made for enjoyment. He is always just charging to the scene. And the action is less but savory.Also his fight in the underground temple against midnight sun's Goons shows us how strong a team the black bulls are and how they are willing to put their lives on the line for their comrade.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:Its a good show. Nothing more, nothing less. Time will tell that how good can they make this show. And so far it has not reached its potential",

            "content": "TL;DR Bad animation, a mediocre and cliche story, and annoying voice acting from the majority of the cast create a subpar shonen anime. 3/10\r\nFirst off, at best, this anime was only ever going to be a generic, paint-by-numbers shonen. The entire story is pulled directly from the \"How to Make an Preteen's Favorite Anime\" handbook. Good news, this means it is passable. Bad news, there is nothing new, very cliched, not doing anything interesting. The pacing is also pretty atrocious. It feels like an anime that thinks from the outset that is going to have hundreds of episodes like Naruto or One Piece. The writingalso generally never gets above just okay.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is fine, not good, just fine. I don't personally think it is nice to look at but I don't think it is bad art wise. I would say that often facial expressions seem off, somehow, I can't place why it feels that way to me, they often just look slightly unnatural. The effects, like for the magic, usually look pretty good. Where I do dock it in the art department is the animation. The lack of consistency in this department is staggering. Occasionally they'll shell out for some good animation in some important episode, but usually, it feels so stilted, awkward, unnatural, and just bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is fine. It is nothing amazing. I'm sure everyone has seen people complaining about Asta's voice actor, so I'm not going to bring it up. The BGM is pretty good, voice acting is not (not just Asta).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people I have seen defending this anime have said that the character development and story is where it really shines, but I just don't see it. I will admit that the quirky characters are occasionally enjoyable if we don't see them too much, but every minute the dude with the stupid haircut and baseball magic talks, I want to die. There is so little actual character development for so long. Every character is introduced with one quirk or character trait. Every character is so one dimensional, that they literally can only grow in one way. Oh the guy with glasses is a by the books kind of dude, bet he ends up becoming friends with the brash and dimwitted lead, who bullshits his way through every situation he ever finds himself in. This girl sucks at magic and is the classic tsundere, I bet we won't have to deal with constantly hearing her internal monologue about the protagonist and how she isn't good enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I put a lot of stock into how an anime looks. If I can't stand the art and the animation, I'm not gunna watch, because I just don't find it enjoyable at all. I've dropped anime before this for having an art style that just didn't sit right with me, and this will not be the last one that I won't watch because I don't like how it looks. If you don't mind the abysmal animation quality, I guess this bog standard shonen would be an okay fit. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

In key moments of the show it's well done which saves it from the pits of anime hell, but the rest of it ranges from below average to near awful, particularly in animation.

I hope you love Asta screaming \"MAHOUTEI NI NARU!!\" or \"MADA DA!!\" because you're going to hear it. A lot. Any chance at character development for the main cast is basically rushed or skipped.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are much more developed, particularly the power players, which is what keeps you watching the show. Good back stories, some intrigue, good interaction with other supporting characters. They contribute more to the central plot than the main characters do.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\r\nHonestly it's hard to get past the main character's constant screaming. I know screaming is a common theme in action shounen anime, but this was excessive. Puts DBZ/Naruto levels of screaming to shame. The music was there, but unmemorable.",

That's why i'm giving that 10/10 Enjoyment and Overall even it's not that perfect. \r\nI had the same feeling just with Full Metal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter 2011 so i really suggest you that masterpiece.\r\nSpoiler free synapsis\r\nThe story revolvs arround Asta a \"mage\" who cannot use any kind of magiuc sohe keep training his body. He wants to become the \"wizard king\" and \"MADA MADA\" he will never surrender to anyone at any costs. He is a good guy who wants to help others so little by little from a sludge pleasant everyone will love him. And he will be stronger and stronger when awakes new powers.\\n\r\nEven he is totally stupid, \"bakasta\" is kinda smart in every fight thanks the fact every enemy missundestand a mage who cannot use any magic.\\n\\n",

However over time the show has imploded on itself. The writing quality has deteriorated and the pacing is completely off. Moments that should have been given more weight are often just whisked aside by characters immediately changing their minds. \r\nThe protagonist being the worst culprit. They gave him a sob story background but instead of giving him depth, they have made him loud, obnoxious and always happy/cheery regardless of the situation. It's completely unbelievable and makes the show cringey to watch because everytime heencounters a villain, he spews the same lines over and over in the same tone. At moments when it seems like he is finally serious and having some character development, it's immediately soured by an ill timed or stupid gag joke or response that just kills it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's gratuitous to a fault. Even with its jokes. It's like a character cannot deliver a single line without tagging a cringey punchline to the end of it. At times I felt like this was making fun of itself and other popular anime like Naruto, because of the ridiculous amount of similarities to it. In the end though, it is nothing but a hot mess of bad comedy, bad writing and a cliches done terribly wrong.",

The show really picks up 15-20 episodes in.\r\nMy biggest criticism of Black Clover is that Asta starts with no magic in a world where everyone else has magic. This could have been used to illustrate how people with disabilities can still find their place in the world by focusing on what they can do rather than what they can't, but instead hegets anti-magic as his magic. This effectively removes anything unique about the show and makes it a standard shounen jump long run series.",

But of course the filler percentage of this anime is low so it doesn't bother the watchers too much. \r\nThe animations are a so-so case to me. I have noticed good quality animations at important scenes but I also see so many animation errors and flaws on not important ones. I guess the animators are just lazy or they just don't have enough time, idk you decide the reason. \r\nThe voice acting is cool. I don't know why some people get annoyed attoo much Asta shouting. It's part of his character. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters, the character designs are not that unique. You can see Asta's resemblance to Hinata from Haikyuu. And some traits that most shonen characters have, but that is to be expected because this is a shonen anime after all. The character introductions are smooth and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime receives so many hates online, I still love the anime and I feel like I can enjoy it until the end of the series.

I started the show with the open mind, and somehow want to prove that all the claim about copying Naruto might be just an exaggerated claim from the narrow minded fans.\r\nThe first 5 episodes were ok for me, it wasn't funny at all, the characters were annoying yet  I still gave the excuse of \"not copy but just the inspiration\" \r\nThen the stories goes on an on to thepoint that I put it on hold from the boredom. Did I mentioned that I finished Shokugeki no Souma before I started this show? They were not comparable. SNS was so much fun so much entertaining compared to Black Clover.\\n\r\nAnyway, after I finished other shows (incld Attack on Titan), I picked up the story again and tried to get through with it. The more I watched the show, I more I dislike the characters especially the Black bull squad. \\n\r\nI don't think the guy with sister complex is funny. I don't think the girl who has big appetite all the time is funny. NOT FUNNY OKAY???? Can you do it better than this?\\n\r\nI don't see just Naruto on this show, but I see Attack on Titan, Bleach, FullMetal Alchemist, so and so on ON THIS SHOW!!! To the point that I'm convinced that is this a parody of all the shows? BUT it's not funny!!!\\n\r\nI don't know whose to blame? Is it a creator who is not smart enough in creating an impressive story?\\n\r\nIs it a sound director who done a really bad job at the bad time?\\n\r\nIs it a director who managed the wrong pace? Bad story pace, bad funny moment? Whose idea of repeating the fail funny moment?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story is getting better on Episode 15 and I decide to give the below scores:\\n\r\nStory: 3 (Ep 1-14)\\n\r\nStory: 6 (after ep 15 )\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n",

It draws very obvious references (not mentioned in the anime) to Naruto. There are the lead's mentors and just like Naruto there is a gang (like Akatusuki) and pretty much its thesame.

Fight scenes are fantastic, character development goes into a lot of detail, and does it rather quickly, which I enjoy; I don't like a slow anime. I first found out about this anime a few days ago (something between September 14th and 18th) and I binged all the episodes, watching all 49 (50th was released on the 18th) in justa couple days, I loved the anime so much. Sound is fantastic, art looks pretty solid too. This review is bland, because I can't give any spoilers, but just trust me that this anime is fantastic if you watch through it all. PS Please don't take away my validity because I haven't seen One Piece, Naruto, nor any of the sort.",

But for people who don't like to watch a weak character become stronger as the anime forwards like naruto then just don't. you geta  lots of people saying its like naruto or some other anime. But actually its a great anime if you keep watching it , ofcourse the protagonist is too noisy , surely teher is a similarity between naruto and this anime ,they both wanna achieve something great in thier life , but thats the part of it that makes it interesting.\r\nI guess people who make false accusations haven'teven watched the anime with more interest episode to beging with.

            "content": "I rated 5 on this, why?\r\nThe story itself is definitely a cliche and overused story like Naruto, Boku no Hero Academia, Fairy Tail and such. It is about a weak main protagonist who work hard and will never give up. Hence, he somehow gain power and became strong. I personally do not mind cliche and overused story line but it has to be executed nicely with at least some uniqueness in how the world in the story works or such. The world use magic which is actually similar to Fairy Tail but is somehow different since it uses grimoire. The character is one dimensional thoughthere will be some development in the manga, still I am not attached to any of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI actually read the manga and thought that it wasn't that bad at all. However, even though the anime follows the manga closely, the feeling that I got from the manga is different from the anime. How? The execution of the anime is outright awful. The animation sometimes are hard to watch and the soundtracks used is dreadful and doesn't give the feeling that it should for the scenes. The supposedly sad scenes doesn't make me feel sad at all, since the time given for the sad scenes to truly seep into my heart are too short and the soundtrack doesn't really give any sad feelings. Scenes that are supposed to make me feel hyped was again destroyed by weird soundtrack. Either the soundtrack are too old like old RPG game soundtrack or I am not even sure what. I am also annoyed by the main character's voice and behaviour. Somehow I don't find the main character too annoying when I read the manga, maybe I imagined it differently but the anime is far too annoying for me. Overall, it really is a cliche, overused and mediocre story and animation that you can actually still enjoy, but it was greatly ruined by the sound.",

I personally dont care if I enjoy it thats all that matters and this is the very first time that I feel that the amount of hate this anime is getting is not deserved so lets start the review. lets start with the story the story follows 2 main characters named Asta and Yunothey are both orphans abandoned at a church and Asta was born with out any magic and wants to be the wizard king and Yuno was born OP as hell it is your classic MC that gets bullied and is a outcast nothing new or original here its a 5/10 next is the characters the characters are ok but Asta voice is so annoying I know everybody says this its like beating a dead horse at this point all I am going to say is watch the English dub the voice is so much better next the only good characters in this anime are the black bulls other then that the characters are ok but all of the characters have there own personality and back story characters gets a 6/10 next is the art the art is not the best I seen but its not bad ether 6/10 last is my personally enjoyment it gets a 7/10 the final score is 6/10. Overall a very underrated anime in my opinion and I rarely every say that its not a good anime or a bad one ether but the reason why its underrated is because this anime is getting so much hate that it simply doesn't deserve at all I would just ignore most of the hate and give it a shot yourself. MAL scores dont mean anything I liked shows with a average of 6 on MAL and I hated shows that have a 8 on MAL so just try it out your yourself make your own opinion.",

It did start off quite slow but I have found that the momentum has been gradually increasing to the point where they end an episode on a mild cliffhanger. As this is a 51 episode series all I ask is for you to have abit of patience. Although I originally started watching this anime to use a time killer, I never expected that I would actually become engaged to the point where I want to know more. Overall, its a 7/10 for me.",

That's just how great it is!\r\nI don't have much else to say this early in the shows life, becauseI'm sure that my concerns will be addressed later in the series. This anime is built to last for a good while, so character and world development is slowly moving along. It kind of remind me of Naruto, One Piece and Bleach in that aspect, and this is one of the series that I want to carry on for just as long.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my point of view regarding the voice of Asta: Yes it's irritating in the begining, but grows along with the character.

This, to me, is the best way to explain one of jump\u2019s latest adaptations Black Clover. \r\nBlack Clover\u2019s overall all design is not that fascinating to me in terms of characters. It would seem that the personalities of each character play a bigger role in terms of likability than their look or even abilities. Like Naruto, the studio is choosing when to go all in on the animation and so far I do not have too many complaints in this department.\\n\r\nOne can certainly argue that Black Clover falls under the same formulaic troupes that have produced some of the most iconic anime to date. Even with that said, it manages to bring something different to the table and I believe that is where the draw to this title lies.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover follows Asta an abandoned orphan found along side Yuno his would be rival in the story. Asta lives in a world surrounded by the power of magic with dreams of becoming the wizard king, a position started by a legendary hero who saved the world from eminent ruin, there is only one problem, he has no magic abilities.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this apparent set back, a latent ability hidden within Asta unveils a powerful weapon that has the ability to negate magic turning his fate around and basically taking us on his journey to become the aforementioned wizard king.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Asta\u2019s character is probably the most unpleasant main character I\u2019ve had the experience of listening to due to his obnoxious and intentional atrocious voice acting(a first experience in my book), it is his actions and obvious ambitions that grow on you to the point you ignore it after a while. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s not only Asta that keeps my interest. Like most Jump anime\u2019s, it is the characters that surround Asta with their mysterious abilities, motivations, and more importantly, their disdain for what Asta represents that continue to pull on you as you watch further. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has not had anything that stood out to me. It doesn\u2019t to seem to give or take away from the anime in anyway though I have enjoyed the two opening songs they have offered up thus far.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Clover certainly has a long way to go but in terms of what the anime has shown to date, I have to be honest and say: so far, so good.  For all of its hang ups, there is heart in this anime which is what has me compelled to continue watching and that is what\u2019s important at the end of the day. \\n",

There's nothing special with the artwork, It's not bad on my eyes but it's not 'omg so amazing' every time I watch an episode. Although I do like the clothing style for some reason.

            "content": "i'm updated to this manga, is it bad nope, good nope, it is just really cliche and okay.The primary highlight of the manga was its art and impressive panels at times, but known for its lackluster dialogue and poor characterization. The problem with this anime straight up is the voice acting, Kajiwara, Gakuto idk if its the direction but his ability to great any depth cannot be conveyed you don't really feel like its a persons voice but voice actor doing its job. CGI, look if you wanted to see naruto at least do 2D this manga doesn't really have much besides its art ifyou butcher that then that's basically butchering this entire show. Art design actually pretty good, but what happened in the 1st minute that's like how not to introduce us to an anime legit piss poor.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an Anime has the main protagonist, to have poor voice acting it's basically immediately failed. Shounen is not known for its story because it's formulaic and already predict whats gonna happen so we focus on the characters and the journey to make up for it. When your main character for a show that's supposed to really likable is annoying how is the audience suppose to have an immersive experience? The quick answer it does not, even Toei animation one of trashiest studios nowadays understands the importance of voice acting. Beside DBS most of the voices in Toei are most part decent or good like one piece all the voice acting is ranging to good to great and some inconsistent ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe good art it has is ruined by CGI, to be fair doing Asta's face is actually kinda hard because of how it's structured. But it has some great art design with the backgrounds but it so pushed aside because of the terrible nature this show has. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt:6/10\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters 4.5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4.5/10\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI say the best thing about this show I really love hating on it, basically the SAO effect so trash that you love to talk about. P.S i wouldn't usually review a show 1 episode in but, for me it was a disgrace.\\n\\n\r\nI watch atleast the fist 6 episodes dubbed but really didn't change anything. I actually dig the manga, the positive their is that its pacing is amazing that what makes this generic stuff work, plus the art and storyboarding is well excuted well this anime the studio or shareholders did not see what actually appealed to people and do the complete oppsite. if this is seasonal it would be great as the manga at times is too fast pace, making solid 12-24 episodes seems like a smart idea, as the manga arcs r pretty quick so they can pace this well.  truly wasted potential and at times has gorgeous animation but just like naruto its deep within crap. \\n",

            "content": "I had to drop this series at about episode 8 or so. The pacing is beyond awful, with it being made alongside the manga, there is just constant filler of stuff I really don't care about. To be honest it is a shame because I'm a big Shonen fan and I like the premise behind this series, the whole different mage groupings is a concept I like, and Asta has a clear goal of what he wants to achieve (Which comes off a bit too clearly to the point of gaining a headache due to his voice). \r\nEven the battle sequences that I saw wereso painfully slow, sure other big-name series' do this too, One Piece has single battles spanning over 10 episodes, but the difference here is suspense and anticipation, cutting back and forth between multiple events all happening at the same time that makes the final moments of that battle just so rewarding to watch! Black Clover on the other hand only has one single narrative at a given time (In the start at least, which isn't surprising obviously with the little time it has had to have developed different narratives) so why does this mean they have to slow down the pacing so much, its just antagonising, I was watching just bored, waiting for the battle to end, or at least for Asta to do something OP (He has the character tropes for it so why does he have to be such a dimwitt??).\\n\\n\r\nI think this series would have benefitted greatly from a much shorter episode length, perhaps 24 to start with, not to mention a little more patience in dropping an anime adaptation (And some better voice direction).",

            "content": "Hyped as the next big thing in shounen anime by some, Black Clover is the story of Asta and Yuno, two boys who were abandoned at a church on the same day. As they grow up, the unlikely duo develop a heated rivalry and vow to best each other in their like-minded ambition to become the next Wizard King. Yuno, the clear favourite to emerge victorious, is reserved and highly competent, even having a rare and powerful Grimoire bestowed upon him when he turns 15. Asta, on the other hand, is loud and utterly inept at magic, but receives a similar blessing in the formof an even rarer \"five-leaf clover\" Grimoire. Set on their diverging paths to greatness, the adopted brothers must work their way up in the new world of magic that they find waiting for them outside of the church.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Black Clover is decent, but certainly nothing ground-breaking. The artstyle fits the medieval European flair it seems to be going for well, and lends the series a grittier, more rustic feel compared to shows of a similar vein like Fairy Tail, which is much more upbeat and colourful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs feel a bit bland and unoriginal, lacking a much-needed quality to prevent themselves from appearing too \"shounen-y.\" The leading duo of Asta and Yuno look way too similar to their counterparts in other shounen anime such as Naruto and Fairy Tail. Which is unfortunate, considering Black Clover should be doing as much as humanly possible to distinguish itself from the giants whose footprints it so stubbornly insists on following.\\n\\n\r\nExcepting the fact that there haven't been that many fights of note so far, the animation has remained solid. For a show of this length (51 episodes), it will be interesting to see if the animation eventually falls apart by the time it reaches the finish line, or if it'll manage to surprise and keep a high level of quality all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nTo keep things simple, Black Clover does not have a good protagonist. Asta is an exact clone of the typical knuckle-headed, high-energy shounen hero, with the added baggage of being obnoxiously loud and persistent. He is in no way original or likeable, and neither is Yuno, who is a straight-up copy-and-paste of the introverted, yet incredibly gifted childhood rival archetype.\\n\\n\r\nIt is too early to make any sort of decision on the rest of the cast, but one thing that was painfully evident about the Black Bulls was that their introductions and characterization were blatantly similar to those of the Fairy Tail Guild in Fairy Tail. This is another aspect of the show that feels much too similar to the shounen giants that it should be competing with. For a shounen anime so late in the game, Black Clover really should be investing its energy in shaking up the formula shounen fans have grown so accustomed to, or at least making the ride a bit more fun and unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is, so far, nothing surprising for a shounen anime. Plenty of flashbacks, high-soaring ambitions, and snippets of action are present from beginning to end, yet the major weakness in terms of narrative is not managing to get the audience behind the characters' motivations. Asta is so annoying and Yuno so guarded that it is difficult to really find yourself cheering them on or feeling their pain. The new characters that are slowly piled on may present a solution to this, however, as they are coming across more likeable and diverse than the initial two, as would some meaningful character development for Asta.\\n\\n\r\nYour own personal enjoyment of this show will come down to how willing you are to watch a standard shounen anime with not much to offer in terms of new ideas. Fans of the shows it so closely mimics, namely Naruto and Fairy Tail, may find themselves unable to take Black Clover seriously as its own separate experience, and inevitably make an unflattering comparison to the aforementioned titles.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone really pining for a more recent shounen anime may find the familiar story developments and archetypal characters comforting and satisfying in a way, but only if they are truly desperate for something so characteristically shounen. When the anime adaptation was first announced, a lot of people were calling it a \"magic-themed Naruto\" and after watching the first cour, I can confirm that this is a totally-justified claim. If that sounds like it would be right up your alley, then this show will likely be an enjoyable experience. If not, I would say it's probably going to be the complete opposite.\\n\\n\r\nTaking into account the endless screaming on Asta's part, the overreliance on tired tropes, and a general failure to bring anything new to the table, Black Clover is not something easy to recommend this early in its run. That is, unless what you are looking for is a new shounen anime to watch after having seen all of the firmly-established titles.\\n\\n\r\nIf it manages to keep up its solid animation, develop Asta and Yuno in meaningful ways, and bank on the strengths of its genre's tropes, while also changing them up and doing more to distinguish itself from its predecessors, Black Clover may end up becoming a show worth watching, but if, and only if.",

            "content": "I'll put things as simple as possible, and start with the conclusion as well for all of you that are lazy:\r\nIf you give half a shit about the animation, go read the manga. If you don't, you will find the anime to be quite enjoyable. On a side note, there aren't many fillers so far, but you should expect some more once we get to ep 90~100, since it will be catching up to the manga.\r\nNow to the actual review:\r\nStory (7~8) - It's quite standard until the plot twists starts happening. Don't expect something incredible but it's good enough for a shounen anime. Things arestarting to get pretty interesting on the manga as well, i can't say much without turning it into a spoiler. That is also the reason to why i put it as 7 or 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4) - As i already said, the animation is quite bad. There are a few fights with good animation, but most of them are awful. The first (i guess) fight that Yami took part in is really well animated, or at least enjoyable. You can pretty much drop off the anime after watching that if you just want to see cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) - I'm gonna be honest here, i don't really pay much attention to it, but i will be giving it a 6 because of Asta's constant screaming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7) - This is actually one of the few shounens that i've watched with an interesting character development early on. The author tried to develop each character from the main group and also give the secondary group some attention, while on many shounens the author doesn't even try.\\n\r\nSadly, some characters end up having a shallow background for too long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7) - I would give it an 8, maybe even a 9, if the animation wasn't such a big turn off on the most important parts of the anime. When things are getting good, you will find yourself watching a 10 frames gif that was probably made without any effort, with a few exceptions. Besides that, the anime follows the default shounen flow, with a little bit of useless parts here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6) - All things considered, it's \"fair\", if you ignore part of it. Again, you should read the manga, if you like reading mangas of course. Things are getting more and more interesting there and some fights will, probably, not be good enough to be enjoyable on the anime.",

            "content": "I feel like this show got off to a slow start, and even was honestly mediocre early on; however, the show gets better as the story progresses into a solid Shonen anime. For starters the major issue I had early on was the humor was ridiculous, and like some other shonen animes it took a while to get going. Which is understandable since these kind of shows are designed to have dozens and dozens of episodes over a planned 12-24 episode series.\r\nI digress, but Asta doesn't join the Black Bulls until episode 6, and he doesn't on his first mission until about episode 8 or9. We literally take 4-5 hours just to get on our first adventure beyond the training/intro phrase, and it wasn't paced well. That said, the first mission is okay, but nothing memorable. What really turns the series around is the Dunegon arc which isn't too long, but reintroduces Asta with his old friend and rival, Yuno. And we see multiple people form two different groups working together to overcome their challenges, and it works well. From here the show really gains momentum and becomes a solid show. Especially the Seabed Temple Arc which closes out season 1. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, and possibly others, the show takes about 13-14 episodes to turn the page into something enjoyable. The major strength of this show as it moves forward is establishing multiple characters with interesting and unique backgrounds, and they all have to come together to overcome their challenges. I also like Asta, but the show was weak only relying on him without a strong support cast in most episodes. The pacing improves, and even longer arcs are enjoyable and at a good pace.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation and sound design is good. I won't say it's groundbreaking, or the most beautiful thing I've seen, but it's smooth with some good action scenes. Some action scenes stand out better than others, but it's typical when it comes to a shonen anime. I say give this a chance, but you have to be patient to see if you like it after a good 14 episodes.",

            "content": "I personally g ive it a 5-6 but based on this scoring system it is a 3.1. Before you get me wrong I think this anime does have definite potential but it is just incredibly poorly done, I am still watching it. The anime holds up to its name of being the most generic shonen ever. Not completely boring but so predictable  \r\n(Story) it's pretty basic, completely predictable. Everything is literally a bad organization trying to collect these crystals to stop some terrible event. There is no complexity, it is literally going to one place, fight the main boss of the enemy, win, andleave for the entire show. Also the power gauging for this anime is trash. The strongest person protecting the stone literally lost instantly to a boss of the enemy organization. Everyone defending the stone was weak as hell and the monk of the crystal is willing to give it if they win the fight.\\n\r\n    You do not feel the weight of power that they are trying to do bc asta has a stupid ability. He has an overpowered anti-magic sword with inconsistent limitations. He can reflect and cut magic and his main problem is that he can't deflect large magic and way too much magic spells coming at him .... at times. One slash can literally obliterate most magic completely without spreading it or anything. But sometimes he can't destroy the whole thing, no specifications for his sword and it is inconsistently despite the quality of magic used against him. His main edge to fight isn't his physical ability that he worked so hard, no its his broken sword assisted by his physical strength that doesn't really shine that much. It does not matter how strong or how amazing the enemy is, if u have the highest quality magic he can cut it instantly, no matter how hard they train or how advanced u are. The sword should be limited to not being able to cut things completely if they are too strong and will only be able to be cut if Asta himself gets stronger. So many flaws with this anime I will not list them all.\\n\\n\r\n(Character)When you watch it you can see all of the generic tropes like its unrealistic love interest, rowdy boy, tsundere girl, Sasuke naruto rivalry, and more stuff like that. Do not get me wrong I love those types of tropes, there is a reason why it's so overused, but only if those tropes are done well. All relationships in here are unrealistic and one dimensional. \\n\r\n      For example Luck, a fight crazy boy who fights to win so his mother would love him since that is the only value she places on him cause he's crazy as well as him seeing her as his only connection. I don't think it's too bad of a backstory(despite being not complex at all) but its done so poorly for the resolution. Literally, Asta just said \"I Am yOuR FriEnd\" and suddenly luck pops into a soliloquy about him saying \"I was wrong I am not alone\"... In some context yeah it makes sense, but literally, their only interactions in the show that they had were the first time they met and that very mission they were doing, everything else was just small shit that had no emotional value. Everything Luck was living within his whole entire life was washed away from someone he barely knows that happens to be from his squad... amazing right. Regardless of the deed of saving Luck, that should at most give respect not solve a traumatic childhood. A lot of the fanboys don't realize that your friend helps u out with emotions, not a superhero that saves the day. This happened in almost every back round story. The only one done decently was Vanessa\\n\\n\r\n(Sound) You get a headache listening to the Asta screams that are suppose to be likable but really isn't. He will stop doing that after a good chunk of the anime. Other than that it's pretty normal.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment) Aside from being poorly done, it is funny at some points, a lot of fails but there are some parts I have to give it some credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I have no problem with the story, I actually think its quite good, but everything else falls flat on its face.\r\nThe art is awful, looks like a 3rd grader drew it and battle scenes havelittle to no work put into them.\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints about the sounds and music.

The jokes always fall flat and every character has a super exaggerated personality. Asta, the main character, is always screaming and says he wants to be the wizard king at least 10 times an episode.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this show at all, I watched 61 episodes hoping it would get better, but it actually just gets worse with time. You can tell the artists were struggling to hit deadlines because of the lazy animations, and about 80% of episodes are fillers. Save yourself from wasting your time on this anime and find something better.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I've seen low budget harems that were funnier/more enjoyable than this.",

            "content": "Story- 5/10\r\nThe story has drawn many comparisons to other popular series, including Naruto, My Hero Academia, Fairy Tail, and even Harry Potter. As a result, it has also drawn the ire of shonen fans. To a degree, deservedly so; some aspects are not original. They are a group of ragtag mages part of a guild- I mean shinobis- I mean wizards- er, magic knights. The protagonist, Asta, wants to become the hokage- I mean wizard king\u2026because he wants to prove to everyone how capable he is and help people\u2026or something.\r\nThere are some good things that the story does which your other typical shonen do notdo. First, this story thankfully moves faster than any of the other shonen mentioned. The \u201cZabuza\u201d arc was over in two episodes. The Chunin/Quirk Hero tournament/exam was over in two episodes. The speed at which it moves is good. It maintains it\u2019s fluidity and moves things right along, cutting out at least some of your typical shonen bullcrap. IE \u201cLet me give a speech about my powers and how awesome I am for 10 minutes before doing anything, then lets do something and talk about it afterwards for another 5 minutes. End of episode!\u201d The middle 10 episodes or so of this series does have a bit of this unfortunately. Thankfully, that was the only part that dragged. \\n\\n\r\nAnother underrated aspect is that characters other than the strong adults and protagonist actually do meaningful things to main antagonists. So two strong mages are fighting- It\u2019s going to be an epic clash between the two all the way to the finish line, right? Nah, one of the scrub minions will interfere with his unique ability, defeating the antagonist boss instead. Well, what about another, stronger antagonist boss later? One that wrecks through most of the protagonist squad without so much as a scratch? Well, the main heroine- who had done little in the series previously- wrecks him. And consider this- within the first 46 episodes of their respective series, did Sakura, Ochako, or Lucy pull off any amazing feat that comparable characters could not do? Within that time frame, did any of them do anything meaningful to an overwhelming antagonist that even the protagonist could not (initially) do?  I\u2019d wager not.\\n\\n\r\nThose two moments mentioned above weren\u2019t complete asspulls either, contrary to what you\u2019d expect. For the former, his unique ability countered the unique ability of the boss reasonably. For the latter, she was hinted at having extraordinary magic attack power but previously had not been able to utilize it properly due to her mindset.\\n\\n\r\nOf course some asspull powerups are still there (A mage in an intense situation can develop new spells). I wish shonen would be better at writing that, instead of always chalking it up as \u201cwillpower+ friendship = insta win hurr durr.\u201d The worldbuilding could be better too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile it can be inconsistent at times, the quality is never poor. At it\u2019s worst it\u2019s average, and at it\u2019s best it\u2019s pretty darn good. For a 51 episode series this is a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most redeemable aspect of the series is the sound. The dub version is great. Most of the OST is good, including the openings and endings. There is one song in particular which is particularly epic. The reason this category loses points is because the sub version of the protagonist has a really grating voice. The high-pitched, constant screaming will make your ears bleed. The dub version is mostly superior for this reason, and I heartily recommend that one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters are cutouts from your standard archetypes, and as a result, many of them are boring and uninteresting. Some of them are given backstories, such as Luck and Gauche. Yet that didn\u2019t make them any more interesting, either. They were still rather one-dimensional characters with unoriginal backstories.\\n\\n\r\nOf course there are a few hidden gems here. Noelle, the main heroine, is your typical Tsundere early on in the series and is usually relegated to protecting the wounded. But later in the series, she has a completely boss moment where she almost completely owns a strong antagonist. This antagonist had decimated every other strong fighter there- including the protagonist, Asta. It was the first demonstration of her true strength, and I look forward to seeing her in the future. She developed into a great female lead.\\n\\n\r\nIn Asta\u2019s case, he does have your typical \u201cNice guy, Loudmouth who never gives up with no talent\u201d clich\u00e9, but the unique thing about him at least is his power. He has no magic power you see, and instead must rely on his unique ability. That is, he can cancel other magic. This is actually fairly neat.  Typically while protagonists are \u201closers in life\u201d such as with Naruto and Deku and even Natsu to a degree, their skillset is also typically the same. They all summon up enormous power through sheer will and training to overpower opponents.  Their skills themselves aren\u2019t particularly unique in how they are utilized. In Black Clover\u2019s case, while Asta does have high physical abilities, he is mostly relying on the skill itself- not raw power like most other protagonists.  In this regard, I at least appreciate that aspect of Asta.\\n\\n\r\nThe other character I should talk about is Yuno. He also draws many comparisons to characters such as Sasuke and Shouto/Katsuki, and to a degree, rightfully so. Yet there are also a couple key things that set him apart. Foremost, while he is a declared \u201crival\u201d of the protagonist, the two were also very good friends their entire lives, akin to brothers even. Contrast that with Sasuke and Naruto who hated each other at first, and the uncaring, cold attitude Shouto/Katsuki share towards Deku. Also, while Yuno had natural magical talent when he was young, he was also a complete wimp and even a bit of loser. His admiration towards Asta made him change that eventually. Another contrast to the typical \u201ccool\u201d characters other shonens put forth.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the cast as a whole is hardly worth any ringing endorsements, there are a few characteristics among the main cast that can be appreciated. There are also a lot of side characters in this show, most of whom I can\u2019t remember their names but their faces are easy to recognize, so some credit is due there to I suppose.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series surprisingly offers some unique aspects that almost made it a good show overall. It\u2019s unfortunate that the negatives bring down the strong moments. Even so, it still manages to succeed on levels other popular shonen fail at.\\n\\n\r\nIt provides for some serviceable entertainment. The middle part dragged a bit and the last couple of episodes fell flat. It is still an okay show overall. Watch the dub, bask in the awesome OST and appreciate a few twists on common shonen tropes. Just try not to let other clich\u00e9s, cardboard cutout characters and a grating subtitled protagonist bother you too much. Though that might prove difficult at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 5/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+A few unique twists on common tropes, both in story and characterization\\n\r\n+Most of the story plays out quickly and fluidly\\n\r\n+Great OST\\n\r\n+Respectable Dub\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Most characters are cardboard cutouts of common archetypes\\n\r\n-Multiple clich\u00e9\u2019s in the story\\n\r\n-Protagonist\u2019s voice in subtitles is grating\\n",

            "content": "Tabata yuuki have caught my eyes first with his short series titled crazy apple. Now, he is running a manga series titled \u201cBlack Clover\u201d in shonen jump magazine. Black clover is getting pushed up and now one of the most stabile series on the magazines. It can also be thought of as Naruto replacement after the end of Naruto. It is the story of an underdog named Asta, who was born without magic live in Magical world and aiming to be the Magic Emperor. And later we found out that it is not that he is not just without magic, but he is the specialone with other power than magic (most likely a demon). Hmmm seems familiar, of course it is since it is the plot of Naruto.\\n\r\nWell the first time I read it, it was a complete mess. I just think that the author just put whatever tropes available and used in shonen manga and mix it in a pot which is Black Clover. Some tropes are : A never giving up prontagonist underdog with secret unknown power (kyuubi), who aim to be the leader of a country (Hokage narudattebayo). A bunch of misfits jumbled up together as a family within a guild (muh nakama power fairy tail).\\n\r\nThe story is about asta and how he compete with his prodigy rival Yuno. Both of them are orphan and like a brother but Yuno is the gifted one while asta is the non giving up one. They both aim to be a magic emperor that will lead the country. While everyone uses magic book to utilize their magic power, asta the one that have no magic in himself at first seems to not have a book for him even though Yuno get the special four leaf clover book for himself. But, after encountering challenge and keeps his conviction he is able to get his ultra special five clover book which provide him with anti magic sword.\\n\r\nWhile it has many tropes within it, I think that the cast is what makes the series run long enough even until now. They have their own quirks and personality which bring the series forward. Even though many of them are pretty much just anime stereotypes like tsundere love interest, a not giving a fuck boss, a lewd friend, competitive friend, weird obsessed friend, and typical flirt. It was pretty clich\u00e9 but kinda entertaining. and the further you read you will notice that they have so much similarities with Naruto on the plot that it kinda hurt if you are a Naruto fan.\\n\r\nThe special thing about this manga is about the art and the magic used. The magic type really varying and not limited to several element only. Some of them are really interesting like mirror magic, cotton magic, teleportation magic and of course the all-powerful fate altering cat magic. The action scenes are really depicted well through Tabata yuuki\u2019s art. The movement, impact, and  atmosphere in the intense fight can be really felt through reading every pages of the manga. \\n\r\nI also heard that it have anime series now, and it was kinda disappointing animation with only several golden moments and animation on the 50- episodes series. I really felt that if your wanted to experience Black Clover to its fullest you should read the manga. And I have to mention even though it is clich\u00e9 It kinda warmed up to me and one of the manga I read weekly after One Piece, My Hero Academia, Kimetsu no Yaiba, Gintama, and Haikyuu.",

            "content": "UPDATED FROM 3 TO 6\r\nStory - 6\r\nThe story is so typical it skips right to the action. You'll only find the backstory interesting if you didn't watch Naruto. It's a complete downgrade of Naruto. Atleast I can sympathize with Naruto's goals and desires. With Asta, he has no family to back his wants, his only friend is like a side character, his team has a complete lack of good character. It could have been a great anime if not for the lack of character uniqueness.\r\nUpdated from 3: Rewatched the series and somehow made it through past episode 10. I admit, the story still closelyresembles the Manga but I enjoyed it a bit more after reading the manga. The manga is pretty bland on the actions and key frame animation, and the anime actually showcases decent fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nIt's nice but not unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nNot something you would cringe upon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nComplete lack of character development. Even in the manga Asta never changed. There's just his goal to become the Mage King but never really refines his swordsmanship or study his own magic. His bestfriend does some training, but who cares about him right? He's just a side character anyway.\\n\\n\r\nUpdated from 3:\\n\r\nThe characters are still pretty bland with too much focus on Asta(without shedding a bit more light on the other side characters that could build into a more familiar atmosphere when watching the anime) but they added a bit more to Yuno's story compared to the Manga- where you can literally throw Yuno into a closet and come back after a few months and nothing's changed. Significan't improvement to thi series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI stopped when I had to go to hospital cause this show gave me cancer.\\n\\n\r\nUpdated from 4: I am now cured from my cancer given to me by this anime by watching FMA: Brotherhood. Anyway, I enjoyed this series a bit more now after recapping how horrible the Manga animation is. The story is still the same but the animation on the series is so much better compared to what's shown in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nBad anime. Bad story. Bad characters. Had a chance to be a good anime but characters are bland and uninspired. It's like they copied Naruto, completely stripped him of his strong character, and slapped him into the bland story that is Black Clover.\\n\\n\r\nUpdated from 4:\\n\r\nI still don't consider this anime as a corner stone to replace Bleach from the Shonen category (although we all know Bleach will never be adapted into anime ever again :( ) but could potentially get to that point in the future since it's an on-going series unlike seasonal anime.",

The char animation is avg.  but has the crappy story... its not it ignore every other char and focus on one or 2 char... eg take recent episode 25 it keep focus only on Asta and few other char... there is 9 different squads and its like 1 vs 1.. first one Rades thn one more after he defeated... the fight scene is so crappy. I barely able to watch anime by skipping,,,, there is no char development and and anime has 6.20min extra stuff out of 24 min  anime. thats like 17.40 sec episode its like you see one scene and episode over.  the anime is similar to nartio like he want to be wizard king... they have 3 squad like nauto team etc but its just  100x crappy thn naruto. \\n\r\nManga may be better thn anime..... the anime is total crap",

            "content": "I haven\u00b4t read the manga. When I tried I dropped it after the 4th page. \r\nBut yesterday I was bored to hell, and decided why not give it another chance.\r\nI\u00b4ll keep this review short, as I\u00b4m not up to date and can\u00b4t give and objective and accurate description of all of it. \r\nI\u00b4m on the 6th episode of the anime and since the second chapter, I already understood what the ending will be. \r\nThe series start with a really lame intro for the characters: the overactive protagonist and the serious talented one. After the first minutes I was already dreading Asta\u00b4s voice. And even Yuno\u00b4s.This anime tries really hard to let us see Asta\u00b4s hardships and how easy everything is for Yuno. It makes it to the point is disgusting to keep watching. \\n\r\nIn the fight with the exiled, where Asta finally happens to show a little bit of magic, I understood why there is so much contrast between the pair. \\n\\n\r\nAsta\u00b4s always worked hard to prove himself to everyone. But fails anyways, even tho he tries to keep a positive mindset. \\n\r\nYuno in the other hand, doesn\u00b4t need to prove himself to anyone. Is almost stated by the characters around them that he\u00b4s \"PERFECT~\".\\n\\n\r\nBut if you put attention to the part where Asta is about to give up, trying to finally acept what he can\u00b4t do...Yuno gives some encouraging words that makes him bring a demonic grimoir. \\n\r\nOnly then Asta has power to defeat their opponent and the story continues. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u00b4m trying to say is: Asta\u00b4s showed that given enough pressure from someone in a difficult situation he might give in. Given the demonic grimoir he has, the only thing that popped to my mind when I saw the fight between the Magic King and the demon, was that the Magic King was hurt because of the fight. Because they were friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries real hard to make you forget about that scene as fast as it can with the usual shonen anime troopes for the first episodes. Not variating a single bit from anything you could have already saw in other mangas. \\n\\n\r\nBasically this manga is trying to sell us a cheap story of trascending your rivals and your problems to prove people you\u00b4re worthy of respect. But don\u00b4t be fooled. Because that\u00b4s not the main objective of this. \\n\r\nLife isn\u00b4t pretty enough to give you so many chances to get above yourself, as shounen anime makes it look. \\n\r\nThat\u00b4s been stated from the first second. \\n\r\nSo now, the only reason I keep watching this clich\u00e9, is because I NEED to see a shonen anime where the overactive protagonist gives in to the hatred and becomes desesperation himself. Even turning into a demon. While leaving his rival, his friend, the sword to kill him and be the actual hero. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, for me it\u00b4s a 4/10. I dare a 6/10 if it actually ended this way.",

Still cringe most of the time but once you just accept that as part of the anime you will catch yourself watching it as a guilty pleasure. Looking forward to how it unfolds.\r\nStory 6: It is really hard to be creative in a genre that has multiple masterpieces; Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, Bleach.. the list goes on. So you would only watch it for the reason you love shounen.\r\nArt 10: Look, I amone to never judge art so this is an automatic 10. As long as the story is good I could get with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: Pretty bland answer.. it is good.. tell me where it's bad\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5: Typical roles with the character. Not that I am complaining, it comes with the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: Total guilty pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: The means of the other scores put together comes out to this.

            "content": "FIRST IMPRESSIONS!\r\nI wanted to make sure that everybody knows I'm doing this review really soon, and I barely know anything about this anime. I just know the protagonists, but I'll definitely do another review when I get to episode 10. \r\nStory (8): The story is the biggest salvation of this series. I found it interesting, even though it's not exactly original or uncommon. Basically, Yuno and Asta (they have girls names but they are boys) are orphans founded by a priest (is unknown if they are brothers or not, at least until now). Yuno is really powerful when it comes to magic power and ihas an interesting pendant wich I'm really curious to know more about, but Asta has no powers at all (and no interesting pendant). (spoilers from now on) But Asta wanted to become the Magician King, and he though he would be able to use magic when he gained a grimoire. Well, he didn't, and it looks like that's pretty impressive. But then, while saving Yuno and his 4 leaves grimoire, he magically gained a 5 LEAVES grimoire wich cames from nowhere. And I though the author lost his chance there, because the fifth leave should mean \"power\". If it did, it would make sense why Asta had no powers at all, because all of his powers would be at the grimoire, but no, because the fifth leave had a \"demon\". And I want to understand that too. \\n\\n\r\nArt (5):\\n\r\nAnimation is terrible and I didn't like the art at all. It has it's moment, but they are few. I think Yuno should be handsome, but I don't agree with that at all. Not just that, but every time they're distant it's notable that they're faces get messed. Actually, faces get messed every time. I think the art must be beautiful if you compare with an anime from 10 years ago, but actually the art is just mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5): I didn't hate Asta's voice actor at all. Actually, I pity him very much. Even though he has a good voice they told him to keep screaming in a character that would destroy the career of any voice actor that would try. I think he will never be able to get another job again, and it's not even his fault. When Asta isn't screaming, I like his voice. Oh, but of course, ASTA SCREAMS ALL THE TIME! I can even see it: He just did one supporting character in his career, then the director show's up and ask \"want to be the voice of the main character?\" and he said \"really!?\", then the director told him to scream and the poor kid doesn't even know this is the last series he's going to have the (un)pleasure to do. They chose him because none good voice actor would accept doing such a character. I though it was interesting at fist, seeing a character with such a crazy mania, but it's really annoying the way he extends all the last vowels. Nobody does that! I usually don't pay attention to the music background unless I see an exciting scene or the music just don't match the situation at all. Then, since none of this happened, I think the music background was fine.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5):\\n\r\nI don't think they are interesting at all. Specially Yuno. I liked him when he was a child, but after that he just have his power. \"I can't be kind with Asta anymore\", man! That doesn't make any sense! It's because his your \"rival\"? You can't be kind with your rival even though you are friends as well? What the hell it's going on? Seriously, I think this series should have a bit more of drama, because it would fit so well! If I was in Asta's shoes I would have cried at least once, because everybody's saying he's a piece of shit and he's always being humiliated, thats so terrible! I think I would have liked Asta more if he had showed more human fellings, because he would always just act with determination even though the entire city was laughing at him. I didn't had the chance to cheer for him, because he didn't need my cheering. This anime just lose all it's chances to make something good. The other characters are just predictable and have nothing interesting about them, just like they are robots. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4):\\n\r\nIt's decent. At least, the site said \"4\" means decent, so I think it's fine. And it's true, if it wasn't decent I wouldn't be able to keep watching. The only thing that keeps me watching it's the hope that this series can become something good, who knows? \\n\\n\r\nDirection (1):\\n\r\nI really think \"direction\" should be rated when we're talking about animes, and this anime's direction is shit. Like I said, he lost all his chances to make this series good. I'm always confused when the episode begin with some flashback that came from nowhere, and when they talked about the first Magic King wich killed the demon I though that flashback was really bothersome. The king didn't looked like he was tired of the fight or did any sound, it was strange! And that demon was so weird! This director is terrible, I'm telling you. I searched his previous jobs and I even though \"what? I liked this anime\", and then I saw he just did 1 episode of each one of them. And, even so, it wasn't animes that I loved. I didn't know any of the animes he directed from the beginning to the end. Actually, I don't know if the director is bad, but he did a very bad job at Black Clover. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5):\\n\r\n8+5+5+5+4+1/6=4,6666..., but I call it a \"5\". Could have been a lot better.\\n\\n",

I don't know if the creators got it over their head after some good episodes. Really I am feeling bad for watching this show. The show had potential, it all went to drain very abruptly. I apologize to those I have recommended this show. The MC was annoying though I didn't feel that much since I started watching after dropping boruto(Most annoying letdown to its prequel). I saw some good plot(common though) in the beginning with good pace and characters butcharacters ought to develop as the series progress but it didn't. Blunders along with low quality hype-situations brought this anime to an all time low. An anime fan would surely find out the inability of the creator with 3-4 episodes.",
