            "content": "Let's cut the chase, and go to what really matters:\r\nStory: one of the most curious plot I've seen in my anime watching life. A rock headed realist with the power to select the new ruler of Hell. A meatheaded demon and his companions/rivals wanting to be selected as the new ruler of Hell. A Victorian England set. Angels in the middle of it. Wait...what? That was my first good impression, the setting was good, the time was good (personal opinion, I love the Ol' England times) and, well, I didn't got disappointed. The plot was amazing, even though sometimes it was quite slow-paced (again, personalopinion, I could live without some \"filler-esque\" episodes). The episodes were hilarious, or dramatic, but even so they didn't fled the main theme of it, the Hellking must be chosen, and a certain human needs to do it. Amazing, but I can't give full points because I hate slow paced animes, and this was a case of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: sometimes the show budget is godlike, and the art sucks, sometimes the budget is low, veeery low, and the art is crazily good. This time, I can say, the budget is low, and the art sucks. Repeated scenes! At this time and day! Nothing leaves such a bad impression as the art, and it was terrible. The opening and ending art were good, maybe that's what lifted up the rating, because I was willing to give it a 4. Nothing more to say, watch it and take your own conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I already told my opinion about the OP and ED arts, let's talk about music. The songs were great. For me, the anime sound is quite hard to give it an opinion, since I'm not someone that keeps listening to the insert songs. But the sound is something that can raise a good anime to a higher class, and that is what I think that happened here. The art sucks, ok, I said it, but the sound was very good, well done and it fit the \"classic Victorian theme\" of the anime and the dramatic scenes got awesome insert songs. Good, good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: that is were the show gets it done. An anime that is not comedy per se, but something in the middle of drama, action and comedy made me laugh it out loud a lot of times. The devils x realist relationship was awesomely  well done, and the secondary characters were captivating. Specially the big guys of Hell. The plot was unique, and the protagonists and their counterparts were unique as well. Nothing could get any better (though I really wanted to see God, what a pity), and for that, 10 for you William and Dantalion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't know what to say here except that I liked it, the plot was unique, the setting was unique (have I told you guys that I love the Victorian theme?), the art was the bad part, but the characters compensate this loss with their awesomeness. Good, that is what I say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend it, with one advice. If you, like me, takes art into A LOT of consideration while picking a show, please, give it a try, it is a good show and it was quite the surprise of the season for me. But be warned, the art sucks. Hope you all like it. See you.",

            "content": "Makai Ouji is definitely something you would probably on first impression be like: This is so unoriginal, the story is boring, why would anyone make this.\r\nBut once you actually finish the first episode, you become enticed and deeply connected with the whole story and it's characters, honestly worth your time.\r\nStory: The story is great. It's action packed with jocular/jovial relief. The story centers around a young high-school teenage boy named William Twinning, and the setting is around the same as Black Butler, I would say. William turns out to be the descendant of the great demon tamer Solomon, and William is now forced to balanceout his regular life, of realism, while demons begin to meddle in his life and bring out this \"nonsense of heaven and hell\" as William is supposed to choose one of the demons to continuously serve him as they rule Hell together.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simply beautiful. There's meticulous detail in every scene, and each character is specially designed to match their personality. The colours are all varied and vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is in great quality (of course, this varies with your video server). The voices match the characters perfectly. You can tell that the voice actors didn't slack off in voicing their characters, as everything was very synced, and the sound effects and fight scenes were very well captivated. Also, the OP & ED sountracks were great, in my opinion, and they matched quite well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned, the characters are all specially created for a large purpose of the series. They are all different and creative. There's also a character that meets every mood, from being stuck up, to jocular, to stubborn, to jovial. The characters really fulfill in elaborating the plot, and they tend to attach to the viewers, leading up to SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS ;~;...I mean, the characters are lovely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I found this anime extremely enjoyable, I was frantically awaiting a new release every Sunday. This anime will guarantee to make you laugh..and sometimes even cry, if you're the sentimental type (cough), but there's no doubt that if you've liked what you've read/heard about Makai Ouji so far, you'll enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Characters, art, unique plot, sound, story, comedy, FEEEEELLLSSS\\n\r\nCons: A bit too many fillers/straying away from the plot at times, could have more action in fight scenes, a bit rushed due to only one season",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this anime. Unfortunately after sitting through 12 episodes all I could think about was how it was a complete waste of my time. I haven't read the manga myself so what ever that I say in this review I say it for the anime only. \r\nBasically the entire show was a flatline, nothing special and nothing particularly interesting. At the beginning it shows some promise by leaving a few mysteries here and there which is why I actually stuck with it for 12 episodes, only to find a wall at the end of the tunnel. The story revolves around maincharacter William Twinning who comes from a wealthy family and possesses extraordinary intelligence. He is also supposedly a hardcore realist, so hardcore that he still claims to not believe in anything other than science even after just being slapped in the face by a demon. Despite being a realist, William is constantly surrounded by demons who are all desperately fighting for his attention because he is a descendant of King Solomon, who has the power to elect the next ruler of hell. This part of the story was what originally attracted me to watch this show, I was pining for a good plot with a dark philosophical undertone somewhat like pandora hearts and kuroshitsuji (mind you, the manga not the anime). However all that it turns out was Solomon pimping out demons all the way back in the biblical times and William Twinning being a little twat and using everyone around him to further his academic career. The demon and non-demon characters are all pretty one dimensional and predictable. And if you're hoping for some BL in this anime I regret to inform you that you will be greatly disappointed. All in all, the story is weak with no character development and doesn't really go anywhere beyond flashbacks of Solomon the king pimp and demons fighting over the throne in hell. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, I draw a complete blank when I think about how the soundtrack added on to the anime so it really wasn't anything memorable. The art was to say the very least horrifying. Maybe because I had high expectations going in to this anime but the art consisted of all the wrong colors on the palatte that made the anime look cheap and the amateurish. The absolute worst part for me is probably the action scenes. If you are an action fan I suggest that you don't touch this anime even with a ten foot pole. It was all wrong, just thinking about the action scenes gives me second hand embarrassment. You can really tell that there wasn't much going for this anime financially from its production, but they also failed to make up for it in the writing department.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 1 on my own list but a 2 here because I don't want to completely trash a series before reading the manga. I'm still going to give the manga a try because I've learned that you should never judge a manga-based series from only watching the anime. However if you're thinking about giving this series a shot I highly suggest that you skip straight to the manga. Don't waste your time with this anime that has no enjoyment value.",

The sounds are perfect to me and the opening/ending theme are of my taste. \r\nBUT, at some points of the anime, I find the NOSES of the character drawings very disturbing. Itis obvious in episode 1 and the opening song. But as the anime goes on, the art gets real better! Horray!\\n\\n\r\nI've just finished the last episode of Makai Ouji today and the ending seems to \"rushed\" and it will definitely give you a feeling of wanting a Season 2 of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime with a good plot, great art and sound effects!

Never having read the manga, nor being a religious expert, the idea was pretty interesting, yet unoriginal. I have to say though overall the art is stellar; you can tell it deteriorated at points, but generally it was fine. It's plot line might be sub-par, but it was still enticing. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat for the next one, and every episode had a good mix of comedy and serious content (Thought the filler episodeswere a bit much.) I feel like some of the slow filler time could have been spent on the ending, but I guess without the filler the audience would have gotten less backstory on the side characters, and also the mandatory anime clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pretty catchy, and definitely fits the storyline, but I wouldn't call it amazing. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that it's easy to get irritated with William Twinning, yet I suppose that's how he's supposed to be. The hilarious personalities of the demons made up for it though.\\n\\n\r\n I'd recommend it because it's a light and quick anime. However, I would easily say that it doesn't need a second season;there is enough plotline to make a spinoff/sequel though. Those who might enjoy Devils and Realist probably enjoyed Kuroshitsuji, or other supernaturalesque or man and servant type  animes.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. It is noted, that while I didn't read it, I guess for those who decide to read the manga first be prepared to get some adaption changes, because that's something a lot people were having meltdowns about.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso a sidenote, it should be known to prospective  watchers there's also a ridiculous amount of unneccessary cross dressers if that bothers you.

            "content": "Makai Ouji had a really interesting story idea but I wish it was executed in a different manner. \r\nBefore I even watched the anime, I already knew that this story would have lots of scenes that border the shounen-ai genre so I wasn't surprised. Demons and angels aren't unique idea but this one had potential and they crushed it by focusing more on fan service in my opinion. There are a lot of episodes that seem pointless and the pacing needed to be a little bit faster because it gets pretty boring at times. If you wanted an action-pack mystery anime with sprinkles of friendshipat the side, this is definitely not the one. It's more of a friendship anime with sprinkles of action at the side. The first and last episode was the best ones in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI heard people saying the manga was better so I started reading the manga and I can agree that it is better!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good! They do tend to repeat frames a lot (especially in the last episode. I had to restart watching it beside I cried out of laughter about it.) but I don't mind. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very character-focused and I think they did a fair job on delivering. The character designs were pretty but if you're one of those people who think boys should look masculine then you should stay away from this one. Still, appearances aside, the characters did feel flat. The only ones that really interested me was Uriel, Dantalian, Solomon and Camio. I already had tasted a good amount of tsundere characters and I'm not the fondest of them so I wasn't the most interested in WIlliam, the show's protagonist. I felt like William didn't really develop as a character within those 12 episodes until the last few minutes of the last episode so that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was pretty alright. It's not one that you can be obsessed with for a long haul. If you like animes with pretty boys who care about each other then man, you will love this.",

            "content": "This review has no spoilers. \r\nFirst off, I would like to say that despite the fact that I never read the manga, I would suggest everyone read it rather than watch this anime. The adaptation is horrible, and through forum posts, I have learned that some major story segments have been cut out. \r\nThe story is bland. Simply bland. Its plot is somewhat stagnant, with very few things to keep the watcher hooked in. Each episode has its own rising action, climax, falling action, and epilogue as if each individual episode was a season of the anime... though only 23 minutes long. It might begood to watch this as a chill, non-committed anime or as an unstressful anime to watch when you are sick. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty dreadful. Yeah, Sytry and Isaac are adorable, William and Dantallion are hot, but not really? The art shifts around a lot, making the impression of a character change dynamically. You can see it in Dantallion's frame in the OP, as well as his first appearance in the ending theme. The impression of Dantallion's art changes too much. \\n\r\nOn a sidenote, the anime is always in 480p, which can be infuriating for people on computers, TV, and HD smartphones. It results in fuzzier details, which just makes the anime look less sharp and appealing. If you are watching this on an older smartphone that has only a 480p display, you should be fine.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really to say about the music. Neither the opening nor the ending music bring anything to the anime. The soundtrack is okay, but again adds nothing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is in shambles, which each character sticking to one idea. William's is realism and the quest for school tuition, and this doesn't change one bit, until the last five minutes of the anime. Really pathetic. \\n\r\nKevin, Dantallion, Sytry, Camio, and the rest of the unimportant characters don't have much personality. \\n\\n\r\nThough I wouldn't say I hate the anime. I did enjoy it, simply because it had some Shounen Ai themes and some of the jokes. To anyone else though, these jokes are kinda lame. I'm easily entertained though. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 4/10. Don't bother with this. Find a better anime to watch. Read the manga if you really are interested.",

Some scenes were rushed and I felt like they were just goofing off from the main plot line.\r\nLast episode gave me the chills but that ending was a bit meh. Too many questions left unanswered, the anime has a lot of potential but it just feels rushed. The story progression was slow from the previous episodes, they just rushed everything for the last episode.\r\nI haven't read the manga yet and just watched the anime, But whatI could say was the episodes were enjoyable and they made me laugh and smile. I really liked the characters but there were some scenes that just made me cringe but it's manageable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this anime for those people who would watch for enjoyment and for those who are not expecting too much focusing on the main goal of the story.",

            "content": "This show is pretty average.\r\nThe protagonist is entertaining and can be funny at times, however the rest of the cast is pretty generic. The cast is very pretty-boy centric, and the show in general is obviously aimed at female viewers. However there are a handful of not-terrible female characters also, which is nice.\r\nThe setting is a bit unusual for a Japanese cartoon, being set in a (I'm guessing) 19th century English boarding school. It actually seems as though a bit of research was put into the setting too, which is nice. I think that they also tried to give the supernatural things a bit ofa history, although they lost me on that one.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that annoyed me a little was the gag episode that was towards the end of the season. I don't have anything against light hearted episodes in general, but this one just wasn't funny. It also ruined the setting for me, having the students partake in a Japanese-style festival. It would maybe be okay as a DVD extra, but it ruined the flow of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is average, although I always enjoy it when the voice actors sing the opening and ending themes. I can't really judge the voice acting itself, but it seemed okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the show is clean and you can clearly tell characters apart, but there's nothing particularly exciting about the art. The (few) battles in the show are quite choppy, and there's definitely a lot of repeated footage going on, especially in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst this show is technically bland, I still found it enjoyable enough to watch through and I'll probably remember it for a little while. I wouldn't tell you not to watch it, but I wouldn't put it at the top of your list either.",

This series follows William Twining a descendant of King Solomon and has the ability to choose the next demon king while Lucifer is in deep slumber. King Solomon was chosen by God to be able to rule over demons and even angels. King Solomon choose to be with demons turning his back on god and the angels. King Solomon thought the way to feel something is by committing sin this is why he made contracts with demons of hell and created hisgreat pillars. King Solomon was killed due to his lust for sinning and his lust for the demons. Thousands of years later William Twining is pronounced the descendant of King Solomon and must choose who will become the demon king. I really thought this series had a interesting story and really good actions scenes to go a long with it. I thought it was very balanced in story and action just thought it fell a bit short. It wasn't something that really sucked me in I was interested just nothing more then that. If you like a more supernatural type anime you might enjoy this anime it is just out of my genre of watching still none the less a pretty good series.",

            "content": "Let's cut the chase, and go to what really matters:\r\nStory: one of the most curious plot I've seen in my anime watching life. A rock headed realist with the power to select the new ruler of Hell. A meatheaded demon and his companions/rivals wanting to be selected as the new ruler of Hell. A Victorian England set. Angels in the middle of it. Wait...what? That was my first good impression, the setting was good, the time was good (personal opinion, I love the Ol' England times) and, well, I didn't got disappointed. The plot was amazing, even though sometimes it was quite slow-paced (again, personalopinion, I could live without some \"filler-esque\" episodes). The episodes were hilarious, or dramatic, but even so they didn't fled the main theme of it, the Hellking must be chosen, and a certain human needs to do it. Amazing, but I can't give full points because I hate slow paced animes, and this was a case of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: sometimes the show budget is godlike, and the art sucks, sometimes the budget is low, veeery low, and the art is crazily good. This time, I can say, the budget is low, and the art sucks. Repeated scenes! At this time and day! Nothing leaves such a bad impression as the art, and it was terrible. The opening and ending art were good, maybe that's what lifted up the rating, because I was willing to give it a 4. Nothing more to say, watch it and take your own conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I already told my opinion about the OP and ED arts, let's talk about music. The songs were great. For me, the anime sound is quite hard to give it an opinion, since I'm not someone that keeps listening to the insert songs. But the sound is something that can raise a good anime to a higher class, and that is what I think that happened here. The art sucks, ok, I said it, but the sound was very good, well done and it fit the \"classic Victorian theme\" of the anime and the dramatic scenes got awesome insert songs. Good, good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: that is were the show gets it done. An anime that is not comedy per se, but something in the middle of drama, action and comedy made me laugh it out loud a lot of times. The devils x realist relationship was awesomely  well done, and the secondary characters were captivating. Specially the big guys of Hell. The plot was unique, and the protagonists and their counterparts were unique as well. Nothing could get any better (though I really wanted to see God, what a pity), and for that, 10 for you William and Dantalion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't know what to say here except that I liked it, the plot was unique, the setting was unique (have I told you guys that I love the Victorian theme?), the art was the bad part, but the characters compensate this loss with their awesomeness. Good, that is what I say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend it, with one advice. If you, like me, takes art into A LOT of consideration while picking a show, please, give it a try, it is a good show and it was quite the surprise of the season for me. But be warned, the art sucks. Hope you all like it. See you.",

It's action packed with jocular/jovial relief. The story centers around a young high-school teenage boy named William Twinning, and the setting is around the same as Black Butler, I would say. William turns out to be the descendant of the great demon tamer Solomon, and William is now forced to balanceout his regular life, of realism, while demons begin to meddle in his life and bring out this \"nonsense of heaven and hell\" as William is supposed to choose one of the demons to continuously serve him as they rule Hell together.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simply beautiful. There's meticulous detail in every scene, and each character is specially designed to match their personality. The colours are all varied and vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is in great quality (of course, this varies with your video server). The voices match the characters perfectly. You can tell that the voice actors didn't slack off in voicing their characters, as everything was very synced, and the sound effects and fight scenes were very well captivated. Also, the OP & ED sountracks were great, in my opinion, and they matched quite well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned, the characters are all specially created for a large purpose of the series. They are all different and creative. There's also a character that meets every mood, from being stuck up, to jocular, to stubborn, to jovial. The characters really fulfill in elaborating the plot, and they tend to attach to the viewers, leading up to SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS ;~;...I mean, the characters are lovely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I found this anime extremely enjoyable, I was frantically awaiting a new release every Sunday. This anime will guarantee to make you laugh..and sometimes even cry, if you're the sentimental type (cough), but there's no doubt that if you've liked what you've read/heard about Makai Ouji so far, you'll enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nPros: Characters, art, unique plot, sound, story, comedy, FEEEEELLLSSS\\n\r\nCons: A bit too many fillers/straying away from the plot at times, could have more action in fight scenes, a bit rushed due to only one season",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this anime. Unfortunately after sitting through 12 episodes all I could think about was how it was a complete waste of my time. I haven't read the manga myself so what ever that I say in this review I say it for the anime only. \r\nBasically the entire show was a flatline, nothing special and nothing particularly interesting. At the beginning it shows some promise by leaving a few mysteries here and there which is why I actually stuck with it for 12 episodes, only to find a wall at the end of the tunnel. The story revolves around maincharacter William Twinning who comes from a wealthy family and possesses extraordinary intelligence. He is also supposedly a hardcore realist, so hardcore that he still claims to not believe in anything other than science even after just being slapped in the face by a demon. Despite being a realist, William is constantly surrounded by demons who are all desperately fighting for his attention because he is a descendant of King Solomon, who has the power to elect the next ruler of hell. This part of the story was what originally attracted me to watch this show, I was pining for a good plot with a dark philosophical undertone somewhat like pandora hearts and kuroshitsuji (mind you, the manga not the anime). However all that it turns out was Solomon pimping out demons all the way back in the biblical times and William Twinning being a little twat and using everyone around him to further his academic career. The demon and non-demon characters are all pretty one dimensional and predictable. And if you're hoping for some BL in this anime I regret to inform you that you will be greatly disappointed. All in all, the story is weak with no character development and doesn't really go anywhere beyond flashbacks of Solomon the king pimp and demons fighting over the throne in hell. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special, I draw a complete blank when I think about how the soundtrack added on to the anime so it really wasn't anything memorable. The art was to say the very least horrifying. Maybe because I had high expectations going in to this anime but the art consisted of all the wrong colors on the palatte that made the anime look cheap and the amateurish. The absolute worst part for me is probably the action scenes. If you are an action fan I suggest that you don't touch this anime even with a ten foot pole. It was all wrong, just thinking about the action scenes gives me second hand embarrassment. You can really tell that there wasn't much going for this anime financially from its production, but they also failed to make up for it in the writing department.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 1 on my own list but a 2 here because I don't want to completely trash a series before reading the manga. I'm still going to give the manga a try because I've learned that you should never judge a manga-based series from only watching the anime. However if you're thinking about giving this series a shot I highly suggest that you skip straight to the manga. Don't waste your time with this anime that has no enjoyment value.",

But hey, it's a goodie for girls, especially those who're into BL. \r\nFrom my perspective, it is a really great anime; a somewhat complicated plot, handsome anime guys and shounen-ai-ish supplement which a fujoshi like me will highly appreciate.\r\nThe characters there are fairly interesting in each of their ways. The sounds are perfect to me and the opening/ending theme are of my taste. \r\nBUT, at some points of the anime, I find the NOSES of the character drawings very disturbing. Itis obvious in episode 1 and the opening song. But as the anime goes on, the art gets real better! Horray!\\n\\n\r\nI've just finished the last episode of Makai Ouji today and the ending seems to \"rushed\" and it will definitely give you a feeling of wanting a Season 2 of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime with a good plot, great art and sound effects! So, I rated an 8 for it and it well deserved it. =)",

Never having read the manga, nor being a religious expert, the idea was pretty interesting, yet unoriginal. I have to say though overall the art is stellar; you can tell it deteriorated at points, but generally it was fine. It's plot line might be sub-par, but it was still enticing. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat for the next one, and every episode had a good mix of comedy and serious content (Thought the filler episodeswere a bit much.) I feel like some of the slow filler time could have been spent on the ending, but I guess without the filler the audience would have gotten less backstory on the side characters, and also the mandatory anime clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pretty catchy, and definitely fits the storyline, but I wouldn't call it amazing. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that it's easy to get irritated with William Twinning, yet I suppose that's how he's supposed to be. The hilarious personalities of the demons made up for it though.\\n\\n\r\n I'd recommend it because it's a light and quick anime. However, I would easily say that it doesn't need a second season;there is enough plotline to make a spinoff/sequel though. Those who might enjoy Devils and Realist probably enjoyed Kuroshitsuji, or other supernaturalesque or man and servant type  animes.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. It is noted, that while I didn't read it, I guess for those who decide to read the manga first be prepared to get some adaption changes, because that's something a lot people were having meltdowns about.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso a sidenote, it should be known to prospective  watchers there's also a ridiculous amount of unneccessary cross dressers if that bothers you.

Demons and angels aren't unique idea but this one had potential and they crushed it by focusing more on fan service in my opinion. There are a lot of episodes that seem pointless and the pacing needed to be a little bit faster because it gets pretty boring at times. If you wanted an action-pack mystery anime with sprinkles of friendshipat the side, this is definitely not the one. It's more of a friendship anime with sprinkles of action at the side. The first and last episode was the best ones in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI heard people saying the manga was better so I started reading the manga and I can agree that it is better!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good! They do tend to repeat frames a lot (especially in the last episode. I had to restart watching it beside I cried out of laughter about it.) but I don't mind. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very character-focused and I think they did a fair job on delivering. The character designs were pretty but if you're one of those people who think boys should look masculine then you should stay away from this one. Still, appearances aside, the characters did feel flat. The only ones that really interested me was Uriel, Dantalian, Solomon and Camio. I already had tasted a good amount of tsundere characters and I'm not the fondest of them so I wasn't the most interested in WIlliam, the show's protagonist. I felt like William didn't really develop as a character within those 12 episodes until the last few minutes of the last episode so that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was pretty alright. It's not one that you can be obsessed with for a long haul. If you like animes with pretty boys who care about each other then man, you will love this.",

            "content": "This review has no spoilers. \r\nFirst off, I would like to say that despite the fact that I never read the manga, I would suggest everyone read it rather than watch this anime. The adaptation is horrible, and through forum posts, I have learned that some major story segments have been cut out. \r\nThe story is bland. Simply bland. Its plot is somewhat stagnant, with very few things to keep the watcher hooked in. Each episode has its own rising action, climax, falling action, and epilogue as if each individual episode was a season of the anime... though only 23 minutes long. It might begood to watch this as a chill, non-committed anime or as an unstressful anime to watch when you are sick. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty dreadful. Yeah, Sytry and Isaac are adorable, William and Dantallion are hot, but not really? The art shifts around a lot, making the impression of a character change dynamically. You can see it in Dantallion's frame in the OP, as well as his first appearance in the ending theme. The impression of Dantallion's art changes too much. \\n\r\nOn a sidenote, the anime is always in 480p, which can be infuriating for people on computers, TV, and HD smartphones. It results in fuzzier details, which just makes the anime look less sharp and appealing. If you are watching this on an older smartphone that has only a 480p display, you should be fine.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really to say about the music. Neither the opening nor the ending music bring anything to the anime. The soundtrack is okay, but again adds nothing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is in shambles, which each character sticking to one idea. William's is realism and the quest for school tuition, and this doesn't change one bit, until the last five minutes of the anime. Really pathetic. \\n\r\nKevin, Dantallion, Sytry, Camio, and the rest of the unimportant characters don't have much personality. \\n\\n\r\nThough I wouldn't say I hate the anime. I did enjoy it, simply because it had some Shounen Ai themes and some of the jokes. To anyone else though, these jokes are kinda lame. I'm easily entertained though. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 4/10. Don't bother with this. Find a better anime to watch. Read the manga if you really are interested.",

The cast is very pretty-boy centric, and the show in general is obviously aimed at female viewers. However there are a handful of not-terrible female characters also, which is nice.\r\nThe setting is a bit unusual for a Japanese cartoon, being set in a (I'm guessing) 19th century English boarding school. It actually seems as though a bit of research was put into the setting too, which is nice. I think that they also tried to give the supernatural things a bit ofa history, although they lost me on that one.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that annoyed me a little was the gag episode that was towards the end of the season. I don't have anything against light hearted episodes in general, but this one just wasn't funny. It also ruined the setting for me, having the students partake in a Japanese-style festival. It would maybe be okay as a DVD extra, but it ruined the flow of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is average, although I always enjoy it when the voice actors sing the opening and ending themes. I can't really judge the voice acting itself, but it seemed okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the show is clean and you can clearly tell characters apart, but there's nothing particularly exciting about the art. The (few) battles in the show are quite choppy, and there's definitely a lot of repeated footage going on, especially in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst this show is technically bland, I still found it enjoyable enough to watch through and I'll probably remember it for a little while. I wouldn't tell you not to watch it, but I wouldn't put it at the top of your list either.",

            "content": "This series is a very interesting one didn't know how I felt getting into it but it turned out to be pretty good. This series follows William Twining a descendant of King Solomon and has the ability to choose the next demon king while Lucifer is in deep slumber. King Solomon was chosen by God to be able to rule over demons and even angels. King Solomon choose to be with demons turning his back on god and the angels. King Solomon thought the way to feel something is by committing sin this is why he made contracts with demons of hell and created hisgreat pillars. King Solomon was killed due to his lust for sinning and his lust for the demons. Thousands of years later William Twining is pronounced the descendant of King Solomon and must choose who will become the demon king. I really thought this series had a interesting story and really good actions scenes to go a long with it. I thought it was very balanced in story and action just thought it fell a bit short. It wasn't something that really sucked me in I was interested just nothing more then that. If you like a more supernatural type anime you might enjoy this anime it is just out of my genre of watching still none the less a pretty good series.",

Did I see YAOI based anything in this anime? No, because a person who would know the difference between a good relationship between a male and another would know that it is NOT. \r\nI enjoyed it a lot but it was very slow for me and like many other viewers found that this anime was INDEED rushed. The ending is left open. This was something that I would wait if there was a SECOND season but I wouldn'tbe disappointed if there wasn't. \\n\r\nGood watch.",

            "content": "I thought it was generic anime because it wasn't outstanding or anything like that. I thought it was a bit unique, I did enjoy the art, and the characters themselves but the plot was a bit lacking. Possible if it was longer then just maybe I might have given it higher rating since the story was cut off for me T-T\r\nI would recommend it to those who like seeing bishounen or good-looking guys. I think it's for someone looking for a light-hearted series that isn't basically looking intensely into the story. I might just try the manga to see if there is any difference :D",
