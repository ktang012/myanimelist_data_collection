            "content": "The beauty of She and Her Cat: Everything Flows lies in its utter simplicity. It takes what we often take for granted, puts a nice metaphorical spin on it, and connects to us on a deep and heartwarming level that you would never expect in a million years. \r\nKanojo (or Miyu), the main character of Everything Flows, is a college student who is just beginning to face the real world. As with many other independent college students, she is facing some tough times, but what makes her situation all the more interesting is how she is being bombarded with incessant change. She just recently movedout of her childhood home, her friend/roommate recently left the apartment that the two of them split the rent for, and she\u2019s had her applications rejected in her endless search to get a job. Needless to say, things are not looking too bright for Kanojo.\\n\\n\r\nThe only one thing that has remained steady and consistent in Kanojo\u2019s life is her cat, Daru. Kanojo\u2019s mother found Daru when Kanojo was still a young child, and, although initially rejecting Daru, she learns to tolerate him. Over time, they grow together and form a deep relationship with each other. Their relationship has now developed up to a point now where Daru recognizes the hardship that Kanojo has to endure. Although there is not much that Daru can physically do, it is clear that he empathizes with her deeply.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the entire storyline is told from Daru\u2019s point of view, but it isn\u2019t isolated to just that. By incorporating a number of flashbacks and cleverly integrated metaphors throughout the story, the screenwriters of this 4 episode series have created something that has just enough impact to leave an impression yet still not sound overly sappy. It\u2019s truly just right: a masterfully crafted balance, as I would say.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they are both well done. An easy, breezy OP & ED and well-timed music to leave an emotional impact \u2013 what\u2019s there not to like? The animation and art are very consistent and does the trick for this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a great watch. 28 minutes in total may not seem like much, but it does the trick for the context of this show. The simplicity of this show is its strongest selling point, and after watching this I\u2019m sure that it\u2019ll leave you thinking about your own life too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Grade: A-\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.\\n",

            "content": "Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows, does more with four 7-minute episodes than most anime accomplishes with hours and hours of exposition. This story is more like a set of connected haikus, or a few simple pen-and-ink drawings, where each careful choice of phrase, or each perfectly drawn line, speaks more deeply than anything else one can imagine. \r\nI loved Daru. His narrative voice was perfect. Even though we'll really never know what cats think, he felt very real to me. And his relationship with Kanojo was portrayed with such nuance and care that I truly believed that his words were truly his own.\r\nIcan only say that, in the final episode, you must watch to the very end. Something very special happens, something magical, something perfect. \\n\\n\r\nI started crying during the first episode. By the end of episode 4 tears were flowing from my eyes, unbidden and unplanned. I'm still crying now, just thinking of this beautiful and utterly perfect gem of animated art. It's rare to encounter any work that's able to convey so much meaning with just the smallest and most intimate of gestures. I felt like I lived an entire life in less than half an hour. And when it was all over, I believed I was genuinely reborn. And I believe that rebirth and reincarnation, if such things could exist, would be more desirable than any other fate. Just to know that connection...that summer day...that familiar face and scent once again...",

            "content": "In case your also wondering if the romance is between the girl and the cat, then the short answer is YES but am sure its not as twisted as you might imagine. The story is the most awesome thing about this short anime, its not exactly something that is gonna make you tear up but its guaranteed to move you, watching \"Kanojo\" from the cats POV as she struggles with finding a job and the stresses of having to adjust to living alone as a new adult in the society.\r\nstory: 9/10\r\nLike i said before, the story is definitely the best part about this anime, itsfast paced since the anime is very short, but wont fail to make sure you understand everything very clearly, the cat narrates most of it, showing us flash backs from the life of Kanojo when she was a child and her problems as she was growing up.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot exactly what you can call the best but it was awesome, the animation wa smooth and the emotion behind every action were portrayed well in every scene. That is about as much as I can say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIm the kinda person who would stop watching a movie or anime just because they messed up the sound tracks for a certain scene, This anime absolutely matched the soundtrack with that heavy tone of watching someone fight responsibilities, I never really notice any anything if the character's voice acting is messed up but am sure you will find that the sound is OK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't really use a lot of characters considering that the anime is from a domesticated cat's POV, but as far as am concerned the character's  were very realistic, the way they talk and act is what you would see in real humans, absolutely down to earth characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt this part takes a 10 because of the awesome story, a very short anime but for just the 7 minutes that you will watch, it will totally reel you in slowly, I like stories that are fast paced because i easily get bored listening to too much detail, this anime packed every up in short scenes that make you understand fast.\\n\\n\r\nWell this review my not be of help but am pretty sure you will enjoy the anime just as much as I did, its one of those anime that doesn't give you much room for hating it so am sure no matter the type of anime you like, this one is definitely a watch for any anime fan.",

            "content": "So this review is based off the first 2 episodes of the anime, so if anything changes as the episodes are released this review will be changed.\r\n8 - Story: Everything Flows is about the lives of a job hunting girl and her cat. It highlights their friendship through youth and focuses pretty heavily on how the cat sees her and tries to make her life better.  And that\u2019s about it. The episodes are 6ish minutes long each so the story is pretty simple. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna give this anime so much dam much credit. Yeah, it has a story that\u2019s simple, butthe way it\u2019s told is really interesting so I felt completely hooked within the first 2 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Characters: There\u2019s also really only two characters that are important. The girl and the cat. Once again they chose perfectly to focus on just two characters given the length of the episodes, and so the way the characters interact with each other is great. They make it clear early on, that even though the cat does have dialogue neither the girl nor the cat can understand each other. Yet the way the girl talks about her life and the way the cat bounces off that giving his insight actually makes you feel like they\u2019re actually best friends.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Sound: Speaking of dialogue, the voice acting is really, really good. At first, hearing the cat with an adult male\u2019s voice did feel kind of weird, but after a minute or so, the voice matches perfectly. Same goes for the girl, her voice is expressive without being whiny and really, what more can you ask for?\\n\\n\r\n9 - Art: Now as far as art goes, I\u2019d have to say this is probably my favourite thing about the anime, because the whole thing is just downright beautiful. No joke, almost every scene is worthy of being used as a wallpaper, they\u2019re just that good looking.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Enjoyment: So, if you\u2019re looking for a pretty chill story that will keep you interested the whole 6 minutes, then I\u2019d definitely recommend checking this one out. Yeah, it\u2019s short, but for an anime to hook you on such lovable characters with such a simple story in such a short period of time, it\u2019s pretty awesome. I\u2019d say Everything Flows is a solid 8/10.\\n",

The opening suits the \"aura\" of the anime. And the animation is just magnificent especially if you stream it in HD. The story was lovely and light. One of the great thing about this anime is that it's told in the perspective of the Cat. I'm pretty sure that cats have this thoughts. I got a bit emotional too cause it reminded me of my old cat, yuki. She was sweet and lovely. I suddenly missedher. I think one of the underlying lessons that you will learn from this is to never take something for granted. I never regretted anything on my end with my relationship and time with yuki. I'm sure she knows that I loved her and I will always do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a cat lover, I highly recommend you to watch this. If you aren't but you wanted something oddly relaxing, I recommend you to watch this. It's just 7 mins per episode so it's convenient :''3",

            "content": "She and Her Cat Review\r\nI'm not going to lie, this is an entertaining series. As a person who doesn't own pets, it's refreshing to see what it's like to own pets from a new perspective. She and Her Cat is one of those short anime that has an 8 minute run time and uses those 8 minutes per episode to their fullest. Let's get into the meat of this review though.\r\nSTORY \r\nSimple concept. A college student lives with her cat. Here's the twist: It's from the perspective of the cat. It's a nice twist, but it isn't a mind blowing concept. For what it does,it does well. It engages the audience, has a nice pace, and has a good idea of what it wants to be. Since it's a show about a college student, it would make sense to have some kind of conflict. The daily troubles of college students (getting a job, paying bills, etc.) allows the audience to relate with the main female character. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does know what it's doing, but the mundane is still mundane. Nothing crazy is going on, and although this isn't a bad thing, a little more conflict would be nice. This series even states in the first episode that (from the perspective of the cat) the main female character does the same thing every morning. This is used to highlight how, even in the face of hardships, the main female character can stay strong. It's a nice idea and it's well executed.\\n\\n\r\nFor what this show does, it does well, but it doesn't go above and beyond with most of its ideas. It seems a little TOO emotional at times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 2 characters as of episode one. Let's split this section between the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe cat is simplistic. The cat knows its limits for what it can and can''t do to help and is grateful for its owner. He tries to comfort his owner and that's about it. Since we see the world through his eyes, we are restricted to the house as the setting. This adds to the idea of this anime being mundane.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female character is characterized well. She is a strong, independent woman who doesn't fall in any of the tropes normally seen in anime. She faces hardships to her fullest and keeps trying in the face of failure. This allows the audience to relate with her struggles more easily and makes the story have a larger impact. \\n\\n\r\nYou can see the bond between pet owner and pet within the first episode through the dialogue and through actions. This show utilizes the show, don't tell aspect of a visual medium most of the time, but falls off the deep end at times with how certain things are explained. The characters and characterization is, overall, strong and a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND SOUND \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful, but as stated, the setting is in a house. There isn't much to mess up. When visuals of the outside world are shown, they are well drawn and attract the audience's eye. The art style is a little different from the norm, but again, it is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are well chosen and fit their roles well. They don't over exaggerate their dialogue, which is nice. I don't like when a small conflict turns into a crying and yelling fest so it's nice to see external conflicts handled realistically. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also fitting, and the ending is soothing. That's another theme of this show, it's calming. Everything comes together to make a simplistic and calming story with some minor conflicts to keep the characters with something to do. The music adds to scenes, but nothing has stood so much yet that I would add it to my music playlist.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\nThis is a nice show to watch to relax. It's relate-able to both pet owners and people who go through mundane conflicts. It's relatively short episode lengths are good for quick viewing sessions while waiting around or to fill a quiet room with some noise for a little. Nothing stands out too much because of the perspective we are given, but this perspective also adds something new that we haven't seen much before. For what this show has to offer, it's worth a watch. I rate it a 4/5, but because it doesn't stand out in how it presents itself, I would say a 7.5/10 is more deserving.\\n\\n\r\nI'm editing this review each episode to ensure the highest amount of accuracy in it.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered how a story narrated by a cat would be?\r\n\"Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows\" is a very meaningful anime. The title itself is beautiful and matches perfectly the content of the story.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nDaru is an old cat who loves his owner. He never uses her name (Miyu). For him, she is just \"kanojo\". I liked how Daru's thoughts catch your attention. His voice is so softly. He narrates the story from his eyes--a cat's eyes. It's interesting to know Miyu through his perspective. She is having a bad time. Can't get a job. Misses her mother. Daru is heronly company. And it's beautiful when they are together.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is so beautifuly animated! I loved the details. Daru's eyes are just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is very touching. It conveys the character's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nAs the main character, Daru is wonderfully developed. There's something very mature in the way he acts and thinks. Miyu doesn't get behind, but I missed some information. The anime could have explored her family's background better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI'm the kind of person who likes to watch animes that make you cry. And I love cats too. So, the enjoyment was great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the best animes I've ever watched. And I'll problaby rewatch it again and again. Daru may be a cat, but he is an amazing character I'll never forget.",

            "content": "\"I'm searching for her because she's searching for me.\"\r\nThis is my review about Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko. I'll update it in every new episodes.\r\nBased on the first Makoto Shinkai's anime project, LIDENFILMS brings the new art and another complex story than the first edition. Because the first edition is very short (around 4 minutes), so, don't hope too much this edition will be long around 20 minutes.\r\nStory (8/10): For the story, it's very good. In episode 1, it's a deccent story. Introduce about the main character life and his owner. But for the prologue of the story, there's something so questionable. Why is therea scene that like Doraemon's Anywhere Door for the cat? I thought it's okay as made us so relax to enjoy this anime.\\n\r\nIn Episode 2, it's better than the first episode. The feel has come and bring the background of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The art is decent. Soft with detailed animation. If we comparing with another Makoto Shinkai's project like 5 Centimeters per Second and Kotonoha no Ni Wa, it's like the earth and the sky. So, don't hope too much for the art quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): All the musics in this anime are relaxing and suitable with the situation. From the opening with the instrumental musical, the BGM, and the ending music, it's very nice. So I give 8 for this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The introduction and the development of all characters are good. Asanuma Shintaro (Seiyuu of Daru) is doing good for narrate his life and Hanazawa Kana (Seiyuu of \"Kanojo\") is doing great to bring \"Kanojo\" more expressive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): It's enjoyable if you like the melancholic/drama anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): For this two episode, it's very good. Brings better and better story in every episode. If this story can execute the story until our tears has fall, it scores can be more than 8.",

            "content": "*Might contain minor spoilers*\r\nA short, simple, nice and warming story presented from a cat's point of view. I always wanted to watch something like this. It's interesting because it makes you think \"what could be in a cat's/animal's mind?\" \r\nThere are four episodes, without the short opening and the ending we have ~25 min. in total (6-7 min. per episode). It's not really much and it's difficult (not impossible) to present a complex story in such a short time. \r\nWith only 4 characters (a few more are just passing by) it's a pretty decent development. We get some flashbacks and we can see how therelationship between Miyu and her mother changed and why she moved alone with her cat. She was presented as a lonely girl, more like an introverted person, therefore she had some troubles finding a stable job. In the end we see her like a new person who finally \"could grow up\".\\n\r\nWe can talk about the relationship between Miyu and her cat too. While she said in the past to Daru that she'd rather be alone, asking him \"you wold too, right?\", now she wouldn't want lo live apart from her precious cat. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is also narrated by the cat. I think the voice acting was very good, Daru's voice was fitting perfectly and together with the music it was a very relaxing four-episode show. \\n\\n\r\nThe things I didn't liked about this short anime are some moments that could have been explained better, I found them a little bit confusing and maybe the fact that they could have added just a few more details about the characters. But because it's a short story, this little things seem like a bigger minus point. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, it was a nice \"little\" anime. I'm happy I watched it. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment/off-topic\\n\\n\r\nI have a cat and I always thought: \"What could animals think about?\", \"How and what do they feel when they are with us, humans?\", \"Are we giving them enough attention?\" \"Are they happy with us?\" \\n\\n\r\nThere was something Daru said in this anime : \"I live in my own time and she lives in her own time. So these moments when my time and hers intersects are more precious to me than anything.\"\\n\\n\r\nMost of the pets we own are alone, they do not have any other animal friends. They might be, sometimes, just a little part of our life, but for them, we are everything they have. I feel like that's what this anime wanted to highlight. And that was, also, what I liked the most about it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Looking for an anime to relax and kill some time with? Then this one's for you. 4 episodes, only around 13 minutes each, it surprisingly left an impact to me, as simple as it is.\r\nThe plot revolves around Daru, an old kitty living together with his owner, a woman struggling to find a steady job. The story is narrated from the POV of the cat, cherishing the time he had with his owner in a series of flashbacks. The plot sounds so simple, but that's exactly why it works. Nothing too complicated to think about, just a fine and relaxing 'healing' kind of show.\r\nNothing muchto talk about the visual here. One thing I can say is that it's a pleasant to look at. The choice of color palettes here suit the overall theme of the story, subtle and calm. One thing that I particularly liked about the show is how realistically they portrayed Daru. He moves and acts like a real cat and that makes him much more likable and believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was nothing too outstanding, but it fits and never felt out of place with the overall theme of the show. It has a calm and relaxing tune with a slight sad undertone to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say this is the perfect show for a cat or even any animal lovers and by the end, it even made me shed a few tears from its bittersweet ending. It's amazing how an anime this short can left that much impact to me. And for that, I gave it a solid 8.\\n\\n",

That being said, if you're like me and are thinking about watching this, stick around and read this review. \r\nI watched this on the recommendation of a friend of mine, and I have to admit that it is somewhat a masterpiece of short anime. That being said, I don't think I was the target audience, so while it was objectively very good, I didn't enjoy it as much as I think I should've. \r\nFirstoff, the story is very simple and meaningful in how simple it is. It's about the flow or nature and the life of an unnamed girl, simply put. That's all it is. And in that, somehow it's still somehow interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just outstanding, hands down. There's nothing else to be said about that. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, we just hear our dear cat main character speaking, and he has somewhat of an ASMR voice, so he's nice to listen to. In all honesty though, the closing and opening music is also very relaxing. This is very good to binge quickly on a rainy afternoon. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the characters are where this shines-- the entire show is centered around them; mostly 'she' and her cat. Since it's a short show, I won't go too much into depth lest I spoil it, but the show gives a startling amount of character to both people and makes it a very entertaining watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as other people did because I'm simply not an animal person or a cat person and it didn't really connect to me for me to feel any real emotions about it. However, this is objectively a very good show and I think everyone should at least give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if: you like cats, you like animals in general, you like short shows, you like stuff that's wholesome and adorable\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if: you're expecting a ton of plot, you don't like animals or cats in general \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

The structure of the series is non-linear, the show excellently maneuvers time giving you the understanding of how things got that way and then what happened next.\r\nThe main character, \"She\" is an fairly complex person with her relationship between her mother, and her friend. She is an great representation of young adulthood, that college age where one might be living alone yet not exactly an adult yet.The presentation of this relationship and how it \"flows\" with the non-linear nature of the scenes gives a subtle but noticeable flavoring that is quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the series is only about 21 minutes long so its worth your time, or only 7 minutes if the first episode doesnt sell you.",

I was in a dilemma of finding a job when I was watching this, so I could relate to a degree.\r\nArt\r\nThis is where I had some mixed feeling. I knew where the spin-off is coming from, so I had a high expectation. But it wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it is very beautiful with the scenery and stuff, but it feels more like a painting than animation to me, since the lack of dimension is really bugging me. Especially when the cat isblack and it turns dark for certain frames. It has a old animation feel though, which is kinda unique at the time where CGI anime is a thing. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt was good, but I don't remember it too well. I guess this is a good thing, since it means that there wasn't anything out of place, which means they did a good job in doing the cues and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nEach character is not complex and only plays a role. The cat plays the narration, the girl plays the girl in distress, the friend and mom are the person who concerned about the girl. I think the chemistry between characters are really well-mixed, and how they reacted to another person showed the character better. For example, how the cat gives cold shoulder to the friend is showing how the cat like the smell of the girl and the girl alone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis has a sad tone throughout the series, and while there are happy times, it's hard to shake off the feeling that it's sad. Nevertheless, it's still fairly enjoyable, with the story well-written and we have only the cat as a narration.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI don't like shows with a sad tone, which I know this show is going to be. I might not rewatch this though, despite I have some good moments with it, since it doesn't really fills my need for laughter. Nevertheless, I would rate this as an okay show at least, since it's short and they delivered it in a simple way and attend to small details which lets you pay more attention to the show.",

            "content": "Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows tells the story of a cat and his owner from the perspective of the cat. It is such a simplistic concept, and yet it has instantly earned a place as one of my favorite shows of all time despite being in seven-minute episodes--which says a lot about how good this series of shorts is. After next Friday it will have finished after just four episodes, which is a shame considering just how well written it is, and it really shows off Shinkai Makoto's spectacular skill as a writer. I will highlight everything that makes this show spectacular inthis review.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, I'll talk about the characters and the story (because these two are heavily intertwined, making it easier to just lump them together). The cast consists of a cat, her owner and a handful of extremely minor supporting characters. With just two characters that get focused on and without it trying to push ahead with some kind of plot (somewhere in which a lot of other shorts fall flat), the story is heavily character driven. The overarching plot which is there is that the owner is struggling having just graduated from high school, and it shows how she is unable to push ahead in life. All of this is told from thr cat's perspective, and when I watch her struggle it really brings tears to my eyes due to just how genuine it feels when watching. The cat thinks about her past, we learn how the two met each other and about the characters, and it leads to a massive amount of relatable character development which leaves me feeling like I know the characters and their hardships, and it is what makes it such a great show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the show, you can see the thought which has gone into the little things which make this show that much better. The visuals are stunning, with the OP and ED having a watercolour art style akin to Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, and the soundtrack is beautiful and really makes the touching or relatable scenes that much moreso, as well as getting across the idea that this show is incredibly relaxing. The OST reminds me of the music that goes over a lot of Non Non Biyori, with the easiest parallel to draw being with Hidamari Michi to Ren Chon's relaxing overtones and tune.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am thoroughly enjoying this show. Honestly this is the closest thing to perfection I think I've ever seen, and it is definitely worth the time to watch. Truly this show is a masterpiece.",

The cat is already pretty old unfortunately and it's clear from the start of the anime that he's getting slower and weaker.\r\nMelancholic themes, a tiny bit of intense drama, nice voice acting by both the cat and the girl (we can hear the thoughts of the cateven though he doesn't understand exactly what his owner says. This reinforces the connection between them nicely, showing that even without \"speaking\" the same language they have  a much deeper, emotional connection). The visuals, while nothing spectacular, are on a pretty ok level, usually displaying a sunset that quickly becomes depressing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the anime is a very good drama worth your time...\\n\r\nEXCEPT:\\n\\n\r\nHas any of you actually ever owned a cat?! Because the writer of this clearly hasn't. Let me tell you folks, I have owned both a cat and a dog in the past and this anime shows how a DOG would think, NOT a cat. Years spent together? Emotional connections? \"I love her.\"?!?!?! Foolish naive humans, that's NOT how a cat thinks. A cat doesn't want to see you... A cat... A cat just wants to watch the world burn... I hate using memes as points of reference, but cats are a$$holes, we know it when we buy them and it's pretty much WHAT we buy them for.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality people, the moment you die horribly because someone threw the microwave in the bathtub, a dog would start crying next to your burnt corpse, and it would eventually die from the depression. A CAT ON THE OTHER HAND, oh... The cat would turn around on your revolving chair, rub its paws together and say: \"The human is dead, good. All according to plan... Nyahahahaha!\"",

My cat and I share a very tight bond and is a very important part of my life. \r\nNeedless to say, this was some of the most emotional 28-30 minutes of my life in terms of anything anime related. The story for myself was extremely relatable, even with the strain of the main character. The art direction fits perfect for the anime, though not as memorable or eye popping as other shows. \r\nThe story is emotional no matte what, but if you have a pet this show may really dig at yoursoul more than others. I was emotional during each episode, until the final episode where I cried for a good half hour. No other anime has ever done this to me before. \\n\\n\r\nI will be holding my cat tight tonight.",

            "content": "All too often these days shows serve as lofty escapes from reality, they are simply sanctuaries to stimulate our imagination and play out what ifs. Often, well-grounded shows that deviate from this are are chastised for being too depressing or not imaginative. Well, folks, here is a show grounded in reality; it is a short but bittersweet piece about the chaotic, unforgiving real world and how a single, young-adult deals with it.\r\nHonestly, this show had come and gone, completely escaping my radar until I saw an exhibition on it in the Kyoto Manga Museum. It's not a comedy and there isn't much action, just anold cat recounting life with his human master. If you want a break from literally out-of-this-world fantasies and endless harems, this is a great little oasis.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is mixed with relatively basic drawing at times (with minimal shading and simplistic coloring- the cat is often drawn as just a single flat blob of gray) and some other rather nicely drawn scenes (such as the sunset in episode two). Overall, it pans out to something between the overly simplistic style of Tonari no Seki Kun and what you'd expect from a full-length anime. A lot of scenes have the VAs talking while a single image pans around. There are only a few characters but they are well drawn, the cat though is a bit on the fat side.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show has a calming, instrumental OP and a voiced ED with somewhat sad undertones; both are fitting considering the overall mood of the show. There is a BGM present but it is not particularly special.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, you'll hear the head voice of the cat, Daru, along with Kanahana convincingly voicing the un-named owner from childhood to adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows the life of a cat as he interacts with his owner, who starts out as a little girl. It gives a loving cat's interpretation of the world around him as he shares in his owner's happiness and grief. There is an abundance of the latter as real life is, well, truly tough at times.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a total of four episodes, each about eight minutes in length, though if you take out the OP/EDs it's really just five and a half minutes of content. Despite the brevity of the show, it still does a good job of exploring themes and really making the viewer connect with what's happening. There isn't exactly much of a rising action or climax but let's just say that the ending is heartily satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nGiven the short length of the show, I wasn't expecting much in this category. That said, the show does a great job of making the characters relatable; and anyone who's owned a pet can understand what the main girl here is going through. That connection to the characters sets this show apart from most of the other anime shorts.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nI will admit that I like cat so do factor that into how I rated this show. She and Her Cat is a lovely short that ultimately is about growing up and having a partner to share the wonders in life. Though nothing grand, the show is an easy and enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "The beauty of She and Her Cat: Everything Flows lies in its utter simplicity. It takes what we often take for granted, puts a nice metaphorical spin on it, and connects to us on a deep and heartwarming level that you would never expect in a million years. \r\nKanojo (or Miyu), the main character of Everything Flows, is a college student who is just beginning to face the real world. As with many other independent college students, she is facing some tough times, but what makes her situation all the more interesting is how she is being bombarded with incessant change. She just recently movedout of her childhood home, her friend/roommate recently left the apartment that the two of them split the rent for, and she\u2019s had her applications rejected in her endless search to get a job. Needless to say, things are not looking too bright for Kanojo.\\n\\n\r\nThe only one thing that has remained steady and consistent in Kanojo\u2019s life is her cat, Daru. Kanojo\u2019s mother found Daru when Kanojo was still a young child, and, although initially rejecting Daru, she learns to tolerate him. Over time, they grow together and form a deep relationship with each other. Their relationship has now developed up to a point now where Daru recognizes the hardship that Kanojo has to endure. Although there is not much that Daru can physically do, it is clear that he empathizes with her deeply.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the entire storyline is told from Daru\u2019s point of view, but it isn\u2019t isolated to just that. By incorporating a number of flashbacks and cleverly integrated metaphors throughout the story, the screenwriters of this 4 episode series have created something that has just enough impact to leave an impression yet still not sound overly sappy. It\u2019s truly just right: a masterfully crafted balance, as I would say.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they are both well done. An easy, breezy OP & ED and well-timed music to leave an emotional impact \u2013 what\u2019s there not to like? The animation and art are very consistent and does the trick for this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a great watch. 28 minutes in total may not seem like much, but it does the trick for the context of this show. The simplicity of this show is its strongest selling point, and after watching this I\u2019m sure that it\u2019ll leave you thinking about your own life too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Grade: A-\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion. I critique anime primarily on how the story is executed and how well-rounded the characters are. This review is not meant to target any other review but was intended to provide a more holistic analysis.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that this is a full-fledged review of the entire season.\\n",

This story is more like a set of connected haikus, or a few simple pen-and-ink drawings, where each careful choice of phrase, or each perfectly drawn line, speaks more deeply than anything else one can imagine. \r\nI loved Daru. His narrative voice was perfect. Even though we'll really never know what cats think, he felt very real to me. And his relationship with Kanojo was portrayed with such nuance and care that I truly believed that his words were truly his own.\r\nIcan only say that, in the final episode, you must watch to the very end. Something very special happens, something magical, something perfect. \\n\\n\r\nI started crying during the first episode. By the end of episode 4 tears were flowing from my eyes, unbidden and unplanned. I'm still crying now, just thinking of this beautiful and utterly perfect gem of animated art. It's rare to encounter any work that's able to convey so much meaning with just the smallest and most intimate of gestures. I felt like I lived an entire life in less than half an hour. And when it was all over, I believed I was genuinely reborn. And I believe that rebirth and reincarnation, if such things could exist, would be more desirable than any other fate. Just to know that connection...that summer day...that familiar face and scent once again...",

The story is the most awesome thing about this short anime, its not exactly something that is gonna make you tear up but its guaranteed to move you, watching \"Kanojo\" from the cats POV as she struggles with finding a job and the stresses of having to adjust to living alone as a new adult in the society.\r\nstory: 9/10\r\nLike i said before, the story is definitely the best part about this anime, itsfast paced since the anime is very short, but wont fail to make sure you understand everything very clearly, the cat narrates most of it, showing us flash backs from the life of Kanojo when she was a child and her problems as she was growing up.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot exactly what you can call the best but it was awesome, the animation wa smooth and the emotion behind every action were portrayed well in every scene. That is about as much as I can say about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIm the kinda person who would stop watching a movie or anime just because they messed up the sound tracks for a certain scene, This anime absolutely matched the soundtrack with that heavy tone of watching someone fight responsibilities, I never really notice any anything if the character's voice acting is messed up but am sure you will find that the sound is OK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't really use a lot of characters considering that the anime is from a domesticated cat's POV, but as far as am concerned the character's  were very realistic, the way they talk and act is what you would see in real humans, absolutely down to earth characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt this part takes a 10 because of the awesome story, a very short anime but for just the 7 minutes that you will watch, it will totally reel you in slowly, I like stories that are fast paced because i easily get bored listening to too much detail, this anime packed every up in short scenes that make you understand fast.\\n\\n\r\nWell this review my not be of help but am pretty sure you will enjoy the anime just as much as I did, its one of those anime that doesn't give you much room for hating it so am sure no matter the type of anime you like, this one is definitely a watch for any anime fan.",

            "content": "So this review is based off the first 2 episodes of the anime, so if anything changes as the episodes are released this review will be changed.\r\n8 - Story: Everything Flows is about the lives of a job hunting girl and her cat. It highlights their friendship through youth and focuses pretty heavily on how the cat sees her and tries to make her life better.  And that\u2019s about it. The episodes are 6ish minutes long each so the story is pretty simple. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna give this anime so much dam much credit. Yeah, it has a story that\u2019s simple, butthe way it\u2019s told is really interesting so I felt completely hooked within the first 2 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Characters: There\u2019s also really only two characters that are important. The girl and the cat. Once again they chose perfectly to focus on just two characters given the length of the episodes, and so the way the characters interact with each other is great. They make it clear early on, that even though the cat does have dialogue neither the girl nor the cat can understand each other. Yet the way the girl talks about her life and the way the cat bounces off that giving his insight actually makes you feel like they\u2019re actually best friends.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Sound: Speaking of dialogue, the voice acting is really, really good. At first, hearing the cat with an adult male\u2019s voice did feel kind of weird, but after a minute or so, the voice matches perfectly. Same goes for the girl, her voice is expressive without being whiny and really, what more can you ask for?\\n\\n\r\n9 - Art: Now as far as art goes, I\u2019d have to say this is probably my favourite thing about the anime, because the whole thing is just downright beautiful. No joke, almost every scene is worthy of being used as a wallpaper, they\u2019re just that good looking.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Enjoyment: So, if you\u2019re looking for a pretty chill story that will keep you interested the whole 6 minutes, then I\u2019d definitely recommend checking this one out. Yeah, it\u2019s short, but for an anime to hook you on such lovable characters with such a simple story in such a short period of time, it\u2019s pretty awesome. I\u2019d say Everything Flows is a solid 8/10.\\n",

The opening suits the \"aura\" of the anime. And the animation is just magnificent especially if you stream it in HD. The story was lovely and light. One of the great thing about this anime is that it's told in the perspective of the Cat. I'm pretty sure that cats have this thoughts. I got a bit emotional too cause it reminded me of my old cat, yuki. She was sweet and lovely. I suddenly missedher. I think one of the underlying lessons that you will learn from this is to never take something for granted. I never regretted anything on my end with my relationship and time with yuki. I'm sure she knows that I loved her and I will always do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a cat lover, I highly recommend you to watch this. If you aren't but you wanted something oddly relaxing, I recommend you to watch this. It's just 7 mins per episode so it's convenient :''3",

            "content": "She and Her Cat Review\r\nI'm not going to lie, this is an entertaining series. As a person who doesn't own pets, it's refreshing to see what it's like to own pets from a new perspective. She and Her Cat is one of those short anime that has an 8 minute run time and uses those 8 minutes per episode to their fullest. Let's get into the meat of this review though.\r\nSTORY \r\nSimple concept. A college student lives with her cat. Here's the twist: It's from the perspective of the cat. It's a nice twist, but it isn't a mind blowing concept. For what it does,it does well. It engages the audience, has a nice pace, and has a good idea of what it wants to be. Since it's a show about a college student, it would make sense to have some kind of conflict. The daily troubles of college students (getting a job, paying bills, etc.) allows the audience to relate with the main female character. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does know what it's doing, but the mundane is still mundane. Nothing crazy is going on, and although this isn't a bad thing, a little more conflict would be nice. This series even states in the first episode that (from the perspective of the cat) the main female character does the same thing every morning. This is used to highlight how, even in the face of hardships, the main female character can stay strong. It's a nice idea and it's well executed.\\n\\n\r\nFor what this show does, it does well, but it doesn't go above and beyond with most of its ideas. It seems a little TOO emotional at times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 2 characters as of episode one. Let's split this section between the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe cat is simplistic. The cat knows its limits for what it can and can''t do to help and is grateful for its owner. He tries to comfort his owner and that's about it. Since we see the world through his eyes, we are restricted to the house as the setting. This adds to the idea of this anime being mundane.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female character is characterized well. She is a strong, independent woman who doesn't fall in any of the tropes normally seen in anime. She faces hardships to her fullest and keeps trying in the face of failure. This allows the audience to relate with her struggles more easily and makes the story have a larger impact. \\n\\n\r\nYou can see the bond between pet owner and pet within the first episode through the dialogue and through actions. This show utilizes the show, don't tell aspect of a visual medium most of the time, but falls off the deep end at times with how certain things are explained. The characters and characterization is, overall, strong and a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND SOUND \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful, but as stated, the setting is in a house. There isn't much to mess up. When visuals of the outside world are shown, they are well drawn and attract the audience's eye. The art style is a little different from the norm, but again, it is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are well chosen and fit their roles well. They don't over exaggerate their dialogue, which is nice. I don't like when a small conflict turns into a crying and yelling fest so it's nice to see external conflicts handled realistically. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also fitting, and the ending is soothing. That's another theme of this show, it's calming. Everything comes together to make a simplistic and calming story with some minor conflicts to keep the characters with something to do. The music adds to scenes, but nothing has stood so much yet that I would add it to my music playlist.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\nThis is a nice show to watch to relax. It's relate-able to both pet owners and people who go through mundane conflicts. It's relatively short episode lengths are good for quick viewing sessions while waiting around or to fill a quiet room with some noise for a little. Nothing stands out too much because of the perspective we are given, but this perspective also adds something new that we haven't seen much before. For what this show has to offer, it's worth a watch. I rate it a 4/5, but because it doesn't stand out in how it presents itself, I would say a 7.5/10 is more deserving.\\n\\n\r\nI'm editing this review each episode to ensure the highest amount of accuracy in it.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered how a story narrated by a cat would be?\r\n\"Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows\" is a very meaningful anime. The title itself is beautiful and matches perfectly the content of the story.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nDaru is an old cat who loves his owner. He never uses her name (Miyu). For him, she is just \"kanojo\". I liked how Daru's thoughts catch your attention. His voice is so softly. He narrates the story from his eyes--a cat's eyes. It's interesting to know Miyu through his perspective. She is having a bad time. Can't get a job. Misses her mother. Daru is heronly company. And it's beautiful when they are together.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is so beautifuly animated! I loved the details. Daru's eyes are just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is very touching. It conveys the character's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nAs the main character, Daru is wonderfully developed. There's something very mature in the way he acts and thinks. Miyu doesn't get behind, but I missed some information. The anime could have explored her family's background better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI'm the kind of person who likes to watch animes that make you cry. And I love cats too. So, the enjoyment was great!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the best animes I've ever watched. And I'll problaby rewatch it again and again. Daru may be a cat, but he is an amazing character I'll never forget.",

            "content": "\"I'm searching for her because she's searching for me.\"\r\nThis is my review about Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko. I'll update it in every new episodes.\r\nBased on the first Makoto Shinkai's anime project, LIDENFILMS brings the new art and another complex story than the first edition. Because the first edition is very short (around 4 minutes), so, don't hope too much this edition will be long around 20 minutes.\r\nStory (8/10): For the story, it's very good. In episode 1, it's a deccent story. Introduce about the main character life and his owner. But for the prologue of the story, there's something so questionable. Why is therea scene that like Doraemon's Anywhere Door for the cat? I thought it's okay as made us so relax to enjoy this anime.\\n\r\nIn Episode 2, it's better than the first episode. The feel has come and bring the background of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The art is decent. Soft with detailed animation. If we comparing with another Makoto Shinkai's project like 5 Centimeters per Second and Kotonoha no Ni Wa, it's like the earth and the sky. So, don't hope too much for the art quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): All the musics in this anime are relaxing and suitable with the situation. From the opening with the instrumental musical, the BGM, and the ending music, it's very nice. So I give 8 for this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The introduction and the development of all characters are good. Asanuma Shintaro (Seiyuu of Daru) is doing good for narrate his life and Hanazawa Kana (Seiyuu of \"Kanojo\") is doing great to bring \"Kanojo\" more expressive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): It's enjoyable if you like the melancholic/drama anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): For this two episode, it's very good. Brings better and better story in every episode. If this story can execute the story until our tears has fall, it scores can be more than 8.",

            "content": "*Might contain minor spoilers*\r\nA short, simple, nice and warming story presented from a cat's point of view. I always wanted to watch something like this. It's interesting because it makes you think \"what could be in a cat's/animal's mind?\" \r\nThere are four episodes, without the short opening and the ending we have ~25 min. in total (6-7 min. per episode). It's not really much and it's difficult (not impossible) to present a complex story in such a short time. \r\nWith only 4 characters (a few more are just passing by) it's a pretty decent development. We get some flashbacks and we can see how therelationship between Miyu and her mother changed and why she moved alone with her cat. She was presented as a lonely girl, more like an introverted person, therefore she had some troubles finding a stable job. In the end we see her like a new person who finally \"could grow up\".\\n\r\nWe can talk about the relationship between Miyu and her cat too. While she said in the past to Daru that she'd rather be alone, asking him \"you wold too, right?\", now she wouldn't want lo live apart from her precious cat. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is also narrated by the cat. I think the voice acting was very good, Daru's voice was fitting perfectly and together with the music it was a very relaxing four-episode show. \\n\\n\r\nThe things I didn't liked about this short anime are some moments that could have been explained better, I found them a little bit confusing and maybe the fact that they could have added just a few more details about the characters. But because it's a short story, this little things seem like a bigger minus point. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, it was a nice \"little\" anime. I'm happy I watched it. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment/off-topic\\n\\n\r\nI have a cat and I always thought: \"What could animals think about?\", \"How and what do they feel when they are with us, humans?\", \"Are we giving them enough attention?\" \"Are they happy with us?\" \\n\\n\r\nThere was something Daru said in this anime : \"I live in my own time and she lives in her own time. So these moments when my time and hers intersects are more precious to me than anything.\"\\n\\n\r\nMost of the pets we own are alone, they do not have any other animal friends. They might be, sometimes, just a little part of our life, but for them, we are everything they have. I feel like that's what this anime wanted to highlight. And that was, also, what I liked the most about it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Looking for an anime to relax and kill some time with? Then this one's for you. 4 episodes, only around 13 minutes each, it surprisingly left an impact to me, as simple as it is.\r\nThe plot revolves around Daru, an old kitty living together with his owner, a woman struggling to find a steady job. The story is narrated from the POV of the cat, cherishing the time he had with his owner in a series of flashbacks. The plot sounds so simple, but that's exactly why it works. Nothing too complicated to think about, just a fine and relaxing 'healing' kind of show.\r\nNothing muchto talk about the visual here. One thing I can say is that it's a pleasant to look at. The choice of color palettes here suit the overall theme of the story, subtle and calm. One thing that I particularly liked about the show is how realistically they portrayed Daru. He moves and acts like a real cat and that makes him much more likable and believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was nothing too outstanding, but it fits and never felt out of place with the overall theme of the show. It has a calm and relaxing tune with a slight sad undertone to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say this is the perfect show for a cat or even any animal lovers and by the end, it even made me shed a few tears from its bittersweet ending. It's amazing how an anime this short can left that much impact to me. And for that, I gave it a solid 8.\\n\\n",

That being said, if you're like me and are thinking about watching this, stick around and read this review. \r\nI watched this on the recommendation of a friend of mine, and I have to admit that it is somewhat a masterpiece of short anime. That being said, I don't think I was the target audience, so while it was objectively very good, I didn't enjoy it as much as I think I should've. \r\nFirstoff, the story is very simple and meaningful in how simple it is. It's about the flow or nature and the life of an unnamed girl, simply put. That's all it is. And in that, somehow it's still somehow interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just outstanding, hands down. There's nothing else to be said about that. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the time, we just hear our dear cat main character speaking, and he has somewhat of an ASMR voice, so he's nice to listen to. In all honesty though, the closing and opening music is also very relaxing. This is very good to binge quickly on a rainy afternoon. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the characters are where this shines-- the entire show is centered around them; mostly 'she' and her cat. Since it's a short show, I won't go too much into depth lest I spoil it, but the show gives a startling amount of character to both people and makes it a very entertaining watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as other people did because I'm simply not an animal person or a cat person and it didn't really connect to me for me to feel any real emotions about it. However, this is objectively a very good show and I think everyone should at least give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if: you like cats, you like animals in general, you like short shows, you like stuff that's wholesome and adorable\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if: you're expecting a ton of plot, you don't like animals or cats in general \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows is an surprisingly subtle and flavorful anime considering assumptions and the miniature length of each episode. The show revolves around an unnamed girl going about her life as her cat monologues. The structure of the series is non-linear, the show excellently maneuvers time giving you the understanding of how things got that way and then what happened next.\r\nThe main character, \"She\" is an fairly complex person with her relationship between her mother, and her friend. She is an great representation of young adulthood, that college age where one might be living alone yet not exactly an adult yet.The presentation of this relationship and how it \"flows\" with the non-linear nature of the scenes gives a subtle but noticeable flavoring that is quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the series is only about 21 minutes long so its worth your time, or only 7 minutes if the first episode doesnt sell you.",

There are only four characters and the main two are very nicely fleshed out, and even one of the others (the mother) has a veryclear-cut personality and ambience to her. They feel very much like typical people (and cat!) but they are lovely characters all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in general was pleasant but not all too interesting, although not hard on the ears by any means. It is always nicely placed as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe quick story within four 7-minute episodes felt much longer than it was and for good reason - it had more depth and felt more \"full\" than most longer animes I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt may look a the surface to just be a short story about a girl and a cat - and it is - but please give this a watch.",

            "content": "I went into this anime with some expectation, and I got some in return.\r\nStory\r\nFairly straightforward, it's simple, but it works. I was in a dilemma of finding a job when I was watching this, so I could relate to a degree.\r\nArt\r\nThis is where I had some mixed feeling. I knew where the spin-off is coming from, so I had a high expectation. But it wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it is very beautiful with the scenery and stuff, but it feels more like a painting than animation to me, since the lack of dimension is really bugging me. Especially when the cat isblack and it turns dark for certain frames. It has a old animation feel though, which is kinda unique at the time where CGI anime is a thing. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt was good, but I don't remember it too well. I guess this is a good thing, since it means that there wasn't anything out of place, which means they did a good job in doing the cues and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nEach character is not complex and only plays a role. The cat plays the narration, the girl plays the girl in distress, the friend and mom are the person who concerned about the girl. I think the chemistry between characters are really well-mixed, and how they reacted to another person showed the character better. For example, how the cat gives cold shoulder to the friend is showing how the cat like the smell of the girl and the girl alone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis has a sad tone throughout the series, and while there are happy times, it's hard to shake off the feeling that it's sad. Nevertheless, it's still fairly enjoyable, with the story well-written and we have only the cat as a narration.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI don't like shows with a sad tone, which I know this show is going to be. I might not rewatch this though, despite I have some good moments with it, since it doesn't really fills my need for laughter. Nevertheless, I would rate this as an okay show at least, since it's short and they delivered it in a simple way and attend to small details which lets you pay more attention to the show.",

            "content": "Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows tells the story of a cat and his owner from the perspective of the cat. It is such a simplistic concept, and yet it has instantly earned a place as one of my favorite shows of all time despite being in seven-minute episodes--which says a lot about how good this series of shorts is. After next Friday it will have finished after just four episodes, which is a shame considering just how well written it is, and it really shows off Shinkai Makoto's spectacular skill as a writer. I will highlight everything that makes this show spectacular inthis review.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, I'll talk about the characters and the story (because these two are heavily intertwined, making it easier to just lump them together). The cast consists of a cat, her owner and a handful of extremely minor supporting characters. With just two characters that get focused on and without it trying to push ahead with some kind of plot (somewhere in which a lot of other shorts fall flat), the story is heavily character driven. The overarching plot which is there is that the owner is struggling having just graduated from high school, and it shows how she is unable to push ahead in life. All of this is told from thr cat's perspective, and when I watch her struggle it really brings tears to my eyes due to just how genuine it feels when watching. The cat thinks about her past, we learn how the two met each other and about the characters, and it leads to a massive amount of relatable character development which leaves me feeling like I know the characters and their hardships, and it is what makes it such a great show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the show, you can see the thought which has gone into the little things which make this show that much better. The visuals are stunning, with the OP and ED having a watercolour art style akin to Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, and the soundtrack is beautiful and really makes the touching or relatable scenes that much moreso, as well as getting across the idea that this show is incredibly relaxing. The OST reminds me of the music that goes over a lot of Non Non Biyori, with the easiest parallel to draw being with Hidamari Michi to Ren Chon's relaxing overtones and tune.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am thoroughly enjoying this show. Honestly this is the closest thing to perfection I think I've ever seen, and it is definitely worth the time to watch. Truly this show is a masterpiece.",

The cat is already pretty old unfortunately and it's clear from the start of the anime that he's getting slower and weaker.\r\nMelancholic themes, a tiny bit of intense drama, nice voice acting by both the cat and the girl (we can hear the thoughts of the cateven though he doesn't understand exactly what his owner says. This reinforces the connection between them nicely, showing that even without \"speaking\" the same language they have  a much deeper, emotional connection). The visuals, while nothing spectacular, are on a pretty ok level, usually displaying a sunset that quickly becomes depressing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the anime is a very good drama worth your time...\\n\r\nEXCEPT:\\n\\n\r\nHas any of you actually ever owned a cat?! Because the writer of this clearly hasn't. Let me tell you folks, I have owned both a cat and a dog in the past and this anime shows how a DOG would think, NOT a cat. Years spent together? Emotional connections? \"I love her.\"?!?!?! Foolish naive humans, that's NOT how a cat thinks. A cat doesn't want to see you... A cat... A cat just wants to watch the world burn... I hate using memes as points of reference, but cats are a$$holes, we know it when we buy them and it's pretty much WHAT we buy them for.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality people, the moment you die horribly because someone threw the microwave in the bathtub, a dog would start crying next to your burnt corpse, and it would eventually die from the depression. A CAT ON THE OTHER HAND, oh... The cat would turn around on your revolving chair, rub its paws together and say: \"The human is dead, good. All according to plan... Nyahahahaha!\"",

The art direction fits perfect for the anime, though not as memorable or eye popping as other shows. \r\nThe story is emotional no matte what, but if you have a pet this show may really dig at yoursoul more than others.

            "content": "All too often these days shows serve as lofty escapes from reality, they are simply sanctuaries to stimulate our imagination and play out what ifs. Often, well-grounded shows that deviate from this are are chastised for being too depressing or not imaginative. Well, folks, here is a show grounded in reality; it is a short but bittersweet piece about the chaotic, unforgiving real world and how a single, young-adult deals with it.\r\nHonestly, this show had come and gone, completely escaping my radar until I saw an exhibition on it in the Kyoto Manga Museum. It's not a comedy and there isn't much action, just anold cat recounting life with his human master. If you want a break from literally out-of-this-world fantasies and endless harems, this is a great little oasis.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is mixed with relatively basic drawing at times (with minimal shading and simplistic coloring- the cat is often drawn as just a single flat blob of gray) and some other rather nicely drawn scenes (such as the sunset in episode two). Overall, it pans out to something between the overly simplistic style of Tonari no Seki Kun and what you'd expect from a full-length anime. A lot of scenes have the VAs talking while a single image pans around. There are only a few characters but they are well drawn, the cat though is a bit on the fat side.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show has a calming, instrumental OP and a voiced ED with somewhat sad undertones; both are fitting considering the overall mood of the show. There is a BGM present but it is not particularly special.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, you'll hear the head voice of the cat, Daru, along with Kanahana convincingly voicing the un-named owner from childhood to adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows the life of a cat as he interacts with his owner, who starts out as a little girl. It gives a loving cat's interpretation of the world around him as he shares in his owner's happiness and grief. There is an abundance of the latter as real life is, well, truly tough at times.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a total of four episodes, each about eight minutes in length, though if you take out the OP/EDs it's really just five and a half minutes of content. Despite the brevity of the show, it still does a good job of exploring themes and really making the viewer connect with what's happening. There isn't exactly much of a rising action or climax but let's just say that the ending is heartily satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nGiven the short length of the show, I wasn't expecting much in this category. That said, the show does a great job of making the characters relatable; and anyone who's owned a pet can understand what the main girl here is going through. That connection to the characters sets this show apart from most of the other anime shorts.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nI will admit that I like cat so do factor that into how I rated this show. She and Her Cat is a lovely short that ultimately is about growing up and having a partner to share the wonders in life. Though nothing grand, the show is an easy and enjoyable watch.",

Even if the series was short, you get attached to the characters real easily. In all honesty this Short should get more credit because it shows an ideal Slice of Life anime. A girl living with her cat, simple. The art in this is very calm-like, which will most likely make you relax when watching this. The soundtrack in this was also very outstanding. Just like the art, the music was soothing. For characters, as I said earlier, Igot really attached to the 4 of them. I definitely recommend watching this on your free time. I guarantee you wont be disappointed in what you will find in this Anime Short.",

I don't think I've ever watched an anime that gave me this many emotions in only 7 short minutes every week for 4 weeks. \r\nThe story is simple: a girl named Miyu moves out of her house to live with her black cat and her friend while struggling to find a job. \r\nWhat makes this short series so special, then? Well, everything is seen through Daru, her cat. \r\nThere's worry in his thoughts, there's admiration, there's care, there's warmth, there's love. Daru loves Miyu. He stays close to her when she's sad and worried, he doeseverything he can as a cat to not make her feel alone and he's proud of her for doing her best through hard times.\\n\\n\r\nThe mood of tenderness and affection created by Daru directed towards Miyu is expressed in such a realistic and nice way that I cried watching every episode and kept going even after the episode had ended. The art, the colors, the sound, the camerawork, the characters... Everything helps conveying this mood and you can truly feel it in any moment.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 10 because I personally don't feel like it deserves any less. Every second of watching Daru was worth it.",

            "content": "I have no idea where to start with this one. This anime is very artistic and it's definitely not for everyone, but a lot of people (myself included) really liked it. It's definitely a lot better than its pre-existing sequel, but still missed a lot in terms of character development and story, though adding to it might actually damage this anime. It can be very confusing sometimes.\r\nThe entire story is from the cat's perspective, which was very interesting. It's not the first time something like that has been done, but I never seen a show where the animal (from whose point of view we seethe story) actually thinks and acts like an animal. He doesn't understand human speech and behavior, which made this already very realistic show feel even more real. It didn't have much going in terms of plot and everything we know about the story is compiled of what we heard the characters say. We don't know anything about the characters backstory because the cat wasn't there, but putting everything together yourself is what the show wanted you to do. This anime never tried to have the best or most unique story, it just wanted you to think.\\n\r\nUntil the after-credit scene of the last episode you wouldn't even know it's a prequel, but even then you wouldn't know unless you've watched the pre-existing sequel already. Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows is a prequel to a five minute OVA called \"Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko\" that was produced in 1999. The OVA is nothing worth watching, but if you did watch it, the ending of this anime will have a little more meaning to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime feel like real people. They act and talk like real people and their motivations were things you'd expect from real people; people you know or even yourself. This made the characters very relatable. It feels like you're watching regular people living their life, which is something you rarely see in anime. Most slice of life anime try to make the story and characters so fun and over the top that they don't feel real anymore, so I found this anime to be very refreshing in that sense. There isn't much character development in this anime, but it didn't draw back from the show and for a short anime like this, I'm happy with what we've got.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the animation except it was beautiful. It looked very smooth and detailed with an almost cinematic quality. I guess they could afford more resources since the anime was quite short.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show was also great. It knew how to support and add to the story and the animation the best way it could, it knew when to be quieter and when to stand out a bit more, it was just perfect for this show. The ending theme did a great job too, fitting well with the show's atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe main character, Miyu, was voiced by Kana Hanazawa, so of course she sounded great. Daru's (the cat) voice actor, Shintaro Asanuma, had a very calming voice and made the watching experience very relaxing. Even Makoto Shinkai (the original creator and the voice of the cat from the OVA) had a cameo in the show. The voice acting was on point for each and every character.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very different from anything I've seen so far. It's not for everyone, I know, but I think that it's worth watching if you can appreciate the more artistic anime, the ones that make you think. If you can, you'll have a good time watching Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows.",

I enjoy how Daru's (the cat's) insights on his owners behavior are so perceptive and caring that they turn over my prejudice towards cats that they care for nothing more than themselves (I blame the comic series Garfield for this). I only wish these four short 7 minute episodes can explain more on how Daru came to be so intuitive of his owner's behavior. He spends most of his days in his owner's apartment so how does he become wise with only a few days asa kitten in the outside world? I appreciate how Daru's  constant presence in his owner's life can allow him to see the gradual change of his owner while the owner makes it hard for her family and friends as she slowly withdraws herself. I feel that this anime could do a better job of fleshing out the perceptions of  Daru by making the show have more episodes. Keeping the episode length short to 7 minutes is great because it makes me feel like Daru's owner's relatives who are shut out by her withdrawal and the cat's narrative allows me to get closer to Daru's owner just as his presence brings the relatives closer to his owner. This is a clever way of juxtaposing the withdrawnness associated with cats with the sympathy associated with humans. Overall I enjoyed this melancholy anime.",

            "content": "[TL;DR: Short, sweet, too real. A story about a cat and her owner through life. If you are looking for a burst of feels and a reality check on your coffee break, look no further. 10/10]\r\nCats are often misunderstood creatures. As the saying goes, dogs have owners, cats have staff. They are the bona fide royalty of pets, even tempered, strong willed, independent and don't seem to care about much of anything other than a good meal, a comfy spot to sleep and getting into mischief when they are bored. But they can be surprisingly sensitive and caring, and they understand a lot more thanthey let on...\\n\\n\r\n\"She and Her Cat: Everything Flows\" is actually an adaptation of the OVA short \"She and Her Cat\" from Makoto Shinkai (the director of 5 Centimeters per Second, The Garden of Words and Your Name). Not a direct adaptation, but an alternate re-imagining of the premise. \"Everything Flows\" is a story about life, as seen through the eyes of Daru, a black cat living with Miyu, an ordinary girl with ordinary problems. Being a cat, he doesn't understand much about human life, but he still feels the pain, the struggle but also the beauty and happiness through the connection with Miyu. As time passes mercilessly, the elderly cat reminisces about the different stages of life he spent with her human. Joy, sorrow, depression, anxiety, as Miyu tries to figure out her place in life, so does Daru try to support her as much as a cat can, until his very last breath...\\n\\n\r\nThey say sometimes less is more, and that's perfectly true for this anime. Clocking in at only 6 minutes per episode (if you don't count the OP and ED) in a 4 episode series, Everything Flows has a lot more content crammed into it than other anime usually offer in multiple seasons of droll exposition. Daru's simplistic view of life offers a unique insight into our own world. From a cat's angle, we are lot less complex creatures than we pride ourselves to be. Our overcomplicated problems seem a lot less daunting, when we could derive joy from the simplest of things, a beautiful sunset, the sound of rain on the windowsill, the steady rhythm of a train passing in the distance...and the love of an old soul purring softly in our lap. Sometimes, life's biggest questions have stupidly simple answers, and there's a lot we could learn even from an old black cat, if we were only to pay attention.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, \"She and Her Cat: Everything Flows\" is a beautiful piece of art. You can binge it in less than half an hour, but it will give you things to think about for weeks if not more. The art, animation and VO is excellent and the story is just too real. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who are looking for some soul-searching.",

The show is pegged with the tag 'slice of life', but this is far from the typical comedy; Kanojo paints a world that feels real, a world where everyday struggles feel like they matter and are truly packed with meaning, just as they are in reality. Every episode has a very bittersweet feeling; you'll feel happiness at the thought that the protagonist will continue to face her struggles, as opposed to happiness over a victory.\r\nOr, you might not feel any of that at all, and that's fine. Each episode isonly 7 minutes, so you won't lose anything by giving it a go.\\n\\n\r\nTo go more in-depth:\\n\r\n-The story is brutal, and genuinely made my heart ache on multiple occasions- however, don't go in expecting a huge plot; everything is kept very subtle and close to home, with key events being personal to the characters and rather simple (e.g. worries about the future).\\n\r\n-The art is gorgeous- it isn't flashy and over the top, but it doesn't need to be (obviously), and the show knows this. Everything looks just right.\\n\r\n-Sound is fine; I especially liked the cats gentle, calm narration, which almost melts into the soothing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nBoom, there you go.

I would say that She and Her Cat is farstronger because of how compact its story is. Not a frame wasted as it goes about spinning its tale of life, death, strife, and acceptance. The show bleeds earnesty as it opens up on the cat Daru sitting in an open field reminiscent of his childhood flashbacks, before him a door leading out into reality. The train is a constant visual, displaying the passage of time and later on used to represent the beginning and ending of a life. The facial animation is a real standout as our protagonist Miyu struggles when talking with her mother and begins to feel overwhelmed by life. The show continues to use vibrant colors with more washed out backgrounds and through lighting and shot composition can express feelings of elation as well as despair. Finally the message of reincarnation and continued perseverance is refreshing, as it feels organic and doesn't try and force any ideas down your throat. I found myself crying even more on my third watch, making further connections and feeling closer to the characters, I am elated that I have been able to experience \u201cShe and Her Cat -Everything Flows-.\u201d \\n",

Realize that one day, you'll lose one another.\r\nI absolutely loved this anime (although I was sad it was only for a few episodes but after watching the last episode, I can understand why), the art was captivating, the storyline was simple and direct (not to mention kawaii af), and it just leaves me with content in each and every episode. \r\nIn a nutshell, if you're looking for a brief and simple anime with slice of life, a bit of humor andrealistic events that probably most people have seen or been through, I would definitely recommend this anime. Even for people who aren't that interested in anime would probably like this too!",

            "content": "The title Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko directly translates as 'She and Her Cat'. The whole series of four 7-minute short episodes is precisely as the anime title says, 'She and Her Cat: Everything Flows'. This anime is about the lives of an unnamed college girl and her cat. The only twist is that the story is told from the cat's perspective.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFor beginners, don't expect a story with twists and turns. In the black cat Daru's perspective, Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko tells a modest story about how Daru lives his life with a junior college girl, who was only referred by him as'She', after he was adopted to her family. Every now and then, Daru shows us some of his flashbacks when he was younger. The story focuses on a few important time frames of Daru's life, but the pacing is relaxed and easy to follow. I've rated 8 out of 10 because the story was very smooth, although strictly speaking, it might not even be called a story. The genre, as the MAL page points out, is Slice of Life; this Slice of Life revolves around Daru rather than She.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, as the story itself is very relaxed and simplistic, hardly any special effects are used. All the scenes are everyday, ordinary scenes. The background are pretty detailed. They are well drawn and well displayed. The artwork is very round, as in with little ragged or sharp edges; this works well with the rather easy mood and tone of the story. The gentle colours used were also fitting to the scenes. The animation is very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only full mark lied in the 'Sound' category. The soundtracks as well as the ED felt very gentle, as were the story and its characters. The soundtracks are a perfect match to every scene, but they were very light as well. Not light-hearted, but very mellow, somehow. The voice acting was done perfectly. As I mentioned for a few times already, this series did not need anything out of the ordinary, and so was the sound for the characters. The voice acting fitted the characters, and that was more than enough. You'll see why in the next part of this review. The voices, along with the soundtracks, were extremely soothing. Even without the visuals, you could imagine how amazing the sound was portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were Daru and the unnamed 'She'. Daru is only a domestic cat, but he is unbelievably psychological. Despite only being a cat, as his age progresses, we can see him become more mature and reflect upon life; not just his own, but his and Her's the same time. He is also practical, often thinking about how to cheer Her up. However, at the end of the day, he is just a cat, so he only sees in his scope, and doesn't really care about anything in the outside world. In his life, there is only She and himself, and for him it was sufficient. \\n\\n\r\nShe was just another ordinary girl. She tries to become independent as she grows up, with only Daru being beside her everyday. She struggles to find a job, and struggles with family-related problems. There wasn't anything too remarkable about her, apart from her love for her cat, whom she refers to as Daru, humanising him instead of calling him anything cat-like. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nKanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows tells a comforting and soothing story. I really enjoyed the process of watching; it felt bliss-like. The only points worth mentioning (that lowered the score) was the final episode, where the ending was told. Instead of using the last minute or so as an opening to a new story, more could be focused on Her feelings for him; the final part can be told in Her point-of-view instead of a third-person point of view.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this type of anime: very real life-like, without any special twists, but just a purely soothing and gentle tale. I think this anime might be the best short series I will ever come to witness. With an almost-perfect 9 out of 10, I strongly recommend this anime to anyone, especially for those who enjoy calming Slice of Life series.",

            "content": "She and her Cat is a beautiful short foray into the interesting perspective of the a girls life through her cat. It is incredibly good, unique, and surprisingly moving for a short 30 minuet anime. The art is good about par for the season well portioned, good balance, nothing far fetched in something that is supposed to be an accurate representation of life. The original OVA has a very original animation that is highly enjoyable in a quasi abstract black and white similar to stencils or sketches, except notably cleaner. Where this show really shines is in the character of the cat and girl, madevery much better by the quality voice acting, the lead in Daru the cat is most of the time is a reminiscent or musing type of perspective and voice, depending on the situation. I would recommend both the OVA and the 4 7-8 minuets shorts. If you just want a number,\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10",

            "content": "The similarly-named precursor anime, Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko, is a fine example of what I call \u201clapidary\u201d anime.  Such works are elegant, concise, and concentrated, and bear the same relation to anime in general as poetry does to prose.  Like poetry, creating anime of this type requires artistic ablity, skills developed through much practice, and great attention to detail.  The creator/director of the precursor work, Makoto Shinkai (\u65b0\u6d77 \u8aa0), is the foremost practitioner of this style, having created a remarkable string of lapidary masterpieces, e.g. 5 Centimeters Per Second and Voices of a Distant Star.\r\nAlas, Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: EverythingFlows, is an attempt to create  a work in the lapidary style by a team at LIDENFILMS that thas no experience working in this style. (Most of their output is mediocre at best).  The result is a total failure: arty rather than artful, insipid rather than intense, sentimental rather than moving.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled, this is just a cheap look-alike, not the real thing.\\n",
