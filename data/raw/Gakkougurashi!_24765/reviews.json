            "content": "Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!) was a surprise for many viewers of the 2015 summer season lineup. With a 1st episode that threw all convention out the window, it didn't take long for it to garner buzz within the anime community. While I entered with some second-hand knowledge of the involvement of zombies in the show's plot\u2014due to the inescapable whispers coming down the grapevine\u2014I assumed that the subject matter would have merely been treated as a backdrop for cute girls to get involved in silly, tension-less slapstick; with the overbearingly cutesy aesthetic that it was sporting on its cover photo being used as my basis for assessment.I was expecting something along the lines of 2015's Re-Kan, where the supernatural elements were just treated as a mere comedic gag, rather than anything integral to the narrative.\\n\r\nAnd while the deceptive(troll) opening theme and most of the show's 1st episode run-time had me duped into believing my assumption, that premature assessment was quickly shattered with the show's ominous reveal towards the latter end of the episode. Of course, there were a few foretelling signs with the way some characters were acting and visual cues scattered throughout the episode, but I was still fooled nonetheless. With that being said, to get the most out of this title, I highly suggest you refrain from doing any research on it beforehand and just watch it blind. So unless you've already watched the show or simply don't care, I advise you to stop reading this review any further. And with that warning in place, for everyone else, on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of \"cute girls doing cute things\" to zombie apocalypse was certainly an odd departure not often seen in anime. In fact, I don't recall anything going down that specific route at all. The closest point of comparison is magical girl shows that take a darker turn as it progresses (Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica), or shows that use sickeningly cute characters and slice-of-life moments before venturing into a bone-chilling bloodbath (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni). But as far as anything that follows directly in Gakkou's footsteps, I'm drawing blanks. At the very least, I can say it's a unique experience. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the \"cute girls doing cute things\" formula is omnipresent throughout the show, it's the moments that it skews into a more unnerving, sinister tone that really makes it stand out. Like the hunting technique practiced by the Angela fish, Gurashi baits the viewer in with a warm, radiant glow surrounding its material, helping lower any defensive walls that might have been set in place. And in this brief instance that you're lulled into a carefree disposition, Gurashi proceeds to pull the rug from under you, as the illusion of comfort fizzles away into something more visceral and disturbing. Gurashi's ability to toy with the viewer's response goes beyond a simple bait-and-switch, it's a sleight-of-hand trick that not many storytellers are capable of executing well. While some of the tonal shifts throughout the show doesn't always transition to the best of its ability (due to improper cohesion between the polar opposite genres being played with), it still manages to keep you on your toes when \"shit hits the fan.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd perhaps the best illustration of this technique in motion can be seen when discussing the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYuki Takeya, our main lead, is a person only tethered to sanity thanks to the willingness of her friends to walk on eggshells in her presence. With such a fragile PTSD mindset that's standing at the edge of rational thought\u2014the likes of which could be toppled with the slightest nudge; a great deal of the show's appeal comes from essentially watching a human ticking time-bomb that could be sent spiraling into madness at any given second. She's Gurashi's central focus and rightfully so, as she not only stands as a psychologically disturbed individual but more importantly, an embodiment of this very delicate duality between escapism and the harsh reality that this anime will come to be to known for. This topsy-turvy mental state was brought to life with visual cues that demanded the viewer's attention. Brightly lit hallways and classrooms teaming with jovial faces are singed away for dilapidated structures and bloodstained walls. We're forced to commandeer Yuki's point of view, watching the murky line between the happy past-life she chooses to embrace as her reality, while the actual truth she rejects\u2014the bloody aftermath of what was once a loving school environment\u2014be the reason that her mind is slowly being torn apart. The subconscious of a girl where only two options exist: either carry on living in denial or be permanently broken if made to face the truth of this post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world\u2014the ultimate catch-22. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while Yuki's involvement brought the necessary intrigue needed to hook audiences in for more, I can't say the rest of the characters boasted the same ability. They were given episodes dedicated to fleshing out their backstory, but their personalities, from beginning to end, were rather one-note. At best, they had the basic requirements covered to carry the narrative but nothing noteworthy beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nBut for everything that Gakkougurashi had going for it, there was a clear misunderstanding of the essentials needed to craft its content into a great show; more specifically, where to further its concept from being more than simply a novelty act. Today, we'll discuss the two major issues that prevented Gurashi from reaching the inner-circles of universal critical acclaim that it so desperately desires.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st major issue that quickly became apparent with each passing episode was the way the show handled Yuki's mental state. When dealing with a mentally disturbed individual, proper psychoanalysis and character exploration is needed to make the broken person's psyche believable. Without it, we're simply given a gimmick that's only viable on superficial terms. With Gurashi, we see the events that trigger the mental breakdown of the character, but it's never explored beyond face value. There's no actual introspection given to justify the way the character is presented. And sadly, because of this, it's reduced to only being used as a ploy for shock value and generating easy-to-consume entertainment. It may have been intended to be more than just that, but it just wasn't detailed enough to get that point across. Since all of the characters were already cookie-cutter stereotypes and no visible effort was shown to develop or add dimension to them, the show, as a result, often felt shallow. \\n\r\nIt didn't have the finesse of something like Perfect Blue, where we get a 1st person perspective into the mind of our protagonist as we experience her gradual breakdown between what's real and imaginary, playing out through the narrative and in her mannerisms. Nor was it like Abenobashi, where the internal strife of the main character was externalized into a visual metaphor for further inspection, while also dedicating time to flesh him out as a grief-stricken teen going through a phase of denial.\\n\\n\r\n\"Show, don't tell\" and \"shock and awe\" were something Gurashi seem to struggle to distinguish between, which was ultimately the reason it was kept off the pedestal with those that did do this kind of character breakdown right. Simply put, it was a case of style over substance that became painfully obvious when the gimmick of the character's mental state was recycled every episode for entertainment value instead of thematic relevance.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd major issue was the story progression itself, or should I stay, the lack thereof. If viewed as a character-driven narrative, it fell short of the mark (noted by the aforementioned problems I discussed), and if viewed as a plot-driven narrative, it was a monotonous dribble that repeated the same shtick every episode. It was \"moe\" antics followed by dark, demented slice-of-life on constant repeat. The reason this worked for shows like Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was because of the commitment made after the plot twist. Once it revealed the major tonal shift to its viewers, it gradually leaned and stayed in the \"darker\" territory. There was no flip-flopping back and forth between cutesy and dark, which in turn added poignancy to the central conflict at hand. It kept moving forward to its inevitable destination and was never back-peddling. This was Gurashi's fatal flaw and ultimately what placed the final nail in its coffin. It simply spun its wheels in the mud, thinking it can depend on the same trick to carry it from beginning to end. And because of this, the show was always stuck in a state of stagnation. The only episodes that tried to break this cycle were the final ones, but by then, the damage was already done. \\n\\n\r\nHad Gurashi dedicated the effort necessary to make Yuki more than just a circus act for our amusement, or placed more effort in its narrative to avoid meandering in circles, it could have been one of the best highlights from 2015. But like many shows with an exciting premise, Gurashi just didn't know how to deliver in the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot twists and shock factor moments made the show a fun spectacle, I couldn't help but feel a lack of engagement. The moe aesthetic and sensationalized depiction of Yuki's damaged state stopped all chances of the severe moments of Gurashi from really having a firm grip on me. This was also the problem I had with Higurashi and Madoka Magica, despite their more successful rendition of this kind of storytelling. They too succumbed to this trigger-happy depiction of cuteness meet sinister. It's just something I can't see beyond an entertaining party trick. And since Gurashi kept jumping back and forth between lighthearted moe and demented slice-of-life, after a while, the novelty that had won it so much attention had quickly faded away; something that's made all the more self-evident from the lack of staying-power it's had among anime enthusiasts. It was enjoyable at times but only on a surface level, and in the end, left me more underwhelmed than satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nGakkougurashi had the potential to make something that subverted the typical formula associated with the \"cute girls doing cute things\" setup but ultimately did nothing to capitalize off of it. Sadly, it's yet another case of a good premise underutilized and poorly handled. The right ingredients were there but at the end of the day, what was served up was a lukewarm dud.",

            "content": "If you have no idea what this show is about, you\u2019re one of the lucky few that can still dive into this quirky \u2018slice of life at school\u2019 show blind. It\u2019s mostly centred on antics and club events thought up by Yuki, guided by the athletic Kurumi and motherly Yuuri. You\u2019ll either love Yuki, (she\u2019s so crazy~) or empathise with Miki\u2019s level-headed reactions to her; Miki acts as a foil to Yuki, providing some gravitas to the show. After one episode you will likely either want to drop it or watch the rest. If you don\u2019t know anything about it, watch an episode before youread the rest of the review.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading on past this paragraph I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019ve either finished the first episode or at least know what happens in it. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to describe the show without giving away things that happen in the first episode, but I\u2019ll avoid spoiling anything beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone had come up with the idea of \u2018moe horror\u2019 I would have regarded it with the same suspicion that I would regard a \u2018death-game harem\u2019, or a \u2018mecha romance\u2019. It\u2019s all well and good in theory, but if you try to keep a consistent tone while staying true to the concept you\u2019re inevitably going to wind up with too much \u2018harem\u2019 and not enough \u2018death-game\u2019, or too much \u2018moe\u2019 and not enough \u2018horror\u2019 (or, to continue with the analogy, some really inorganic character development). To balance out the conflicting themes in this instance you really need some sort of excuse to violently flip between a light-hearted slice of life show and a dark post-apocalyptic horror without breaking the audience\u2019s immersion. Fortunately, one method to making this strange transition between completely different tones work resides under Yuki\u2019s cat-ear beanie. With what comes across as either complete insanity or a pathological determination to keep things happy and light-hearted, Yuki manages to get the other characters to forget about their situation, which in turn lulls the audience into that same sense of security. With such a setup, flipping the show back into a horror is as simple as cutting away from the mood Yuki has created. \\n\\n\r\nWe soon discover that the show\u2019s title is a clever pun in more ways than one. \u2018Gakkougurashi\u2019 follows the daily lives of a cast of mostly schoolgirls that are quite literally living at a school, flipping between their attempts to have fun and enjoy their lives on a day-to-day basis, on the one hand, and showing how each of them found themselves in such a situation, on the other. \\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of \u2018School-Live!\u2019 is spent on flashbacks, showing events that led up to their current situation. This approach takes away from the tangible sense of threat, but has the advantage of bringing the oh-so-rational Miki into the first episode (which is an amazing thing for people that aren\u2019t a huge fan of Yuki). It\u2019s a trade-off and a departure from the source material, which unfortunately leads to a few minor plot holes being ripped open from the fabric of the narrative. Given the context of the narrative presented, I was happy for them to spend plenty of time showing how the situation had come to be the way it was. That\u2019s where most of the excitement of this setting should reasonably come from given the nature of the show. Once our protagonists have managed to find safety, the plot as it is generally needs to rely on their desperation or stupidity to inject any new threat into the narrative without the audience losing immersion, so focusing on the lead-up to their situation was a good idea overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters vary widely in personality traits and outlook, and you\u2019ll likely find that at least one of them has a mentality you can gel with. The power dynamic and relationships between the girls are multifaceted and interesting mainly because of what they represent. Yuuri holds an unspoken and uncontested authority over the group as a pre-designated maternal leader, Kurumi is a hot-headed badass that quickly resorts to violence, Yuki is a psychotic and emotionally manipulative idealist, Miki is a stoic and cold-shouldered pessimist, and Megu-nee is very similar to that clumsy yet lovable substitute teacher you likely once had: she panics, falls over, and drops things, and is ignored far too often by her students when they don\u2019t need her help. From that melting pot of conflicting ideals and character archetypes comes a series of friendships built from necessity; built upon the cornerstone that is the hardship of their desperate situation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of self-awareness maintained in the writing throughout, whether it\u2019s (quite literally) pointing to other works that it has drawn inspiration from (such as the movie \u2018I am Legend\u2019 and the novels of Stephen King), or lampshading apparent plot contrivances by having the characters ask questions the audience were themselves wondering about (viz. why is this school so oddly well prepared for what happened?). This is one of the biggest strengths of the show and a huge part of why I\u2019m comfortable giving it a high score. The writers clearly knew the artistic context of what they were doing and had a reasonable sense of how the audience would react to what they were seeing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of \u201828 Moes Later\u2019, however, was an unfortunate stumbling block that marred the show in some respects. I\u2019m not against the \u2018moe\u2019 art design and see nothing intrinsically wrong with it (except that it\u2019s being used so often in modern anime that any departure from it feels like a breath of fresh air). The problem is moments of laziness and inconsistency that were obvious enough to be distracting: the characters are occasionally drawn out of proportion or with slightly misplaced features. It\u2019s not something I would normally bring up, but it\u2019s an obvious bad sign when such mistakes are even apparent to people that aren\u2019t looking for them.\\n\\n\r\nI briefly mentioned before that this show had departed from the source material in several respects. Some of these changes were worse than others. The inclusion of Miki in the first episode was a reasonably appropriate change from the manga; however, cutting out most of Miki\u2019s character development by simplifying her backstory was a strange decision. If only they hadn\u2019t included multiple episodes worth of drawn out sequences of events that did nothing to further the plot (viz. filler), we could have at the very least blamed the restrictions in episode length and number for biting the source material in the backstory! Speaking of backsides, that\u2019s about how abruptly (and awkwardly) this show segues into fanservice. The artistic direction panders to its audience in this regard to the point where it gets in the way of the plot; the writers of the show seemed to hold contempt for the idea that there are only so many appropriate times and places for panty shots or getting changed into bikinis. Fortunately these moments don\u2019t tend to occur in conjunction with the more \u2018dark\u2019 scenes, a plot contrivance that I\u2019m more than happy to forgive when faced with the alternative (a brutal deconstruction in more ways than one). Suffice to say, if you\u2019re put off by unnecessary fanservice you may find a few scenes cringeworthy. Most of it is well within the bounds of plausible deniability though, so it\u2019s fair to bet that you won\u2019t find it worth dropping the show over.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the positives, the OP of this series is a blast! Each episode the opening video is slightly (or dramatically) altered so that it\u2019s full of Easter eggs and little pieces of foreshadowing. One of the fun things about following along with the show week by week as it aired was seeing the community pore over all the minor details and changes, most of which I wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise! The ending songs ranged from \u2018boring enough to skip\u2019 to \u2018delivering emotional crits\u2019, depending on how well you\u2019ve connected with the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Night of the Living Lolis\u2019 is in some respects what you make of it, which is fitting given that one deeper theme brought up in the show is about the extent to which one can construct their own reality, and to what extent this functions as a tool for overcoming adversity. It\u2019s a theme that\u2019s there, but the onus is on the viewer to engage with that theme if they want to. No direct questions and answers about these things are thrust in the audience\u2019s face, but how you engage with the aforementioned ideas will be made clear from what you think of the characters that espouse respective opinions on those same ideas through their conduct.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a middle arc easily described as wading through treacle, the final arc of \u2018GG\u2019 regains focus and the plot starts to lunge forward to an exciting conclusion, quelling any fears that the setting had been forgotten about. How much of an impact this show will have on you will come down in part to how willing you are to forgive plot contrivances due to being invested in the characters, although in your judgement of such things you\u2019ll often be less disappointed if you give the writers the benefit of the doubt. For what it\u2019s worth, rape alarms are that loud, rusty metal is that weak, generators do make noise, and shovels are heavy. \\n\\n\r\nIf \u2018not judging a book by its cover\u2019 has equivalents in anime, one could be \u2018not judging a show by its genre\u2019. And while it certainly wasn\u2019t many of the animators, at least someone from Lerche genuinely tried to make this work. At a first glance, Gakkougurashi! looks like the result of moe creeping into ever more unfitting genres and settings, but thanks to the great writing it truly showed signs of life even when it should have by all rights been dead on its feet. \\n",

            "content": "Out of most of the anime of summer 2015, the one that keeps popping up time to time is the one and only \"Gakkou Gurashi\". I don't usually watch anime that is currently airing and most of the time I would watch it in English Dub, the reason why is because I would like to see the animation instead of the subtitles (however, some anime series, I do watch in English Sub such as this particular one). However, one of my friends recommended me this anime \"without any research\" (which I usually do) and after watching the first episode, I was completely glued to theseries.  \\n\\n\r\nNow 12 episodes later I can now officially do a review of this particular series, the series that everyone was pretty much talking about. So I'll mention my personal opinions about it, what the company \"Lerche\" did great on and also mention what they need to work on, without further ado, let's review \"Gakkou Gurashi\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe series talks about a club called \"The School Living Club\", a group of four girls and their young dog living in the school, however there's a reason why they are living in the school, which is explained in the anime (I'll give hints but no major spoilers ;))\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that I was one of those people that liked the storyline ever since the first episode, there were some great things but at the same time there's flaws. So I'll mention them here.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n\u2022 Mainly focuses on the main characters, you get to know more about their backstory, how the club was developed and how the characters get along.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each episode had a cliffhanger and makes the viewers want to know more about what will happen next in the series. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 From the beginning to the end, it made you question about what will happen to the characters and so on until you watch the end and find out that most of the questions have been answered. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The Moe / comedy and dark themes do NOT mix. This is the one of those problems that people had when they were watching the series. It makes the viewers think if they're supposed to consider the series as a serious one or a comedy especially due to the situation.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 There is a lot of filler moments in this series, moments that were very unnecessary, such as the comedy moments. They're supposed to deal with a serious situation, not moments where they're supposed to have fun and forget about what's happening around them, which happens often in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Not going to say everything wasn't predictable, but there's certain things that were predictable, one of them being the school environment later on in the series. They did an excellent job making things unpredictable in the first episode but as the series goes on, you realize certain things that have been pointed out in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The series is unique and has its own art style. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The characters were well designed, the expressions for each of the characters shows the emotions for any situation and the creators developed great outfits for each character making them unique in certain ways.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The environments were done well as each environment expresses a certain mood, depending on the situation, if it's happy and cheerful, they make it like nothing happened, if its dark, they make it dark and gloomy. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 If you compare the art between the manga and the anime, it is quite similar so they did manage to get the same type of art style as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nCon:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Like the story, Moe and dark themes don't work too well together. It would have been better if they stuck to one of them instead of both. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPro:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each OST was done well, it expresses the moods of the situation, if the situation is a Moe moment, they have cheerful music playing, if it's a sad moment, they make the music sound very sad and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The ending themes were okay too but the one theme that I've enjoyed the most out of this series was the Opening. If all you heard was the Opening without seeing the intro, you would imagine this as a cheerful and catchy opening theme, you would never expect it to be dark anime series. If you watch the intro from the first episode, it looks like another \"slice of life\" anime, but as the series goes on, the intro changes but the song stays the same, I know there may be other anime that did the same thing but this is an amazing idea that I don't often see which makes the Opening even more enjoyable to watch. I always get excited whenever the intro came on because I always wanted to know what they're going to change next and what they'll change it into. It's a very enjoyable intro to watch and a very catchy song to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nI seriously have no cons for this anime when it comes to sound as personally the music was fine the way it was. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each character has her own unique personality which makes each of the characters stand out from one another. (Examples: Yuki being the energetic and positive one, Miki being the serious one, Yuuri being the leader type and Kurumi being the cheerful type and the one with the shovel).\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The minor characters are mentioned time to time,  we get an understanding of what the minor characters were like, both appearance and personality. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Like the soundtrack, I can't really complain about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I thought the show was pretty entertaining, sure it had some slow and mostly comedic moments but it had moments were it actually made you wonder about what will happen in the next episode. You hope for the best for each character as well as have concerns about the things around them. Characters and the soundtrack were awesome, the art is enjoyable to see however, the story should have been worked on a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very enjoyable series and I highly recommend people to watch Gakkou Gurashi. The series is only 12 episodes so you can completely watch it within a couple of days. It was enjoyable to watch and a possibly a great anime to watch over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 / 10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some people like school. Some people dreads it. Then, there are some others that just goes there to get an education and nothing more. What about Takeya Yuki, a petite girl who just happens to be in love with school? If you think about it, there\u2019s nothing really wrong with liking school. What\u2019s wrong about this show is that the school Yuki is attending isn\u2019t exactly what it seems. Welcome to Gakkou Gurashi (School-Live!), a show that comes with a bizarre twist. And by all means, it\u2019s not exactly what it looks like\u2026\r\nOr maybe it does at first. The animated series adapted by Lerche comesfrom the manga of the same name. The series takes place in a school life setting where everything seems really normal at first. Or perhaps too normal. The first 20 or so minutes of the pilot episode establishes a school life style where Yuki is enjoying every minute of it. And really, why shouldn\u2019t she be? She is with her friends, having fun, making memories, and just being a kid. Anyone who have trouble investing time into the typical slice of life with \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 factor will likely feel annoyed. That is\u2026until the ending. The twist comes with a zombie apocalypse. In essence, Gakkou Gurashi fuses together a bunch of oddball genres that includes school, slice of life, supernatural, and a bit of survival horror. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way though. The show still retains its cuteness but explores a dark side of it that\u2019s nothing like what your school may be.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling of the show is structured in somewhat of a controversial way. As a manga reader, I will say that it is entertaining but still sways from faithfulness. The first episode makes changes while also introducing certain characters far too early than they should be. The overall tone of the story flows somewhat well in terms of content despite pacing issues. It shouldn\u2019t be hard for anyone to figure out that something may be wrong through careful analysis. The background foreshadowing such as the bizarre words on the school\u2019s chalkboard or gravestones should make the viewers scratch their head. Also, isn\u2019t it just strange that everything seems a bit too simple at their school? \\n\\n\r\nA main part of the show also consists of the character cast. Yuki is the most prominent character in the series not because of her personality but because of some of her delusions. The show establishes an eerie message that perhaps she is hallucinating or building a delusional barrier around herself. The reality is that there are zombies are school, the classrooms are in shambles with windows shattered, hallways are barricaded, and death is a quite real. Yuki\u2019s personality is also quite cheerful and sometimes is distracting for the audience. Similarly, some of her friends also plays along with her despite knowing the truth. They include Kurumi, Yuri, and Miki and all of them shows various skills when needed for survival. Their personalities ranges although all of them gets along quite well as friends. Kurumi is more of the fighter for the group with her handy shovel while Yuri plays more of a supportive role (the older sister type). Miki also adds support to help the other girls and even plays alongside Yuki as \u201cMii-kun\u201d. As cute and colorful as this group is, the audience is still often reminded of what\u2019s at stake. By the time the first episode ends, I think any anime original viewers will find it surprising in some ways by the false advertising and bait.\\n\\n\r\nOn most terms of the show, it blends in a form of dark comedy. Sure on the surface, everything seems cherry but the reality is not so cute. The comedy on most part is what you will typically see from series about \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d. In essence, the show actually masks its true visage somewhat well with its humor if a viewer is unaware of the premise or coming into the show completely fresh. Meanwhile, Gakkou Gurashi exploits its darker elements with Yuki\u2019s state of mind. Other characters also gets some of their background story told including Yuki\u2019s friend \u201cMii-kun\u201d and her teacher, Megumi. The show establishes fairly well that Yuki is overly fond of them. As such, it creates the false barrier about her state of mind. Throughout the show, it\u2019s almost like Yuki is in a world of her own. Yuki continuously shows how much she loves school while the audience knows it\u2019s more than just that. And by this execution, I guess it can be a hit or miss. Some people will find the series overly repetitive after a few episodes. Others may think that the comedy doesn\u2019t mix well with the overlay of the story. Despite this, Gakkou Gurashi succeeds in keeping a thrilling story by adapting with the characters. The style of the show is obviously more than just a slice of life so it often crafts plot twists to make the audience anticipate for more.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to artwork, there should be no surprise that the girls are designed to look cute. They all wear their regular school uniform with some variations. For instance, we have Yuki\u2019s cat-like hat or Kurumi\u2019s arm-warmers. Overly cute may sometimes become evident throughout the show especially with character expressions. In reality, the setting of the school is designed to look like it was the aftermath of an apocalypse. It conveys the message to the audience that nothing is normal. The zombies are designed to look horrific with their mindless rampage. Fan service also exists with swimsuits although most of it downplayed. Instead, it\u2019s replace with violence with vague censorship. It\u2019s also noticeable that the body language of the characters shows the audience of their conflicting feelings. Finally, I have to say that the show has a clever way of decorating its OP and ED theme songs along with its symbolisms.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say the soundtrack is overly impressive but neither is it lacking. Somewhere in between, I think the soundtrack works especially to deliver that eerie feeling when it\u2019s needed. Other times, its recycled usage of the lighthearted harmony is hardly memorable. Perhaps the most distinctive thing related to sound is the voices of the characters. Yuki is portrayed with a very energetic voice who is often on the lookout for fun at school. She genuinely loves school so her presence along with her voice brings in a cheery atmosphere. That is\u2026there are moments when her breaks down in an almost mental-like state. For that, I\u2019d say that her character is adapted well in terms of voice mannerism. Others in the show includes Kurumi\u2019s tomboyish voice and Yuuri\u2019s mature personality with a matching voice tone that is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not a big fan of school. For someone like Yuki, that\u2019s an understatement. And for a show like Gakkou Gurashi, it\u2019s about much more than the girls having fun and getting an education. Ever heard of the phrase, \u201cwhen it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t?\u201d That\u2019s what the show feels like. As such, don\u2019t expect Gakkou Gurashi to be the typical slice of life with cute girls having their happy endings every episode. This is not a happy show. If you take a look at the physical attributes of their real school and environment, then it\u2019s easy to see why. If you thought that Gakkou Gurashi is like colored rainbows with smiles and laughs, think again.",

            "content": "I am not english, so i apologize if i make mistakes.\r\nGakkou Gurashi is surely not your typical Slice of Life anime. The first thing that you can think after seeing its genres will be: \"Slice of Life + Horror? What's that troll?\", and it's here that you are wrong, my friend; Gurashi Gakkou is probably the second anime (Puella Magi Madoka Magica the first one) that manages to use 2 genres completely different so well. It could be called Slice of Horror. The new generation of anime has begun! \u2570\u0f3c=\u0ca0\u0a0a\u0ca0=\u0f3d\u256f\r\nThat is why i like this anime so much, unique genres and characters. Don't get fooledby the first 20 minutes of the anime, You will see only a group of girls who live at school and look for a dog dispersed in the school with moe moments/reactions, In any case i definitely do not recommend dropping the anime before the real story starts (at the end of the first episode you'll understand what i am talking about).\\n\r\nGo to watch the first episode because from now on there will be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime is great. The first thing you notice is this \"School-living club\", and here comes the mindfuck. The main character is mentally unstable, does not see what she has in front of her eyes. The anime is set in a post-apocalyptic world, oh wait, most of the characters \"are\" in a post-apocalypric world, Our Yuki is in a world friendly with her, where all are her friends and the school is perfectly normal. Obviously nothing of what she sees is true, yes, the school is surrounded by zombies. Here starts the adventures of our protagonists in a cruel world, Where errors are not allowed, only courage. Obviously, there's some mystery here and there that makes the anime more interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot a lot to say here. The art is great, it works very well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's moe when there's the Slice of Life and scary when the horror scenes arrive. The zombies have a unique art, seem to be more shadows than zombies sometimes, but don't worry, there is a reason\\n\r\nTho the animation is not really great, just normal. It has a lot of issues, and you can see the frames sometimes but it doesn't matter, because it fits perfectly with the anime's atmosphere. Don't expect something Ufotable-like animation, Lerche had 3 shows this season so you can imagine...\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely perfect. The OST fits perfectly with the anime. Outstanding in the horror moment, it's not your usual sound that you hear. The OP sequence is genial, cheerful music with zombies in the background, you don't see it everyday (i think). The ED sequence is more quiet, it could have been better, i don't deny it. The OST...reminds me sometimes a film, really great the concept, what you are watching: an anime; what you are hearing: a soundtrack of a film. It does a great job again because it shows the state of mind of the protagonist. It makes you feel anxious, happy, etc...\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis group of girls is perfect. There's the leader \"Yuuri\" that thinks about cooking, giving orders And the remaining resources, she has some interesting clothes that she puts on the uniform. Then there's the courageous \"Kurumi\" that kills zombies and rescues her friends. There's the quiet \"Miki\" that loves reading post-apocalyptic stories (especially of Stephen King), why not? And lastly we have our cheerful Yuki that lives in her world. Then there's Taroumaru...Taroumaru is a dog who cheers up the girls, play with them and has a great development with Yuki and Kurumi. He is not a character that you will love for sure but i think i like him...\\n\r\nOh wait! how could i forget about Megu-nee! i-i mean, Sakura-sensei. She is the closest person to Yuki and a good teacher that gives advices to students. Megu-nee is a character that everyone love.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFun and cute moments followed by scary moments. Even if there are zombies, in a dead city, this show sometimes makes you forget there are all these scary things, because nothing is better than a good comedy. IMO, the comedy/moeblob doesn't have always a good tempism, but...Oh well, in poor words, you'll have fun watching this show.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Slice of Life, go to watch it, if you like Zombies and mysterious circumstances go to watch it, if you like both, why are you reading this review? Run! You will not regret watching this show. Gakkou Gurashi is an anime that has a new whole concept of a post-apocalyptic world.\\n\r\nThis show makes you smile and scares you at the same time, unique setting, don't you find it unique? I do.\\n\r\nI am definitely enjoying Gakkou Gurashi a lot. AOTS (summer 2015) IMO.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful \u301c(^\u2207^\u301c\uff09",

            "content": "The idea of having cute girls in dark settings is nothing new to the world of anime, but especially after the record-breaking commercial success of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica way back in 2011, there has been a particularly big outbreak of new anime trying to ride the same wave and get a good bang for their buck. But the problem with that is that it generally only results in the final product feeling similar yet inferior in comparison to earlier works following the same idea, as was made evident in shows like Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru and Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou for example.\r\nGakkou Gurashiis to me the first anime which actually succeeds in doing this in the last few years. It manages to provide the exact same kind of contrast between moe and despair that tugs on your heartstrings and keeps you on your toes, yet it does it in a completely different setting and an incomparable storyline.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have not yet watched this anime, I would highly recommend you to at least watch the very first episode to its end without reading any further or getting yourself spoiled. It is something that you should really experience first-hand for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point, Gakkou Gurashi is initially shown from the eyes of the energetic high-schooler Takeya Yuki as a very stereotypical slice of life moe comedy following her and her friends living inside their school. And yes I literally mean living in, as their School Living Club's activities consist of always staying inside the school with the intention of \"growing closer to the school's many departments, foster self-governance and independence, and set an example for all to follow\". Thus they sleep in the school, take classes in school and play in school. Pretty straightforward. However as is revealed at the end of the first episode, this is nothing but a huge deception. Because in reality, the world which Gakkou Gurashi takes place in has already fallen to a zombie apocalypse, all the students other than the members of the School Living Club are already dead, and Yuki is completely mentally unstable and thus incapable of seeing the truth of her newfound reality for what it is. What makes this so great is the presentation. They manage to build the whole situation up so cleanly, so smoothly and with such perfect precision that it eventually hits you like a hammer when the truth is finally revealed. And you can't say it came out of nowhere either; the clues are clearly spread out throughout the first episode if you're paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs fascinating as this opening was though, the real question following it was whether the story was actually sustainable from that point onwards. After all, when you drop that kind of bombshell in the very first episode, you better have something to offer for the remaining 11 episodes of the anime. Does Gakkou Gurashi accomplish this then? Well... yes and no. The rest of the story doesn't really rely on shock value quite as much, but instead takes a slower approach. The girls continue to live out their lives inside the barricaded school as they do their best to keep up the act that everything is fine and dandy in Yuki's presence in order to not break her mentally, try to find information about the zombie apocalypse and why/how it occurred, as well as simply staying alive. Occasionally they'll venture outside the safe zone and into hostile territory, but they never stay there any longer than necessary and they try to avoid direct combat if possible due to the risk of infection. So there isn't much in the way of bloodthirsty zombie bashing carnage in this show, but honestly I'm very thankful for that because I find that to be one of the most mindless concepts in fiction. Don't expect Gakkou Gurashi to play out like Highschool of the Dead, because it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nIn theory I think this is a good decision, but if there is one thing which Gakkou Gurashi fails at, it is a certain aspect of its execution. You see although the contrast between the slice of life segments inside the school and the darker elements are very cool to see, it sadly doesn't balance them properly. Simply put, there is *way* too much focus on the slice of life part of the equation. As much as I like that kind of content in general, in Gakkou Gurashi's case it feels more out of place than anything else more often than not. When you've just gotten some dramatic plot twist at the end of an episode, it feels rather annoying when the entirety of the episode thereafter is spent doing nothing at all. I mean yes, of course it's important to show off how the girls are trying to keep their spirits up in the desperate situation which they find themselves in, but it does it too much. It doesn't just come across as fleshing out the characters, but also quite frankly as wasting time. Especially when you put in an entire episode showing off the girls in their bikinis by the pool on the school's roof and even take the extra time to have the camera zoom in on their tits one by one, then it no longer classifies as contrast; it's purely fanservice. At that point there's just no room for sugarcoating it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nNow personally I don't really mind that part too much per se, but it doesn't change the fact that it is taking up a huge amount of time which could have been spent on actually progressing the story instead. As a result, when you look at the anime as a whole... it doesn't really advance very much from start to finish. About half the story lies in the last three episodes alone, and although those were certainly top tier, it doesn't excuse all the random stuff that happens (more like not happens) in the middle of the season. I mean imagine if the latter parts had been the middle ones instead; they'd have had room for like 4 or so more episodes before the end. Though of course you can always pick up the manga instead if you want more content, but that's a different matter altogether and not really a valid excuse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Gakkou Gurashi is a thrilling anime which is sadly dragged down quite a bit by a single flaw. It stands out from the crowd due to its original combination of setting and execution; it has occasionally stellar directing, nasty cliffhangers, and interesting characters, but at the same time it doesn't focus on its own strengths properly which leads the viewers to just want the show to \"get on with it already\" a lot of the time. Even so though, the pros still heavily outweigh the cons, and the good points are what the anime will primarily be remembered for. And really, any series which can manage to leave such a solid impression on you as a viewer is a noteworthy anime in my mind.",

In addition to that with the story, it's sort of like School Live borrowed lots of the shock and suspense elements from High School of the Dead and dulled it down a few levels to make it easier to watch. I think it was done that way so everything is not all in your face at once. School live takes things one step at a time and that'swhat helps build up suspense. Moving on to arts and Characters, nothing too unique stands out about the characters, they are sort of like your generic anime girls. The typical stupid hyper girl and with pink hair purposely made to be cute and \"a hit with the fans.\" The one mature classmate whose  job is to look out for everyone. The tough girl with the tom-boyish personality but is really a big softie, etc. School live isn't too bad, like all anime it has its obviously faults, but I'm sure if you love cute girls trying to solve mysteries, plot twists, and violence then you're going to love School Live!",

            "content": "(FIRST REVIEW)\r\n(ALSO SPOILERS)\r\nGakkou Gurashi (School-Live!) is an interesting anime that blew up in the Summer 2015 season. Many people praised it for being unique, dark, and a fresh new take on the zombie genre. It has moe girls and zombies. 2 things to bait the anime community in. So how does this \"masterpiece\" hold up? \r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story in this is so average. The story changes in tone shift from being a cute, moeshit, slice of life show from a dark and depressing Madoka Magica take. However, it does it horribly. There's no weight to either of these sides to the anime and it justmakes the anime seem lazy and lacking. Also how some episodes would just focus on moeshit rather than the actual story we all came it to see. It acts like it doesn't care at all. However, something I can say about the story is how it takes some risks. I was surprised by how this show deals with some tragedy and the way it does it is quite impressive. Doesn't excuse the story from being lackluster and bi-polar. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLerche was everywhere spewing out shows in the Summer season. Too bad all of them were fucking trash but at least they had some decent art. I like how the characters movements are so fluid in some scenes and how their movements would change with the tone. For example, Kurumi attempting to kill some zombies would have pace that's quicker rather than usual when she's just standing in the slice of life would. I also like how well the color pallet would stick well with the tones as well. Keeping it dark and creepy when it needs to. But sadly, that's basically it. The art does nothing to stick out but instead it just blends in with other anime. Also, most of the animation is SO STILTED. All the characters mostly do is just stand around talking. It seems like they even forgot they were in this terrible show. Not much to say, the art and animation are just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actresses showed some emotion in their performances here and there but nothing really seemed to stick out as well. They at least tried I'll give them that. A good thing about the sound however is the music box that would play here and there and would sound like it's dying right at the end when something bad happens. Yes, music boxes have been done to death in anime, but it was still a nice touch. As for everything else? MOESHIT TO THE MAX. Nothing in the soundtrack stands out at all. It's the same shit we've heard over and over and over again in other slice of life, cute girls doing cute things anime. Average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly shit, where do I begin? These characters are so 2-dimensional. None of them have a personality nor do any of them develop. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is just the same old ditzy girl we see in all anime before who acts like everything around her is fine. She has a personality but it's annoying and she does not develop. \\n\\n\r\nKurumi is the tomboy who had to kill the love of her life (THAT IS NEVER BROUGHT UP AGAIN) who has no personality. She is a blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nYuuri, the worst character, also has no personality. She's just there to make food and keep the club under protection. Another blank slate that doesn't develop. The anime tries and make her seem different and attempt to \"develop\" her by attempting to kill Kurumi when Kurumi is turning into a zombie. It was handled horribly since Kurumi and Yuuri barely shared a bond together so how are we supposed to care? I sure as hell know I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nMiki is an overprotective character who tried and seems like she cares for the club. Another blank slate who kinda develops but is done also horribly. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else is a waste of your time. The characters are the worst part of the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it was painful to watch sometimes, I still kind of enjoyed this anime. I was still intrigued on everything that was going on and was just begging that this anime would get better, but nope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi is a dumb, moeshit, same old slice of life show we've seen a million of times in other series. The only thing that this show does different is that it has zombies. It has 1-dimensional characters, average art, a weak story that doesn't know what it wants to be, and a soundtrack that makes you want to drill your ears. You want a good slice of life show? Go watch Aria the Animation. At least that one has good characters, better art and a story that's actually well written. Stay away from this anime. It's just another show that goes into the trash just like every other anime from the Summer 2015 season. Lerche has fucked up big time.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "Is this suppose to be a Joke? I'm sorry but this anime was a gigantic waste of time! when it comes to Thriller, I'm not a big fan of it. the only animes i watched in the Thriller setting we're Another and Tokyo Ghoul.\r\n so let's rip this crap apart before i have a Goddamn Mental breakdown\r\nStory:\r\nIt's premise was the Reason to why i wanted to watch the Anime. it tells the Story about 4 Girls and a little Dog who are living on a School and at the First Episode you don't know why but at the end of the 1st Episode, itreveals it's Dark twist... they are actually stuck on the school thanks to a lot of Zombies in it. so by this i said to myself: \"YEAH, This is gotta be a great Thriller\" but... oh god the Cutesy comedy mixed with the Dark atmosphere that is trying to get it's doesn't fit well... like at all! when there is a very Dark moment after the end of a Episode, what happens? CUTESY COMEDY TO DRIVEN INTO YOUR SKULL! \\n\r\ni mean yeah there are some Thriller or Dark animes with Cutesy visuals that has to put something cute in it... but in Madoka Magica and Higurashi, it works because the Plot keeps on going and it gets even Darker. thus, we wanna see how Darker can it goes. so that's why School Live Fails at this!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\ni don't have much to say it, the Animation is tolerable at best, but it has it's flaws. most of the Characters have the same Eye shapes with different Colors. the Designs are mediocre with not much Creativity putted into it. and i also hate and Despise the use of CGI in anime.. and Unfortunately it is used here too, either with Zombies at long distance or with People at long distance. it's not as bad as Chaos Dragon or Buddyfight, but is still pretty mediocre. one thing that Bothers me a lot is that at fist i thought they we're Kids... but they are Teenagers and Adults!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n*sigh* where do even begin with them? in fact, it's hard to say anything about them because... they are all Forgivable! there is Kurumi that has a weapon that is a Shovel (if Shovel Knight exists so why not?) but she is not very Interesting like... at all! there is Miki which is the 2nd most Annoying character because she literally calls all the Girls mostly by \"Senpai\" all the Freaking time. there is Yuuri which is a Calm (and also dangerous) woman who is pretty Bland... and then you have Yuki... which is the Most annoying Character in the Anime, she is the only one that Ignores that there is a Zombie pack on the School and tries to live a \"EXCITING\" life on School, she is Hyper Active and pretty Stupid too. there is also Megumi Sakura which is average, and Taromaru which is a dog that... nah, just a dog. overall, all Characters are Dreadful\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nnothing much to say about it really... it's pretty forgivable and not a single track stands out! the Voice acting is Standard and very bad, especially Yuki's voice acting! hearing her voice was like Trying to beat the Racing Stage from Battle toads at 3x Speed. Aka: Impossible and just flat out annoying!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nthe Enjoyment of this anime is like your patient on School lessons. it's not Fun, it's boring and you just want to end it fast as possible so you could do something better. this Anime was a mistake to watch! and the Last Episode and ending was probably the most Unrealistic and Utterly Ridiculous thing i have ever seen in my entire life! I've seen Thriller that is done Well, and Thriller that is done Poorly... and sadly, School Live is a Example of being done Wrong... it was not Worth watching it\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 2/10",

            "content": "I am extremely disappointed with the way this show ended. Seeing as that is the case, this review will basically be all spoilers, so read at your own risk.\r\nI'm gonna admit, this was one of the more enjoyable shows for me this season. I rate heavily on personal enjoyment, so for the most part, this series was high up on my seasonal watch queue. No, I did not like the characters although I do understand that they were meant as a contrast of the world they were living in. No, I didn't like the sudden, out of the blue tone shifts that the show presented.No, I didn't think that this show was tapping into the full potential of what it could have done, but hey, it was enjoyable, so I kept coming back.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go to episode 11, shall we? This was, by far, the best episode School-Live! had put out. It felt like the characters were truly desperate, they were genuinely terrified, and that all hope seemed lost. They were struggling with just about everything and on the brink of death throughout the entire episode. Not only that, but holy shit was the music in this episode good. I'd say around the 9 minute mark when the portable radio was played and the soft, enchanting singing started drifting out as you see the character's struggling to stay alive was phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was extremely excited to see what episode 12 (the grand finale) would bring us.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it completely let me down. It was bullshit. I'm about to list all the things awful about this episode, so be prepared for a shitstorm of complaining. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, it's not possible that Taromaru remembered Yuki and saved her life. It's a zombie. Everything leading up to that point would have suggested that, while the zombies are relatively aware, they do not have control over their actions, they act to kill. Taromaru saving Yuki would blatantly state that the zombies can control themselves and enact self-restraint, of which none do, let alone a dog which has about 1% of the mental capacity humans do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then all it fucking took for the whole problem to solve itself was to say \"School's out, go home\"?! Are you fucking kidding me?! That's just bullshit and I refuse to accept that. It was almost comical it was so overly simple and stupid. That is in no way how a zombie apocalypse story should end. Not only is it just utterly off tone with how the entire series went, it's just illogical. I cannot stress to you enough how bad this ending was. I'm a perverse person. I wanted them all to die and for the series to end. I would have easily given this show a 9 and called it the best of the season. Unfortunately, School-Live! decided that they just weren't going to do that and instead opt for a cop-out.\\n\\n\r\nHow were they to know that there was another dog down there? If I were in that situation I would've just assumed the dog heard a noise and went down there because, let's be honest, it's a dog. That's what dogs do. There is no reason for them to have assumed that, and yet they did, so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the graduation ceremony. Oh man, the graduation ceremony. Don't even get me started (it should be evident that I'm about to get started, it's an expression, leave a \"Helpful\" on my review please). Basically, they just decided that instead of closure, they were gonna go the Angel Beats! route and try to just make you cry as their way of forcing people to like the show. It was disgusting watching high school seniors cry at every slightly inspirational thing people said. And it dragged on for so fucking long. A solid 10 minutes were spent just saying goodbye and whatever else they felt like crying about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the last main problem I have with episode 12 is the lack of closure. So many things left unexplained. How did the outbreak first happen? What was Megu-nee's connection with it? Why did the girls in the school not just construct a ton of weapons so they wouldn't have to rely on that damn shovel for everything? Did they ever get to a safe-house? How do the zombies not starve and rot away? Why has nobody made any attempt to establish long-distance contact? Is the infection localized or is it on a global scale? Where are all the zombies in that final scene where they're just cruising down the highway and there's no one to be seen? And where the fuck are they going?\\n\\n\r\nThis show just made me so mad after how well it set itself up to just dissolve into a mess of emotional crap that I cannot give it a recommendation and the only reason I give it a 7 is because of episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, and as always, feel free to tell me what you thought.",

            "content": "\"Anime is for kids\" they say...  \r\nAsk them to watch this anime. They say \"okay\"...\r\nLooks at Gakkou Gurashi Poster \"Another Moeblob Slice Of Life Anime\" they say..\r\nWatches the first OP \"Why do they put Horror tag?! For sure it\u2019s for kids again\" they say...\r\nWell, this is Madoka Magica version 2.0, where Promotional Posters and OPs will mislead you.\r\nAnyway, here is the review what I\u2019m thinking about. *MINOR to MAJOR SPOILERS ahead\r\nI also feel the same way, thinking that this anime is just going to talk about slice of life and moeness at a world where people are infected and gone, but I was wrong,this is more likely a survival mission for four girls to escape the already ruined city which I assumed Tokyo since one of the news broadcast is \u201cTokyo News\u201d and the fact that we know that this apocalypse happen because of biological weapon used by one of the upper class or an elite organisation in japan for testing, which also includes the school where the four girls studied that had infected most of the citizens in that state. Should had been 5 survivors but ultimately sacrifice herself to save the girls from getting infected, that was where I got depressed real hard. So much of the scene had made me depressed, that I was planning to drop it or not but with strong heart I decide to continue because I had read the manga, though I could partly disagree that some part are not adapted. It is well adapted from the manga and there are some parts that are a bit loosely taken from the manga, but overall they did adapt well, just that I don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t include the most important part of the scene in each manga to the anime, well I could mostly agree due to the timeslot given and also the budget that a company had. Well, it\u2019s great that we could learn how survival and teamwork is all about. It\u2019s great that I can play Left4Dead again after 2 years of hiatus. Mostly, this series focuses on survival in school, graduation, Taroumaru and Megu-nee, which is \u201call but not all scenes\u201d adapted from the manga. Also I got moved by Yuki\u2019s speech towards the zombies which they all ultimately listen to her and went back where they belong and they all graduate from high school. And I do believe that there would be a strong indication of season 2 as if you watch after the ending credits where a girl holds a drawing of Yuki\u2019s 4 group, but it\u2019s just assuming as the manga is still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the animation and the art of this particular anime. Most of the works are all done by Studio Lerche, (remember Carnival Phantasm?) Anyway, the character designs are quite appealing and decent, I love how the situation and the surrounding the city looks like depicting that this story takes place on a post-zombie apocalypse where most of the buildings would be destroyed and all other shits. Anyway, the motion of the zombie, I wonder if I could call it as CGI, is pretty okay, from far it\u2019s more like they are 3D version of zombie but for close up view, they are more like a 2D view. But overall, not much of complaints on the saturations and the smoothness of the animations and art of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that made us mislead is the OP song video, watch closely as you progress throughout the episode, it keeps on changing right? I wonder if this should be in the story comment or sound but anyway let\u2019s just move on, the OP song is really catchy and more like I don\u2019t know how to explain it but I assume they just want to mislead us that this is a moe anime. Well, I do enjoy listen the OP since the title is \u201cFriend Shitai\u201d meaning that it might do with friends or anything. Other than that, most of the seiyuus are well selected, especially on Takeya Yuki and Ebisuzawa Kurumi, for Ebisuzawa Kurumi I was expecting Taneda Risa to voice acting her but it was Ozawa Ari instead voice acting her, kinda disappointed but she did great on voice acting her with the tomboyish voice act, Takeya Yuki is voiced by Iori Minase whom she voiced Hestia, she is really good at voicing cute voice for a 1996 liners. Miki-kun and Rii-san voice actors are also well voiced, it\u2019s enjoyable to listen to all the 4 main characters voices\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters, I will only focus on 2 characters, so let\u2019s begin.  Takeya Yuki, a student of 3-A is an airhead and a good girl student whom she really loves Megu-nee so much, she doesn\u2019t really care about the zombie apocalypse the fact that she create an illusion herself to not seeing her what happen to the past and the current situation in the anime. I do understand her feelings that she wanted a good, enjoyable, school and everyday life and the fact that everything is gone she doesn\u2019t want that to happen so instead she decide to illustrate from the real scene herself where everything is normal, which I kinda feel bad for her. But she does show her courage and has a strong heart even if she start to break down because what\u2019s past is past, we do have to look at the future and she did give the best and heart feeling speech to everyone. Ebisuzawa Kurumi, a strong girl with her shovel carrying her back, her mission is survival and to protect all the four girls from getting infected, she do make comedic scenes which I enjoy. She is also the first girl to get bitten by Megu-nee, but she held strong and managed to survive the infection by antidote which doesn\u2019t work properly leaving her half-human/zombie. But I\u2019m glad she survive before being fully infected, if not, I would most likely to drop the 12th episode.  \\n\r\nSo did I enjoy watching it? Well, from my perspective I do enjoy watching it, and this is the first series I have watched with a horror tag, and the 200th anime to be completed since I started watching anime last year. I do feel depressed after watching this anime as some the key characters had died for example Megu-nee and Taroumaru.  Even if it\u2019s depressing, I\u2019ve learn some good lessons regarding this anime, team working and survival instincts. This shows that, if we don\u2019t learn how to survive then bad consequences would occur, so team work is important, leaving a person alone to do the job would be risky and is best to have two than one to prevent all problems. Glad I enjoy watching Gakkou Gurashi.\\n\\n\r\nWell I would recommend anyone to watch Gakkou Gurashi, yes it has comedy and kawaii scene too and those who are scared of killing, slashing or any violents don't worry, they blurred it out. Also, those who had already watched the Hollywood movies or shows like World War Z, I am Legend, Shawn of the dead, 28 days later, Walking dead and the games like last of us or left4dead, I would recommend you guys to watch this even if it has moe, but the main point is about zombie survival. So I do hope you guys enjoy watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this maybe long and complete nonsense review, I wrote really hard and think hard with some to rewrite this review before posting it fully to the site. I hope this review would be helpful, that doesn\u2019t mean I want to be in the top, but anyway happy watching~ \\n\\n\r\nWell, morals to everyone: \"Don't judge an anime by its cover\", you never know what would happen next.\\n",

            "content": "\"Moe and Dark cannot mix\" -- This is pretty much the same old line I see every time in anime series like these.\r\nThe shows that have a cutesy looking artstyle yet it turns into a dark tone series where you have never expected to become, is a common excuse for the community at times where at times it seems people don't get how these can be used in anime format. For this case, the zombie apocalypse setting is rarely used in the anime format, and the only anime I can remember using this aspect is Highschool of the Dead. This year we got Gakkou Gurashi!,a new summer anime series that came out unexpected to the audience, and yet many known talks about it recently. Well since the series just ended what are my thoughts about the show overall? Is it good? or did it ended up like the previous show with the same aspect? Well let's go and find out together.\\n\\n\r\nNote that this is going to be a very personal perspective thought about the series as a standalone product. I will go and directly go to the perspective thought as an anime only watcher (for the most part) and do not compare with the manga. So keep in mind about the anime review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To start off, the story itself would be at first simple. Our female protagonist Yuki lives in a normal life at \"school?\" and then we find our other cast of characters in the \"school-living club\", where she loves to live in the daily life in the place. By the \"\" I just noted, do you think its normal to live at school? I sure do not think thats normal, because nobody would like to live at school. When you think about it at first glance, the series lets you know in suspicion and of course this works as well with the execution of its actual plot. Or the premise of the show. At the first episode of the series it executes everything perfectly matched that you don't actually notice the foreshadowing happening into your eyes or in front of you, and as the episodes passed by it does foreshadow a lot of things as well with the events thats happening around. The series is all about the aspect of knowing reality and imaginary for the first part of my reason why I like the show. It leads the viewer into suspicion of the weird events happening in the episodes, try to piece things together in other to get the answers. Its like a puzzle piece if you imagine it. The second thing I like about the show is how they mesh the moments well, at least for the entirety of the anime. It leads to development and bonding towards the cast, and of course the flashbacks also works well with the series to know about them. Another thing that I like about the anime is more so of the psychological aspect. By psychological aspect, its by the mentality of the characters and how they're dealing with things throughout the entirety of the series. If you do not know what I mean, in short I mean their sanity. I think its more so of the psychological and also the survival aspect that goes for the cast of characters. That makes the show special in its own way, rather than going all action packed for the most part and its every time mashing and smashing. Of course the anime does has its moments of action and entertainment. The Slice of Life moments also helps out to build up a bond and relationship with the cast even on an anime original standpoint. Of course some of the slice of life moments in the anime (bits of it) were very unnecesary and it could have been better to add more content into the show. Overall the show does handle its execution properly at most cases.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters of the show could be described as simple, but yet memorable. The cast of characters (mainly) consist on 5 characters. Which are Yuki, Miki, Kurumi, Rii, and Megumi. If I can include one more, that would be Taroumaru the dog.\\n\\n\r\nThe five girls are together in the school, we know that, but what do they consist off?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Yuki. She's a jolly, happy, friendly and caring character. Of course a lot of people would say \"But she's crai crai (crazy)\", thats something that for me understandable. But to me Yuki is the only character around that helps the others to move on. Shes considered as the light for everyone in the group, the spark that makes them continue to move on. Even if people think she's crazy, I personally think she's not to my suspicion. She is also a very good person giving advice to the members of the club, which helps a lot for her. Overall for me she's well enough for me to like her.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi (my favorite girl) can be considered as the strong character of the anime series. She's brave, courageous, and also caring for her members. She had also a backstory which for me was very well done to know very well her suffering after the whole incident. Of course at times she acts very cute and nicely, but when it comes to the fight scenes, she knows how to get shit done right (at most). Shes also determined to go to bigger things during the anime, which makes me applaud her a lot.\\n\\n\r\nRii-san can be considered as the bigger sister pretty much in the group. Of course at first she's just your average and typical \"big boobs\" character, but she does contribute at least a bit of a role in the anime. She's observant, very strict, and as well with taking care of everyone. She's pretty much the mother of the whole group, as well with her words and speeches along in the anime she does as well give some push onto the little members. Of course as well, she's considered fun at times.\\n\\n\r\nMii-kun is pretty much the newer member to the group, at first she was just your stereotypical \"Senpai Senpai\" girl, but there was a reason behind that. And that was because of her backstory which she had more screentime to get fleshed out enough. She used to have a friend, and her perspective way in her backstory caused a lot of impact towards what happened. It made impact as well during after a bit of the anime series, and as well with her trying to get attached to Taroumaru, their bonds built on well enough at least. She's considered someone that wants to know more about Yuki, but as well with that, she's also intelligent and smart at times when its needed.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi (also known as Megu-nee) was the center of the whole group, also known as the teacher in the anime series. She's well known as the caring and friendly teacher, and she wants everyone to survive. She's also someone that doesn't want to be strict by her positions due to her being the teacher and the members being the students, as she also wants to have an equal relationship with them and protect them in any way possible (thats how I look at it). She was the center and involved for most characters of the anime, and getting a fleshed out backstory of the whole incident was simply well done.\\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting cast, to not go into the full edge detail. The whole supporting cast can be described as the center of each one of the characters of the anime pretty much. As for Taroumaru as an extra member as he is of course the mascot of the anime series, he was well put enough in the anime and make some sort of relevance, and of course he's the best puppy ever if I can say. The puppy and Mii-kun moments were the best moments in the anime. Thats what I can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: To start off, lets say that the artstyle for the series, is pretty much simple. Moe. Nah I'm joking with that simple statement. The art can be considered as high quality and yet decent artstyle fitting for the cast of colors. The series actually looks at times colorful and bright coloring at times, and sometimes in the anime when it comes to the tension moments it give a darker shade tone where it looks at the atmosphere. As for the animation I would say it was done well for the most part, especially at the fight scenes when it came for Kurumi. It just looked fantastic and fluid, it doesn't look that choppy or cracky. Or Jarring.\\n\\n\r\nHowever my only issue with the anime series would be once again, the CGI Zombies used at times during the anime. Its not a big issue because its not used that much, but at some places it just looks out of place and it doesn't look right for certain occassions of the anime. It just looks like also budget copy and paste at the same zombies, which makes it jarring. Overall the Art/Animation department is good despite that issue I found.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: To describe the manner of the music and sound department, the components are by far the strongest one out of all of them. The music for the first part of it, can be described as calming, and darkening tone. It uses different types of compositions in order to flow with the scenarios of the series. For example for the psychological aspect it uses a more so distorted OST, and for the emotional moments it uses a more instrumental and yet emotional OST. It fits with the scenarios very well and for me they become memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department it can be also described as amazing. You don't realize it at times, but when it comes to the moments when they're in danger, it gives a goosebumps and a very scared feeling, that cannot be explained. It just looks like an actual movie, where you get these moments of tension and you get a lot of the slaps and screams.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, here's a personal note. I actually screamed and fell down on my back one time during this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs well with the voice acting it fits with its cast very well, especially Kurumi and Miki. I love those voice actresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with a tiny bit of issues I tell you in the anime, its quite shocking I get to enjoy the show and feel so vastly invested in it. Of course if it wasn't for someone in particular to not skip it, I would have missed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIts a very good anime worth watching, expected from Lerche delivering this was not even surprising how much I love the series to death.",

            "content": "The most Moe but terrifying thing you will ever see! For this review I will be focusing on story, Characters and my enjoyment. [In order for me to write this review, I will have to give out a spoiler since a major plot twist happens in the first episode]\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of gakkougurashi is fairly simple. A zombie apocalypse takes place and traps a group of students in a school house. However the twist is that the protagonist sees the world as if everything around her is normal. I loved this show! the story telling was remarkable and some moments were so effective that I wasgenuinely crying. If you are looking forward to shedding a tear or two then give gakkougurashi a try. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of gakkougurashi are very likable. This show likes to do a little thing with it's characters. At the beginning, this show gets you to adore it's characters with some very cute and playful scenes, and then afterwards as the story progresses, the show puts it's characters into dangerous situations. Even if the character is a zombie, the show will make you care so much for that zombie that you wouldn't know who to root for. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: I enjoyed Gakkougurashi, a lot and I am not forgetting it any time sooner. The only problem I had with this show is the puppy, there was this puppy in this show who was very cute, but the puppy was stupid. He was the cause for a lot of the situations that the main characters were put into. Every time the puppy would wander of on his own and the characters would need to find him. However I cared for the puppy more than I expected to, towards the end.",

            "content": "** WARNING : Contains Spoilers **\r\nOne of the best Zombie Apocalypse Anime I have ever seen. It is about a group of girls, trying to live off in the world affected by zombie Apocalypse.\r\nThis Anime starts off as a Moe Anime, but gets dark in the First Episode itself. It isn't the zombies that make it dark.\r\nThe only thing that sets it different from other Animes, is Yuki (Main Character) who refuses the accept the zombie Apocalypse and pretends everything is fine.\r\nShe talks to her friends as if they are present, alive, and attending school just like she is. Unfortunately, they have all turned tozombies.\\n\\n\r\nWe see the reason for this peculiar behaviour explained in the last few episodes. The reason is sad and depressing. Although one might speculate it as a reaction to having lost her friends, there is something else to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n** Spoilers ahead : Don't read if you haven't watched the anime. 100% Recommended to watch **\\n\\n\r\nI haven't cried for so some time. After binge watching Your Lie in April, Clannad, followed by Violet Evergarden etc.., this Anime adds to the list.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\n* Yuki : (Main Character) She has lost her friends, and someone really close to her. Megu-nee held her with love. She tries to keep her promise to Megu-nee of \"never losing the smile\", and thus ends up pretending everyone was alive and OK. Her loss drove her into insanity and thus she began to refuse the reality, and the moe nature originates.\\n\\n\r\nThough she might seem as a burden, It is important to remember, that we are trying to save humanity. If we were to ditch a non infected human, It won't make us different than the zombies.\\n\\n\r\n* Kurumi : She knows how to wield the sword (shovel in this case :p), and fight. She is only one who had thrown out her feelings and fear for the zombies and was able to kill them.\\n\\n\r\n* Yuri : She does practically nothing, but is the brains of the school-live! club.  Her uncanny resemblance to Megu-nee is gradually revealed though.\\n\\n\r\n(!Spoilers)\\n\r\n* Miki : She is the only person not to have met Megu-nee. Atleast not till the end. \\n\\n\r\n* Megu-Nee : Teacher at this school.\\n\\n\r\nEx Teacher at this school.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, she pops out of nowhere and only talks with Yuki. She can't hold stuff and says they are too heavy. No one else talks to her. Her teleporting herself into the car (Ep 4) was creepy. One can foresee, she isn't alive, and is just a mental image created by Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nShe plays an important role in creating the school-live club and guiding it in the initial stages. She gets infected protecting the children, and turns into a zombie. Yuki was the only person, who could not accept it, and began her hallucinations.\\n\r\nShe tried to keep her promise of \"always smiling\".\\n\r\nShe was the guide in life and in death.\\n\\n\r\nI lost it when Yuki says \"Bye-Bye Megu-nee\".. :'(\\n\\n\r\nHonourable Mentions:\\n\r\n* Taroumaru : A dog, a friend and the second zombie to have helped the club. RIP. You shall be remembered for your bravery and loyal nature. RIP, my friend.\\n\\n\r\n* Zombies : They play a important role too. Zombies tend to remember the memories. The reason they hang around near school is that they loved to come to school. This love had been etched into their memories, and is the reason why they came to school everyday. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot : This Anime is not much of Horror, but of Psychological and Slice of Life Genre.\\n\r\nBoth these elements are strong enough to make a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe group of girls take shelter at the school, which surprisingly had lot of amenities like Solar powered electricity, rooftop garden (vegetables were grown), and what not. Perfect for taking shelter in a zombie Apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a coincidence? No. The reason is also revealed later as to why the amenities were there in the first place.\\n\r\nThe girls spend their days living in the school, cooking food, cleaning, and routine checks and trips for rations etc.\\n\r\nYuki spends her time in classroom, being tutored by a delusional Megu-nee.\\n\\n\r\nYuki's memory return gradually. And accepts the reality. Although she saw it with her own eyes, she refused to believe it. It was sad and depressing when Yuki talks to that door. :(\\n\\n\r\nIt is ok to be sad for one's death. The important thing is to let go \\n\r\nand not let your emotions take over to the extreme that you refuse to accept reality. \\n\r\n(A similar message was given in the Anime : \"Another\" )\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Episode specific*\\n\r\nFor people who feel they are just doing nothing, there isn't much to be done. A school is NOT equipped with killing equipments.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, for those who say, why they returned to school, instead of going away, that's becaue\\n\r\n- the school had electricity, water, food supplies.\\n\r\n- Power was cut off at other places\\n\r\n- They realized the potential of the school in keeping them alive. Any other place, they would have died earlier.\\n\r\n- They thought the infection had spread to a very wide range. They might not be able to travel that distance with a car without getting out of fuel. (Remember power is cut, so gas stations are useless), unless they find a way to dig into the underground fuel tank.\\n\r\n- They didn't knew of any other shelter places.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it made sense to return back to school.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, many people feel why they didn't go on a killing spree. It is important to remember that they are children. Murder is not a native instinct, especially not for a child.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is excellent. And one of the unique zombie apocalypse. Personally, it is the best one. I cried the last 2-3 Episodes (the whole episode) :'( .\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10 / 10 (A recommended watch)\\n\\n\r\n~Recoder",

            "content": "Contrary to many of those in the anime community, I\u2019m not actually a big fan of moe. I don\u2019t dislike it per se, but I could care less about its inclusion in shows. Despite this, I think it fits remarkably well in the case of Gakkougurashi. The juxtaposition between the cute girls and the dark things surrounding them makes for an interesting dynamic, even if it isn\u2019t entirely original and has been done better by other shows. I include this as an introduction to assure those reading this that my review isn't influenced by the use of cute anime girls (at least consciously, to myknowledge).\\n\r\nI\u2019ll refrain from spoiling anything about the show in case you\u2019re one of the few who hasn\u2019t heard a thing about it. Doing so; however, will be difficult as there is a massive plot twist at the end of the first episode. Because of the lack of spoilers, this review may seem oddly vague at times.\\n\r\n[Story 6/10]\t[Characters 9/10]\\n\r\n\tThe story of Gakkougurashi is, simply put, rather basic. It follows the usual plot you\u2019d expect from the type of show it\u2019s trying to be after episode 1. There is one point where it seems as though there may be something interesting added to the plot, but it\u2019s never pursued and is left unanswered. This is something that very well could be solved by a second season, but that's looking unlikely at the moment. Very little progression is actually made in the plot; however, that isn\u2019t where the show places most of its focus. The focus of the show is on its characters, their relationships with each other, and their struggle to survive in the harsh world. The small cast of characters are all well developed and have unique personalities, even if none in particular stand out. Without spoiling anything, one of the characters faces a \u201cmental disorder\u201d, for lack of a better term, that she has to overcome. Her challenge of getting over her problem is well developed and is definitely one of the highlights of the show. Even Taroumarou, their dog, is a likable character with a nice \u201cpersonality\u201d. Though its story may fall flat, the characters of Gakkougurashi manage to carry it forward.\\n\r\n\t\t[Art 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThe animation almost always remained fluid and didn\u2019t have any noticeable problems. In the happier scenes, brighter colors are used, whereas the darker scenes were less saturated. The art didn\u2019t really stand out too much, but it looked nice and was able to convey the story it was trying to tell successfully.\\n\r\n\t\t[Sound 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack of the series is well composed, but it\u2019s nothing too special. Specifically, some of the tracks manage to sound happy but have a dark undertone to them (comparable to say, Over the Garden Wall) which was a very fitting touch, though it wasn\u2019t many. A few of the darker and more emotional pieces were great, managing to carry a lot of meaning. I have no complaints regarding the voice acting, though it wasn\u2019t anything jaw-dropping. The sound of Gakkougurashi has its strong points in its music, but, for the most part, it\u2019s only slightly above average.\\n\r\n\t\t[Enjoyment 9/10]\\n\r\n\tSomething I didn\u2019t know whether or not to mention in the \u201cstory\u201d section of the review was the show's atmosphere. I decided it fit better here, as a well-crafted atmosphere relies on a blend of all of the above categories. With that said, the atmosphere of Gakkougurashi is very well portrayed. At any point in the show, even during the happier moments, it feels as though something bad is lurking just around the corner. It manages to keep the viewer on their toes at all times, even if nothing bad happens all that often over the course of the show. Because the first episode is from the eyes of the main character, Yuki and her disorder, a certain level of \u201ctrust\u201d with the show is broken that makes you continue to question things throughout the episodes. This almost psychological manipulation employed by the show was well executed and, just when you think you may be overly paranoid, it throws a twist at you. From the atmosphere of the show, I move onto the rest of the things I enjoyed in it. I was very attached to the characters, and I often found myself on the edge of my seat when something bad was about to happen to them. When they managed to pull through, I\u2019d experience an overwhelming feeling of relief. The sad scenes of the show were also heartbreaking, though they do suffer the same fate as any 12 episode series in that they may not have had as much build up as they otherwise could have had. The simple slice of life aspect in between the darker events happening was enjoyable to watch, more so if you take into account the atmosphere of paranoia in the viewer.\\n\r\n\t\t[Overall 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThough it only had a slightly above average soundtrack, decent art, and a sub-par plot, the blend of the three made for a phenomenal atmosphere. The small cast of well-developed characters placed in this atmosphere enhanced the show dramatically. I\u2019d recommend this show to anyone looking for a dark show with some interesting plot twists that\u2019ll keep you alert at all times.\\n",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!) is not your average Slice of Life style anime. Following the life of Yuki Takeya, it seems that this would appear to be your average anime of a cheerful girl who enjoys school. However, this is but an illusion. In reality, society and humanity has fallen due to a zombie apocalypse. Four girls have banded together in their school to survive this ongoing nightmare, while trying to maintain their daily lives of being students. As the story progresses, each episode will mess with your thoughts and emotions gradually until the very end where it destroys you. The art is graphic in some scenes,but overall very well made, as is the soundtrack. Each character is given their own ideals and ambitions, while at the same time keeping the similar to one another. Yuki is the playful, cheery girl. Miki is the quiet, stoic type. Yuuri (Rii) is the big sister and caretaker of the group. Kurumi is brave and adventurous, being the group's defender (thank you, Shovel Knight). After each episode, you'll be left with wanting more and more, trembling at the thought of what might happen next. Overall, Gakkougurashi! is a great (9/10) anime that deserves high recognition in being unique while not differentiating too much.",

You\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re testing your emotions and attachment to the characters and, what I think is the most important, you\u2019re trying to survive this show\u2019s surprises. Of course, Yuki, Yuuri, Miki, Megumi and Kurumi living in a besieged school and creating a \u201cschool-living club\u201d are kind of generic example of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d formula. Especially joyful and careless Yuki Takeya, the engine of this anime and one of better thought fictitious figures in the last years. Nevertheless, I think that \u201cGakkougurashi!\u201d represents something deeper than a superficial zombie apocalypse or/and moe genre. It\u2019s a show aboutsurviving, yes. But rather than surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, it\u2019s more important here to consider that the characters deal with a loss of their friends, animals, families. It\u2019s also a beautiful show about moving on and acceptance. About looking after those who need it the most. It\u2019s an anime about friendship and mutual help. This is also the reason why I appreciate it a lot: because of its metaphorical values in which zombies walking around the school are just parables. Warning! Many tears will drop. Many sudden changes of tone are to be expected. Heartbreaking twists perhaps? See it yourself! 9/10.",

            "content": "To the reader: \r\n-~- I feel it's absolutely best to go into this show with no prior knowledge. The synopsis here is vague for a reason. Go in with an open mind and no expectations, and I think the viewer will have a much better experience. -~-\r\nI first encountered Gakkou Gurashi about 6 months ago- when it was announced as a Summer series anime. Reading the description, I got absolutely nothing from it- but a little more digging led to the discovery that it was a cross between moe and post apocalytpic with some emphasis on psychological narrative. I was immediately interested- as I'd neverseen such a combination before, and it sounded like it might be cool. \\n\\n\r\nCue the first episode- They say you can't have plot twists in the first episode... they were wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup and lead on with how we were seeing things versus in actuality were very surprising- shocking even. It had some of the most amazing framing and dissonance between the mental state of Yuki and her projection of reality I'd seen- and I was hooked. The subtle imagery as Yuki and Miki ran through the school, culminating with that classroom shot was incredible. I don't want to say too much here, because it's best to not know anything, but I really thought I finally had a worthy successor to the moe-horror that Higurashi had established itself queen of... but all was not well. \\n\\n\r\nBy the 4th or 5th episode, it was plain that Yuki's mental state and her way of dealing with (or not dealing with) the newly ruined world was not the focus of the show, but instead turned into this wishy washy dark and suspenseful tale one moment and slice of life cute-girls-doing-cute-things the next. While this type of flip flopping set up a really good vehicle for really hitting the viewer with the hard moments due to how light and fluffy it had been, Gakkou Gurashi still wasn't above typical moe/school show pitfalls. I mean, I get that school is in the name- School Live! being the closest English translation, but the inclusion of a pure fanservice episode at a KEY moment in the show, at the absolute climax was a horrible decision. \\n\\n\r\nWhen everything is on the line, and major decisions and changes are about to happen- why not just throw in a swimsuit episode? Because what we needed in a unique show was SOMETHING ELSE to make it just like every other anime involving schoolgirls- some good ol T&A. \\n\r\nI can't stress enough how badly this wrecked the very tense and suspenseful atmosphere they had painstakingly built up - a real tragedy in an anime that  could have been something better. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nIn a lesser show, there would have been a lot of pointless side characters introduced- but Gakkou Gurashi stays strong with an unchanging cast of four. With the focus on their interactions, we really get a feel for how these characters are as people, and actually care for them- something not many anime manage to achieve. While Yuki's incessant naivet\u00e9 is grating at times, at the point when I got sickest of it- the mood changes, and her illusionary existence comes crashing down, prompting a great shift in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the apocalypse, I think few people realize how important your health is. Often in such shows, the main characters are taken to heroic feats and ridiculous Deus Ex Machina moments because, well... they're the main characters and \"they can't die, hah!\" In this however, the sense of vulnerability is always looming. The characters remark over the course of the show how they realize that they can't stay at their school forever, and that there seems to be an ever increasing threat outside their tiny haven, and this gently increasing tension comes to a head at about the same time the sickening moe garbage was making my head hurt. The sense that the characters were in real danger and may die was there- and I genuinely expected deaths, I just had no idea whom. It was a really rewarding watch in that aspect, because the characters didn't just pull magic out of the hat, or develop supernatural powers. Gakkou Gurashi definitely stays very grounded, and I appreciated that very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left a bit to be desired though. It was the kind of feel good ending that probably everyone saw coming, and with the buildup to it, I was expecting a bit more given the dark conclusion it was foreshadowing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSide Note: \\n\r\nOne thing I've discussed about zombie media is the portrayal of how the apocalypse came to be, and whether it takes one of three routes that form the basis for the conflict: \\n\\n\r\n1.\tThat Science did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It\u2019s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that\u2019ll fool the teen demographic. \\n\r\n2.\tA Wild Virus Appeared! Some mutated microbe that\u2019s unaffected by any drug affects all but some small number of populace who, by plot convenience, don\u2019t contract the illness. \\n\r\n3.\tWho cares! Zombies are here and we have to destroy/evade/hide from them to survive! \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Gakkou Gurashi took route 3, but definitely with some shades of route 2. The subject of a virus and a planned response by the government was touched on, but it was never the forefront issue brought up as to why. Again, it doesn't really matter why the zombies are there- and it didn't need a pseudo scientific explanation to prove to me, the watcher, that it was that thought out. That part of the setting doesn't matter- it's how the characters DEAL with it that does. For the most part- they dealt with it. But then again, that's the conflict, isn't it? How does one deal with it?\\n\\n\\n\r\nScoring: \\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\\n\r\nConsistently good, but not anything special- definitely some excellent single frame shots with great small details and framing\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7 \\n\r\nCutesy intro, cutesy outro, cutesy insert music, and cutesy VA. What else is there to say?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nSince we had a full season to get to know and examine the characters, they feel genuine and the audience is actually given enough fodder to decide whether they care about/like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nPost Apocalyptia X moe, little bit of drama, some suspense, and enough Slice of Life to fill everyone's need for the mundane. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nWith the inclusion of a completely wasted fanservice episode and a few \"you idiot\" moments, that knocked it down a point. Strong beginning and a decent made up for it though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nIf a departure from the typical moe blob show into a bit darker territory is something you might be interested in, why not?",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!) was a surprise for many viewers of the 2015 summer season lineup. With a 1st episode that threw all convention out the window, it didn't take long for it to garner buzz within the anime community. While I entered with some second-hand knowledge of the involvement of zombies in the show's plot\u2014due to the inescapable whispers coming down the grapevine\u2014I assumed that the subject matter would have merely been treated as a backdrop for cute girls to get involved in silly, tension-less slapstick; with the overbearingly cutesy aesthetic that it was sporting on its cover photo being used as my basis for assessment.I was expecting something along the lines of 2015's Re-Kan, where the supernatural elements were just treated as a mere comedic gag, rather than anything integral to the narrative.\\n\r\nAnd while the deceptive(troll) opening theme and most of the show's 1st episode run-time had me duped into believing my assumption, that premature assessment was quickly shattered with the show's ominous reveal towards the latter end of the episode. Of course, there were a few foretelling signs with the way some characters were acting and visual cues scattered throughout the episode, but I was still fooled nonetheless. With that being said, to get the most out of this title, I highly suggest you refrain from doing any research on it beforehand and just watch it blind. So unless you've already watched the show or simply don't care, I advise you to stop reading this review any further. And with that warning in place, for everyone else, on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of \"cute girls doing cute things\" to zombie apocalypse was certainly an odd departure not often seen in anime. In fact, I don't recall anything going down that specific route at all. The closest point of comparison is magical girl shows that take a darker turn as it progresses (Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica), or shows that use sickeningly cute characters and slice-of-life moments before venturing into a bone-chilling bloodbath (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni). But as far as anything that follows directly in Gakkou's footsteps, I'm drawing blanks. At the very least, I can say it's a unique experience. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the \"cute girls doing cute things\" formula is omnipresent throughout the show, it's the moments that it skews into a more unnerving, sinister tone that really makes it stand out. Like the hunting technique practiced by the Angela fish, Gurashi baits the viewer in with a warm, radiant glow surrounding its material, helping lower any defensive walls that might have been set in place. And in this brief instance that you're lulled into a carefree disposition, Gurashi proceeds to pull the rug from under you, as the illusion of comfort fizzles away into something more visceral and disturbing. Gurashi's ability to toy with the viewer's response goes beyond a simple bait-and-switch, it's a sleight-of-hand trick that not many storytellers are capable of executing well. While some of the tonal shifts throughout the show doesn't always transition to the best of its ability (due to improper cohesion between the polar opposite genres being played with), it still manages to keep you on your toes when \"shit hits the fan.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd perhaps the best illustration of this technique in motion can be seen when discussing the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nYuki Takeya, our main lead, is a person only tethered to sanity thanks to the willingness of her friends to walk on eggshells in her presence. With such a fragile PTSD mindset that's standing at the edge of rational thought\u2014the likes of which could be toppled with the slightest nudge; a great deal of the show's appeal comes from essentially watching a human ticking time-bomb that could be sent spiraling into madness at any given second. She's Gurashi's central focus and rightfully so, as she not only stands as a psychologically disturbed individual but more importantly, an embodiment of this very delicate duality between escapism and the harsh reality that this anime will come to be to known for. This topsy-turvy mental state was brought to life with visual cues that demanded the viewer's attention. Brightly lit hallways and classrooms teaming with jovial faces are singed away for dilapidated structures and bloodstained walls. We're forced to commandeer Yuki's point of view, watching the murky line between the happy past-life she chooses to embrace as her reality, while the actual truth she rejects\u2014the bloody aftermath of what was once a loving school environment\u2014be the reason that her mind is slowly being torn apart. The subconscious of a girl where only two options exist: either carry on living in denial or be permanently broken if made to face the truth of this post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world\u2014the ultimate catch-22. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while Yuki's involvement brought the necessary intrigue needed to hook audiences in for more, I can't say the rest of the characters boasted the same ability. They were given episodes dedicated to fleshing out their backstory, but their personalities, from beginning to end, were rather one-note. At best, they had the basic requirements covered to carry the narrative but nothing noteworthy beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nBut for everything that Gakkougurashi had going for it, there was a clear misunderstanding of the essentials needed to craft its content into a great show; more specifically, where to further its concept from being more than simply a novelty act. Today, we'll discuss the two major issues that prevented Gurashi from reaching the inner-circles of universal critical acclaim that it so desperately desires.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st major issue that quickly became apparent with each passing episode was the way the show handled Yuki's mental state. When dealing with a mentally disturbed individual, proper psychoanalysis and character exploration is needed to make the broken person's psyche believable. Without it, we're simply given a gimmick that's only viable on superficial terms. With Gurashi, we see the events that trigger the mental breakdown of the character, but it's never explored beyond face value. There's no actual introspection given to justify the way the character is presented. And sadly, because of this, it's reduced to only being used as a ploy for shock value and generating easy-to-consume entertainment. It may have been intended to be more than just that, but it just wasn't detailed enough to get that point across. Since all of the characters were already cookie-cutter stereotypes and no visible effort was shown to develop or add dimension to them, the show, as a result, often felt shallow. \\n\r\nIt didn't have the finesse of something like Perfect Blue, where we get a 1st person perspective into the mind of our protagonist as we experience her gradual breakdown between what's real and imaginary, playing out through the narrative and in her mannerisms. Nor was it like Abenobashi, where the internal strife of the main character was externalized into a visual metaphor for further inspection, while also dedicating time to flesh him out as a grief-stricken teen going through a phase of denial.\\n\\n\r\n\"Show, don't tell\" and \"shock and awe\" were something Gurashi seem to struggle to distinguish between, which was ultimately the reason it was kept off the pedestal with those that did do this kind of character breakdown right. Simply put, it was a case of style over substance that became painfully obvious when the gimmick of the character's mental state was recycled every episode for entertainment value instead of thematic relevance.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd major issue was the story progression itself, or should I stay, the lack thereof. If viewed as a character-driven narrative, it fell short of the mark (noted by the aforementioned problems I discussed), and if viewed as a plot-driven narrative, it was a monotonous dribble that repeated the same shtick every episode. It was \"moe\" antics followed by dark, demented slice-of-life on constant repeat. The reason this worked for shows like Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was because of the commitment made after the plot twist. Once it revealed the major tonal shift to its viewers, it gradually leaned and stayed in the \"darker\" territory. There was no flip-flopping back and forth between cutesy and dark, which in turn added poignancy to the central conflict at hand. It kept moving forward to its inevitable destination and was never back-peddling. This was Gurashi's fatal flaw and ultimately what placed the final nail in its coffin. It simply spun its wheels in the mud, thinking it can depend on the same trick to carry it from beginning to end. And because of this, the show was always stuck in a state of stagnation. The only episodes that tried to break this cycle were the final ones, but by then, the damage was already done. \\n\\n\r\nHad Gurashi dedicated the effort necessary to make Yuki more than just a circus act for our amusement, or placed more effort in its narrative to avoid meandering in circles, it could have been one of the best highlights from 2015. But like many shows with an exciting premise, Gurashi just didn't know how to deliver in the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot twists and shock factor moments made the show a fun spectacle, I couldn't help but feel a lack of engagement. The moe aesthetic and sensationalized depiction of Yuki's damaged state stopped all chances of the severe moments of Gurashi from really having a firm grip on me. This was also the problem I had with Higurashi and Madoka Magica, despite their more successful rendition of this kind of storytelling. They too succumbed to this trigger-happy depiction of cuteness meet sinister. It's just something I can't see beyond an entertaining party trick. And since Gurashi kept jumping back and forth between lighthearted moe and demented slice-of-life, after a while, the novelty that had won it so much attention had quickly faded away; something that's made all the more self-evident from the lack of staying-power it's had among anime enthusiasts. It was enjoyable at times but only on a surface level, and in the end, left me more underwhelmed than satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nGakkougurashi had the potential to make something that subverted the typical formula associated with the \"cute girls doing cute things\" setup but ultimately did nothing to capitalize off of it. Sadly, it's yet another case of a good premise underutilized and poorly handled. The right ingredients were there but at the end of the day, what was served up was a lukewarm dud.",

            "content": "If you have no idea what this show is about, you\u2019re one of the lucky few that can still dive into this quirky \u2018slice of life at school\u2019 show blind. It\u2019s mostly centred on antics and club events thought up by Yuki, guided by the athletic Kurumi and motherly Yuuri. You\u2019ll either love Yuki, (she\u2019s so crazy~) or empathise with Miki\u2019s level-headed reactions to her; Miki acts as a foil to Yuki, providing some gravitas to the show. After one episode you will likely either want to drop it or watch the rest. If you don\u2019t know anything about it, watch an episode before youread the rest of the review.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading on past this paragraph I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019ve either finished the first episode or at least know what happens in it. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to describe the show without giving away things that happen in the first episode, but I\u2019ll avoid spoiling anything beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone had come up with the idea of \u2018moe horror\u2019 I would have regarded it with the same suspicion that I would regard a \u2018death-game harem\u2019, or a \u2018mecha romance\u2019. It\u2019s all well and good in theory, but if you try to keep a consistent tone while staying true to the concept you\u2019re inevitably going to wind up with too much \u2018harem\u2019 and not enough \u2018death-game\u2019, or too much \u2018moe\u2019 and not enough \u2018horror\u2019 (or, to continue with the analogy, some really inorganic character development). To balance out the conflicting themes in this instance you really need some sort of excuse to violently flip between a light-hearted slice of life show and a dark post-apocalyptic horror without breaking the audience\u2019s immersion. Fortunately, one method to making this strange transition between completely different tones work resides under Yuki\u2019s cat-ear beanie. With what comes across as either complete insanity or a pathological determination to keep things happy and light-hearted, Yuki manages to get the other characters to forget about their situation, which in turn lulls the audience into that same sense of security. With such a setup, flipping the show back into a horror is as simple as cutting away from the mood Yuki has created. \\n\\n\r\nWe soon discover that the show\u2019s title is a clever pun in more ways than one. \u2018Gakkougurashi\u2019 follows the daily lives of a cast of mostly schoolgirls that are quite literally living at a school, flipping between their attempts to have fun and enjoy their lives on a day-to-day basis, on the one hand, and showing how each of them found themselves in such a situation, on the other. \\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of \u2018School-Live!\u2019 is spent on flashbacks, showing events that led up to their current situation. This approach takes away from the tangible sense of threat, but has the advantage of bringing the oh-so-rational Miki into the first episode (which is an amazing thing for people that aren\u2019t a huge fan of Yuki). It\u2019s a trade-off and a departure from the source material, which unfortunately leads to a few minor plot holes being ripped open from the fabric of the narrative. Given the context of the narrative presented, I was happy for them to spend plenty of time showing how the situation had come to be the way it was. That\u2019s where most of the excitement of this setting should reasonably come from given the nature of the show. Once our protagonists have managed to find safety, the plot as it is generally needs to rely on their desperation or stupidity to inject any new threat into the narrative without the audience losing immersion, so focusing on the lead-up to their situation was a good idea overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters vary widely in personality traits and outlook, and you\u2019ll likely find that at least one of them has a mentality you can gel with. The power dynamic and relationships between the girls are multifaceted and interesting mainly because of what they represent. Yuuri holds an unspoken and uncontested authority over the group as a pre-designated maternal leader, Kurumi is a hot-headed badass that quickly resorts to violence, Yuki is a psychotic and emotionally manipulative idealist, Miki is a stoic and cold-shouldered pessimist, and Megu-nee is very similar to that clumsy yet lovable substitute teacher you likely once had: she panics, falls over, and drops things, and is ignored far too often by her students when they don\u2019t need her help. From that melting pot of conflicting ideals and character archetypes comes a series of friendships built from necessity; built upon the cornerstone that is the hardship of their desperate situation.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of self-awareness maintained in the writing throughout, whether it\u2019s (quite literally) pointing to other works that it has drawn inspiration from (such as the movie \u2018I am Legend\u2019 and the novels of Stephen King), or lampshading apparent plot contrivances by having the characters ask questions the audience were themselves wondering about (viz. why is this school so oddly well prepared for what happened?). This is one of the biggest strengths of the show and a huge part of why I\u2019m comfortable giving it a high score. The writers clearly knew the artistic context of what they were doing and had a reasonable sense of how the audience would react to what they were seeing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of \u201828 Moes Later\u2019, however, was an unfortunate stumbling block that marred the show in some respects. I\u2019m not against the \u2018moe\u2019 art design and see nothing intrinsically wrong with it (except that it\u2019s being used so often in modern anime that any departure from it feels like a breath of fresh air). The problem is moments of laziness and inconsistency that were obvious enough to be distracting: the characters are occasionally drawn out of proportion or with slightly misplaced features. It\u2019s not something I would normally bring up, but it\u2019s an obvious bad sign when such mistakes are even apparent to people that aren\u2019t looking for them.\\n\\n\r\nI briefly mentioned before that this show had departed from the source material in several respects. Some of these changes were worse than others. The inclusion of Miki in the first episode was a reasonably appropriate change from the manga; however, cutting out most of Miki\u2019s character development by simplifying her backstory was a strange decision. If only they hadn\u2019t included multiple episodes worth of drawn out sequences of events that did nothing to further the plot (viz. filler), we could have at the very least blamed the restrictions in episode length and number for biting the source material in the backstory! Speaking of backsides, that\u2019s about how abruptly (and awkwardly) this show segues into fanservice. The artistic direction panders to its audience in this regard to the point where it gets in the way of the plot; the writers of the show seemed to hold contempt for the idea that there are only so many appropriate times and places for panty shots or getting changed into bikinis. Fortunately these moments don\u2019t tend to occur in conjunction with the more \u2018dark\u2019 scenes, a plot contrivance that I\u2019m more than happy to forgive when faced with the alternative (a brutal deconstruction in more ways than one). Suffice to say, if you\u2019re put off by unnecessary fanservice you may find a few scenes cringeworthy. Most of it is well within the bounds of plausible deniability though, so it\u2019s fair to bet that you won\u2019t find it worth dropping the show over.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the positives, the OP of this series is a blast! Each episode the opening video is slightly (or dramatically) altered so that it\u2019s full of Easter eggs and little pieces of foreshadowing. One of the fun things about following along with the show week by week as it aired was seeing the community pore over all the minor details and changes, most of which I wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise! The ending songs ranged from \u2018boring enough to skip\u2019 to \u2018delivering emotional crits\u2019, depending on how well you\u2019ve connected with the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Night of the Living Lolis\u2019 is in some respects what you make of it, which is fitting given that one deeper theme brought up in the show is about the extent to which one can construct their own reality, and to what extent this functions as a tool for overcoming adversity. It\u2019s a theme that\u2019s there, but the onus is on the viewer to engage with that theme if they want to. No direct questions and answers about these things are thrust in the audience\u2019s face, but how you engage with the aforementioned ideas will be made clear from what you think of the characters that espouse respective opinions on those same ideas through their conduct.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a middle arc easily described as wading through treacle, the final arc of \u2018GG\u2019 regains focus and the plot starts to lunge forward to an exciting conclusion, quelling any fears that the setting had been forgotten about. How much of an impact this show will have on you will come down in part to how willing you are to forgive plot contrivances due to being invested in the characters, although in your judgement of such things you\u2019ll often be less disappointed if you give the writers the benefit of the doubt. For what it\u2019s worth, rape alarms are that loud, rusty metal is that weak, generators do make noise, and shovels are heavy. \\n\\n\r\nIf \u2018not judging a book by its cover\u2019 has equivalents in anime, one could be \u2018not judging a show by its genre\u2019. And while it certainly wasn\u2019t many of the animators, at least someone from Lerche genuinely tried to make this work. At a first glance, Gakkougurashi! looks like the result of moe creeping into ever more unfitting genres and settings, but thanks to the great writing it truly showed signs of life even when it should have by all rights been dead on its feet. \\n",

            "content": "Out of most of the anime of summer 2015, the one that keeps popping up time to time is the one and only \"Gakkou Gurashi\". I don't usually watch anime that is currently airing and most of the time I would watch it in English Dub, the reason why is because I would like to see the animation instead of the subtitles (however, some anime series, I do watch in English Sub such as this particular one). However, one of my friends recommended me this anime \"without any research\" (which I usually do) and after watching the first episode, I was completely glued to theseries.  \\n\\n\r\nNow 12 episodes later I can now officially do a review of this particular series, the series that everyone was pretty much talking about. So I'll mention my personal opinions about it, what the company \"Lerche\" did great on and also mention what they need to work on, without further ado, let's review \"Gakkou Gurashi\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe series talks about a club called \"The School Living Club\", a group of four girls and their young dog living in the school, however there's a reason why they are living in the school, which is explained in the anime (I'll give hints but no major spoilers ;))\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that I was one of those people that liked the storyline ever since the first episode, there were some great things but at the same time there's flaws. So I'll mention them here.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n\u2022 Mainly focuses on the main characters, you get to know more about their backstory, how the club was developed and how the characters get along.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each episode had a cliffhanger and makes the viewers want to know more about what will happen next in the series. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 From the beginning to the end, it made you question about what will happen to the characters and so on until you watch the end and find out that most of the questions have been answered. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The Moe / comedy and dark themes do NOT mix. This is the one of those problems that people had when they were watching the series. It makes the viewers think if they're supposed to consider the series as a serious one or a comedy especially due to the situation.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 There is a lot of filler moments in this series, moments that were very unnecessary, such as the comedy moments. They're supposed to deal with a serious situation, not moments where they're supposed to have fun and forget about what's happening around them, which happens often in the series.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Not going to say everything wasn't predictable, but there's certain things that were predictable, one of them being the school environment later on in the series. They did an excellent job making things unpredictable in the first episode but as the series goes on, you realize certain things that have been pointed out in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The series is unique and has its own art style. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The characters were well designed, the expressions for each of the characters shows the emotions for any situation and the creators developed great outfits for each character making them unique in certain ways.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The environments were done well as each environment expresses a certain mood, depending on the situation, if it's happy and cheerful, they make it like nothing happened, if its dark, they make it dark and gloomy. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 If you compare the art between the manga and the anime, it is quite similar so they did manage to get the same type of art style as the manga.\\n\\n\r\nCon:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Like the story, Moe and dark themes don't work too well together. It would have been better if they stuck to one of them instead of both. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPro:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each OST was done well, it expresses the moods of the situation, if the situation is a Moe moment, they have cheerful music playing, if it's a sad moment, they make the music sound very sad and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The ending themes were okay too but the one theme that I've enjoyed the most out of this series was the Opening. If all you heard was the Opening without seeing the intro, you would imagine this as a cheerful and catchy opening theme, you would never expect it to be dark anime series. If you watch the intro from the first episode, it looks like another \"slice of life\" anime, but as the series goes on, the intro changes but the song stays the same, I know there may be other anime that did the same thing but this is an amazing idea that I don't often see which makes the Opening even more enjoyable to watch. I always get excited whenever the intro came on because I always wanted to know what they're going to change next and what they'll change it into. It's a very enjoyable intro to watch and a very catchy song to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nI seriously have no cons for this anime when it comes to sound as personally the music was fine the way it was. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Each character has her own unique personality which makes each of the characters stand out from one another. (Examples: Yuki being the energetic and positive one, Miki being the serious one, Yuuri being the leader type and Kurumi being the cheerful type and the one with the shovel).\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The minor characters are mentioned time to time,  we get an understanding of what the minor characters were like, both appearance and personality. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Like the soundtrack, I can't really complain about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I thought the show was pretty entertaining, sure it had some slow and mostly comedic moments but it had moments were it actually made you wonder about what will happen in the next episode. You hope for the best for each character as well as have concerns about the things around them. Characters and the soundtrack were awesome, the art is enjoyable to see however, the story should have been worked on a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very enjoyable series and I highly recommend people to watch Gakkou Gurashi. The series is only 12 episodes so you can completely watch it within a couple of days. It was enjoyable to watch and a possibly a great anime to watch over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 / 10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some people like school. Some people dreads it. Then, there are some others that just goes there to get an education and nothing more. What about Takeya Yuki, a petite girl who just happens to be in love with school? If you think about it, there\u2019s nothing really wrong with liking school. What\u2019s wrong about this show is that the school Yuki is attending isn\u2019t exactly what it seems. Welcome to Gakkou Gurashi (School-Live!), a show that comes with a bizarre twist. And by all means, it\u2019s not exactly what it looks like\u2026\r\nOr maybe it does at first. The animated series adapted by Lerche comesfrom the manga of the same name. The series takes place in a school life setting where everything seems really normal at first. Or perhaps too normal. The first 20 or so minutes of the pilot episode establishes a school life style where Yuki is enjoying every minute of it. And really, why shouldn\u2019t she be? She is with her friends, having fun, making memories, and just being a kid. Anyone who have trouble investing time into the typical slice of life with \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 factor will likely feel annoyed. That is\u2026until the ending. The twist comes with a zombie apocalypse. In essence, Gakkou Gurashi fuses together a bunch of oddball genres that includes school, slice of life, supernatural, and a bit of survival horror. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way though. The show still retains its cuteness but explores a dark side of it that\u2019s nothing like what your school may be.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling of the show is structured in somewhat of a controversial way. As a manga reader, I will say that it is entertaining but still sways from faithfulness. The first episode makes changes while also introducing certain characters far too early than they should be. The overall tone of the story flows somewhat well in terms of content despite pacing issues. It shouldn\u2019t be hard for anyone to figure out that something may be wrong through careful analysis. The background foreshadowing such as the bizarre words on the school\u2019s chalkboard or gravestones should make the viewers scratch their head. Also, isn\u2019t it just strange that everything seems a bit too simple at their school? \\n\\n\r\nA main part of the show also consists of the character cast. Yuki is the most prominent character in the series not because of her personality but because of some of her delusions. The show establishes an eerie message that perhaps she is hallucinating or building a delusional barrier around herself. The reality is that there are zombies are school, the classrooms are in shambles with windows shattered, hallways are barricaded, and death is a quite real. Yuki\u2019s personality is also quite cheerful and sometimes is distracting for the audience. Similarly, some of her friends also plays along with her despite knowing the truth. They include Kurumi, Yuri, and Miki and all of them shows various skills when needed for survival. Their personalities ranges although all of them gets along quite well as friends. Kurumi is more of the fighter for the group with her handy shovel while Yuri plays more of a supportive role (the older sister type). Miki also adds support to help the other girls and even plays alongside Yuki as \u201cMii-kun\u201d. As cute and colorful as this group is, the audience is still often reminded of what\u2019s at stake. By the time the first episode ends, I think any anime original viewers will find it surprising in some ways by the false advertising and bait.\\n\\n\r\nOn most terms of the show, it blends in a form of dark comedy. Sure on the surface, everything seems cherry but the reality is not so cute. The comedy on most part is what you will typically see from series about \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d. In essence, the show actually masks its true visage somewhat well with its humor if a viewer is unaware of the premise or coming into the show completely fresh. Meanwhile, Gakkou Gurashi exploits its darker elements with Yuki\u2019s state of mind. Other characters also gets some of their background story told including Yuki\u2019s friend \u201cMii-kun\u201d and her teacher, Megumi. The show establishes fairly well that Yuki is overly fond of them. As such, it creates the false barrier about her state of mind. Throughout the show, it\u2019s almost like Yuki is in a world of her own. Yuki continuously shows how much she loves school while the audience knows it\u2019s more than just that. And by this execution, I guess it can be a hit or miss. Some people will find the series overly repetitive after a few episodes. Others may think that the comedy doesn\u2019t mix well with the overlay of the story. Despite this, Gakkou Gurashi succeeds in keeping a thrilling story by adapting with the characters. The style of the show is obviously more than just a slice of life so it often crafts plot twists to make the audience anticipate for more.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to artwork, there should be no surprise that the girls are designed to look cute. They all wear their regular school uniform with some variations. For instance, we have Yuki\u2019s cat-like hat or Kurumi\u2019s arm-warmers. Overly cute may sometimes become evident throughout the show especially with character expressions. In reality, the setting of the school is designed to look like it was the aftermath of an apocalypse. It conveys the message to the audience that nothing is normal. The zombies are designed to look horrific with their mindless rampage. Fan service also exists with swimsuits although most of it downplayed. Instead, it\u2019s replace with violence with vague censorship. It\u2019s also noticeable that the body language of the characters shows the audience of their conflicting feelings. Finally, I have to say that the show has a clever way of decorating its OP and ED theme songs along with its symbolisms.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say the soundtrack is overly impressive but neither is it lacking. Somewhere in between, I think the soundtrack works especially to deliver that eerie feeling when it\u2019s needed. Other times, its recycled usage of the lighthearted harmony is hardly memorable. Perhaps the most distinctive thing related to sound is the voices of the characters. Yuki is portrayed with a very energetic voice who is often on the lookout for fun at school. She genuinely loves school so her presence along with her voice brings in a cheery atmosphere. That is\u2026there are moments when her breaks down in an almost mental-like state. For that, I\u2019d say that her character is adapted well in terms of voice mannerism. Others in the show includes Kurumi\u2019s tomboyish voice and Yuuri\u2019s mature personality with a matching voice tone that is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not a big fan of school. For someone like Yuki, that\u2019s an understatement. And for a show like Gakkou Gurashi, it\u2019s about much more than the girls having fun and getting an education. Ever heard of the phrase, \u201cwhen it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t?\u201d That\u2019s what the show feels like. As such, don\u2019t expect Gakkou Gurashi to be the typical slice of life with cute girls having their happy endings every episode. This is not a happy show. If you take a look at the physical attributes of their real school and environment, then it\u2019s easy to see why. If you thought that Gakkou Gurashi is like colored rainbows with smiles and laughs, think again.",

            "content": "I am not english, so i apologize if i make mistakes.\r\nGakkou Gurashi is surely not your typical Slice of Life anime. The first thing that you can think after seeing its genres will be: \"Slice of Life + Horror? What's that troll?\", and it's here that you are wrong, my friend; Gurashi Gakkou is probably the second anime (Puella Magi Madoka Magica the first one) that manages to use 2 genres completely different so well. It could be called Slice of Horror. The new generation of anime has begun! \u2570\u0f3c=\u0ca0\u0a0a\u0ca0=\u0f3d\u256f\r\nThat is why i like this anime so much, unique genres and characters. Don't get fooledby the first 20 minutes of the anime, You will see only a group of girls who live at school and look for a dog dispersed in the school with moe moments/reactions, In any case i definitely do not recommend dropping the anime before the real story starts (at the end of the first episode you'll understand what i am talking about).\\n\r\nGo to watch the first episode because from now on there will be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the anime is great. The first thing you notice is this \"School-living club\", and here comes the mindfuck. The main character is mentally unstable, does not see what she has in front of her eyes. The anime is set in a post-apocalyptic world, oh wait, most of the characters \"are\" in a post-apocalypric world, Our Yuki is in a world friendly with her, where all are her friends and the school is perfectly normal. Obviously nothing of what she sees is true, yes, the school is surrounded by zombies. Here starts the adventures of our protagonists in a cruel world, Where errors are not allowed, only courage. Obviously, there's some mystery here and there that makes the anime more interesting.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot a lot to say here. The art is great, it works very well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's moe when there's the Slice of Life and scary when the horror scenes arrive. The zombies have a unique art, seem to be more shadows than zombies sometimes, but don't worry, there is a reason\\n\r\nTho the animation is not really great, just normal. It has a lot of issues, and you can see the frames sometimes but it doesn't matter, because it fits perfectly with the anime's atmosphere. Don't expect something Ufotable-like animation, Lerche had 3 shows this season so you can imagine...\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely perfect. The OST fits perfectly with the anime. Outstanding in the horror moment, it's not your usual sound that you hear. The OP sequence is genial, cheerful music with zombies in the background, you don't see it everyday (i think). The ED sequence is more quiet, it could have been better, i don't deny it. The OST...reminds me sometimes a film, really great the concept, what you are watching: an anime; what you are hearing: a soundtrack of a film. It does a great job again because it shows the state of mind of the protagonist. It makes you feel anxious, happy, etc...\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis group of girls is perfect. There's the leader \"Yuuri\" that thinks about cooking, giving orders And the remaining resources, she has some interesting clothes that she puts on the uniform. Then there's the courageous \"Kurumi\" that kills zombies and rescues her friends. There's the quiet \"Miki\" that loves reading post-apocalyptic stories (especially of Stephen King), why not? And lastly we have our cheerful Yuki that lives in her world. Then there's Taroumaru...Taroumaru is a dog who cheers up the girls, play with them and has a great development with Yuki and Kurumi. He is not a character that you will love for sure but i think i like him...\\n\r\nOh wait! how could i forget about Megu-nee! i-i mean, Sakura-sensei. She is the closest person to Yuki and a good teacher that gives advices to students. Megu-nee is a character that everyone love.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFun and cute moments followed by scary moments. Even if there are zombies, in a dead city, this show sometimes makes you forget there are all these scary things, because nothing is better than a good comedy. IMO, the comedy/moeblob doesn't have always a good tempism, but...Oh well, in poor words, you'll have fun watching this show.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Slice of Life, go to watch it, if you like Zombies and mysterious circumstances go to watch it, if you like both, why are you reading this review? Run! You will not regret watching this show. Gakkou Gurashi is an anime that has a new whole concept of a post-apocalyptic world.\\n\r\nThis show makes you smile and scares you at the same time, unique setting, don't you find it unique? I do.\\n\r\nI am definitely enjoying Gakkou Gurashi a lot. AOTS (summer 2015) IMO.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful \u301c(^\u2207^\u301c\uff09",

At least the first episode. Twice. Now! BEGONE! No questions, go just watch it!\r\nOK!\r\n...Are they gone? Ok.\r\nStory: \r\nI was hooked after episode one. Weren't we all? It's not my typical anime, at. all! But I couldn't not watch it. Even when I got a bit freaked out by the library scene in episode 2. Usually I can guess the twists and turns but maybe since I was so scared out of my wits, Icouldn't. Cleverly written. Top notch. It's given me a new appreciation for more darker animes.\\n\r\n (Even in spite of the one thing that happens later which makes me hate any film, book or series.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nReally cute and simplistic, though you could tell the animators are talented artists, lots of little subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nLove the theme song, so upbeat.  Just like Yuki, I think the opening she'd want to have, Cute VA's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nReally play well off each other, the perfect example of a gang. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nWow.  Definitely become one of my favorites. I'd rewatch if I wasn;t a ridiculously jumpy person. Can't wait for a second season though the mind boggles how they'd follow it up on par with the first season.\\n",

            "content": "The idea of having cute girls in dark settings is nothing new to the world of anime, but especially after the record-breaking commercial success of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica way back in 2011, there has been a particularly big outbreak of new anime trying to ride the same wave and get a good bang for their buck. But the problem with that is that it generally only results in the final product feeling similar yet inferior in comparison to earlier works following the same idea, as was made evident in shows like Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru and Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou for example.\r\nGakkou Gurashiis to me the first anime which actually succeeds in doing this in the last few years. It manages to provide the exact same kind of contrast between moe and despair that tugs on your heartstrings and keeps you on your toes, yet it does it in a completely different setting and an incomparable storyline.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have not yet watched this anime, I would highly recommend you to at least watch the very first episode to its end without reading any further or getting yourself spoiled. It is something that you should really experience first-hand for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point, Gakkou Gurashi is initially shown from the eyes of the energetic high-schooler Takeya Yuki as a very stereotypical slice of life moe comedy following her and her friends living inside their school. And yes I literally mean living in, as their School Living Club's activities consist of always staying inside the school with the intention of \"growing closer to the school's many departments, foster self-governance and independence, and set an example for all to follow\". Thus they sleep in the school, take classes in school and play in school. Pretty straightforward. However as is revealed at the end of the first episode, this is nothing but a huge deception. Because in reality, the world which Gakkou Gurashi takes place in has already fallen to a zombie apocalypse, all the students other than the members of the School Living Club are already dead, and Yuki is completely mentally unstable and thus incapable of seeing the truth of her newfound reality for what it is. What makes this so great is the presentation. They manage to build the whole situation up so cleanly, so smoothly and with such perfect precision that it eventually hits you like a hammer when the truth is finally revealed. And you can't say it came out of nowhere either; the clues are clearly spread out throughout the first episode if you're paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs fascinating as this opening was though, the real question following it was whether the story was actually sustainable from that point onwards. After all, when you drop that kind of bombshell in the very first episode, you better have something to offer for the remaining 11 episodes of the anime. Does Gakkou Gurashi accomplish this then? Well... yes and no. The rest of the story doesn't really rely on shock value quite as much, but instead takes a slower approach. The girls continue to live out their lives inside the barricaded school as they do their best to keep up the act that everything is fine and dandy in Yuki's presence in order to not break her mentally, try to find information about the zombie apocalypse and why/how it occurred, as well as simply staying alive. Occasionally they'll venture outside the safe zone and into hostile territory, but they never stay there any longer than necessary and they try to avoid direct combat if possible due to the risk of infection. So there isn't much in the way of bloodthirsty zombie bashing carnage in this show, but honestly I'm very thankful for that because I find that to be one of the most mindless concepts in fiction. Don't expect Gakkou Gurashi to play out like Highschool of the Dead, because it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nIn theory I think this is a good decision, but if there is one thing which Gakkou Gurashi fails at, it is a certain aspect of its execution. You see although the contrast between the slice of life segments inside the school and the darker elements are very cool to see, it sadly doesn't balance them properly. Simply put, there is *way* too much focus on the slice of life part of the equation. As much as I like that kind of content in general, in Gakkou Gurashi's case it feels more out of place than anything else more often than not. When you've just gotten some dramatic plot twist at the end of an episode, it feels rather annoying when the entirety of the episode thereafter is spent doing nothing at all. I mean yes, of course it's important to show off how the girls are trying to keep their spirits up in the desperate situation which they find themselves in, but it does it too much. It doesn't just come across as fleshing out the characters, but also quite frankly as wasting time. Especially when you put in an entire episode showing off the girls in their bikinis by the pool on the school's roof and even take the extra time to have the camera zoom in on their tits one by one, then it no longer classifies as contrast; it's purely fanservice. At that point there's just no room for sugarcoating it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nNow personally I don't really mind that part too much per se, but it doesn't change the fact that it is taking up a huge amount of time which could have been spent on actually progressing the story instead. As a result, when you look at the anime as a whole... it doesn't really advance very much from start to finish. About half the story lies in the last three episodes alone, and although those were certainly top tier, it doesn't excuse all the random stuff that happens (more like not happens) in the middle of the season. I mean imagine if the latter parts had been the middle ones instead; they'd have had room for like 4 or so more episodes before the end. Though of course you can always pick up the manga instead if you want more content, but that's a different matter altogether and not really a valid excuse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Gakkou Gurashi is a thrilling anime which is sadly dragged down quite a bit by a single flaw. It stands out from the crowd due to its original combination of setting and execution; it has occasionally stellar directing, nasty cliffhangers, and interesting characters, but at the same time it doesn't focus on its own strengths properly which leads the viewers to just want the show to \"get on with it already\" a lot of the time. Even so though, the pros still heavily outweigh the cons, and the good points are what the anime will primarily be remembered for. And really, any series which can manage to leave such a solid impression on you as a viewer is a noteworthy anime in my mind.",

            "content": "After Watching School Live, I noticed that in terms of story and characters, it's just like watching a cute, less violent & graphic, less erotic, but most importantly, more annoying version of High school of the dead. In addition to that with the story, it's sort of like School Live borrowed lots of the shock and suspense elements from High School of the Dead and dulled it down a few levels to make it easier to watch. I think it was done that way so everything is not all in your face at once. School live takes things one step at a time and that'swhat helps build up suspense. Moving on to arts and Characters, nothing too unique stands out about the characters, they are sort of like your generic anime girls. The typical stupid hyper girl and with pink hair purposely made to be cute and \"a hit with the fans.\" The one mature classmate whose  job is to look out for everyone. The tough girl with the tom-boyish personality but is really a big softie, etc. School live isn't too bad, like all anime it has its obviously faults, but I'm sure if you love cute girls trying to solve mysteries, plot twists, and violence then you're going to love School Live!",

            "content": "(FIRST REVIEW)\r\n(ALSO SPOILERS)\r\nGakkou Gurashi (School-Live!) is an interesting anime that blew up in the Summer 2015 season. Many people praised it for being unique, dark, and a fresh new take on the zombie genre. It has moe girls and zombies. 2 things to bait the anime community in. So how does this \"masterpiece\" hold up? \r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story in this is so average. The story changes in tone shift from being a cute, moeshit, slice of life show from a dark and depressing Madoka Magica take. However, it does it horribly. There's no weight to either of these sides to the anime and it justmakes the anime seem lazy and lacking. Also how some episodes would just focus on moeshit rather than the actual story we all came it to see. It acts like it doesn't care at all. However, something I can say about the story is how it takes some risks. I was surprised by how this show deals with some tragedy and the way it does it is quite impressive. Doesn't excuse the story from being lackluster and bi-polar. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLerche was everywhere spewing out shows in the Summer season. Too bad all of them were fucking trash but at least they had some decent art. I like how the characters movements are so fluid in some scenes and how their movements would change with the tone. For example, Kurumi attempting to kill some zombies would have pace that's quicker rather than usual when she's just standing in the slice of life would. I also like how well the color pallet would stick well with the tones as well. Keeping it dark and creepy when it needs to. But sadly, that's basically it. The art does nothing to stick out but instead it just blends in with other anime. Also, most of the animation is SO STILTED. All the characters mostly do is just stand around talking. It seems like they even forgot they were in this terrible show. Not much to say, the art and animation are just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actresses showed some emotion in their performances here and there but nothing really seemed to stick out as well. They at least tried I'll give them that. A good thing about the sound however is the music box that would play here and there and would sound like it's dying right at the end when something bad happens. Yes, music boxes have been done to death in anime, but it was still a nice touch. As for everything else? MOESHIT TO THE MAX. Nothing in the soundtrack stands out at all. It's the same shit we've heard over and over and over again in other slice of life, cute girls doing cute things anime. Average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly shit, where do I begin? These characters are so 2-dimensional. None of them have a personality nor do any of them develop. \\n\\n\r\nYuki is just the same old ditzy girl we see in all anime before who acts like everything around her is fine. She has a personality but it's annoying and she does not develop. \\n\\n\r\nKurumi is the tomboy who had to kill the love of her life (THAT IS NEVER BROUGHT UP AGAIN) who has no personality. She is a blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nYuuri, the worst character, also has no personality. She's just there to make food and keep the club under protection. Another blank slate that doesn't develop. The anime tries and make her seem different and attempt to \"develop\" her by attempting to kill Kurumi when Kurumi is turning into a zombie. It was handled horribly since Kurumi and Yuuri barely shared a bond together so how are we supposed to care? I sure as hell know I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nMiki is an overprotective character who tried and seems like she cares for the club. Another blank slate who kinda develops but is done also horribly. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else is a waste of your time. The characters are the worst part of the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it was painful to watch sometimes, I still kind of enjoyed this anime. I was still intrigued on everything that was going on and was just begging that this anime would get better, but nope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi is a dumb, moeshit, same old slice of life show we've seen a million of times in other series. The only thing that this show does different is that it has zombies. It has 1-dimensional characters, average art, a weak story that doesn't know what it wants to be, and a soundtrack that makes you want to drill your ears. You want a good slice of life show? Go watch Aria the Animation. At least that one has good characters, better art and a story that's actually well written. Stay away from this anime. It's just another show that goes into the trash just like every other anime from the Summer 2015 season. Lerche has fucked up big time.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

I'm sorry but this anime was a gigantic waste of time! when it comes to Thriller, I'm not a big fan of it. the only animes i watched in the Thriller setting we're Another and Tokyo Ghoul.\r\n so let's rip this crap apart before i have a Goddamn Mental breakdown\r\nStory:\r\nIt's premise was the Reason to why i wanted to watch the Anime. it tells the Story about 4 Girls and a little Dog who are living on a School and at the First Episode you don't know why but at the end of the 1st Episode, itreveals it's Dark twist... they are actually stuck on the school thanks to a lot of Zombies in it. so by this i said to myself: \"YEAH, This is gotta be a great Thriller\" but... oh god the Cutesy comedy mixed with the Dark atmosphere that is trying to get it's doesn't fit well... like at all! when there is a very Dark moment after the end of a Episode, what happens? CUTESY COMEDY TO DRIVEN INTO YOUR SKULL! \\n\r\ni mean yeah there are some Thriller or Dark animes with Cutesy visuals that has to put something cute in it... but in Madoka Magica and Higurashi, it works because the Plot keeps on going and it gets even Darker. thus, we wanna see how Darker can it goes. so that's why School Live Fails at this!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\ni don't have much to say it, the Animation is tolerable at best, but it has it's flaws. most of the Characters have the same Eye shapes with different Colors. the Designs are mediocre with not much Creativity putted into it. and i also hate and Despise the use of CGI in anime.. and Unfortunately it is used here too, either with Zombies at long distance or with People at long distance. it's not as bad as Chaos Dragon or Buddyfight, but is still pretty mediocre. one thing that Bothers me a lot is that at fist i thought they we're Kids... but they are Teenagers and Adults!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n*sigh* where do even begin with them? in fact, it's hard to say anything about them because... they are all Forgivable! there is Kurumi that has a weapon that is a Shovel (if Shovel Knight exists so why not?) but she is not very Interesting like... at all! there is Miki which is the 2nd most Annoying character because she literally calls all the Girls mostly by \"Senpai\" all the Freaking time. there is Yuuri which is a Calm (and also dangerous) woman who is pretty Bland... and then you have Yuki... which is the Most annoying Character in the Anime, she is the only one that Ignores that there is a Zombie pack on the School and tries to live a \"EXCITING\" life on School, she is Hyper Active and pretty Stupid too. there is also Megumi Sakura which is average, and Taromaru which is a dog that... nah, just a dog. overall, all Characters are Dreadful\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nnothing much to say about it really... it's pretty forgivable and not a single track stands out! the Voice acting is Standard and very bad, especially Yuki's voice acting! hearing her voice was like Trying to beat the Racing Stage from Battle toads at 3x Speed. Aka: Impossible and just flat out annoying!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nthe Enjoyment of this anime is like your patient on School lessons. it's not Fun, it's boring and you just want to end it fast as possible so you could do something better. this Anime was a mistake to watch! and the Last Episode and ending was probably the most Unrealistic and Utterly Ridiculous thing i have ever seen in my entire life! I've seen Thriller that is done Well, and Thriller that is done Poorly... and sadly, School Live is a Example of being done Wrong... it was not Worth watching it\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 2/10",

            "content": "I am extremely disappointed with the way this show ended. Seeing as that is the case, this review will basically be all spoilers, so read at your own risk.\r\nI'm gonna admit, this was one of the more enjoyable shows for me this season. I rate heavily on personal enjoyment, so for the most part, this series was high up on my seasonal watch queue. No, I did not like the characters although I do understand that they were meant as a contrast of the world they were living in. No, I didn't like the sudden, out of the blue tone shifts that the show presented.No, I didn't think that this show was tapping into the full potential of what it could have done, but hey, it was enjoyable, so I kept coming back.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go to episode 11, shall we? This was, by far, the best episode School-Live! had put out. It felt like the characters were truly desperate, they were genuinely terrified, and that all hope seemed lost. They were struggling with just about everything and on the brink of death throughout the entire episode. Not only that, but holy shit was the music in this episode good. I'd say around the 9 minute mark when the portable radio was played and the soft, enchanting singing started drifting out as you see the character's struggling to stay alive was phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was extremely excited to see what episode 12 (the grand finale) would bring us.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it completely let me down. It was bullshit. I'm about to list all the things awful about this episode, so be prepared for a shitstorm of complaining. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, it's not possible that Taromaru remembered Yuki and saved her life. It's a zombie. Everything leading up to that point would have suggested that, while the zombies are relatively aware, they do not have control over their actions, they act to kill. Taromaru saving Yuki would blatantly state that the zombies can control themselves and enact self-restraint, of which none do, let alone a dog which has about 1% of the mental capacity humans do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then all it fucking took for the whole problem to solve itself was to say \"School's out, go home\"?! Are you fucking kidding me?! That's just bullshit and I refuse to accept that. It was almost comical it was so overly simple and stupid. That is in no way how a zombie apocalypse story should end. Not only is it just utterly off tone with how the entire series went, it's just illogical. I cannot stress to you enough how bad this ending was. I'm a perverse person. I wanted them all to die and for the series to end. I would have easily given this show a 9 and called it the best of the season. Unfortunately, School-Live! decided that they just weren't going to do that and instead opt for a cop-out.\\n\\n\r\nHow were they to know that there was another dog down there? If I were in that situation I would've just assumed the dog heard a noise and went down there because, let's be honest, it's a dog. That's what dogs do. There is no reason for them to have assumed that, and yet they did, so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the graduation ceremony. Oh man, the graduation ceremony. Don't even get me started (it should be evident that I'm about to get started, it's an expression, leave a \"Helpful\" on my review please). Basically, they just decided that instead of closure, they were gonna go the Angel Beats! route and try to just make you cry as their way of forcing people to like the show. It was disgusting watching high school seniors cry at every slightly inspirational thing people said. And it dragged on for so fucking long. A solid 10 minutes were spent just saying goodbye and whatever else they felt like crying about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the last main problem I have with episode 12 is the lack of closure. So many things left unexplained. How did the outbreak first happen? What was Megu-nee's connection with it? Why did the girls in the school not just construct a ton of weapons so they wouldn't have to rely on that damn shovel for everything? Did they ever get to a safe-house? How do the zombies not starve and rot away? Why has nobody made any attempt to establish long-distance contact? Is the infection localized or is it on a global scale? Where are all the zombies in that final scene where they're just cruising down the highway and there's no one to be seen? And where the fuck are they going?\\n\\n\r\nThis show just made me so mad after how well it set itself up to just dissolve into a mess of emotional crap that I cannot give it a recommendation and the only reason I give it a 7 is because of episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, and as always, feel free to tell me what you thought.",

            "content": "\"Anime is for kids\" they say...  \r\nAsk them to watch this anime. They say \"okay\"...\r\nLooks at Gakkou Gurashi Poster \"Another Moeblob Slice Of Life Anime\" they say..\r\nWatches the first OP \"Why do they put Horror tag?! For sure it\u2019s for kids again\" they say...\r\nWell, this is Madoka Magica version 2.0, where Promotional Posters and OPs will mislead you.\r\nAnyway, here is the review what I\u2019m thinking about. *MINOR to MAJOR SPOILERS ahead\r\nI also feel the same way, thinking that this anime is just going to talk about slice of life and moeness at a world where people are infected and gone, but I was wrong,this is more likely a survival mission for four girls to escape the already ruined city which I assumed Tokyo since one of the news broadcast is \u201cTokyo News\u201d and the fact that we know that this apocalypse happen because of biological weapon used by one of the upper class or an elite organisation in japan for testing, which also includes the school where the four girls studied that had infected most of the citizens in that state. Should had been 5 survivors but ultimately sacrifice herself to save the girls from getting infected, that was where I got depressed real hard. So much of the scene had made me depressed, that I was planning to drop it or not but with strong heart I decide to continue because I had read the manga, though I could partly disagree that some part are not adapted. It is well adapted from the manga and there are some parts that are a bit loosely taken from the manga, but overall they did adapt well, just that I don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t include the most important part of the scene in each manga to the anime, well I could mostly agree due to the timeslot given and also the budget that a company had. Well, it\u2019s great that we could learn how survival and teamwork is all about. It\u2019s great that I can play Left4Dead again after 2 years of hiatus. Mostly, this series focuses on survival in school, graduation, Taroumaru and Megu-nee, which is \u201call but not all scenes\u201d adapted from the manga. Also I got moved by Yuki\u2019s speech towards the zombies which they all ultimately listen to her and went back where they belong and they all graduate from high school. And I do believe that there would be a strong indication of season 2 as if you watch after the ending credits where a girl holds a drawing of Yuki\u2019s 4 group, but it\u2019s just assuming as the manga is still ongoing.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the animation and the art of this particular anime. Most of the works are all done by Studio Lerche, (remember Carnival Phantasm?) Anyway, the character designs are quite appealing and decent, I love how the situation and the surrounding the city looks like depicting that this story takes place on a post-zombie apocalypse where most of the buildings would be destroyed and all other shits. Anyway, the motion of the zombie, I wonder if I could call it as CGI, is pretty okay, from far it\u2019s more like they are 3D version of zombie but for close up view, they are more like a 2D view. But overall, not much of complaints on the saturations and the smoothness of the animations and art of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that made us mislead is the OP song video, watch closely as you progress throughout the episode, it keeps on changing right? I wonder if this should be in the story comment or sound but anyway let\u2019s just move on, the OP song is really catchy and more like I don\u2019t know how to explain it but I assume they just want to mislead us that this is a moe anime. Well, I do enjoy listen the OP since the title is \u201cFriend Shitai\u201d meaning that it might do with friends or anything. Other than that, most of the seiyuus are well selected, especially on Takeya Yuki and Ebisuzawa Kurumi, for Ebisuzawa Kurumi I was expecting Taneda Risa to voice acting her but it was Ozawa Ari instead voice acting her, kinda disappointed but she did great on voice acting her with the tomboyish voice act, Takeya Yuki is voiced by Iori Minase whom she voiced Hestia, she is really good at voicing cute voice for a 1996 liners. Miki-kun and Rii-san voice actors are also well voiced, it\u2019s enjoyable to listen to all the 4 main characters voices\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters, I will only focus on 2 characters, so let\u2019s begin.  Takeya Yuki, a student of 3-A is an airhead and a good girl student whom she really loves Megu-nee so much, she doesn\u2019t really care about the zombie apocalypse the fact that she create an illusion herself to not seeing her what happen to the past and the current situation in the anime. I do understand her feelings that she wanted a good, enjoyable, school and everyday life and the fact that everything is gone she doesn\u2019t want that to happen so instead she decide to illustrate from the real scene herself where everything is normal, which I kinda feel bad for her. But she does show her courage and has a strong heart even if she start to break down because what\u2019s past is past, we do have to look at the future and she did give the best and heart feeling speech to everyone. Ebisuzawa Kurumi, a strong girl with her shovel carrying her back, her mission is survival and to protect all the four girls from getting infected, she do make comedic scenes which I enjoy. She is also the first girl to get bitten by Megu-nee, but she held strong and managed to survive the infection by antidote which doesn\u2019t work properly leaving her half-human/zombie. But I\u2019m glad she survive before being fully infected, if not, I would most likely to drop the 12th episode.  \\n\r\nSo did I enjoy watching it? Well, from my perspective I do enjoy watching it, and this is the first series I have watched with a horror tag, and the 200th anime to be completed since I started watching anime last year. I do feel depressed after watching this anime as some the key characters had died for example Megu-nee and Taroumaru.  Even if it\u2019s depressing, I\u2019ve learn some good lessons regarding this anime, team working and survival instincts. This shows that, if we don\u2019t learn how to survive then bad consequences would occur, so team work is important, leaving a person alone to do the job would be risky and is best to have two than one to prevent all problems. Glad I enjoy watching Gakkou Gurashi.\\n\\n\r\nWell I would recommend anyone to watch Gakkou Gurashi, yes it has comedy and kawaii scene too and those who are scared of killing, slashing or any violents don't worry, they blurred it out. Also, those who had already watched the Hollywood movies or shows like World War Z, I am Legend, Shawn of the dead, 28 days later, Walking dead and the games like last of us or left4dead, I would recommend you guys to watch this even if it has moe, but the main point is about zombie survival. So I do hope you guys enjoy watching it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this maybe long and complete nonsense review, I wrote really hard and think hard with some to rewrite this review before posting it fully to the site. I hope this review would be helpful, that doesn\u2019t mean I want to be in the top, but anyway happy watching~ \\n\\n\r\nWell, morals to everyone: \"Don't judge an anime by its cover\", you never know what would happen next.\\n",

            "content": "\"Moe and Dark cannot mix\" -- This is pretty much the same old line I see every time in anime series like these.\r\nThe shows that have a cutesy looking artstyle yet it turns into a dark tone series where you have never expected to become, is a common excuse for the community at times where at times it seems people don't get how these can be used in anime format. For this case, the zombie apocalypse setting is rarely used in the anime format, and the only anime I can remember using this aspect is Highschool of the Dead. This year we got Gakkou Gurashi!,a new summer anime series that came out unexpected to the audience, and yet many known talks about it recently. Well since the series just ended what are my thoughts about the show overall? Is it good? or did it ended up like the previous show with the same aspect? Well let's go and find out together.\\n\\n\r\nNote that this is going to be a very personal perspective thought about the series as a standalone product. I will go and directly go to the perspective thought as an anime only watcher (for the most part) and do not compare with the manga. So keep in mind about the anime review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To start off, the story itself would be at first simple. Our female protagonist Yuki lives in a normal life at \"school?\" and then we find our other cast of characters in the \"school-living club\", where she loves to live in the daily life in the place. By the \"\" I just noted, do you think its normal to live at school? I sure do not think thats normal, because nobody would like to live at school. When you think about it at first glance, the series lets you know in suspicion and of course this works as well with the execution of its actual plot. Or the premise of the show. At the first episode of the series it executes everything perfectly matched that you don't actually notice the foreshadowing happening into your eyes or in front of you, and as the episodes passed by it does foreshadow a lot of things as well with the events thats happening around. The series is all about the aspect of knowing reality and imaginary for the first part of my reason why I like the show. It leads the viewer into suspicion of the weird events happening in the episodes, try to piece things together in other to get the answers. Its like a puzzle piece if you imagine it. The second thing I like about the show is how they mesh the moments well, at least for the entirety of the anime. It leads to development and bonding towards the cast, and of course the flashbacks also works well with the series to know about them. Another thing that I like about the anime is more so of the psychological aspect. By psychological aspect, its by the mentality of the characters and how they're dealing with things throughout the entirety of the series. If you do not know what I mean, in short I mean their sanity. I think its more so of the psychological and also the survival aspect that goes for the cast of characters. That makes the show special in its own way, rather than going all action packed for the most part and its every time mashing and smashing. Of course the anime does has its moments of action and entertainment. The Slice of Life moments also helps out to build up a bond and relationship with the cast even on an anime original standpoint. Of course some of the slice of life moments in the anime (bits of it) were very unnecesary and it could have been better to add more content into the show. Overall the show does handle its execution properly at most cases.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters of the show could be described as simple, but yet memorable. The cast of characters (mainly) consist on 5 characters. Which are Yuki, Miki, Kurumi, Rii, and Megumi. If I can include one more, that would be Taroumaru the dog.\\n\\n\r\nThe five girls are together in the school, we know that, but what do they consist off?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Yuki. She's a jolly, happy, friendly and caring character. Of course a lot of people would say \"But she's crai crai (crazy)\", thats something that for me understandable. But to me Yuki is the only character around that helps the others to move on. Shes considered as the light for everyone in the group, the spark that makes them continue to move on. Even if people think she's crazy, I personally think she's not to my suspicion. She is also a very good person giving advice to the members of the club, which helps a lot for her. Overall for me she's well enough for me to like her.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi (my favorite girl) can be considered as the strong character of the anime series. She's brave, courageous, and also caring for her members. She had also a backstory which for me was very well done to know very well her suffering after the whole incident. Of course at times she acts very cute and nicely, but when it comes to the fight scenes, she knows how to get shit done right (at most). Shes also determined to go to bigger things during the anime, which makes me applaud her a lot.\\n\\n\r\nRii-san can be considered as the bigger sister pretty much in the group. Of course at first she's just your average and typical \"big boobs\" character, but she does contribute at least a bit of a role in the anime. She's observant, very strict, and as well with taking care of everyone. She's pretty much the mother of the whole group, as well with her words and speeches along in the anime she does as well give some push onto the little members. Of course as well, she's considered fun at times.\\n\\n\r\nMii-kun is pretty much the newer member to the group, at first she was just your stereotypical \"Senpai Senpai\" girl, but there was a reason behind that. And that was because of her backstory which she had more screentime to get fleshed out enough. She used to have a friend, and her perspective way in her backstory caused a lot of impact towards what happened. It made impact as well during after a bit of the anime series, and as well with her trying to get attached to Taroumaru, their bonds built on well enough at least. She's considered someone that wants to know more about Yuki, but as well with that, she's also intelligent and smart at times when its needed.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi (also known as Megu-nee) was the center of the whole group, also known as the teacher in the anime series. She's well known as the caring and friendly teacher, and she wants everyone to survive. She's also someone that doesn't want to be strict by her positions due to her being the teacher and the members being the students, as she also wants to have an equal relationship with them and protect them in any way possible (thats how I look at it). She was the center and involved for most characters of the anime, and getting a fleshed out backstory of the whole incident was simply well done.\\n\\n\r\nFor the supporting cast, to not go into the full edge detail. The whole supporting cast can be described as the center of each one of the characters of the anime pretty much. As for Taroumaru as an extra member as he is of course the mascot of the anime series, he was well put enough in the anime and make some sort of relevance, and of course he's the best puppy ever if I can say. The puppy and Mii-kun moments were the best moments in the anime. Thats what I can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: To start off, lets say that the artstyle for the series, is pretty much simple. Moe. Nah I'm joking with that simple statement. The art can be considered as high quality and yet decent artstyle fitting for the cast of colors. The series actually looks at times colorful and bright coloring at times, and sometimes in the anime when it comes to the tension moments it give a darker shade tone where it looks at the atmosphere. As for the animation I would say it was done well for the most part, especially at the fight scenes when it came for Kurumi. It just looked fantastic and fluid, it doesn't look that choppy or cracky. Or Jarring.\\n\\n\r\nHowever my only issue with the anime series would be once again, the CGI Zombies used at times during the anime. Its not a big issue because its not used that much, but at some places it just looks out of place and it doesn't look right for certain occassions of the anime. It just looks like also budget copy and paste at the same zombies, which makes it jarring. Overall the Art/Animation department is good despite that issue I found.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: To describe the manner of the music and sound department, the components are by far the strongest one out of all of them. The music for the first part of it, can be described as calming, and darkening tone. It uses different types of compositions in order to flow with the scenarios of the series. For example for the psychological aspect it uses a more so distorted OST, and for the emotional moments it uses a more instrumental and yet emotional OST. It fits with the scenarios very well and for me they become memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department it can be also described as amazing. You don't realize it at times, but when it comes to the moments when they're in danger, it gives a goosebumps and a very scared feeling, that cannot be explained. It just looks like an actual movie, where you get these moments of tension and you get a lot of the slaps and screams.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, here's a personal note. I actually screamed and fell down on my back one time during this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs well with the voice acting it fits with its cast very well, especially Kurumi and Miki. I love those voice actresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with a tiny bit of issues I tell you in the anime, its quite shocking I get to enjoy the show and feel so vastly invested in it. Of course if it wasn't for someone in particular to not skip it, I would have missed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIts a very good anime worth watching, expected from Lerche delivering this was not even surprising how much I love the series to death.",

[In order for me to write this review, I will have to give out a spoiler since a major plot twist happens in the first episode]\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of gakkougurashi is fairly simple. A zombie apocalypse takes place and traps a group of students in a school house. However the twist is that the protagonist sees the world as if everything around her is normal. I loved this show! the story telling was remarkable and some moments were so effective that I wasgenuinely crying. If you are looking forward to shedding a tear or two then give gakkougurashi a try. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of gakkougurashi are very likable. This show likes to do a little thing with it's characters. At the beginning, this show gets you to adore it's characters with some very cute and playful scenes, and then afterwards as the story progresses, the show puts it's characters into dangerous situations. Even if the character is a zombie, the show will make you care so much for that zombie that you wouldn't know who to root for. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: I enjoyed Gakkougurashi, a lot and I am not forgetting it any time sooner. The only problem I had with this show is the puppy, there was this puppy in this show who was very cute, but the puppy was stupid. He was the cause for a lot of the situations that the main characters were put into. Every time the puppy would wander of on his own and the characters would need to find him. However I cared for the puppy more than I expected to, towards the end.",

            "content": "** WARNING : Contains Spoilers **\r\nOne of the best Zombie Apocalypse Anime I have ever seen. It is about a group of girls, trying to live off in the world affected by zombie Apocalypse.\r\nThis Anime starts off as a Moe Anime, but gets dark in the First Episode itself. It isn't the zombies that make it dark.\r\nThe only thing that sets it different from other Animes, is Yuki (Main Character) who refuses the accept the zombie Apocalypse and pretends everything is fine.\r\nShe talks to her friends as if they are present, alive, and attending school just like she is. Unfortunately, they have all turned tozombies.\\n\\n\r\nWe see the reason for this peculiar behaviour explained in the last few episodes. The reason is sad and depressing. Although one might speculate it as a reaction to having lost her friends, there is something else to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n** Spoilers ahead : Don't read if you haven't watched the anime. 100% Recommended to watch **\\n\\n\r\nI haven't cried for so some time. After binge watching Your Lie in April, Clannad, followed by Violet Evergarden etc.., this Anime adds to the list.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\n* Yuki : (Main Character) She has lost her friends, and someone really close to her. Megu-nee held her with love. She tries to keep her promise to Megu-nee of \"never losing the smile\", and thus ends up pretending everyone was alive and OK. Her loss drove her into insanity and thus she began to refuse the reality, and the moe nature originates.\\n\\n\r\nThough she might seem as a burden, It is important to remember, that we are trying to save humanity. If we were to ditch a non infected human, It won't make us different than the zombies.\\n\\n\r\n* Kurumi : She knows how to wield the sword (shovel in this case :p), and fight. She is only one who had thrown out her feelings and fear for the zombies and was able to kill them.\\n\\n\r\n* Yuri : She does practically nothing, but is the brains of the school-live! club.  Her uncanny resemblance to Megu-nee is gradually revealed though.\\n\\n\r\n(!Spoilers)\\n\r\n* Miki : She is the only person not to have met Megu-nee. Atleast not till the end. \\n\\n\r\n* Megu-Nee : Teacher at this school.\\n\\n\r\nEx Teacher at this school.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, she pops out of nowhere and only talks with Yuki. She can't hold stuff and says they are too heavy. No one else talks to her. Her teleporting herself into the car (Ep 4) was creepy. One can foresee, she isn't alive, and is just a mental image created by Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nShe plays an important role in creating the school-live club and guiding it in the initial stages. She gets infected protecting the children, and turns into a zombie. Yuki was the only person, who could not accept it, and began her hallucinations.\\n\r\nShe tried to keep her promise of \"always smiling\".\\n\r\nShe was the guide in life and in death.\\n\\n\r\nI lost it when Yuki says \"Bye-Bye Megu-nee\".. :'(\\n\\n\r\nHonourable Mentions:\\n\r\n* Taroumaru : A dog, a friend and the second zombie to have helped the club. RIP. You shall be remembered for your bravery and loyal nature. RIP, my friend.\\n\\n\r\n* Zombies : They play a important role too. Zombies tend to remember the memories. The reason they hang around near school is that they loved to come to school. This love had been etched into their memories, and is the reason why they came to school everyday. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot : This Anime is not much of Horror, but of Psychological and Slice of Life Genre.\\n\r\nBoth these elements are strong enough to make a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe group of girls take shelter at the school, which surprisingly had lot of amenities like Solar powered electricity, rooftop garden (vegetables were grown), and what not. Perfect for taking shelter in a zombie Apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nIs this a coincidence? No. The reason is also revealed later as to why the amenities were there in the first place.\\n\r\nThe girls spend their days living in the school, cooking food, cleaning, and routine checks and trips for rations etc.\\n\r\nYuki spends her time in classroom, being tutored by a delusional Megu-nee.\\n\\n\r\nYuki's memory return gradually. And accepts the reality. Although she saw it with her own eyes, she refused to believe it. It was sad and depressing when Yuki talks to that door. :(\\n\\n\r\nIt is ok to be sad for one's death. The important thing is to let go \\n\r\nand not let your emotions take over to the extreme that you refuse to accept reality. \\n\r\n(A similar message was given in the Anime : \"Another\" )\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Episode specific*\\n\r\nFor people who feel they are just doing nothing, there isn't much to be done. A school is NOT equipped with killing equipments.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, for those who say, why they returned to school, instead of going away, that's becaue\\n\r\n- the school had electricity, water, food supplies.\\n\r\n- Power was cut off at other places\\n\r\n- They realized the potential of the school in keeping them alive. Any other place, they would have died earlier.\\n\r\n- They thought the infection had spread to a very wide range. They might not be able to travel that distance with a car without getting out of fuel. (Remember power is cut, so gas stations are useless), unless they find a way to dig into the underground fuel tank.\\n\r\n- They didn't knew of any other shelter places.\\n\\n\r\nSo, it made sense to return back to school.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, many people feel why they didn't go on a killing spree. It is important to remember that they are children. Murder is not a native instinct, especially not for a child.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is excellent. And one of the unique zombie apocalypse. Personally, it is the best one. I cried the last 2-3 Episodes (the whole episode) :'( .\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10 / 10 (A recommended watch)\\n\\n\r\n~Recoder",

            "content": "Contrary to many of those in the anime community, I\u2019m not actually a big fan of moe. I don\u2019t dislike it per se, but I could care less about its inclusion in shows. Despite this, I think it fits remarkably well in the case of Gakkougurashi. The juxtaposition between the cute girls and the dark things surrounding them makes for an interesting dynamic, even if it isn\u2019t entirely original and has been done better by other shows. I include this as an introduction to assure those reading this that my review isn't influenced by the use of cute anime girls (at least consciously, to myknowledge).\\n\r\nI\u2019ll refrain from spoiling anything about the show in case you\u2019re one of the few who hasn\u2019t heard a thing about it. Doing so; however, will be difficult as there is a massive plot twist at the end of the first episode. Because of the lack of spoilers, this review may seem oddly vague at times.\\n\r\n[Story 6/10]\t[Characters 9/10]\\n\r\n\tThe story of Gakkougurashi is, simply put, rather basic. It follows the usual plot you\u2019d expect from the type of show it\u2019s trying to be after episode 1. There is one point where it seems as though there may be something interesting added to the plot, but it\u2019s never pursued and is left unanswered. This is something that very well could be solved by a second season, but that's looking unlikely at the moment. Very little progression is actually made in the plot; however, that isn\u2019t where the show places most of its focus. The focus of the show is on its characters, their relationships with each other, and their struggle to survive in the harsh world. The small cast of characters are all well developed and have unique personalities, even if none in particular stand out. Without spoiling anything, one of the characters faces a \u201cmental disorder\u201d, for lack of a better term, that she has to overcome. Her challenge of getting over her problem is well developed and is definitely one of the highlights of the show. Even Taroumarou, their dog, is a likable character with a nice \u201cpersonality\u201d. Though its story may fall flat, the characters of Gakkougurashi manage to carry it forward.\\n\r\n\t\t[Art 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThe animation almost always remained fluid and didn\u2019t have any noticeable problems. In the happier scenes, brighter colors are used, whereas the darker scenes were less saturated. The art didn\u2019t really stand out too much, but it looked nice and was able to convey the story it was trying to tell successfully.\\n\r\n\t\t[Sound 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack of the series is well composed, but it\u2019s nothing too special. Specifically, some of the tracks manage to sound happy but have a dark undertone to them (comparable to say, Over the Garden Wall) which was a very fitting touch, though it wasn\u2019t many. A few of the darker and more emotional pieces were great, managing to carry a lot of meaning. I have no complaints regarding the voice acting, though it wasn\u2019t anything jaw-dropping. The sound of Gakkougurashi has its strong points in its music, but, for the most part, it\u2019s only slightly above average.\\n\r\n\t\t[Enjoyment 9/10]\\n\r\n\tSomething I didn\u2019t know whether or not to mention in the \u201cstory\u201d section of the review was the show's atmosphere. I decided it fit better here, as a well-crafted atmosphere relies on a blend of all of the above categories. With that said, the atmosphere of Gakkougurashi is very well portrayed. At any point in the show, even during the happier moments, it feels as though something bad is lurking just around the corner. It manages to keep the viewer on their toes at all times, even if nothing bad happens all that often over the course of the show. Because the first episode is from the eyes of the main character, Yuki and her disorder, a certain level of \u201ctrust\u201d with the show is broken that makes you continue to question things throughout the episodes. This almost psychological manipulation employed by the show was well executed and, just when you think you may be overly paranoid, it throws a twist at you. From the atmosphere of the show, I move onto the rest of the things I enjoyed in it. I was very attached to the characters, and I often found myself on the edge of my seat when something bad was about to happen to them. When they managed to pull through, I\u2019d experience an overwhelming feeling of relief. The sad scenes of the show were also heartbreaking, though they do suffer the same fate as any 12 episode series in that they may not have had as much build up as they otherwise could have had. The simple slice of life aspect in between the darker events happening was enjoyable to watch, more so if you take into account the atmosphere of paranoia in the viewer.\\n\r\n\t\t[Overall 8/10]\\n\r\n\tThough it only had a slightly above average soundtrack, decent art, and a sub-par plot, the blend of the three made for a phenomenal atmosphere. The small cast of well-developed characters placed in this atmosphere enhanced the show dramatically. I\u2019d recommend this show to anyone looking for a dark show with some interesting plot twists that\u2019ll keep you alert at all times.\\n",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!) is not your average Slice of Life style anime. Following the life of Yuki Takeya, it seems that this would appear to be your average anime of a cheerful girl who enjoys school. However, this is but an illusion. In reality, society and humanity has fallen due to a zombie apocalypse. Four girls have banded together in their school to survive this ongoing nightmare, while trying to maintain their daily lives of being students. As the story progresses, each episode will mess with your thoughts and emotions gradually until the very end where it destroys you. The art is graphic in some scenes,but overall very well made, as is the soundtrack. Each character is given their own ideals and ambitions, while at the same time keeping the similar to one another. Yuki is the playful, cheery girl. Miki is the quiet, stoic type. Yuuri (Rii) is the big sister and caretaker of the group. Kurumi is brave and adventurous, being the group's defender (thank you, Shovel Knight). After each episode, you'll be left with wanting more and more, trembling at the thought of what might happen next. Overall, Gakkougurashi! is a great (9/10) anime that deserves high recognition in being unique while not differentiating too much.",

You\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re testing your emotions and attachment to the characters and, what I think is the most important, you\u2019re trying to survive this show\u2019s surprises. Of course, Yuki, Yuuri, Miki, Megumi and Kurumi living in a besieged school and creating a \u201cschool-living club\u201d are kind of generic example of \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d formula. Especially joyful and careless Yuki Takeya, the engine of this anime and one of better thought fictitious figures in the last years. Nevertheless, I think that \u201cGakkougurashi!\u201d represents something deeper than a superficial zombie apocalypse or/and moe genre. It\u2019s a show aboutsurviving, yes. But rather than surviving in a post-apocalyptic world, it\u2019s more important here to consider that the characters deal with a loss of their friends, animals, families. It\u2019s also a beautiful show about moving on and acceptance. About looking after those who need it the most. It\u2019s an anime about friendship and mutual help. This is also the reason why I appreciate it a lot: because of its metaphorical values in which zombies walking around the school are just parables. Warning! Many tears will drop. Many sudden changes of tone are to be expected. Heartbreaking twists perhaps? See it yourself! 9/10.",

            "content": "To the reader: \r\n-~- I feel it's absolutely best to go into this show with no prior knowledge. The synopsis here is vague for a reason. Go in with an open mind and no expectations, and I think the viewer will have a much better experience. -~-\r\nI first encountered Gakkou Gurashi about 6 months ago- when it was announced as a Summer series anime. Reading the description, I got absolutely nothing from it- but a little more digging led to the discovery that it was a cross between moe and post apocalytpic with some emphasis on psychological narrative. I was immediately interested- as I'd neverseen such a combination before, and it sounded like it might be cool. \\n\\n\r\nCue the first episode- They say you can't have plot twists in the first episode... they were wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup and lead on with how we were seeing things versus in actuality were very surprising- shocking even. It had some of the most amazing framing and dissonance between the mental state of Yuki and her projection of reality I'd seen- and I was hooked. The subtle imagery as Yuki and Miki ran through the school, culminating with that classroom shot was incredible. I don't want to say too much here, because it's best to not know anything, but I really thought I finally had a worthy successor to the moe-horror that Higurashi had established itself queen of... but all was not well. \\n\\n\r\nBy the 4th or 5th episode, it was plain that Yuki's mental state and her way of dealing with (or not dealing with) the newly ruined world was not the focus of the show, but instead turned into this wishy washy dark and suspenseful tale one moment and slice of life cute-girls-doing-cute-things the next. While this type of flip flopping set up a really good vehicle for really hitting the viewer with the hard moments due to how light and fluffy it had been, Gakkou Gurashi still wasn't above typical moe/school show pitfalls. I mean, I get that school is in the name- School Live! being the closest English translation, but the inclusion of a pure fanservice episode at a KEY moment in the show, at the absolute climax was a horrible decision. \\n\\n\r\nWhen everything is on the line, and major decisions and changes are about to happen- why not just throw in a swimsuit episode? Because what we needed in a unique show was SOMETHING ELSE to make it just like every other anime involving schoolgirls- some good ol T&A. \\n\r\nI can't stress enough how badly this wrecked the very tense and suspenseful atmosphere they had painstakingly built up - a real tragedy in an anime that  could have been something better. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nIn a lesser show, there would have been a lot of pointless side characters introduced- but Gakkou Gurashi stays strong with an unchanging cast of four. With the focus on their interactions, we really get a feel for how these characters are as people, and actually care for them- something not many anime manage to achieve. While Yuki's incessant naivet\u00e9 is grating at times, at the point when I got sickest of it- the mood changes, and her illusionary existence comes crashing down, prompting a great shift in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the apocalypse, I think few people realize how important your health is. Often in such shows, the main characters are taken to heroic feats and ridiculous Deus Ex Machina moments because, well... they're the main characters and \"they can't die, hah!\" In this however, the sense of vulnerability is always looming. The characters remark over the course of the show how they realize that they can't stay at their school forever, and that there seems to be an ever increasing threat outside their tiny haven, and this gently increasing tension comes to a head at about the same time the sickening moe garbage was making my head hurt. The sense that the characters were in real danger and may die was there- and I genuinely expected deaths, I just had no idea whom. It was a really rewarding watch in that aspect, because the characters didn't just pull magic out of the hat, or develop supernatural powers. Gakkou Gurashi definitely stays very grounded, and I appreciated that very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left a bit to be desired though. It was the kind of feel good ending that probably everyone saw coming, and with the buildup to it, I was expecting a bit more given the dark conclusion it was foreshadowing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSide Note: \\n\r\nOne thing I've discussed about zombie media is the portrayal of how the apocalypse came to be, and whether it takes one of three routes that form the basis for the conflict: \\n\\n\r\n1.\tThat Science did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It\u2019s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that\u2019ll fool the teen demographic. \\n\r\n2.\tA Wild Virus Appeared! Some mutated microbe that\u2019s unaffected by any drug affects all but some small number of populace who, by plot convenience, don\u2019t contract the illness. \\n\r\n3.\tWho cares! Zombies are here and we have to destroy/evade/hide from them to survive! \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Gakkou Gurashi took route 3, but definitely with some shades of route 2. The subject of a virus and a planned response by the government was touched on, but it was never the forefront issue brought up as to why. Again, it doesn't really matter why the zombies are there- and it didn't need a pseudo scientific explanation to prove to me, the watcher, that it was that thought out. That part of the setting doesn't matter- it's how the characters DEAL with it that does. For the most part- they dealt with it. But then again, that's the conflict, isn't it? How does one deal with it?\\n\\n\\n\r\nScoring: \\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 6\\n\r\nConsistently good, but not anything special- definitely some excellent single frame shots with great small details and framing\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7 \\n\r\nCutesy intro, cutesy outro, cutesy insert music, and cutesy VA. What else is there to say?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nSince we had a full season to get to know and examine the characters, they feel genuine and the audience is actually given enough fodder to decide whether they care about/like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nPost Apocalyptia X moe, little bit of drama, some suspense, and enough Slice of Life to fill everyone's need for the mundane. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nWith the inclusion of a completely wasted fanservice episode and a few \"you idiot\" moments, that knocked it down a point. Strong beginning and a decent made up for it though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nIf a departure from the typical moe blob show into a bit darker territory is something you might be interested in, why not?",

It's overhyped only because of the moe characters.\r\nFound myself just skipping through parts (Yuki's annoyingness) and yup, sure enough, it just became ok. \r\nAnd for everyone else saying this is aclassic perfect example of PTSD.

            "content": "Gakkougurashi is an anime that takes two aspects from opposite spectra and juxtaposes them side-by-side, hoping to blend them together well. The two aspects being zombies and moe.\r\nHowever, in just the first episode, it shows how hard it is to coalesce moe and zombies together. Heavy symbolism and foreshadowing come into play to show just that. The star character, Takeya Yuki, cracks jokes and makes a fool. The other characters laugh at her as if they aren't in their current condition. In fact, the entirety of the cast doesn't show realistic reactions to their situations until lateinto the series. This is not a plus because for a show that has characters facing psychological situations, what the viewer wants is to watch the characters in their realistic state of mind. Either that, or something that has a lot of action or horror, or similar subgenre.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that Gakkougurashi is too flip-floppity with its storytelling. It lacks focus on what it wants to convey. There are scenes and complete episode setups that focus on the survivors' lives, playing and having fun, even though there's a constant struggle dealing with the zombie apocalypse they live in. Some of my favourite scenes with Yuuri talking with another character about the apocalypse were immediately followed by Yuki and her ridiculous moe, toning down the scene's serious mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe art \u03b5 animation of the show is average of your typical moe anime. Sometimes the animation is lazily done with slide motions but that's not often. Other than that, there weren't many problems although I did see saw some slight computer animation (for the zombies) in the final episodes that were aesthetically odd.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I thought the background music was exceptionally done and very fitting to the atmosphere. Sound effects weren't anything special but the voice acting was paired well with their respective characters, especially Yuuri and Miki. As for the ending songs, they were nice and gentle, bringing out the atmosphere of the series; there's not much to say about the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, at first, were nothing too amazing but were actually the opposite: empty shells that didn't quite have personalities. However, as the series progressed, so did the characters. Growing goals and battling with internal conflicts. Yuki too, began to bud intentions and objectives. This was a huge bonus for a show that began to lose my interest. \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing, I viewed Gakkougurashi as a worthwhile watch that attached me to its characters and made me want to watch more. Although I said that zombies and moe don't mix well, the first episode was full of necessary clich\u00e9 moe scenes, successfully setting up the show with the reveal at the end. In fact, I almost cried at the end (poor Taroumaru!).\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up, the main problems I had with Gakkougurashi were its rather inappropriate usage of moe and unrealistic characters. Other than that, the show was mostly enjoyable up to its end.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score:6.5/10",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!*\r\nVideo Review Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBsGvIUuBW8\r\nQuick Synopsis:\r\n           To give you a brief overview of this Anime\u2019s dimension, the story starts off with a calm, and peaceful setting, as most programs do. The main characters given to us are as flat as Paper Mario, and show no sign of difference to them, while being compared to the MOE narrative form of \u201ccute girls, doing cute things\u201d for some explicit reason. These characters are also a part of School Club called \u201cthe School Living Club.\u201d (Let that sink in for a minute or so.) However,as you continue watching, small hints of oddity can be gathered by the chilling sound effects and the dark iconography hidden in the show, which in turn, becomes the show\u2019s staple force. To top it off, at the end of the first episode\u2026when you least expect it, BOOM! The story reveals to you that this is not your ordinary MOE show, but a show of the dead, featuring, FOUR GIRLS, A DOG, AND 1 ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! Did I forget to mention that one of the main characters is shown to be a crazy nut job who thinks everything is fine and dandy\u2026if not\u2026well you KNOW NOW! However, after completing the series, there are a few questions that may leave you in a questionable state including?\\n\r\nWhy was the building so well-prepared for the outbreak?\\n\r\nAre there any drawbacks from the medicine used for Kurumi\u2019s wound/who created it?\\n\r\nDuring the club outing segment, after saving Miki, why didn\u2019t they just leave?\\n\r\nWhy weren\u2019t the Zombies formidable antagonists for the girls in the story?\\n\r\nWhy would they bring Yuki, if she was undergoing this emotional trauma?\\n\r\nWhy didn\u2019t we get to know any information about Yuuri\u2019s intake/past events with the Zombie Apocalypse?\\n\r\nWell, I believe it\u2019s time to jump into what I find to be the pros and cons of the ANIME adaptation of Gakkou Gurashi!\\n\\n\r\nStory-line:\\n\\n\r\n          After revealing the true nature of the Anime\u2019s plot after episode one, I wanted the story to focus on the character\u2019s attempts to fight through the consequences or problems the story would inflict upon them while having the desire to escape because of the Zombie Apocalypse. For the most part, the story was able to balance the MOE traits with the horror aspects well, but there were some slight problems in the Anime where the peaceful, and light-hearted tones conflicted with the story\u2019s horror side. A few examples would include: \\n\r\nExample 1: Episode 2 - Where Kurumi is conflicted about something, and Yuki breaks the tension with the Test of Courage idea.\\n\r\nExample 2: Episode 9 - Where they lose sight on the emergency manual situation to have some pool time.\\n\r\nHowever, the instances where the combination was executed brilliantly would include:\\n\r\nExample 1: When they were investigating the broadcasting room area in episode 8.\\n\r\nExample 2: Now this is kinda a combination, but at the end of episode one with the camera angles on Yuki as we are revealed that the world is not what it seems to be \u2013 Episode 1\\n\\n\r\n In light of the events leading up to the climax of the series, I found it to be entertaining, but odd to some degree. The sequence of events are in no particular order, but seem to follow your standard narrative structure quite well. We are given an exposition that informs us about the situation the ladies are in, and then we\u2019re given a few episodes which give hints of foreshadowing to various deaths, and some perspectives from at least two of the girls, being that of the bookworm Naoki Miki and our action girl Kurumi Ebisuzawa. The light-hearted moments with the girls having fun on the activities were adorable/enjoyable to watch, but sometimes it felt like they were dragged on to the point where I just wanted to see the gruesome, and darker elements which stem from its psychological portion! HECK, it\u2019s labeled as a SEINEN Manga series for a reason now! \\n\\n\r\n             However, the rise in suspense in episodes 10-11 were done well since they were able to capture the horror from the girl\u2019s situation internally, and externally with the visuals, soundtrack, and the character\u2019s facial expressions! Others and I may agree that the resolution of the show could have been a bit better, whether it be, one of the girls dying alongside Taroumaru, or that all of them could have died period. But, it makes sense by the logic given to us within the show, stating how the Zombies remember their previous lives/roles in society. Also, the fan service\u2026and I will say no more on that note. Overall, the storyline had its cons and certainly had its pros, but it could have been better if the story focused heavily on the darker plot lines, while incorporating some interesting material from the Manga\u2026*COUGH* Miki\u2019s refusal to believe in Yuki\u2019s dilemma! *COUGH* *HELICOPTER ARC* \\n\\n\r\n                                                        Characters:\\n\r\nIf I had to choose what character to talk about first, I\u2019d choose Yuki Takeya. Yuki is the most energetic, airheaded, and surprisingly the oldest girl from the batch. To some, she could be viewed as bait for their zombie fishing rod because of the way she is presented in the show, but since she views the world to be equivalent to that of a bowl of Lucky Charms, instead of a walk on Elm Street, it transforms her from being the typical stock character to that of a more dynamic individual as the story progresses. Examples of this progress can be seen during:\\n\r\nExample 1:  Use the carefree Yuki bits from episodes one and two here to explain her beginning! (Put In Small Box)\\n\r\nExample 2: Then use the bits in episode 5/6/7/10/11/12 where Yuki is shown to have some type of change throughout each episode in terms of her internal structure.\\n\\n\r\n          She may be a stereotypical girl fit for the Moe genre, and her joyful prescience in the Anime may have its good and bad instances during the important moments in an episode, but toward the second half of the show she starts to grasp the concept of reality as we draw near to the show\u2019s resolution. A quick pro or con for this character would include, strong character development and how her personality keeps the others from going insane. Though, through some eyes she may be shallow/annoying during the critical moments of the show, and that she may not hold any defining characteristics to her character other than what\u2019s given to her. \\n\\n\r\n          Alright, for the next character we have Mrs. Shovel Knight, Kurumi Ebisuzawa. Kurumi is the most athletic, thick-headed, and active member of the club. To some people she could be classified as the \u201cbest girl\u201d due to her tomboyish appearance. She\u2019s also one of the only members, who actually fights off the Zombies in every situation, but one. In terms of characterization, Kurumi is very reliant and calm in desperate situations, but could be classified as an emotional character since she typically believes she can handle every situation on her own which later bites her in the arm\u2026hehe. However, I found her backstory/flashback rather lackluster compared to another main character in the series. Her flashback included a love interest for a male character during her high-school track team days. Although it was able to bring out the action hero we know today, I felt that if the minor character was given more depth as the one I shall mention later on, then her flashback could have been a tad bit better. Overall, Kurumi is given great development after the fact, and thankfully, behind her shovel-like armor, she has emotional weaknesses to bring out the realistic quality to her character.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf I asked you the question of, \u201cWho do you think is Mecha\u2019s Favorite character from the club,\u201d and you answered Naoki Miki, then you will definitely be getting some goods in your stocking this year! Miki or Mii-kun as Yuki likes to call her, would have to be the most fragile, skeptical, and reserved member of the club. In terms of characterization, Miki can be looked as the foil or sidekick to Yuki\u2019s character, since they both have differing viewpoints on the zombie infested world, which enhance the qualities of Yuki\u2019s character largely. Miki\u2019s flashback would have to be the best one throughout the entire run of the series, since we are able to understand her personal emotions rather than her being a yes woman. Being able to see who she was before the outbreak occurred, and having lost her friend Kei to the Zombie apocalypse. Plus, with the additive of the symbolic CD player of friendship, I was able to feel sympathetic toward her character more than the other club members. An example of this could be seen throughout episodes 4-5 during the Miki retrieval mini arc.\\n\\n\r\n         {However, there\u2019s a slight note I have to mention that most Manga fans would discuss as well and that\u2019s after she is included. Miki isn\u2019t shown to be as resilient as she was in the Manga, and in this case I would have loved to seen more personal conflicts between Yuuri and her rather than what was shown in the Anime. Was this scene that big of a deal,\u2026not really? But it would have brought her character to life a tad bit more, but I\u2019m pleased with the ending result that was portrayed in the Anime.}\\n\\n\r\n         Now we reach the club\u2019s final member, and that is Yuuri Wakasa aka OPPAI JUSTICE! Yuuri is the most mature, kind-hearted, and resourceful member of the group. She normally plays the big sister role of the club, but when all heck breaks lose, she loses her calm nature and begins to break down emotionally. As far as characterization goes, Yuuri really doesn\u2019t have a backstory to go along with her character sadly, and some may consider her to be the worst of the group because of this. Yuuri does go through some emotional break downs near the ending of the story, but throughout the entire run of the series not much comes from her other than the stereotypical big sister traits seen in most Anime. However, she played her role quite well in the series, which didn\u2019t bother me at all. Hopefully, a second season, if given, will be able to bring life to this character, than what was portrayed in this season.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn terms of the minor characters including the clumsy, lovable teacher Sakura Megumi (Megu-nee), the animal mascot, Taroumaru, and Miki\u2019s best friend, Kei, they all played key roles in supporting the characters and story, as it progressed. With the incorporation of Megumi\u2019s character in the story, the series was able balance the peaceful and gloomy scenarios well. Also, Yuki\u2019s character was driven by the fact that she didn\u2019t want to remember the character\u2019s death, and without it, I believe she would just be a female with no inner emotions. Her impact on the rest of the cast including Miki was strong, since she was an integral piece to their puzzle of compassion. Though, the only down side to Megu-nee\u2019s character was the way her death was structured. If you\u2019re the type of person who likes a death that is straightforward than you may have complications with this specific character\\n\\n\r\n        With regards to the other two characters they share similar traits to that of one dimensional characters since they seem to be placed in the story, to satisfy the viewer or to enlighten a character trait for a member of our main cast. Spoiler, they both die, but Taroumaru\u2019s death was better in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound-Track:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack for the series was standard, but memorable to my ears. The opening theme titled, \u201cFriend Shitai\u201d by Gakuen Seikatsubu is amazing and honestly catchy. It\u2019s a great refresher and kick-starter for Gakkou Gurashi, even though the soundtrack doesn\u2019t match the story\u2019s premise in any way. Another highlight for this opening would be how the voice actresses who play the characters in the JP dub are actually the one\u2019s singing the song. \\n\\n\r\n           Speaking of the actresses, I found the JP voice acting to fit well with the characters. During the intense and joyous moments of the show, the voice acting seemed to be on point from what I recall from the program. Although when comparing the voice acting to other shows, it could be standard at most. However, I was able to obtain the general feel for each character, and I can\u2019t really complain there. \\n\\n\r\n           In regards to the three ending themes for this series, they fit perfectly, but are not really special or mind-blowing. Although, they grasp the sadness and happiness of the series, they don\u2019t seem to memorable, unless, your like myself who downloads the song and consistently listens to it during the random times of the hour. However, if I did have to choose the best track out of the three, it would have to be \u201cAfterglow\u201d by Maon Kurosaki. While listening to the vocal cover and instruments play in the background you could feel the sadness obtained during the reveals in the show.\\n\\n\r\n            On the other hand, there are some instances where the sound effects in the Anime are used during the most random moments. One to note would be in episode four when Miki suddenly notices Taroumaru fled the room, there\u2019s an instance where a wind sound could be heard. Now it\u2019s quite miniscule I know, but it seemed rather odd to me at the time. However, the OST for the critical and light-hearted moments fit well for the series.\\n\\n\r\nExample: Episode 6: When Miki asks Yuki, who\u2019s Megu-nee?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art quality in Gakkou Gurashi, there wasn\u2019t really much that bothered me, besides two things, and that would be the misplacement of certain facial features and the lovely use of computer animation or as the cool kids say CGI. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhat I mean by the misplacement of character features would include scenarios where the children are given no eyes, or are losing parts of their appearance. This can be shown during Yuki\u2019s delusional moments. I understand it\u2019s a part of the child-like art form, but in most instances some of the background characters are given features that show them as dolls or figurines. Now the only time I found this to fit well would be during the comical and embarrassing moments for the characters, but that\u2019s about it.\\n\\n\r\nExample: The character bubbles seen during the child-like moments of the show and during the instances when they tell each other off, in a humorous manner.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn terms of the use of CGI, the only complaint I have with it would have to be the zombies and sometimes the background character designs. The cars, buildings, scenery, etc. didn\u2019t seem to bother me in any fashion, since they never change to the traditional animation style. Some series like Rwby, I feel, use computer animation well because their series started as CGI and remained CGI. However, with the zombies and people they often change from the computer animation and traditional animation style frequently, and I felt that it should\u2019ve stayed true to one animation style.\\n\\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, I didn\u2019t seem to find any problems with the background elements of the series, or the artwork on the character\u2019s appearances since they clashed well when the series decided to flip the mood, occasionally. Heck, even the dark color pallets on the zombies and the red bubbles that surrounded Kurumi and the other characters during their quarrel with the dead made me shiver in excitement. The animation was standard, but interesting in the slightest. The camera angles used in some of the scenes really hit home during the emotional and climatic moments of the show. A few examples would include:\\n\\n\r\nExample 1: The zoom in features on the faces of Yuuri/Yuki/Miki during their encounter with the zombies. \u2013 Episodes 5/6/10/11\\n\\n\r\nExample 2: The glass as it is falling down from the building because of the zombies gaining access into the school building. \u2013 Episode 10\\n\\n\r\n\tDon\u2019t even get me started with the awesome foreshadowing elements they placed into the opening sequence of the series, because I believe I would like to take a deeper look into that predicament, in the near future of my YouTube Channel. (Why did you have to steal my thunder, Mother\u2019s Basement!)\\n\\n\r\n\tAlthough I would have loved for there to be more fluid animation in the action scenes rather than some elongated still frames, I still felt the series had pretty decent animation, nonetheless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n\tPersonally, while watching this series I was rather stoked to find out what would happen next, and re-watching the previous episode to find out the hidden artifacts of the real world was fun in itself. Does the series have its flaws? Absolutely. Would I recommend people who are new to Anime to watch it? Certainly. If I had the power to change anything from this series, what would I change? Honestly, the only way to fix the issues for this series would be, by stretching the series to at least 18 to 21 episodes to fit the source material in perfectly. Keeping true to one type of animation style rather than mixing both of them together, and maybe giving some of the characters a little more depth to make them connect with the audience more.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the series was able to provide the entertainment I was looking for in a show at the time, and I would definitely give it a re-watch sometime in the near future.\\n",

            "content": "*THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE*. So watch it if you haven't. It might seem boring and stupid at the start, but trust me, it's worth.\r\nGakkougurashi was an anime that I had to finish. It was underlyingly twisted, which made this anime quite enjoyable, for the most part.\r\nStory: 7.5-ish\r\nWell the concept of the anime was pretty basic, however, it sure as hell did not start off that way. I was trolled really bad. But breaking it down, when you do get past episode 1, it's pretty much a zombie apocalypse and a bunch of girls trying to survive. Whatmakes this anime really interesting though, is the individual stories following the characters. It messed with you a bit, with all the plot twists. This was all really well done. They showed us how each character dealt with the whole situation  in their own way, which is defs a plus.\\n\r\nBUT\\n\r\nUnless you really like slice of life, the 'slice of life parts in between really distracted from the good creepy stuff about handling the zombies. This, and the comedy element of the anime. It was alright at times, however I don't think I ever really remember laughing out loud. It lightened up the anime for sure, but when the anime was really good, it was when they focused more on the disaster that these girls are constantly living in DANGER. Like, for a bunch of school girls who are really young, they act pretty calm (despite some being psychologically disturbed, I guess). But what about their family? Never touched that subject.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNot too shabby. What I really wished though, was to actually see some more gory elements of the zombies. They would seriously be so much scarier if they actually showed their faces at least once. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7-ish\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself I would give a 6. It wasn't memorable at all. The OP was really good. Had me trolled from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7.5\\n\r\nI liked all the characters in the anime, just the main, I had to warm up to her. At times she really got on my nerves. I didn't understand her happy-go-lucky personality and found it occasionally annoying, as it kind of just distracted from the really interesting bits. I get that she is just meant to be kawaii and silly to block out her fears and pain, but still, having to watch at least 10 episodes of it, I couldn't bear it very well. I just wanted her to FACE REALITY, and it was so frustrating when she couldn't.\\n\r\nBUT. \\n\r\nwhen she did, she was so much better. Her character development was a slow one, but by the end of the season, I did understand her situation. I did not hate her, despite her overly happy nature, but by the end of the anime, I still cared about her as the other characters always had. The other girls, I liked them all for different reasons. Their personality types were pretty standard, however all the decisions they had to make always left me on edge. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIf this anime had just cut the crap and focused solely on the psychological effects and of the apocalypse, they would have a much stronger story, However, it wouldn't really be the same. The slice of life put into this anime, juxtaposed with the deadly zombie apocalypse created quite disturbing concept. Overall, I did enjoy this anime and the ending opens up so many doors for new characters and uncovered secrets that still haven't been answered. The world is much larger than just the school.\\n\r\nI would be excited for a second season, but if they didn't, I don't think I would be that upset either.",

            "content": "Note: Light spoilers but spoilers are written vaguely as to not fully spoil the reader. \r\nGakkou Gurashi started out with potential. The manga it was adapted from juggled harrowing tension along with moe slice of life moments pretty well and the anime started out quite strongly. However, as the series dragged on it also began to fall apart, both as an adaptation of the manga and in terms of plot structure.\r\nI will first highlight how the anime compares with the manga as an adaptation before moving onto reviewing it as its own entity.\r\nThe series had a very strong bait-and-switch episode 1, it lures you intoa sense of security before pulling back and revealing its dark nature all too well and I highly recommend watching the first episode- and maybe episode 3- if you have even the slightest interest in the series before reading the manga instead. The manga provides better characterization and pacing especially if compared with the anime whose pacing slowed to a complete crawl by episode 5 before suddenly accelerating at around episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development for Miki and Yuuri has suffered considerably. Key moments to their arcs such as Miki warming up to Yuki and Yuuri's descent into madness aren't portrayed at all in the anime, unless if you consider Yuuri very briefly loosing it in episode 11 but even then she still picked herself up by episode 12 without any repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nThis dog is given more screentime than it should have gotten and is arguably a bigger focus to the anime than some of the girls. The focus on Taroumaru is one change from the manga I'd rather the creators not have taken. Especially in the later episodes, the focus is shifted to Taroumaru's end of the spectrum, with the girls seemingly caring more for the stupid dog rather than themselves and their friends. At one point, an episode's plot hinges on Taroumaru's importance so much that the gravity of the girls' plight is weakened as a result. \\n\\n\r\nWhile its all too easy to blame the anime's fault entirely on Taroumaru, the fact is, even when judged on its own merit, the anime still falls flat on several occasions. Even with the focus on Taroumaru, the anime still had plenty of episodes to provide the girls with more characterization and to further contextualize theie situation. Instead, most of the episodes in the middle of the series, beginning with episode 4, focused more on the Slice of Life elements rather than the Survival elements.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes, the Slice of Life moments were there to highlight the danger the girls are in, subverting standard cliches by juxtaposing them with the very real danger the girls face on a normal basis. However later episodes almost always completely focus on the Slice of Life elements, making the show less a twisted Survival Horror with Slice of Life elements to a Slice of Life show guest starring some zombies. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the gratuitous fanservice for this. Episode 4 and 5 had several disturbing shots of Miki in her lingerie, some low angle shots, and this really damaged any credibility to the emotional scene the show was trying to convey. Later episodes aren't much better, with shower scenes and beach episodes being the tip of the iceberg. Hell, there's a 20 second scene where the girls have a conversation with the camera focusing on their breasts the whole time. Classy.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say the anime is completely flawed though. There are a few good moments spread here and there. Episode 3 is a good example of what the show does best, creating a no-nonsense horror atmosphere is one of the show's biggest strengths and it serves to highlight how much of an improvement the anime would have been under better direction.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, Gakkou Gurashi the anime is a poor adaptation and a weak anime on its own right. Reading the manga just reminds the viewer of how much of a wasted potential the anime is. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 Disappointing.",

            "content": "Story & Writing:\r\nThe author of Gakkou Gurashi probably hit upon one extremely interesting idea and decided to write an entire series based on that one brainwave. However, he probably didn't realize that an interesting idea ain't worth jack shit if you don't develop and expand upon it. As a result, we get Gakkou Gurashi.\r\nWhile interesting at first, this show ended up feeling half-assed and lazy. Its more unique aspects are introduced solely as a gimmicky selling point and was never capitalized on as the show waddles awkwardly between cutesy moe and edgy horror. I don't think the show itself even knows what it wants tobe. It's neither dark, gritty nor realistic enough to be a compelling horror, but neither is it fun and lighthearted enough to be a slice-of-life either. By the end, this entire show feels like one big sloppy mess of somewhat interesting ideas loosely strung together with blood, spit and moe. Absolutely no cohesion nor depth - just novelty and shock factor.\\n\\n\r\nBut the depth and development - or lack thereof - is not the only subpar thing about this show. It genuinely could have thrived off of its barebones premise alone if only the characters weren't so goddamn boring and generic. \\n\r\nEven if a show's writing fails to develop on its own premise, it can still be decent provided that its characters are decently interesting and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut in Gakkou Gurashi, I do not give a single fuck about any one of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nNot Yuki. Not Yuuri. Not Miki. Not Kurumi. Not even the fucking dog.  \\n\\n\r\nThey can all go die for all I care because they do not have a single shred of individuality nor charisma about them. I really think that these characters are the ultimate symbol of Gakkou Gurashi's identity crisis, of its internal conflict and indecisiveness towards whether it wants to be a moe slice of life or a post-apocalyptic horror. Even Yuki, the most promising character, was never really properly explored nor developed. Her unique \"trait\" ends up being just another one-hit-wonder gimmick swept along in the sea of gimmicks that makes up this show. When you boil these characters down, they're all just generic moe tropes who got shoehorned into an oh-so-dark-and-tragic setting. That's it. They don't really do anything. They don't abandon their humanity to butcher zombies nor develop baser human desires for sex nor do they betray one another nor sacrifice themselves or any of that juicy stuff. Not in Gakkou Gurashi. These boring-ass characters are only there just to bitch, cry and whine. It never feels like they're making any kind of radical or substantial decisions, nor are they plunged into any extreme scenarios that would force them to step outside their comfort zones and make decisions they would usually not make. Instead, they just act really laid-back, fucking around on top of the school rooftop like nothing's happening. At the end of the day, no matter how this show tries to fucking hide it, these characters are ultimately just cute girls doing cute things, with maybe a bit of edginess, angst, and melodrama sprinkled on top. This is not really innovative or anything. Angst and melodrama are already ubiquitous enough among slice-of-life shows. What's your excuse, Gakkou Gurashi?\\n\\n\r\nOh and btw, a certain character acted like a complete retard towards the end, causing contrived angst and melodrama to ensue. \\n\r\nWhat's worse is that all of this tension and conflict are resolved in one fell swoop through one convenient plot device. This solution wasn't really mind-blowing or anything, and the show could have done it way earlier and save the audience the anguish of sitting through 12 episodes of trashy moe and pseudo-horror clusterfuck. Up to that point, the show has been barely passable with its writing - neither too dumb nor too smart. I was willing to give the show a 6 but because of this dipshit plot development, down to a 5 you go you piece of shit. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: This show's lazy writing plays it too safe and never wants to push anything, to make anything extreme or interesting. The characters and their emotions; the plot developments; the setting - all of them are ultimately bland and pointless, not worth giving a damn about.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art design is slightly above average, boasting a vibrant color palette but bland  character design and visual style. Also, it really toned down the more gory aspects of its story, soft-censoring or completely omitting scenes showing blood and violence. In other words, the artstyle is an awkward cross between visceral and cute, neither fully embracing one nor the other. Once again, this just goes to show how half-assed Gakkou Gurashi is, with no real identity or substance to add flavor to its premise.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is surprisingly good. Many of the background tracks are extremely creepy and manages to perfectly set the tone every time. It's a shame, though, that it's wasted on the mediocre writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n5/10 \\n\\n\r\nYou know what? I just had more fun typing up this review than I ever had in my 4 hours of watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n5/10",

There is a noteable lack of an antagonist on this series, the only concern about their actions being their own feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the combination of comedy,drama and tragedy make this a well made story, easily enjoyable and somewhat pleasant.

The OP's and ED's were amazing with great attentions to detail within each one. Also the way the OP changed based on where you were in the story was a really nice touch.\r\nThe characters were lovable fromthe start and become increasable likable further on in the series. There's Yuki the airhead carefree one, \\n\r\nKurumi the tomboy, Miki the reserved one and Yuuri the reliable older sister.

I bought the series on dvd the second I finished it.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime over other animes such as High school of the Dead was because it felt more realistic not in art style but in which the way the girls react in the situation as they don't have unrealistic resources like army weapons and so on.

And that is not form the plot or story being unbearable, I am not going to say more so as to not do the whole spoiler alert.  It completely restored and repaired the damage that had been done to my love of the zombie genre. All of theshows and cut rate just plain awful zombie movies and shows that have flooded the market in the last few years had all but made me want to give up on the whole zombie genre, I have been a fan since I was a child and watched the Romero films the original dawn and day of the dead. Then came the fad that people realized that a zombie movie was the cheaper of the horror movies to make and the market was flooded with crap, beginning with the remake of day of the dead. Then the walking dead went and turned the whole plot line into something like an American soap opera, there is a time to end a story, instead of dragging it way beyond any kind of sense. But with that being said I would love to see at least one more season of gakkou gurashi! the content is there in the manga the introduction to other characters and more plot, this one deserves another season a lot more than the 22nd season of the walking dead.",

So one day, I sat down and turned on the first episode.\r\nThe first thing I noticed was that this was a moeblob anime. There are a lot of those out there so I was already wondering why this one stood out the most. Itwas cute, funny and enjoyable. But once I saw  the end of the first episode, I realized why this stood out. I was left shocked, freaked out, but continued to watch the show. And by god was it worth it.\\n\r\nGakkouGurashi tells the story of Yuki, who lives at her school with her friends Kurumi, Yurri, Miki and their teacher  Sakura in the School Living club. Yuki is a cheery girl who loves her school, attends her classes, talks with her friends because the reality of the schoo, is too much for her to handle. While in her mind, she's at school where nothing happened, because the real world is a zombie appocolypse.\\n\r\nThe plot flows smoothly leaving out holes and if there are some, they fill it up faster than a glass of water. The twists in the show are shocking, heartbreaking,  ur you still want more\\n\r\nThe characters develop so perfectly, making you care for each person. By the end of the first episode I could remember everyones names and I fell in love with everyone.\\n\r\nThe art and sound are spectacular switching form extremely cute to disturbing in just one frame or one note.\\n\r\nOver all, this is one of the greatest animes of all time, and I can't wait for the season two.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE!!SPOILER FREE!!SPOILER FREE!!\r\n=================\r\n                  INTRO\r\n=================\r\nI don't usually read the synopsis when starting a show and I started this believing it's another generic moe blob but gave it a chance because the twin tail girl in the poster looked kind of charming. I was not disappointed and it truly was a moe sol show---at the start. I noticed some out of place scenes but didn't pay much attention because I thought it was just an average studio making average mistakes.\r\nThen it happened....\r\n=================THE REVIEW\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe studio has done a brilliant job in hooking its viewers with the 1st episode. The show's symbolism and subtle camera pans are done really well all throughout the series. I am usually someone who does not watch moe shows but the 1st episode really pulled me in. Sadly, the show suffers from poor pacing starting from Episode 3 instead of building up on the foundation that the 1st episode laid. \\n\\n\r\nThe show switched to a 4-5 episode back story of an uninteresting character with an uninteresting past (except for Taroumaru!). Almost half of the show was used up for her.  The backstory of Megu-nee and Yuki, 2 pivotal characters, was also bare bones to give way to that flashback. It also felt like they overused the moe-sol segments for too many episodes. I think they could have used more episodes during their first few days so we could get invested in their relationships but they just used a \"tell do not show\" style which was kind of cheap.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, they got back on track during the last three episodes and it was a great roller coaster of emotions. Murphy's Law be damned!\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             CHARACTERS\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nThe twin tail girl charmed me into watching this show and boy, was I not disappointed. Shovel girl--ahem--Kurumi is definitely best waifu material (did I do it right?). She is literally and figuratively, the group's guardian. She is a strong-willed dependable badass that supports the group from the frontlines. PTSD? Ha! Kurumi laughs and fights at the face of adversity!\\n\\n\r\nYuki is the emotional support and Rii-san the stomach support (LOL). Really, all the characters are archetypes and it's pretty good how they leave and evolve as a character except for Rii-san who does not get any backstory at all. Well, at least she's good as a housewife.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even going to dig deep for Miki as I'm still bitter about her abundant screentime. For taroumaru, that little ball of cuteness deserves pet of the year!\\n\\n\r\n=================\\n\r\n             VERDICT\\n\r\n=================\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a pretty good depiction of the anxiety and fears that teenagers feel as they take that first step into society. Replace the zombies with Adults trying to get the characters to conform to the norms; Megu-nee as that fond memory in your childhood that you cannot just let go; Taroumaru as a reminder of your innocent days;  the Apocalyptic zombie world as society full of uncertainties, disappointments, and despair; and the Graduation as a sign of that bold first step outside of your comfort zone and into a new world of unknowns.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode and the great attention in details makes me want to give this show a 10. Unfortunately, the flaws are glaring and it felt like it would be too unfair to give it my bias.\\n\\n\r\nso in the end I give it...\\n\\n\r\n7.4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nA show with great potential hampered by poor pacing, little character development with some characters, and too many moe-sol segments.",

            "content": "Summer was certainly a busy season for Lerche, seeing as this is just one of their three shows to air during it's course (The other two being Monster Musume and Ranpo Kitan: Game Of Laplace which I also reviewed right here). Out of them all though, School-Live! quickly became the most critically acclaimed, boosting sales of the manga by a massive 1000% following its animated premiere. This becomes even more impressive when you consider that director, Masaomi Ando, only has a couple other directorial credits to his name (Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse/White Album 2). But does School-Live! live up to the hype? (No punintended, I swear.) That's of course up to you decide -- but I'll weigh in on it in just a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, and a hefty portion of the manga, is mainly centered on the pink-haired, bubbly Yuki Takeya, who is so torn up by the event of a zombie outbreak that she has created a world in her head where literally nothing has changed. The first episode sets the stage for this anime absolutely perfectly, disguising the entire episode just how it would look from the perspective of Yuki. It isn't until the very last scene where we find out that everything we just watched was a gigantic hallucination and that the majority of the characters we saw were dead and...well, not gone. But you know what I mean. Everything from that point onward takes on a complete tonal shift. This is no longer the bright, joyous show we expected (Considering you went into blind, without any knowledge of what it really was). Instead, it's a psychological mess of how teenage girls handle being the last few people on what could be the entire planet. We don't really know yet.\\n\\n\r\nEach member of the School Living Club plays an important part in keeping the group a well-oiled machine. Take one of them away, and everything starts to fall apart. Yuki keeps the group motivated and hopeful. Yuuri is the wise, motherly figure that everyone looks up to. Miki brings reason and logic into the mixture. And Kurumi kills zombies with a shovel. (Needless to say, she is best-girl). The girls are dependent on each other for this entire series. I mean, how can you not when your friends are trying to kill you and eat you? That dependence, however, is great under these circumstances because the result winds up being packed with wonderful chemistry and sort of developmental paradox where each girl helps the next find something out about themselves. Not to mention, each one's style and attitude is so well-contrasted with the others that all viewers will be able to easily choose their favorite. There's none of that whole \"Otaku-Inner-Struggle (OIS for short, which is a disorder I just made up)\" where we have to fight between girls to decide on who the superior one is.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off as just a tale of survival, but slowly builds up until more and more backstory in uncovered. The pacing, as far as this is concerned, is spot on. We get a ton of exposition and learn a little bit about each character before things start to get really weird. And I mean really weird. Not to mention, each doubt that viewers have -- each \"Well why is there still electricity?\" type question will not go unanswered. The story is well-written with those concerns in mind. I don't know if I've ever watched something before where literally every single loophole is filled in. It's actually quite spectacular when you really think about it. There are so many skeptical notions you think up while watching this series, and all of them come to a satisfactory close just episodes later. In addition, the usage of suspense and subtle details hidden in the background will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire twenty-something minutes of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis paragraph might get spoiler-heavy, so skip it if you haven't watched the series and still intend to do so. Up until the halfway-point of this series, when we find out that Megu-Nee has been dead this whole time (Which I totally called, by the way), the show is just pretty good at best. But when we find out that some of society knew this was coming, that's when this show gets great. It's not just school girls trying to survive and fend off zombies anymore. It's a thought provoking tale of how we might handle a situation like a zombie outbreak -- what we would do if we had reasonable suspicion that one might occur. And that raises thoughts like, \"Well, if we knew this might happen, why didn't we prevent it? What happened to everyone else? Why these four girls?\" Life or death situations in anime are great no matter what. But when those situations involve adolescents in a world where adults aren't even there for guidance, those are the times when that life or death stuff really shines. Seeing adolescents forced into growing up quicker just to conserve and fight for their own lives is significantly more impactful than having some huge, burly mech-fighter dude fighting another giant mech-warrior with his life on the line.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nThis is a damn good show. It's much better going into it like I did (Without any idea of what it's about) than going in with the knowledge that it will turn into a psychological thriller, but I guess that is now impossible considering you just read this review. Regardless, this easily snuck its way into my \"Top 10 Anime Series 2015\" just as I'm sure it will for a lot of others. So to answer the question of \"Whether or not it lives up to the hype,\" the answer is yes. Yes it does. Pick this or the manga up, and allow yourself to go on a journey filled with cute-girls on the brink of death and lots of bloodshed. Lots and lots of bloodshed.",

            "content": "I was much more impressed by this anime than I expected it to be, it was something I randomly came across on Crunchyroll and didn\u2019t expect much out of. Granted, I had been spoilered for the basic premise so knew what I was getting into on that front, but regardless, thought it would be handled sloppily and immaturely (like some others I could mention). \r\nI\u2019m glad I was wrong. It\u2019s really hard to say without spoiling, but I\u2019m going to try on the off chance that you\u2019ve read this without actually reading the synopsis on MAL first. \r\nThe characters were developed well, some more thanothers. I will say I really didn\u2019t like Yuki, the MC, but I could understand her. (It really didn\u2019t feel like she was a high school student though.) The other 3 main characters started off quite one-dimensional but gained more depth simply as more of the surroundings were explored, and you could get a better glimpse of what they were dealing with on a daily basis. They did grow as people through their struggles, Yuuri-San in particular felt much older than her age sometimes. The backstory was brought in at exactly the right time, and to amazing effect. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that the premise it was actually handled quite realistically (not that I\u2019ve ever experienced anything remotely like what happened in this anime, but it was consistent with other decent literature I\u2019ve read on the subject). Your perspective really changes once you realise that everything they do, all their cute antics, are just to maintain a semblance of normality that will allow them to retain their sanity, and it makes you wonder if you would do as well in their shoes. (Oops, that was kind of a spoiler, but an unavoidable one.)\\n\\n\r\nSound was good and art was good. No complaints on either of those two. Normally I\u2019m not one for the \u2018cutsey\u2019 art style, but I can understand why it was needed here.\\n\\n\r\nThere was quite a big shift in tone right at the very end. It was nice (if a bit rushed), but it also undermined a lot of the build up in the rest of the show. Maybe I just found it disappointing because I was expecting it to take a vastly different turn. Either way, it felt a little out of place, and did make me lower my score a notch.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, this anime was a pretty good attempt at its genre. Why didn\u2019t I rate it higher? Because I didn\u2019t think it was THAT good. It didn\u2019t feel like a masterpiece or anything. The series was enjoyable, but there wasn\u2019t much to it apart from the premise (though, in its defence, I don\u2019t think there was meant to be). And whilst I liked the characters and thought their stories were done well, the show didn\u2019t make me that emotionally invested in them. Yes, I could appreciate them, and empathize with them to an extent, but nothing similar to what I felt in Shinsekai Yori or Zankyou no Terror. It was more a feeling of dread for their situation, an \u2018insert yourself\u2019 anime. Which is great, but as it\u2019s not what the show was aiming for, it wasn\u2019t a positive here.\\n\\n\r\nStill, let me reiterate, it did impress me for what it was (enough to give it a 7, anyway), and I\u2019d recommend you give it a go if you like cute girls dealing with the struggles of daily life - and then some.

            "content": "Moral of the story is too have a shovel in case of Zombie Apocalypse !!\r\nThis was a story i had a sense of dread going in. I have never been a fan of these Emotional tugging stories. I'm also not a fan of the overused genre of Zombies. But i forced myself into this so i wouldn't keep putting this off. I did very much enjoy this in the end but i probably wouldn't want to watch it again if asked. \r\nIt is one of those show's that are good and fun to watch the first time. But once you know everything then it doesn'thave the same effect as your first time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI'v never really enjoyed Zombie media's, Just because i find it so unrealistic it's unbearable. I can suspend my disbelief that Zombies start appearing. But i find it annoying that when you think of it. The military of any Post Cold War nation shouldn't have too many problems. Places like Japan,America,Russia, Ect... They all have armored vehicles that no human would be able to tear apart. The Lightly Armored Humvee's wouldn't have any problem. Let alone Massive Tanks. Helicopters and Planes are way above the ground and don't have to worry, Unless the Zombies get their hands on Stinger missiles. I doubt any Army would even deploy Infantry troops. This is something that just bugs me about how every Zombie media i'v seen has the Military unable to do anything.\\n\\n\r\n~~Spoilers~~\\n\r\nEveryone said's you should go into certain Animes and Manga's blind. But that tends to be hard to do. Reading the description gives you a basic idea of what's gonna happen. So when the reveal that the Zombie Apocalypse has actually happened. It's not that surprising. \\n\\n\r\nIt is nice how they have the MC have these delusions that the world is still the same and nothing is wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some things i didn't like. Such as the characters ( Kei & Megumi ) Both being dead. I really wished that Megumi was still alive. Such as her being zombiefied but still able to operate as a normal human or even have her saved by the vaccine in the end. Same With Kei. We are given a glimpse of what looks like Kei as a zombie when the cast leaves the school. \\n\\n\r\nI get wanting to be serious. But i honestly think the show may have benefited better if those two were both alive in the end or at least Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does put you on the edge of your seat. You never know what's actually gonna happen. Any moment one of the characters have a real chance of dying. This is even made more extreme when we have a character who is living in her own fantasy world. Completely oblivious to the zombies, Means she can get herself into danger any moment. Your left with a very hopeless feeling with her on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is also pretty great too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall awesome story. Just not something you will want to watch again any time soon.",

            "content": "I tried my best to not include major spoilers, but very minor spoilers are included (only from the first episode!).\r\nGakkougurashi is a light-hearted Moe cute anime. Well, who am I kidding? Gakkougurashi is an emotional roller-coaster that will make you rethink a lot of things in your life. \r\nWhen I started watching it, I knew it was going to be dark, but I didn't know it was going to be THIS dark. The illusion of cuteness and slice of life shatters after the first episode's ending. After that, you are taken on a very emotional adventure with high school students Yuki, Kurumi, Miki and Yuuri.\r\nStory:\\n\r\nYuki is a high school student. She is a member of a very unique club- the \"school-living-club\". As the name suggests, the members of this club live in school. The members cook, sleep and even shower in school. You might ask yourself \"but why are they living in their school? Don't they have homes and families?\" The answer is simple- they do not have any other choice. The human race has been almost completely destroyed by zombies.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is very Moe-ish and cute. But don't get confused, this anime is dark and twisted, maybe even more than horror anime with a more serious art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music are great and very suiting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI'll sum it up in one sentence: THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING. (okay and here are my reasons for this claim..) Together with the 4 main characters, you really feel as if you are in their situation yourself. You watch the grow, learn and change (and maybe even do so yourself). You can feel their sadness, happiness and pain, and for me that's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much. I was expecting a regular horror anime that relies on gore and blood as it's horror factor, but this was psychological. (i will not write any examples as i don't want to spoil this amazing anime, but if you do decide to see it you will understand where i'm coming from.) In just 12 short episodes, this anime brings you to tears of both happiness and sadness, makes you worry and laugh, and most of all, makes you scared. I LOVED this anime, because it has a little bit of every genre: slice of life, comedy, shounen, drama, horror, and romance. No matter what your favorite of those genres might be, I highly recommend you watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi, or \"School-Live!\", might have the best pilot episode of any anime I have ever seen. Not in terms of plot or humour, but in the way it is written. The way the episode uses the audience's expectations (or lack there of) to it's advantage is nothing but pure brilliance. Just like a skilled magician it misdirects your attention in a way so that when you're rewatching it for a second time, it all suddenly seems obvious. Therefore, going into this anime blind is extremly rewarding.\r\nThe story as a whole is very entertaining, but most importantly: satisfying (something a lot of other anime fails tobe). It is said that the most dangerous part of tightrope walking are the last few steps, and the same is true when telling a story. I could go on forever about shows that start out as great, only to f*ck it all up with an ending that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. But thankfully; when Gakkougurashi ended, it felt right.\\n\\n\r\nNo anime is perfect though, and with Gakkougurashi the flaws are with the main characters themselves. We never really get to know them, what you see is what you get. And considering the kind of situation these girls are in, I think it would've been nice to learn at least a little about their backgrounds. For instance, why do they never talk about their families? Like, at all?! \\n\\n\r\nBut besides that, the characters aren't bad, and the relationship between them is both portrayed and developed in a great, believable way. Both the art and sound is of the quality you should expect from a modern anime. And I also like the way the OP changes as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Gakkougurashi is a bit of a paradox. Because I can tell you one thing: it does not deserve the 10 rating. But despite that, I still kinda want to give it a 10 rating. And an anime that makes me wanna give it a 10, even though it doesn't really deserve a 10, definitely deserves a 10.",

If you haven't watched it yet i suggest you go in blindly, as I did. \r\nAt first, you think its all moe-cute-kawaii-what you wish school would be but after the first episode... it shows us what really is happening.\r\n{Story 7/10}\r\nGood story, but not outstanding. After the first episode, you can kinda get a grab on what's going to happen. Plus you know that most likely none of the main characters will die, (well the ones alive won't). Unlike other animes like Magical girl raising project, or Madoka Magica, it doesn't take many sad turns, no twists thatleave you shocked in your chair.\\n\\n\r\n{Art 9/10}\\n\r\nAmazing art, I love the style and the cute scenes! Especially the ones with Taromaru rejecting Miki, its just the funniest thing. But then in the darker scenes its even more amazing, how it shows the reactions of the other characters!\\n\\n\r\n{Sound 8/10}\\n\r\nI mean i didn't really notice the sound that much I just listened but it was good quality, and the voice actors are all really cute.\\n\\n\r\n{Character 7/10}\\n\r\nCharacters are cute, and I love all of them. My favourite one is Kurumi just cause badass. But I admit that they are all kind of...predictable and commonly used. Except for Yuri, her personality is common but her reaction to the situation with the zombies is realistic and sad.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment 8/10}\\n\r\nI just wanted to watch it every day, and the intros are incredible when they change. I like how they don't tell you, or write it out for you. When Kurumi got bit, the love from Megumi broke and thats why the zombies could make it in, and I like how they didn't say that in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Overall 9/10}\\n\r\nGreat anime, would recommend. Enjoyable in my opinion cute but horror, and I love it! Great art, love the characters, the story is a bit cheesy but overall, good anime! The ending sucked though.\\n",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[The first episode of the show is drastically improved if you go into it blind and so I recommend watching it before reading this review however it is not required for comprehension]\r\n[Synopsis]: Takeya Yuki (Minase, Inori) along with her friends Kurumi (Ozawa, Ari), Yuuri (Ichimichi, Mao), and Miki (Takahashi, Rie) make up the School-Living club - a group of students that live out of the campus while attending classes and borrowing from the schools facilities. Though Yuki has yet to realize it, there is a concerning reason for the club's existence and though she loves going toschool, her daily routine may not be as it seems. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Gakkougurashi is fairly small and primarily concerns the members of the School-Living club and their respective faculty member Megumi Sakura. The small cast makes a lot of sense for the show in my opinion and while the story is definitely focused on exploring the characters individually and their predicament, I feel like the show itself was ultimately more concerned with delivering thematically and visually - areas where it succeeded excessively. That being said, the cast was characterized to the point where they weren't any kind of negative influence on the show and there were more than a few strong character moments throughout the show's run. \\n\\n\r\nYuki best represents the light-hearted, slice-of-life element of the show both through her perception of her surroundings and in how she interacts with the other members of the group. Her happy go-lucky attitude, her style of running from room to room, and her gag interactions with other students and her friends immediately set a sugar-sweet precedent that the show is then immediately able to dash expertly within the first episode and in this way Yuki provided a great deal of utility to the show and allowed it to play with its contrasting settings to a far greater length than it would otherwise have been able to. \\n\\n\r\nKurumi is similarly childish and excitable however also represents a coming to terms with the environment of the show and her 'action-girl' status provides a go-to archetype to reinforce the stereotypical aspects of the show's design in order to inversely capitalize down the line. Yuuri is the eldest of Yuki's friends and while she acts the most adult-like as the president of the club she also seems to always have something boiling beneath the surface which was a character trait I enjoyed as it often was used to betray the attitude of her scenes while not doing so directly or in a hamfisted manner. Lastly, Miki is the youngest of the group and a newcomer to the club; due to her initial unfamiliarity with her fellow club-members, she offers an outsider's perspective on the group and their setting. She also has a good deal of emotional baggage and is one of the more sentimental characters in the show. Each of the characters do well enough to stand on their own though they also each offer great utility to the show in their characterization and they were great vehicles for some of its more intricate themes.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThis category was where the show truly blew me away - the art of Gakkougurashi was creative, intelligent, and flexible and provided perhaps the greatest amount of intrigue above all else for me as a viewer. Firstly, the twin aesthetics of the show clash wonderfully - the hyper-moe cast against that of a rather classic zombie-horror setting. The horror of the show plays out a bit differently from other anime like Corpse Party where the violence and gore expresses it's reliance on shock value and the blatant nature of its delivery. Gakkougurashi uses its horror techniques more subtly and instead visually distances the horror action of the show with repeated cuts to black and hazy filters in order to add to the surrealness of the setting in juxtaposition to the previously established near-slice-of-life atmosphere. Furthermore, as the show continues, these horror images are better brought into focus as that side of the show becomes gradually more dominant and the surrealness of the setting is replaced with the underlying harsh reality of the girl's situation. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of my favorite techniques used by the show and an area which I think speaks directly to the show's intelligence is that Gakkougurashi does not flaunt its horror images but instead allows them to exist in the background, almost unassumingly. A show of lesser design and direction would have moved heaven and hell to make sure these images reached the viewer and paraded them around instead of letting them occur naturally within the show. Along with this visual technique, the show also makes great use of depth-of-field in order to focus on certain shot elements and expert use of lighting and shadows. \\n\\n\r\nGakkougurashi makes amazing use of color as well. The majority of the show's setting and it's character designs are extremely bright and in vibrant colors (pinks, whites, and greens) whereas the contrasting environment of the horror scenes are far darker and bleak to the point where the show can become drained of color entirely and is visually delivered through blacks and gray-tones. The palette and color tone of each scene is highly dynamic which helped express the stark contrast between the show's two moods. There is even intelligent work being done in Yuki's character design as her school uniform, which differs in color from that of her fellow club members, sets her apart on a visual level in an attempt to parallel her altered perception and difference in mindset from the other girls. The subtle changes in the opening of the show provide a good commentary of what is transpiring and being revealed each episode and was a point of interest at the beginning of each watch. \\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nIn so many words, Gakkougurashi is a show that is driven by an engaging, thematic juxtaposition. The disparity between the actions and activities of the girls and the world that they live in is the central focus of the show and by spending half its time establishing a feel-good atmosphere while simultaneously developing a twisted horror story full of tragedy and sentimentality the show operates in way unique to itself. There is a great juxtaposition between the mundane, every day things such as worrying about graduation and love interests against the abnormal horror setting at the heart of the show. Due to the disparity in perception in the case of Yuki, the cast of the show is allowed to return to it's slice of life roots far more often than it otherwise should be able to and in this way I found Gakkougurashi highly different in terms of progression from other shows that capitalize on presenting conflicting themes and moods such as Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna which, for the most part, have a major turning point in tone before embarking on something more complex and dark than their original premise. Gakkougurashi offers a continuous parallel between its two worlds that I found highly entertaining and clever. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a good deal of subtext as a lot of the interactions early on can be explained in different ways after learning of their implications in future episodes and so there is entertaining retroactive work being done in terms of tone and sentiment among the characters. The story is presented somewhat non-linearly at first as it takes the time early on to delve into the individual backstories of each of the girls while fleshing out the setting at hand before progressing the plot towards its conclusion. The comedy of the show wasn't the strongest and I felt like it existed mostly for the purpose of, like many other attributes of the show, reinforcing one of the show's major genre elements rather than actually trying to deliver unique and genuine humor. It's a bit run of the mill in this regard however this allows the show to work better within the stereotypical setting that it tries to operate under and betray. The gag and comedic faces were very classic in their implementation to the point that one could even forget what they were watching because of the traditional environment and style they were delivered in.\\n\\n\r\nIt is for a similar reason to my reasoning surrounding the show's comedy that I found myself quickly forgiving Gakkougurashi for its moe aesthetic and occasional fan-service scene such as it's classic 'beach episode' installment because they both furthered the show's thematic dichotomy. Additionally, there is hardly an episode that goes by without some attention paid to both sides of the show therein the viewer is never left alone with the slice-of-life atmosphere for too long. I see the fan-service as less of a play to get the viewers attention and more of an attempt to reinforce the stereotypical nature and environment of the light-hearted side of the story as to better contrast its ridiculousness with the darker themes and plot developments later in each episode. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music fit the show extremely well and while I didn't feel like there were any stand-out songs in an objective sense, they worked extremely well with the visuals to present an intelligent and intricate setting. Gakkougurashi danced between the up-beat, ditzy music typical of the slice of life school setting and the grittier, darker music of the horror setting in interesting ways, sometimes confusing the two and subtly fading one into the other to amazing effect - corrupting the scene fantastically. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nGakkougurashi was a show that hooked me from episode one with its unique tone and twisted setting. The intelligence of the show really shone through in its visual direction and kept me highly invested each week. The ending was satisfactory in some ways and unsatisfactory in others in that it didn't bother to deliver on a couple of key plot points that arose in the midsection of the show. I think the show would benefit greatly from another installment in order to continue the story however I am doubtful the second season could play with the theme and tone of the show in the same way and would have to either present an incredibly compelling story or bring something unique to the table once again. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Gakkougurashi an 8 because it kept me captivated from start to finish with its brilliant use of images, colors, and shot composition alongside an incredibly interesting thematic dichotomy which it played at excellently. The ending didn't quite live up to the rest of the show in my opinion and the stereotypical nature of the show, while incredibly important to its design and delivery, was stereotypical non-the-less and caused the show to drag slightly at times however I feel this was negligible. \\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Gakkougurashi to fans of horror who can find it in themselves to also tolerate a traditional slice of life school setting for a handful of episodes as the payoff is definitely worth it in this regard. Fans of genre twists where something pure and innocent becomes something darker would do well to pick up this show as the show really triumphed in this area though it presents a more continuous conversation between its contrasting genres than other shows I have seen. While the show does heavily concern zombies I wouldn't necessarily recommend the show to fans of zombie fiction based on this alone unless they fell into one of the previous categories - there isn't a great deal of characterization surrounding the zombies and therein they might not carry the same intrigue as other shows that involve them.",

            "content": "* This is one of the most deceiving thing ever made.How to use Moe right 101 \"\r\nFor Gakkou Gurashi! We will start talking about the art. It is mainly made using too much moe and loli characters.Well that isn't so bad.The bad thing is the fact that the characters are around 17~18 yo ... yea... after you watch 5 mins you will wonder too \"Are they actually highschool students?\" Wtf is this bullshit?!?! In other words is kinda annoying if you see what the genres suggest this show will be about. . . Well other than that problem the background is really well made andthis anime has proved that they used this art style in order to attract the viewers easier to the story and make them relax.\\n\r\nContinuing with the characters which are outstandingly made. Not that they are unique , not that they are special. They are just incredibly realistic and natural that perfectly fit and don't do stupid things out of their character! This show perfectly introduced you characters and their background how they ended in their situation and their problems which made them advance in their life.Additionally, not only it features their good and strong aspects but their opposite weaknesses.For example, A leader which is very kind,strong willed and with great influence to the followers has the fear of what future holds and if his plans succeed ! Let's not forget about the MC and its situation,but instead of me talking about this, i will let you find out for yourself!\\n\r\nThe music on the anime was great.Maybe one of the few anime that you carefully stayed and watched the OP and ED cause of the numerous of hints and hidden messages it had and you MUST discover them!!At the start, you will really question this anime? Like wtf is going one?\\n\r\nTHIS AIN'T RIGHT!! yes. . . that will happen a lot dear friend. . .Each and every episode there will be more things to search for in order to \"unravel\" the mystery. In other words, the OP and ED was really interactive and very well though and deep. . .\\n\r\nThe story was really not something unique but not cliche either. It had its own aspects and authentic parts. What made it even better it was the details and the ways it was introduced. Really well written one. Worth praising and unforgettable! All the dots were slowly connected!!\\n\r\nIt had its twists and its bullshit moments.Magnificent setup! It has pretty good ways of drawing out emotions and it definitely contains Horror,Psychological and mystery as it suggest. Don't be fooled mongrels!! This is masterful at deceiving !!\\n\r\nMoreover, this anime has many metaphoric scenes in order to pass some deep messages which is something you don't normally see and requires hard work in order to be used right !!\\n\r\n------------------Personal Opinion and weakness-----------------------\\n\r\nThis anime planned everything out, foreshadowed, suggested, gestated, and culimated... but all of that setup leads to a series of serrendiptious contrivences. I feel a little gyped. It's like 28 weeks later all over again. Fabulous setup... and then everyone just goes stupid.\\n\r\nAlso the flashbacks and shinanegans? Like waddaEf. IS that needed? For the time being? \\n\r\nAnother spicy thing is that it had its \"Fan Service\" moments. Tho. . . no matter how annoyed it wasn't so bad... Why? Cause the moments lasted lower than 1 mins each and there were no ecchi jokes or meanigless unrealistic \"Ecchi\" scenes!! But there was they all time cliche Swimsuits episode. . .Yea fuck that obligatory \"Swimsuit\" episode. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE! Last but not least, there were moments when anime went complete retard mode and deactivated all kinds of logic it had. . . Especially in the last 2 episode. I don't imply that nothing made sense. I imply that the last 2 episodes were full of miracles and plot conveniences!! Not so bad as it sounds tho... no major flaw or something. . .\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a hell of a ride.The only problem is that it starts pretty slow and questionable and it selflessly destroy its image in the beginning! I mean it presents itself as SHIT,but inside there is gold!!This series is definitely one of the genuine and prototype series out there.\\n\r\nTherefore im recommending it blindfolded to anyone. \\n\r\nPersonally this anime finished in 11 episodes for me. If you want max enjoyment i suggest you doing the same and ignoring ep 12 !! \\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Exceeds at almost anything ! Music/art/story/chars!\\n\r\n-Moe art used for the right purposes!\\n\r\n- A really good ride!\\n\\n\r\nThis was my Shameless review.\\n\r\nI am leaving without remorse!",

Makes me wanna bash their face in with a baseball bat (random Higurashi reference).\r\nI had kind of a similar reaction when I watched the first 15 minutes of Gakkou Gurashi! A girl wakes up in her bed in school and starts walking around with her dog. She then proceeds to have breakfast in her club room with the club members and then goes to attend class like anyother student would do. Apparently the Club's name is School Living Club and all the members live on the school premises and don't go home after school's over. Usual anime logic aside, it doesn't make much sense because first of all, no school authority will ever allow such a club to exist where you practically live at school. And then there's the dog. So, I tolerated that till the end of episode 1 and that's where the twist hit me the face. This pack of moe blobs is actually in a zombie apocalypse and the main character is delusional (I like how the hints were sprinkled around in the episode). Now this turns the whole moe routine on it's head. Instead of being cute/obnoxious, the whole thing becomes sad and pitiful. This excellent use of shock drew me into this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the good thing about Gakkou Gurashi! is that they know HOW to transition between these dark and light atmospheres. The problem comes in with the story and pacing of the anime. While they spend plenty of time fleshing out their characters by providing all of them with their own separate backstories, the main plot remains at a standstill up until the very end. And that makes me a little frustrated because I'm dying to know how this bunch of school girls are going to make it out of that school building? Will they wait till they are cornered or they're gonna take the initiative? And all of this isn't answered till the last couple episodes. Instead, what I get is more of that cute moe routine with more twists thrown in, which makes the middle portion of the anime slightly boring and frustrating. So, you do need a little bit of patience to chew through that part.\\n\r\nAs for the ending of the show, it is definitely interesting but they seemed to have forced the emotional atmosphere there. It's still good but it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what Gakkou Gurashi! did great was how it dealt with it's characters. As I said before, they provide ample amount of backstories (interesting backstories) to all of their characters (except Wakasa Yuuri) so they're all fleshed out. The fact that Yuki is delusional adds a lot to all the characters around her and how they behave (imagine the psychological pressure). Of course, Yuki herself isn't always clueless either, she often tends to avoid or play dumb whenever the club members try to 'confront' her. This is depicted very well by how they do her expressions at those times (how it shows up on her face). The same goes for all the other characters. They don't stick to a certain character trope and play it throughout the show. They all help each other and contribute in whatever way they can. What I didn't like about them was how none of them seemed to be worried about their families. And since the anime does not give us any other information about the outside world, we don't know any better than the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe good thing here is that the characters question things around them which would have normally been labelled as mere coincidences. Like how the school has all the supplies and everything conveniently available. How the zombies seem to follow a certain pattern according to their previous lifestyle. On top of that, they don't go full hollywood mode and start killing zombies as if they were eagerly waiting for a zombie apocalypse to happen. They are a bunch of kids in school and they act like it. Though they can be surprisingly rational at times. With the exception of Yuuri (and maybe Taroumaru), all the characters did their part well for the kind of situation they were in (backstories and all).\\n\\n\r\nCompared to all the production messes during the summer season (Manglobe going bankrupt, ufotable messing up God Eater, Rokka no Yuusha's terrible fight sequences and CG, not to mention DBZ super), I'd say the animation quality was nice. At least it was consistent throughout the show. The characters are fluid, the backgrounds are pretty. There is a nice balance between the light and dark tones and they handle the atmospheres well during those transitions. What I especially like is the subtle changes they made into the opening of the show as the plot progressed and several major plot twists were revealed. The ending sequence was okay. As for the soundtrack, I'd say the usual - \"It was there, it was nice but not good enough for me to go out of my way to look for it\".\\n\\n\r\nSo, Gakkou Gurashi! is a nice show and quite a different take on the whole Zombie Apocalypse scenario. Sure, it doesn't show you the shrewd ugliness of mankind or how the laws of physics change when it comes to boobie mechanics, but does give you an interesting scenario to think about. One that is isolated from the ugliness that humans would show in case of such scenario but at the same time close to being a realistic (and human) depiction of how a bunch of highschool girls would deal with such a situation. It is a bit idealistic and could get a little frustrating at times, I'm just glad that anime tried something like this. So give this a shot, but go in with an open mind.",

Since I\u00b4m not a natural english speaker, have patience with me, kay?\r\nGakkougurashi is a show that talks about a life in school (really?)\r\nEverything starts perfect, cute girls doing cute stuff.\r\nBut then... (SPOILER ALERT)\r\nThe real drama beggins. You see why they are there, what are they doing to survive.\r\nI really love the story, kinda reminds me of Madoka Magica.\r\nThe art is great, although the manga art is more detailed.\r\nThe openings and endings are awesome! The opening makes me want to dance and cry at the same time. And everyone has such a sweet voices.\r\nCharacters... woah, I loveeach of the girls in this show, their personalities are so rare, and distint. \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot, and I watched while was releasing... and waiting one week for another episode hurted me like bitch.\\n\r\nBut if you don\u00b4t like the slice-of-life thingy, you\u00b4ll enjoy more when the \"thing\" starts.\\n\r\nHope I helped ^-^\\n",

I feel like the only realistic pair is Kurumi & Mii-kun. But there are times where I feel like everyone in the group is real. I like how the group bonds even though they are going through hardships. Their personalities are perfect & fit well with events and what they do in those events.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime.

School-Live! is not scared to bring this to the table with it's 'horror' tag here on MAL. Each character has their own story on what they're doing to survive.

A chance for you to love the characters and to get even more attached before the show throws something else at you making your heart ache for them even more.\\n\\n\r\nSchool-Live! is highly enjoyable and a must for all horror fans.

            "content": "Putting this message at the end would just contradict the label below, so all I can really say here as far as it goes is that if you\u2019re a fan of the moe genre and seeing it being \u201cdeconstructed\u201d or done in a completely way, I definitely recommend that you check this show out for yourself.\r\n---THIS IS A CONCLUSIVE REVIEW THAT CONTAINS SPOILERS--- (please do not read unless you have already finished the show and just want some random dude\u2019s opinion about it)\r\nPerhaps the greatest factor which contributed to my enjoyment of this show was the way in which it was presented.  Not onlythe girls are faced with an apocalypse at their hand, they also have to worry about the more pressing aftermath of the apocalypse: their infected classmates. Yet despite having these elements at play, the girls still find themselves reminiscing and reenacting their light-hearted highschool life which seemingly went unaffected by this disaster. This is why calling it a deconstruction of the SOL Moe genre is a little difficult, because as the viewer you get a good perspective of whatever is happening outside, yet inside the School-life clubroom, the girls never fail to enjoy their touching story of a rather atypical highschool life. It\u2019s two different story that, when presented and interacts together, everything seemingly connect with each other to give form to an amazing narration and a deep level of suspense which pulls the viewer in to see how the story develops.\\n\\n\r\nA cool thing about Gakkougurashi is how the character interaction played out. Initially being introduced as typical archetypes, the girls are then placed into situations where their skills and knowledge interact with each other, ensuring each other\u2019s survival and all the while forming an even bigger bond between them. Without each other covering for one another\u2019s back after coming to an understanding of their weak and strong points, they wouldn\u2019t have made it in one piece.\\n\\n\r\nAs if it wasn\u2019t hinted enough by all of the girls\u2019 desire to graduate, Gakkougurashi is ultimately an anime about moving on. It isn\u2019t about trying to be most badass zombie slayer, nor was it about betrayal and survival of the fittest, in fact, the anime version intentionally avoided this kind of subject because in one of the early chapter of the manga, there was a scene where Kurumi assumes that Yuuri has abandoned her because of the reluctant expression on her face as she looks a way while Kurumi was asking for help, only for such a thought to be interrupted by Yuuri\u2019s clever method of exploiting the zombie\u2019s attraction to sound. Obviously, this scene was rewritten to be cut out from the anime series, and for good reasons too, because something like that would have been perfect foreshadowing for themes of betrayals in a more extreme situation, but that\u2019s not the point of the anime Gakkougurashi.\\n\r\nThematically, this is why the highschool club setting works so naturally well with Gakkougurashi: the girls doesn\u2019t want to move on because the life that they knew so well was unexpectantly robbed of. Them staying behind in their highschool wasn\u2019t just because of the convenience in which it provided but also because that it is presented to be the closet and most important thing to them before the world came tumbling down.\\n\\n\r\nThe graduation in the final episode is full of meanings to support this sense of acceptance and moving on too, because graduation in itself is the act of moving away from an important time in your life, by holding a graduation for the girls, it essentially delivers a power message telling that they have also graduated from their need to rely on the highschool to cope with the world (of course, the more important reason here is because of the previous zombie invasion) \\n\\n\r\nHell, every other visual representation in the final episode even supports this.  Especially Miki who finally find her friend who is unfortunately already infected but despite both her and the ending theme \u201cWe Took Each Other\u2019s Hand\u201d talks of regret of letting go of an important individual, she gave her a sad glance with a slight teary eye but did not carry a stronger emotion on her face, showing that she have come to terms with the way that this new world have to function in. And of course, all of this happened with the school standing behind their back as they make their way outside of the gate in search of the next survival base, having already grown stronger and moved on from their highschool life, ready for the outside world.",

Just 4 ordinary girls who for some reason are living at school, very cute, dog bouncing around getting up to mischief, then... zombies. And Yuki sees an ordinary school. \r\nThe art is very good. It is easy to see the difference between what Yuki sees and what everyone else sees. \r\nI never really noticed the sound, so I can't say much about it,\r\nI love love LOVE the characters. Yuki is ever optimistic, and she suffers from a mental condition which means she can sees the school as an ordinary place. Kurumi is a tough and bravetomboy who has a soft side. Rii-San is a responsible big sister figure, and Miki is sensible and while she plays along with Yukis delusions, she thinks that someone needs to tell her. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely really enjoyed this anime. The starting song is really good, and I would sing it all the time if I could speak Japanese. This anime had me laughing, falling off the bed in shock, staring at the screen, and, yes, crying quite a lot. The characters were so good I really felt for them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a really superb piece of anime.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nGakkou Gurashi has this adorable little doggy named Taroumaru. A doggy that reminded me of my own. Her name is Mollie \u2013 with an \u201cie,\u201d not a \u201cy\u201d \u2013 and she is the strongest pooch I have ever known.\r\nBorn the runt of the litter, when Mollie was a few weeks old, she was no bigger than the palm of your hand. She did not walk around so much as she skipped, her unbelievably tiny legs allowing her to jump from one spot to the next. I remember thinking that a dog who was as small asshe was could not possibly exist. But her being there, daintily moving on the grass in front of us, was impossible to doubt. My mother, to this day, believes that we had saved Mollie, her miniature stature enough of a reason for her original owners to euthanize her.\\n\\n\r\nHer fur was pure white, her tail was stubby, and she had the slightest lazy eye that made her even cuter. Early on, she became scared of thunderstorms and fireworks, crying and shaking uncontrollably until someone in our family sat with her. She hated her cage (still hates it), incessantly complaining until she was set free once more. She loves to stretch her body as far as she can while getting belly rubs. And strangest of all, she simply has to run around in circles when playing, as if the rotations would boost her energy further.\\n\\n\r\nMollie was in our life for little more than five months before she got very sick during her first December. She was admitted to the veterinary clinic; the diagnosis was kidney failure. The doctors thought she had no chance to live and actually had us bring her home. I can still see Mollie in the golden cage, her blissfully unaware of her condition. She was skipping and jumping on her favorite blanket, her tugging on her toys and barking playfully. My family and I were looking on, weeping.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, like light snow drifting softly on Christmas Day, a miracle occurred. She survived. The medicine started to work and Mollie became healthy once more. At least, for a time: she would later have intestinal issues, tooth decay, and loss of hearing. But she has never given up. After years of difficulties, she is still trudging on. Sure, her hair has yellowed, her tail is longer, and her lazy eye is lazier than ever, but her tenacity has never wavered.\\n\\n\r\nMollie is an amazing puppy, a trooper through and through. She is our Taroumaru. And as both showcase, sometimes when the situation is looking down, the best thing to do is smile.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi is an anime that cannot be taken at face value. Its exterior is purposefully misleading, the contents within contrasting how it presents itself both to those in and out of the loop. The anime understands that it occupies the area where the sunshine and the shadows cross, leveraging these two halves to the best of its ability, ultimately leading to positive results.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode sets the stage. Cute characters have fun hanging out together. A couple are normal, one wields a shovel, and the last is a big ball of energy. The playground is a typical school, with quirky classmates, loving teachers, and lax rules. It is fun for everyone involved, the time filled with silly antics and huge smiles, making it out to be like \u201cany other slice-of-life show.\u201d Then the plot twist occurs. This bait and switch, from boundless joy to horrifying truth, works on multiple levels. First, the actual point in time: rather than having it go from one extreme to the other, the calamity has already occurred. This places the focus on the characters and their current situation rather than on the turning point itself, strengthening these respective areas. Second, it forces the audience to reevaluate. Since what was given was portrayed one way, the twist causes the viewer to rethink what was actually going on, increasing investment in the show itself. Third and last, it pushes itself away from the norm. It is not all laughs, fun, and happiness; it is death, darkness, and despair. The anime is not a typical slice-of-life offering, but instead a twisted take on \u201ccute girls doing cute things.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAtypical directions are common for narratives, as are dichotomies. In Gakkou Gurashi\u2019s case, the dichotomy it creates \u2013 cute versus psychological \u2013 helps itself, each side accentuating the other. The characters having fun at the \u201cpool\u201d or holding a variety of relay events is adorable to watch, the bleak atmosphere furthering this feeling since it stands out so much from the gore and harshness that surrounds them. The opposite goes through the same effects: watching as the cast tries to block the rooftop door with boxes to protect themselves or seeing Yuki hiding in a maze of convenience store aisles to hide from a pursuer feels more dramatic and tense since the cuteness and the silly jokes gives way to these direr scenarios. Better yet, the show is not afraid to go completely one way or the other. One moment has Yuki imagining a wedding between Kurumi and \u201cShovel-kun\u201d while the next has Yuuri contemplating putting the newly betrothed out of her misery. These instances are fine on their own but because they are coupled together, and because they are so contrasting, they are amplified and thus have a larger impact than they otherwise would.\\n\\n\r\nThe instances are also not constructed using a linear timeline. Instead, the anime adopts a semi-non-chronological order. First it starts in the middle with the four main girls, goes forward slightly, then jumps back in time, then forward again, and eventually to a point beyond where the adventure began. Convoluted to an extent, but purposeful. This roundabout progression generates mystery and confusion, both caused through the jumbling of the events. The former because the out-of-order scenes hide information whereas the latter because it is harder to tell what is happening when. Together, and like the dichotomy the show so heavily leans on, the haphazard ordering heightens the drama.\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi also covers its writing bases. Having the girls literally live in a school seems impossible. Without electricity, clean water, and attainable food, the likelihood that they would survive for more than a week or so is slim. But as the anime details, solar panels, water filters, and fresh crops turn the normal school into a sustainable mini-village. This happening is not convenient; the show explains how the building was specifically designed with the outbreak in mind. The zombies also follow the school-centric theme. Throughout the season, those infected were shown to remember their past lives. Some students would lounge around on the soccer field while others crowded the mall. Megumi\u2019s diary clearly proves she is, to some degree, aware of who she was before. Therefore, the final solution to save the gang \u2013 Yuki broadcasting that the school-day was over (cleverly and metaphorically ending her, Yuuri\u2019s, Kurumi\u2019s, and Miki\u2019s stay at the school as well) \u2013 was already gradually established, making the action again not a convenience but rather an inspired move.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the school and the zombies also reveal a glaring issue: a distinct lack of the past, specifically not showing more of before the outbreak. Outside of Megumi\u2019s episode, little is given of the school, its students, and the relationships these two entities generated while they were still pure. The audience does not get to learn about the girl with a collar or see the jubilation of the various clubs. So when Yuki\u2019s emotional farewell is given, it is not that emotional because the viewer was rarely given the opportunity to connect with the same aspects that Yuki had come to love. As such the moment, while sincere, loses power because the audience essentially does not \u2013 cannot \u2013 care for these parts.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cCare\u201d is a vital motif of the show. A teacher caring for her students. A regretful child caring for her dog. So Gakkou Gurashi begs the question: what should be cared about? In a situation where the past is gone, the present is harrowing, and the future is grim, the anime imparts a contextually not-so-simple message: \u201cwhen life hands you lemons, make lemonade.\u201d Life is hard. Often obstacles of the physical and mental variety hamper people on an everyday basis. So sometimes life can seem impossible to handle, unfair in the cards it deals. The girls of the anime obviously find themselves in a markedly more dangerous situation, but the same rule applies. They do not resign to pessimism. They do not believe that what remains of the world is hopeless. Even when they do \u2013 as is seen with Miki\u2019s original predicament \u2013 they learn to take it one step at time, finding joy where presumably none exists. It might be trying on some bikinis for fun. It might be holding a graduation ceremony to commemorate a job well-done. It might be pitching a tent for a makeshift campfire outing. Or it might be something simpler, like reading an engaging novel or eating a favorite snack. Regardless of what is done, it is important to find the light in the darkness, to view the brighter side of life whenever possible, because then, and only then, will more goodness follow. For the girls of Gakkou Gurashi, their ability to always make that lemonade allowed them to find this goodness: lives worth living.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is filled with other ups \u2013 Miki\u2019s near-death in the basement mirroring her time in the mall \u2013 and other downs \u2013 Kei\u2019s supposed zombie self as a way to wrap up her plotline is somewhat sloppy \u2013 but considering how the anime keeps its focus almost entirely on the dualities it creates, the narrative concludes opposite to how it started: filled with positivity. That is to say, the girls of the school live\u2026for now.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi continues its misleading tendencies through its visuals. In other words, the anime\u2019s art and animation are stronger than \u201cjust another slice-of-life\u201d would lead one to believe.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the first episode alone is almost enough evidence to make a case for how powerful the anime is in its presentation. Drawing the other students devoid of features makes them there but distant. The small Easter-eggs scattered throughout are telling of the reality without outright talking. And the seemingly inconsequential details like the stacked desks and the broken windows are weird but not weird enough to make them standout. All of the signs exist for something being not-quite-right but are constructed in such a way as to not reveal the plot twist before the opportune moment.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the show\u2019s moments also include other subtle artistic decisions that sum together to create intricate scenes. Tactics like having Megumi slide in from off-screen to conceal her status and refusing to reveal the eyes of the zombies to heighten their scariness are noteworthy for their simultaneous simplicity and execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe camera direction also sees elevated execution, incorporating skewed shots to increase tension, up-close shots to capture the manic faces of the characters, and top-down ones to provide a perspective that showcases the cute girls in their broken environment. One shot in particular involves a sort of fish-eye lens, where Yuki\u2019s head bends as the camera moves away from her to quickly relay her collapsing sanity. While used only once, it goes to show how inventive the anime gets with its cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nInventiveness continues when the characters and their character designs are investigated. Yuuri is specifically crafted as older: her larger bust, her beauty mole near her right eye, and her beige sweater paint her as the more mature person that she is. Kurumi goes wacky. Besides wielding a shovel, her black-and-white sleeves, her purple twin-tails, and her kneepads act as a silly exterior that harbors a more distraught interior. Both girls are certainly interesting, since the personalities they maintain can easily be surmised through the designs they hold.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs get even more interesting when it comes to Miki and Yuki. For Miki, she is rather plain, wearing the regular school uniform. Her short hair, blue eyes, and small frame give her a gender-neutral design for a reason: she is designed to be the most relatable. Her character goes through emotions that many people in this kind of situation could relate to, so having her appear slightly androgynous makes her more neutral gender-wise and thus more relatable. Yuki, though, takes the cake. Her pink hair, her lavender-and-white outfit, and her white wings on her backpack heavily contrast with not just the environment but also the other girls, making her completely standout. But it is her black hat that encapsulates all that she is. The hat\u2019s little ears are cute yet the colors clearly contrast with her own design, matching the split her mind has undergone. Simultaneously, hats hide heads, concealing what lies beneath them. Yuki \u201cplaces a hat\u201d on reality through her mental blocking, hiding the truth of the situation to keep herself going. In other words, Yuki\u2019s hat symbolizes her insanity. A hat should be a trivial item for any character, but in Yuki\u2019s case, it provides a profound revelation on her character without having to know much about her. In short, her design is genius.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the actual animation does not reach the same level as Yuki\u2019s character design, it still manages to remain above average throughout the season. Kurumi and Yuki often have the most movement of the bunch, due to the former\u2019s fighting and the latter\u2019s energy. Gakkou Gurashi also likes to employ comical and comic-like bubbles to add cuteness and to stock up on resources for more intensive scenes like those that adopt a grainy filter or when the characters are simply having fun together. Combined with hair ruffling, eye moving, and tail wagging, the anime\u2019s attention to its animation never falters, thereby increasing its total execution.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIn a slice-of-life anime like Gakkou Gurashi, it is arguably the characters that have the most importance since the story being told is not necessarily captivating. Putting it differently, the cast have more weight to carry since the narrative surrounding them is more a setting than a driving force. The weight, though, is not equally distributed in the show, with Kurumi, Yuuri, Yuki, and Miki demonstrating various levels of strength and therefore execution.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi receives a lot of her characterization early on. Before the outbreak, she had a crush, wanting nothing more than to form a romantic relationship with him. But he succumbed to the legion and, worse still, Kurumi was the one to take him down. This changes her: she alone fights and kills other zombies, distancing herself from them when she enters her battle-trance mode. She does not view the zombies as people. At least, she does not want to, since when she is met with the picture on a girl\u2019s phone or she encounters Megumi, she wavers, losing her composure. At one point she makes a promise with Yuuri about putting each other out of their misery should either fail to protect themselves. How fitting, then, that she gets infected later on in the series, turning her into the kind of person that she came to despise. It turns into a battle of the mind rather than one of the body, the latter the type she had grown accustomed to.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi\u2019s character is the least interesting of the group (despite her wacky design) because the anime does not spend enough time exploring her traits. After learning about her connection to the situation and hatred of the zombies, she more or less gets pushed to the side, taking the spotlight on occasion to swing her shovel or to make an aforementioned promise. Otherwise, she is relegated to quips here and there without having too much impact until the end where her condition worsens. In a way, it is logical: Kurumi knows how to drive, fight, and scout. She is a utility, capable of completing a lot of the hard labor that the rest of the girls cannot. So when she is well, it is smooth sailing, but when she is literally couch-ridden, the group almost falls apart. What does not make sense, however, is the decision to forego showing more of her mental battle. The audience receives a clip of this during the early stages of her infection, but afterwards kicking and screaming is all that is seen, meaning in terms of development Kurumi receives very little. By the end, it is unclear whether or not she has gotten over her crush, how she feels towards the zombies now, and if her near-death experience affected her, leaving her character in an awkward position.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri\u2019s character fairs slightly better, if only because she has another \u2013 Megumi \u2013 to play off. Yuuri is the leader of the girls, motherly in her nature. She is strict yet caring, she knows how to cook, and she usually makes the more authoritative decisions. Interestingly, this is not a mantle that she necessarily wanted to uphold. Technically Megumi was the overseer, but following the teacher\u2019s death, Yuuri took the reins, making sure she, Kurumi, Yuki, and Miki were kept safe within their makeshift club. She is not the strongest or the smartest or the silliest, but this is precisely why she best fits the leadership role since, more so than anyone, she knows what has to be done and can use those who are the strongest, smartest, and silliest to accomplish these goals.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri looked up to Megumi, seeing the teacher as someone to emulate or at least follow, Megumi\u2019s pure kindness a rare trait for anyone to have. So Yuuri takes the same path: she plays along with Yuki\u2019s antics, she advises Kurumi to not overexert herself, and she talks privately with Miki to ease Miki\u2019s conscious. She wants to be there for the girls in their time of need as best as she can, and therefore what she has more so than the others is a sense of calm. Yuuri\u2019s strength is the ability to keep the group stable through her loving watch. This is why when she breaks down, she breaks down hard. She does not know how to handle the hectic final set of events because nobody is there to keep her calm. Seeing her in such a state is noticeable to the viewer; if Yuuri of all people cannot keep it together, it must truly be a dire situation. Similar to Kurumi, though, it is unclear how these events and their time at the school has changed her. At the minimum, she is thankful to Megumi for imprinting on her the same set of values, allowing her to keep her and the group from losing all hope.\\n\\n\r\nHopeful is all that Yuki is. She is always smiling, her affable personality cute, fun, and kind. She has a deep affinity for the school, the teachers, and the students, loving life and all that it has to offer. Yuki seems almost too perfect on paper, which is exactly the case. Her persona is not really a ruse but a mental block. She is insane, to put it lightly. She has imaginary friends. She is capable of seeing and talking to her deceased teacher. She refuses to acknowledge that their current predicament is what it is, instead forcing her own reality at every turn. She is technically an older student but she is without a doubt the most childish out of the four of them, a dichotomy that aligns itself perfectly with her contrasting nature.\\n\\n\r\nYuki\u2019s behavior is intriguing because of how she and the others view it. Whether or not she is fully aware of her personality disorder is difficult to pinpoint; clearly she knew that what she was doing was wrong for her psyche \u2013 she says as much on the final rooftop scene \u2013 but throughout the season she seems blissfully unaware of the troubles surrounding them, solving chalkboard problems in a disheveled room. Kurumi, Yuuri, and Miki understand Yuki\u2019s strangeness, but rather than forcing her to realize the truth they leverage her positivity. The other girls abuse Yuki\u2019s ability to always keep things fresh and fun in order to keep themselves sane. In way, the three of them using Yuki as a motivational booster is demented and likewise insane. To an extent, she is nothing more than a tool, a convenient entity to get them through the day. It is messed up because they know they can help her but they do not. Luckily, Yuki is forced to come to terms with the real reality, saving the others and consequently growing up. To confirm this notion, she lays her symbolically psychological hat to rest, signifying that she has, in fact, graduated.\\n\\n\r\nArguably though it is Miki, not Yuki, who is the strongest character of the anime. She garners a surprisingly large amount of screen-time, mostly because she has a completely separate plotline before it merges with the main one. During her subplot, she and her best friend Kei survived in a mall, with nothing but each other, Taroumaru, and a CD player. Miki was content with their hidey-hole, believing that surviving was enough. When Kei abandons her to pursue better prospects, she does not know what to do. Loneliness piles on, the CD player quickly becoming a symbol for the daily repetition she confined herself to and the repetitive feeling of being alone.\\n\\n\r\nMiki is eventually saved, but having lost Kei and having been away from people for so long, she does not immediately connect with the others. She saw Yuki as weird, and Kurumi and Yuuri as manipulative for keeping Yuki in said weird condition. Rather than goofing around, she felt that their time could be better utilized to continue what she had relegated herself to: surviving and nothing more. But after sending letters on balloons (and pigeons) and reconciling with Taroumaru, she slowly opens up, doing away with her reserved self and establishing relationships with the rest of the cast. Miki comes to follow the story\u2019s main theme of finding the fun in life where none is had. As such, she develops from a lonely, critical young girl into a confident, lively woman, appreciating and understanding that there is more to life than simply surviving. Or as Miki puts it, \u201cI lived, and it was all worthwhile.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt the center of the girls is Megumi. Megumi helped Kurumi, she mentored Yuuri, and she taught Yuki. Also, if it was not for her and keeping the original group together, Miki would never have had the opportunity to become more than she was. Megumi is the rock that connects them all, and through her, the characters\u2019 theme comes to light: not being afraid to rely on others. While Megumi silently watches over them when she does move on, her absence highlights the importance of how nothing can be done alone. Each girl has their strengths and their weaknesses, each girl doing what she can to keep the group going. The group is a circular chain, each loop linked to the next, a missing link deforming the structure. They would not be as successful without each other; Kurumi\u2019s slaying, Yuuri\u2019s aiding, Yuki\u2019s laughing, and Miki\u2019s rationalizing work in tandem to keep their group thriving. They have Megumi to thank for bringing them together but only each other for continuing what she started. And as the conclusion depicts, the girls might have graduated, but they will continue to support and rely on one another no matter what may come.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is fantastic, encompassing all of the cuteness and adorableness that the anime contains. The fun little beat, the fast lyrics, and the switching vocalists make the piece pleasant to listen to both in and out of the anime. The piece builds up in the beginning, to give way to a catchy and back-and-forth tone that captures the same tempo that the anime also follows.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ending theme is a mixture of happiness and sadness. The track itself is mellow, with background choirs and ambient sound effects that makes it a simple piece, and therefore a nice way to transition out of most of the episodes. The second ending goes decidedly darker, the chimes and clacking scary-sounding to match the anime\u2019s atmosphere. As the piece proceeds the singer heavily carries the track until the instruments finally appear. Still, the vocalist nails her notes, achieving a finish with range and emotion that coincides with the saddened feel of the show itself. While the second ED does not trump the OP, it easily defeats the first ED, making one wonder why it was not used for the entirety of the season to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is filled with exactly the types of pieces needed to fit the slice-of-life and horror aspects. The former is filled with xylophones and party tunes that lift the spirits whereas the latter is filled with melancholic piano pieces that lower the mood considerably. Nothing immediately stands out, but the OST performs at the necessary level to make the scenes it is used vibrant and depressing when needed.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting reaches the same level, with solid performances for the cast but nothing downright noteworthy. Inori Minase as Yuki has quite the cute voice to expound her cute nature ten-fold. Mao Ichimichi as Yuuri speaks in a tone that only a mature woman could, fitting her personality well. And a special shout-out to Emiri Katou as Taroumaru for puppy barks and cries that could make anyone say \u201cD\u2019aww.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI sound like a monster for saying this, but I sort of wish all of the girls died, or at least all of them but Yuki. A tragic ending would have been poignant, a visceral and harsh reality that would be difficult to stomach after seeing the girls go through so much and have so much fun together. I was robbed of this \u2013 \u201crobbed\u201d because I honestly believed going in to the final episode that the anime was going to end on a heart-shattering note \u2013 leaving me a bit bitter.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is why Taroumaru\u2019s death hit me harder than it should have because they tricked me once more. It seemed like he was hurt, sure, but he was eating and drinking. Then he passed away. At first, I was shaking my head, saddened that he died after everything that had happened. But the real kicker was on the roof. Yuki\u2019s words, \u201cHe looked at you and said\u2026\u2019Thank you!\u2019\u201d while the screen flashbacked to Taroumaru\u2019s tiny smile, made me cry right alongside Miki. It was a powerful moment not just because I was attached to the dog but because I could see and hear the pain in Miki\u2019s face and voice. I hate goodbyes (something that frequenters of my material might know), so watching such a heartfelt goodbye escalated how much of a chord this struck with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show was still lovable even if my evil ending never came to fruition. Yuki was an extremely fun character, her undeniable cuteness and her never-ending smile giving her a charm that meshed nicely with her insanity. Again, I sound crazy, but part of the reason why I liked her so much was because she was insane, but now that that has technically been overcome, she loses a quirk to her that made her unique, something I am strangely not okay with. Still, Miki teasing Yuki in the shower about being her \u201csenpai\u201d and Yuki\u2019s expressions matching Taromaru\u2019s always put a smile on my face, so I suppose Yuki accomplished what she set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri, Kurumi, and Miki were likewise hilarious. Yuuri\u2019s gag with getting overly furious, Kurumi wanting to use \u201cjust the blunt end\u201d for catching purposes, and Miki acting adorable whenever Yuki got too close for her comfort almost always gave me some kind of chuckle. Megumi, too, since the group ignoring her made her feel not wanted or respected, leading to some funny reactions on her part. The whole season was a lot of fun \u2013 despite all of the despair it contained \u2013 with the only other gripe besides the optimistic ending being that I have to patiently wait to see where the School Living Club goes next.\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi is simultaneously a cutesy and thrilling ride. The narrative\u2019s dichotomous nature, the art\u2019s stellar direction, and the cast\u2019s interesting characterizations create an anime that does reasonably well all around. The opening and ending themes, as well as the emotional moments \u2013 of the comedic and dramatic variety \u2013 further buffer the show. Life can certainly get one down. But this anime, like Mollie, makes it that much easier to smile.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, dualities throughout keep the narrative focused and purposeful but a lack of the past tampers the audience\u2019s ability to emotionally connect\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, intricate artistic direction keeps the art stunning, character designs are well-done, with Yuki\u2019s being fantastic, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Kurumi is bad, Yuuri is okay, Yuki is good, and Miki is great, with Megumi highlighting the theme of relying on others\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, great OP, okay first ED, good second ED, okay OST, solid VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, cute, hilarious, and emotional, but I preferred a more tragic conclusion\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

Otherwise stick around.\r\nFor an anime called 'School live' there isn't a lot of living going on. to make this review short a& sweet I'll say this; This anime was great. following the life of a girl living in her delusions refusing to accept the world has ended.\r\nThe cast is admittedly not the most varied however it didn't stop me from enjoying this anime at all. The concept of zombies in anime isn't touched all that much other than a certain elephant in the room [Highschool ofThe Dead]. But the way this anime portrays it is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Yuki Takeya has seen (some shit) things, things that would drive most people to insanity. Yuki copes with this in her own way, by pretending its never happened. This show combines Slice of Life and light hearted conversations with a dark undertone that the apocalypse is happening all the mean while.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime comes to a close the apocalypse begins to take more control over the story than the fluffy slice of life- especially in the last episodes. Which are a grim reminder to the group that this is indeed the end of the world, and a foreboding sign to a tragedy is quite apparent if you're paying enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up if you want to watch this anime prepare to be sad, there are many elements of it that break you on the inside. From touching last words, to speeches, and everything in between (Including death). This anime may not be interesting to all groups but I hope you, the reader, enjoy it.",

            "content": "Gakkou Gurashi! is a confusing anime. The story line is very hard to understand a first. However,it gets better as the episodes go on. This anime is good, and is enjoyable. Its only 12 episodes, but the manga is still ongoing so if you are done with the anime read  the manga.\r\nStory Line9/10-NO SPOILERS. Yuki is a young girl living in a school with her friends, Kurumi, Miki, and Yuuri. they all part of a school living club. Yuki is in love with school, well in her head. Why? Find out. In her school, nothing is human....The story line is confusing. However, its aclever idea. Having a Slice of Life anime have a Horror story line is crazy. But it worked. Its enjoyable, and silly. The story line switches with dark mature themes, to happy, cute themes. That is wierd, and thats why the story is a 9 instend of a 10, but its still fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters9/10-There arent many characters in this anime, only 4 main ones. However thats not even close to say that their bad. The 4 main characters are all girls, but their funny, cute, and can be brave at times. They all help each other, and try to stay strong when something bad has happen. The character delvopment is good, but not the best. At least they are all fun characters. One of the characters, Miki, has a really upsetting back story, which makes her one of the best characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound Track9/10-This anime has a very good amount of music. The opening theme is good, very catchy. Almost all of the music fits the anime very well. Gakkou Gurashi! has a sound track that is catchy, and cute. Like the anime. The dark music is creepy, and could be better, because it isnt the best.(Not because its creepy, but because it isnt that great).\\n\\n\r\nArt10/10-Gakkou Gurashi! has amazing colors. The bright colors fits the characters perfectly. The The dark colors fit the dark, upsetting part of the anime very well. The character design is great, and is very well made.(It fits the characters well). THe colors switch between the happy and scary moments, and is clever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment9/10-Gakkou Gurashi! is a anime I REALLY liked. Mostly everything I enjoyed. The characters were all enjoyable, and the storyline was great,this was a anime thats really fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall9/10-Gakkou Gurashi! is a enjoyable anime. Its only 12 episodes, but its still great. For anyone who loves both Horror and Slice of Life, try this anime out.",

            "content": "~Gakkougurashi!~\r\n- Story - 5 [Something Unique but not that much]\r\nThe story is very simple, MOE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, though majority of the story is Slice of life with Philosophical Values. But its combination is rare, a Dark Slice of Life anime.\r\nThe story introduced themselves as a Little Light in the Dark, at least it's not the typical Slice of Life Moe, but the psychological trauma, and their emotional support to each other makes this anime better than most of the Slice of Life Moe series.\r\nThe story is very predictable, the setting is light, with few action and psychological scene, but the only thing that I can'tpredict is the realization of Delusions\\n\r\nThe pacing is really good, they were able adapt it well to fit the anime timeline.\\n\r\nThough I thought it was dark, but it's 70% Light and 30% dark. And the slice of life will make you smile, but that smile will disappear when the trouble comes, with few suspense, action, psychological action(the use of sound to evade zombies)\\n\r\nSo far, I've only seen Flashback, Deus ex machina(only once for Miki Naoki), Foreshadowing, Plot twist, First-person Narration and the best Ticking clock scenario, as their literary techniques(from wiki).\\n\r\nThe ending is not the Best, but it was able to close the anime(with the Front 13, Back 9[just search it on google]) To be Honest, I watched the last episode on RAW, but that will not hinder the Last episode review. Honestly It ended like Angel Beats, but the most interesting in the last episode, They Have used their Feeling and Emotions to Drive out the Zombies(which is illogical) and there's also an Epic Scene where A Hero will die not as a Zombie, but as a Hero(just decipher it in your own) If you're fond of Philosophical(if you can grasp it, then you're with me.) Slice of Life(moe) with a Zombie(I can't call it horror nor dark, it's really light) then you will love this.\\n\\n\r\n- Art - 5 [they hold back on its gore and dark aspects]\\n\r\nThe art is Moe, a child like anime characters despite of their age.\\n\r\nBut I think the Mangaka tried to express Cute little characters in dangerous situation with horrified faces, but was able to Smile and to be Happy even in the amidst of the Effects and dangers the Chaos\\n\r\nAt least the art was able to make it GORE, but it's still lacking, and the Anime focused on the Cute side of it.\\n\r\nThere's a mixed CGI on it, the cars, but nothing more.\\n\r\nThe anime was able to adapt better in terms of Art Quality, but in terms of Dark Originality of it, they were able to produce the 70% in the anime.\\n\r\nThroughout the episode 1-11, they were able to maintain smooth art.\\n\r\nThe background is really GOOD, that's one of the best art in this series, it's really bloody, they didn't hold back in the background.\\n\r\nThe character design is MOE, They were able to meet the standard of it, but the irony of this production, they are the ones who makes\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace and made Danganronpa which is the same as Horror but the opposite of MOE.\\n\r\nThe Character Design is not unique, they are MOE, or child like character but the age is different, though it's common in our country(it's full of lolis here)\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 3 [there's nothing Horror at All, it's just for MOE]\\n\r\nThe Voice Actress were able to make the Cutest voice in this anime.\\n\r\nAnd they don't need to adapt for the role they were given.\\n\r\nBut I think the Voice Actress have Improved, but a little in this anime.\\n\r\nBut it would be fun, if the non-japanese VA can play this with a cute voice.\\n\r\nBut the background music is not the best in this anime, it was good in Slice of Life scenes, but not on Horror or Thrilling scenes, they've used Diminished chords or the Devil Chords but the Infra Sound, or the Feel sound is not used, and One Punch Man BGM is way better in terms of Horror.\\n\r\nI always try to catch the music and hears its expression, but for this one, it still lacks, it's more like a Deep Thought Provoking Sound rather than Horror.\\n\r\nI think I will used their OST or BGM for Thought Provoking Mangas.\\n\r\nI like the opening, it's light and Fluffy, and The ending is Dramatic which fits the mood after watching a Light mixed Dark element in an episode.\\n\r\nAnd in terms of OP/ED, Though I can Listen to it, it's not catchy, if you want to repeat the op, but the ed is ok to add in my phone. But as a Musician, the op and the ed are not catchy, or it's not worth for playing it for a Cover. I would love to make an AMV for this using Rock with Dark and Metal Elements on it.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters - 5 [MOE girls are Developed, but only on the last 2 EP]\\n\r\nThe Characters are very well done, they have strengths and Resolves to live, their only weakness is Flashbacks of Tragedy and Psychological Disorder or Delusional disorder. But the normal weakness for the people, Zombie Trauma, is not present here.\\n\r\nThe characters were able to portray realistic actions in the zombie apocalypse situation, but at the same time, they were able to Smile and Laugh, which is not Present for the many people who lives in this world.\\n\r\nI can relate to the characters, Unlike Games and Manga that Uses Guns, Bats, and other tools to kill zombies, They have used the Sound to evade Zombies, which is the best when it comes to Survival Tactic. They were able to Support their Emotional Needs, which is one of the Best message in this series, which lacks in many people that lives in reality. And the best so far: Be Happy in times of Chaos, which is illogical. But also my personality in real life.\\n\r\nThe characters did improved, but it's just a small factor in terms of Character Development, but they can adapt in the situation very fast.\\n\r\nOnly Four people are currently present in this Anime.\\n\r\nAnd their enemies, of coarse the Zombies, which made the Clock Ticking Scenario.\\n\r\nThere's no supporting character that lives, but for a single Girl.\\n\r\nThey've only used First Person Narration, or the characters shown in the screen in the scene that are present are the ones who narrate themselves.\\n\r\nI disliked the taste of the majority of japanese boys, which is MOE[cute girls], But for the Characters in this anime, I liked them so much, that they were able to show the Philosophical Value of Happiness in times of Trouble, which is the situation they lived in.\\n\r\nThough I think I will forget about them, because I'm not into MOE\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 4 [not into light if it has dark elements on it]\\n\r\nThose people who loves Cute Girls with an Aspect of School, Slice of Life, will love this. But for the people who Loves Horror, Mystery, Psychological, will not love this, They can watch this, but not as a their taste, and most of them Will hate this anime. But for a Person who watches Anime that Loves to apply things from an anime in Real Life situations, then this is a masterpiece, they were able to show LIGHT in the DARK, and there's only one \"Deus ex Machina\" present here(ex. One Punch Man)\\n\r\nThis is anime is good for newbies in both Horror and Anime, but not for Horror lovers.\\n\r\nI think I will not re-watch the whole anime, but for the sake of its Philosophical Values, I will watch some scenes that has epic lines and quotes.\\n\r\nI think it is still enjoyable to re-watch the whole anime, but for me, I have to look for another anime.\\n\r\nIt's better to remember it as a LIGHT MOE ANIME. than DARK MOE ANIME, it's good but It's still lacks in many ways to call this a Great Anime.\\n\r\nIt's good as a cup of tea for Horror, Mystery, Psychological lovers and it's intense for School, Slice of Life lovers. but As a person who watches anime for Real Life situation, then this is really good in terms Lessons that can be applied in Real Life Situations, like when you have to Adapt quickly in times of trouble, Psychological Recovery, if you're not really happy in your current life, because of many problems, and Lastly, is to SMILE in the times of Disaster and its effect.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 4 [decent show with few philosophical values yet...]\\n\r\nThis anime was able to its four elements in a Decent Way, but it should have been Better if the ART and the SOUND was able to portray the mood. The Horror aspects is Missing that could Have Been better because of the ART and SOUND that were underestimated. I Judge According to How it was Done, not Story and Characters Only. This is a Decent Anime which I rate 4/10 or not BAD on how it was DONE. \\n\\n\r\n- Worth - 4 [worth for being cute, that's all]\\n\r\nThis is an Over Rated Anime, because of its surprise that it brought to us, but I think we have to lessen that Deserving praise. In terms of Logical rating, I would give this 4/10, which was able to bring some thing new yet unsatisfied results for me. But in terms of Real Life Lessons and Application(treat the zombies as your problems) then I would give this a High Rating, I would give it an 6/10 which deserves it. It's up to you if you want to watch it.  It's an Anime for those who has soft spots for cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nMy Real Thoughts are the ones on the [ words input ] I Don't want to change it any longer, It's gonna take long before I changed It...\\n",

            "content": "Hey look! Another cutesy, totally innocent, slice-of-life anime that I can show to a bunch of 4-7 years old kids. I'm sure they'll love it. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nTakeya Yuki is in love with the school. For her, it's a wonderful place, where she enjoys school activities, especially the activities of her club: School Life Club.\r\nJust like all the slice-of-life animes, nothing really happens in this show. All they do is laugh around, fool around like a typical high-school students, drink tea, participate in club activities, swim around in a pool and our protagonist chasing around a cute dog. That'sliterally it, I can't expand on this anymore. Ok, think of the show as like K-On except the characters are different. The 2 shows are almost the same. Yuki = Yui, Kurumi = Azusa, Miki = Mio, Megu-nee = Sawako, you get the point. It's just a nice, soothing, relaxing anime that relieved my stress from real-life. \\n\\n\r\nOk, I'm done with the sarcasms. School Live! is in no way a cutesy slice-of-life show. The characters are actually living in a post-apocalyptic world where almost everyone is a zombie and the main characters barricaded themselves in a school. The first episode that was shown to us is just a big troll, showing us the typical high school life and the characters having fun. Basically, like Madoka except there's no magical girls here. There's a huge reason why that slice-of-life scene was shown in the first episode. It isn't just to shock the viewers. Well, that's one of the reasons but the main reason is it's got something to do with the Main Character's mentality. I'll explain more in the \"Characters\" category\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode, the show didn't really move forward. The entire first half of the show were flashbacks of how the epidemic started, how the characters got involved in it in the first place, and how they all met each other. I personally think the show did a great job building the characters in the first half.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show finally had the plot moving forward. They just show us how the characters cope with the mess that they're in and how they're living their everyday lives in a post apocalyptic world. In other words, it's just like I'm watching a regular slice-of-life anime...except with zombies. I like the slice-of-life scenes. It portrays how the characters keeps their sanity after all the sh*t that they went through and how they keep having fun despite the fact that they're in a post-apocalyptic world. .\\n\r\nThere was one plot twist in the second half of the show that made me go \"Holy Mother of Jesus Christ\". This is honestly one of the best plot twists in the show. Before the plot twist occurs, watch out for Megu-nee and how the characters act around her. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing that I want to point out is the show's effective use of foreshadowing. Posting a picture would be a lot better but I'll just write a bunch of examples. Most of my examples were in the first episode. Firstly, the windows. Secondly, the cross at the school roof garden. Thirdly, the girls were worried about Yuki wandering around the school in broad daylight with a bunch of students. Fourth and lastly, the main characters didn't pay that much attention nor were they worried about Megu-nee that much. There are more Megu-nee foreshadowings but I'm done.    \\n\\n\r\nAfter all the positive points that I mentioned above, How could I rate the story a 7 you ask? The ending of the show killed it for me. It wasn't because of Tarumarou's death..It was because of that one scene. That one particular scene that I completely hate. That scene where they were supposed to die but Yuki pulled a \"deus-ex machina\" making all the zombies leave the school. They could have done it some other way but the way they did it in the anime was just complete bullsh*t to me. Some of you might think otherwise but this is how I feel about the ending. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nSo who animated School Live?.......Lerche? I don't know that studio. Anyways, they did a great job with the show's visuals and animations. Especially the dark atmosphere that they were showing off. The zombie designs...ehh, looks ok. Not the scariest I've ever seen but were they supposed to be scary in the first place? The character designs looks so \"moe\" but I'm pretty sure they designed the characters like that on purpose.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI gotta say, the soundtrack that they used for both slice-of-life scenes and dark scenes was amazing. You guys already know how a theme should sound like whenever a slice-of-life scene is playing so I don't have to mention the slice-of-life themes. The themes used for the dark scenes, however, legitimately scared the shit out of me. Note that I decided to watch the show at night so when they revealed the post-apocalyptic world that they live in, I couldn't sleep for the whole night. It's like a happy background theme then suddenly, it becomes slow. You know, like one of those scary-ass nursery rhyme songs. Now the OP and ED theme song. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Friend Shitai\" by Gakuen Seikatsubu and the ED theme songs are  \"Harmonize Clover\" by Maon Kurosaki, \"We took each other's hand\" by Kaori Sawada and \"Afterglow\" by Maon Kurosaki. The OP theme song is one huge troll. The song is all happy and rainbows and it only fit in the first episode. As for the ED theme songs, I only liked the first one. The first ED theme song sounds like a dramatic song foreshadowing the character's fate. Except their fate was different than I expected. The 2nd ED theme song sounds decent. If it weren't for the singer, I would have liked it. Although, it was a nice song to use after a certain someone \"died\". \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI feel like this is where the show shined...The characters. \\n\r\nWe have Yuki, the main character suffering from her own delusions because of the incident that occurred with Megu-ne. I honestly broke down when I saw what state of mentality Yuki is in. It's like she's suffering from the 5 stages of grief and hasn't moved past the first stage for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nThere's actually a reason....a good reason why Yuki is still delusional and hasn't accepted the fact that they're now in a post apocalyptic world and that Megu-ne is gone. Let me ask something..Is it wrong for the characters to keep Yuki in that state? If I were to answer this question, I would say no. I mean, the whole reason why the characters are still normal is because of her. The characters feared that by telling her the truth, it would cause Yuki to enter in a state of a long long depression. Without Yuki bringing fun to the group, they would all be insane right now. Some of you might think the characters were being selfish for keeping Yuki in that mental state. Honestly, there's no right answers to my question. It all depends on your morality.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the rest of the main characters which are Kurumi, an energetic girl and the only character on the group who can fight off the zombies. Then there's Miki, also the student of Megurigaoka Private High School and was found by Yuki's group on the mall. She has a friend named Kei and her whereabouts are unknown. Then there's Yuuri, the leader of the club (group) and most mature character in the group. Finally, there's Megu-nee, who suffered the most unfortunate fate in the show. What I like about the characters is the way they act and think which are almost realistic. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, I enjoyed the show not only for it's slice-of-life moments but also because of the shock and fear factor of the show. I wish I could say the same thing for the ending episode.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"School Live!\" is a good survival anime that portrays the characters in an almost realistic way and also explores the main character's mental state. The shock and fear factor of the show is also one of the one of the reasons why I enjoyed the show. Unfortunately, the show suffered from a \"Happy Ending Syndrome\". I don't have a big problem with the happy endings but if that's where the story seems to be going then stick with it instead of bringing in some magical god just so he can bless the characters with unbelievable powers that they can use to escape the inescapable situation. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Story for the majority of the series\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animations\\n\r\n+Scary Dark Atmosphere\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Theme used for the scary parts of the show are legit scary\\n\r\n+Characters are portrayed almost realistically\\n\r\n+First half used to build the character\\n\r\n+Effective use of Foreshadowing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-\"Happy Ending Syndrome\"\\n\r\n-Some Unnecessary Fanservice Scenes. \\n",

            "content": "---- POSSIBLY VERY MINOR SPOILERS ---\r\nI don't know. I have no idea what others are gushing about giving all those 9s and 10s (because of manga? Then give the manga a 9 on 10, don't give anime a high grade on merits of the manga when it obviously doesn't deserve so!). This feels pretty damn mediocre to me, and DEFINITELY not as an anime of the season. There are far better contenders for that title IMO.\r\nStory - goes pretty much nowhere most of the time, there's way too much comedic relief and moeblob moments for a supposedly dark theme behind the story. If this issubverting the zombie horror trope, it's not doing it right. I am constantly waiting for the moment when shit hits the fan and everybody needs to (wo)man the fuck up, but it doesn't happen at all until far too late into the season, at which point I completely lost any interest in the whole thing. I guess points of \"excitement\" are when Yuki's illusion breaks down, but it breaks down very rarely.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, after episode 2, I though this had the potential of being something really good, going deep into psyche of Yuki (doesn't happen) and perhaps others (I guess that happens to an extent, but not enough). But nope. Moeblob slice-of-life. Not sure if that's your thing, but if it is, knock yourself out.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, I'm constantly waiting for something CONCRETE to happen, some contact with outside world, some proper zombie shoveling (sic), but it just doesn't happen, which makes me wonder WTF is the script writer on about?!\\n\\n\r\nArt - pretty damn good all around. Wasted talent on a story badly handled.\\n\\n\r\nSound - pretty good overall, but nothing special or something to remember. In the very rare thrilling moments of tension, sound does beef up the atmosphere nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - characters are pretty typical all around. Little to no development in any of them. We get some backstories, but that doesn't count as character development. Color me unimpressed here. Worst thing of all was the damn dog eating way too much screen time, artificially creating compassion - I didn't buy it. In fact it made me not care about the cast at all, so anything that could possibly happen to them, I wouldn't even blink. Just badly handled character writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I guess the only thing with which this anime managed to shock me is its complete lack of direction. It's quite hermetic, much like the main cast being trapped in that school. Shit, they had the \"outing\" episode, couldn't they drive that car farther away, try to go to another town, try to get some PROPER help? Nooooope, let's go back to school. Woo fucking hoo.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the only thing this anime somehow manages to make me is keep watching to see if something is finally going to fucking happen. And by the looks of it, next episode (ep 9) is going to somehow be a bikini episode. Wow. If I wanted that kind of fanservice, I'd go watch Highschool Of The Dead. Even that has a better zombie story in its background!\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the anime through, I've left with a fairly sour taste in my mouth. Out of 12 episodes seen, I could count 4  or perhaps 5 that are absolutely worth watching, everything else is condensed filler the story would work completely well without. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I am pretty underwhelmed. Don't waste your time like I did.",

Hate reading perfect 10 reviews cause it feels like you are reading some fanatical propaganda or something...unfortunately I can't help it, this thing deserves it. \r\nOk now if you have no idea what this anime is about just watch it, at least the first ep and then see if you like it. Otherwise SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS:\r\nThe reason this thing is a PERFECT 10 (yah it is not perfect but it is easily one of my favourite anime) is that it surprises. Anime is absolutely surprising when you first see one. If you watch a movie from Ukraine (this won't work ifyou are actually from Ukraine, so to all Ukrainians reading this pretend I said Iceland) that movie will be surprising, the different perspective of the different country makes their popular culture different (duh). But as you continue to consume that popular culture, patterns emerge and woah do patterns emerge with anime...it takes only a couple of minutes (often seconds) into a 1st ep and I know what is going to happen, whose pantsu are gonna be seen by who and which boring nice guy teenager is gonna turn into the best mech pilot/super or magic powered hero and kill all the bad guys, agonizing over his actions all the while etcetera and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime goes about things differently. Sure it has tropes: swimsuit episode in a zombie apocalypse (nice shoehorning) and the characters could be taken from just about any slice of life school anime out there BUT it put this slice of life school light comedy right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. It did not go full dark and moody and depressing either it just keeps on riding the line between these two genres and switching between them at will. This is what makes this anime so original. \\n\\n\r\nThere was no point in this anime where I got bored or despaired over the story or character direction, I thoroughly enjoyed all of it and if that doesn't make it a 10 then I do not know what does.\\n",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi! (School-Live!)'s first episode was one of the most memorable of 2015. The misleading first episode sets up the entire atmosphere for a series that isn't afraid to take risks in surprising the audience.\r\nThe majority of people are already aware of the show's surprise twist at the end of the first episode (if not and you like a good shock, please stop reading here): this seemingly cutesy slice-of-life takes place during a zombie apocalypse, in which the main girl has deluded herself into thinking that her school life is going on as normal. The rest of her friends, the remaining survivors from her school, goalong with her delusion out of the fear of completely mentally breaking her.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the realization as an audience member that what you're seeing is a delusion makes for some surprising dark comedy. The main girl innocently runs through the halls, unable to see the broken glass, blood-stained windows, or hear the moans of the turned students outside.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it also helps that the show would make a good SoL on its own. If it didn't have interesting characters or good comedy, then 3/4ths of the show would be boring, and the more serious moments wouldn't be as powerful. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the show does turn dark and serious, it's very intense. If you got bored with The Walking Dead after a while, don't worry: this is like the early seasons where you understood what was going on and were fully captivated by the peril the characters were on. If you still like The Walking Dead, even better. This is the best parts of the show, with cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some cliches and mysteries left unsolved, but I'm still holding out that there'll be a season 2. I highly recommend Gakkougurashi! if you're looking for a change from the norm.",

I just wish the \"ghosts\" were drawn more detailed like it was in the manga. But nonetheless, it was really good.

Not to mention the plot has a very serious tone like dealing with mental health disorders so having a Moe aspect and being able to make itwork and not feel like they're just trying to say \"Hey something really tragic happened, but here's some moe to make it all better!\" is really impressive, they used the moe not to cover up this serious tone but to show how some of the characters deal with the horrors they've had to see. The \"Moe\" was there to move the plot forward and show how the main character was slowly coming to grips with reality and was starting to finally move forward after being stuck in the same spot unable to move on...\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely check this anime out if you haven't already, it has some of the most lovable characters I've ever seen and well there's only a little Moe that's always a good thing to have for most people, however prepare for a train-ride of emotions and make sure you go into this anime knowing it's going to get a very serious tone and some of the thing's that happen may not be very pleasant for all viewers however if you're fine with some more heavier topics than this anime is perfect for you.",

            "content": "It's been a sometime since this show premiered, so I sort of knew what was going to happen when I went in. However, I was completely unaware of the other stuff waiting to be uncovered. On paper, I think the story would be able to work for the most part. However, I can say with confidence that the show does an amazing job at bringing it to life. \r\nThe directing is great at presenting the atmosphere of this show, especially when it\u2019s time to release the cat out of the bag. Each scene displays something new and interesting, with amazing ways to portray the gravitythat comes with them. It results in both a creepy and depressing atmosphere, but a good kind of creepy that immerses you into the show. On its own, the directing is solid enough to carry the story through. The music was basically the icing on the cake. It adds significantly to the story and directing. It fits perfectly with each tone the show is portraying. Every track is both catchy and memorable, especially the gentle and dramatic ones, which are just amazing to listen to. \\n\r\nMeanwhile, the characters themselves are also amazing. The subtle details about them are nicely placed and make a huge impact when brought up, it is especially satisfying to notice on a second viewing. Although doing so made me notice how some of them can be made somewhat less subtle, the attachment you feel towards the characters are enough to make you put that to the side. The characters feel genuine, and you can\u2019t help but latch onto them throughout the series. The emotions they make feel believable and make you feel what they feel, and that is expressed through the show\u2019s amazing artwork. Speaking of which, the use of a bright chipper color palette in the light tones, and the film grains and darker shades in the serious tones work well at making a contrast between the two. The animation may not look stellar in some moments, but I think it still holds up for the most part. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are still a few glaring issues that I have with the show. One of which is what happened where in the school, like flashbacks portray a scene happening in one location, but then later it seemed like it happened someplace else. I don\u2019t know, looking back, I can\u2019t help but be a little puzzled by where things were in the show. The same thing goes with the zombies, which I still have some questions about even after much of it was clarified in the show itself upon rewatching it. However, I\u2019m willing to look past it because of not only everything I\u2019ve stated in the previous paragraphs, but because I believe that the rest of the show\u2019s writing still holds up regardless. \\n\r\nOverall, 'School-Live!\u2019 or \u2018Gakkougurashi!\u2019 has brilliant directing, writing, characters, and animation that definitely overshadows the flawed aspects that each of them have. Throughout the series, I couldn\u2019t help but be enamored with how each aspect played off of one another. The show\u2019s flaws were unable to take me out of the experience, even on a second viewing. In the long run, I wouldn\u2019t mind recommending this show, even if I might have a difficult time doing so.",

            "content": "PREMISE\r\nPutting horror into anime has always proven itself to be a difficult task. Many studios have tried, often to little avail. Instead of moments that instill dread into our hearts, we\u2019re left with predictable setups, uninspired monsters, or an over-dependence on gore. It appears that anime is just not a good medium to really freak people out.\r\nAs such, Gakkou Gurashi is trying a different angle. Reminiscent of Madoka Magika, it isn\u2019t trying to unsettle viewers by being incredibly scary. Instead, it tries to be only somewhat scary, but within an otherwise completely unscary setting. And so we have one of the more unusual matchups inrecent years: typical moe schoolgirl fluff... and zombies.\\n\\n\r\nEXECUTION\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi has been an incredibly polarizing show. I feel that the crux of the controversy is due to the fact that, despite its twist, Gakkou Gurashi is still a show where \u201ccute girls do cute things\u201d at heart.\\n\\n\r\nTo understand why some people really like Gakkou-- and why others really dislike it-- we need to look at the show\u2019s main theme: denial of reality. While it is shown early on that Yuki takes the theme to an extreme extent, all of the other main characters are guilty of it as well. For instance, the girls could break Yuki away from her fantasies-- they even admit that they would be able to. But they don\u2019t. Why? Because Yuki\u2019s cheery demeanor would vanish. So let\u2019s make sure Yuki stays happy instead, because if she\u2019s so happy, then things can\u2019t possible be that bad, right?\\n\\n\r\nTo further this delusion, the girls try to live life as usual. They\u2019re not sleeping at school because it\u2019s a safe haven, but because they\u2019re part of a School-Life Club. They\u2019re not foraging for supplies, they\u2019re going on a field trip. Hey, I have an idea! Let\u2019s write messages and tie them to balloons! Let\u2019s have a fight with water guns! Let\u2019s have races in the hallway! If anything, they\u2019re acting even more upbeat and bubbly than usual, because that\u2019s all that\u2019s keeping away reality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where, for many, the show falters. There is a large chunk of screentime given to these schoolgirls acting like, well, schoolgirls. This leads to a whole lot of moe fluff that, while it advances the setting, does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. And for those who cannot stand the genre, or the show\u2019s stagnant story, there are many valid complaints to be had against Gakkou Gurashi.\\n\\n\r\nBut for those who don\u2019t mind the set-up as much, it definitely does a lot to make the horror hit harder. I don\u2019t want to delve into spoilers, but I will say this: Gakkou Gurashi is really, really dire. With every episode, things are looking more and more helpless. And no matter how much you may want to go along with the cast\u2019s beliefs that everything is going to turn out alright, you won\u2019t be able to get away from the feeling that every bit of happiness is just another sign that things are going to go horribly wrong. And that\u2019s not something you come across in an anime very often.",

            "content": "Definite spoilers as I will be pointing out some flaws with the story.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThis is what happens when you try to blend moeh and horror, you end up with something that's really neither with too many plot devices.\r\nSo we're presented with the concept of 'living' vs 'survival'. When all is hopeless, is it more important to survival as long as you can, or to try to live out the remaining time you have? Thrown into an apocalyptic situation, the girls have chosen to try to 'live' by pretending as often as they can that they're just living at school. However, this premise only works becauseof all the plot convenience thrust onto them in that the school has all these facilities which allows them such a lifestyle as well as their few numbers which allows them to 'live' for a good amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe zombies are atrociously slow and are pretty weak as well, as a high school girl can quite easily dispatch them, which brings the question why are there no other survivors. Secondly, it seems that the zombie apocalypse was something that was expected, or at the very least, prepared for, which begs the other question of why no other teachers survived. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the girls do wander outside their safe zone, for some reason, they think it's a smart idea to bring Yuki along, who has become disillusioned with reality due to trauma. And somehow, despite being an immense liability where Yuki basically has to be counselled during and after any encounter, they make it out every time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a suspension of disbelief cannot be held for long due to convenient plot devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI would have rated this higher if it were not for the poor implemented CGI. CGI is used sparsely, but when it's used, it's so obvious that it breaks the tension. An example of good CGI is in Kantai Collection. I found the lighter, happier backgrounds to be quite average compared to the darker and bloodied backgrounds. The characters themselves are more of the typical moeh designs in that they're brightly lit but their overall texture feels a bit flat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nDidn't really like the OP nor ED, voice acting was pretty standard so not impressed or disappointed there. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nBasically everyone has trauma... which is fine. Except when both Kurumi and Yuuri seems to encourage Yuki's state of mind it's a real wonder how they manage to live for so long. The only real person of interest is Miki as she recognises both the importance of maintaining an optimistic attitude but also a realistic attitude at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe moeh/cutesy parts of the story weren't really that cute and actually made me lose interest at times. The darker parts were definitely more interesting, especially when Yuki was absent and the sane members of the group had to discuss their survival and resource woes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nBy combing both cute parts and horror parts, I felt like it ended up diluting both. Too much of the story seems to rely on plot conveniences (such as in ep 11 when lightning strikes and wipes out the roof which signifies that they will have to move on afterwards) and just doesn't have the power to maintain a suspension of disbelief.",

If you want to be very shocked from the revelation in the first episode, stay away for now and read the review once you've watched the first episode. If you haven't and will continue to read the review, let me tell you, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.)\r\nRemember Puella Magi Madoka Magica, which looked cute on the outside but had a dark twist on the inside? Well, Gakkou Gurashi is like that. One character completely denies that the dark twist is even happening, though, making this series even more of a mix of moe andhorror. I first heard of Gakkou Gurashi from a fellow MAL user whose review of the manga I have read, and when I found out there was an upcoming anime adaptation, I was pretty excited. Needless to say, this anime has not let me down.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about what Gakkou Gurashi is about; Yuki Takeya is a 3rd-year high school student who really loves her school. She hates studying, but she still has fun at school, with her friends and teachers. The best part, for her, is her club, the School Living Club, where the club literally lives at school. The other members are Kurumi Ebisuzawa, Yuuri Wakasa (a.k.a. Rii-san), Miki Naoki (a.k.a. Mii-kun), and Megumi Sakura (a.k.a., Megu-nee, she's the club's adviser). Oh, and don't forget the dog, Taroumaru. Okay, here comes the dark twist; truth is, the entire School Living Club are survivors of the zombie apocalypse. Yuki is completely oblivious to this fact, though, and she continues to live her school life as if there's nothing wrong in the world.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I warned you. Let me ask you this, though; how the heck am I supposed to explain what this anime is about without spoiling it?!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, let's admit it, people. The zombie apocalypse theme has been used over and over again in many different formats, and with this anime and High School of the Dead, anime is no exception. Of course, there are plenty of moe anime, too. Combine those two, and it's actually a better mix than you may expect. There are plenty of horrific moments, but the moe elements that this anime has give us a bit of a break from those horrific moments. The characters are very fun to follow, too, and they gain a decent amount of development.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good. It's not the best animation, but it definitely knows when to use bright colors and dark colors; it really sets the tone of the anime. The music is also good. The OP, \"Friend Shitai\", remains the same throughout the entire anime, but what we see as it plays gradually changes as the series goes on. While this is good, whenever the opening plays, I just can't help but think, \"Okay, we know that this is not just some moe anime, so KILL THE HAPPY MUSIC ALREADY.\" Both of the EDs are quite nice, too, especially \"Afterglow\" by Maon Kurosaki. I just loved that song!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gakkou Gurashi was an enjoyable anime. If you like both moe and zombies, watching this will give you a satisfaction to see both at once. Just don't think it's just one of them, though, because it's actually a mix of each other.",

            "content": "Warning! Long read! Scroll down to last paragraph for summary. \r\nAs a fan of dark, psychological anime, I initially despaired upon completion of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica that I\u2019d never find anything quite up to par. These worries evaporated when I completed the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi. \r\nAlthough it may seem initially just like cute girls doing cute things, don\u2019t let the cover or the first 20 minutes of the first episode fool you. Gakkou Gurashi is in fact an express train to the dark and sometimes horrifying with plenty of feel stops along the way. \r\nFrom the first episode, Gakkou Gurashi seemed likea great anime. With cutesy art, characters and theme songs, despite knowing that there was a \u2018dark twist\u2019 to the story didn\u2019t prepare me for the last scene. It\u2019s a pity that nothing is completely perfect. Gakkou Gurashi has it\u2019s share of flaws and it disappointed me at times, however it remains an anime I would recommend to my peers nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, aesthetic value is high. Although the art isn\u2019t particularly mind-blowing, it\u2019s very cutesy and visually pleasing. One downside is that even the teacher, Megumi \u201cMegu-nee\u201d Sakura looks hardly older than her students, however this is easily forgiven. The colours are bright and vivid, the lines are clean and cute and the contrast is big when we view the world as it really is versus Yuki\u2019s delusionary P-O-V. There are a few minor but annoying hiccups, such as the illogical orientation of the ears on Yuki\u2019s hat when her head is turned, however animation is otherwise smooth and pleasant. The zombies are also well animated, gory and disturbing without being graphic at all. In fact, I would even say that Gakkou Gurashi makes good use of the idea that the unseen is scarier than the seen, leaving the viewer to imagine what truly lies behind those ominous shadows.As a whole, the anime manages to remain disturbing on a psychological level without any particularly graphic scenes, which I greatly appreciated. And let\u2019s just also mention that despite the characters all appearing like lolis, they actually had chests, something more gratifying than I thought it would be. \\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi\u2019s art, somewhat simple yet still very pleasing and enjoyable, is well deserving of an 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, Gakkou Gurashi is also a job well-done. Although the OP and ED weren\u2019t quite my taste, I found that they complemented the anime quite well. Just like in the infamous Madoka, the cutesy OP has a great impact during later episodes that greatly contributes to the dark, psychological nature of the anime. Think someone giggling during a particularly violent scene of a horror movie. \\n\r\nVoice actors were also high tier. Without overdoing the sugary moe aspect of the anime, each VA\u2019s voice suits her character perfectly. Except for, well, poor Megu-nee, who once again sounds way too young. \\n\r\nI was, however, disappointed with the background music. Though not lacking, I found the background tracks just as unnoticeable as Megu-nee (something akin to a \"running gag\" in the anime) and was even under the impression that Gakkou Gurashi had none. Background tracks are a tricky thing to get right, and tracks that draw away from the dialogue are undesirable, however to have them so unnoticeable is not right either.\\n\r\nSomewhat weaker than the aspect of art, 6.5/10 is a reasonable score for the sound. Although it\u2019s not something about which I say \u201cwow!\u201d like I have in some other anime, it\u2019s still rather satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is, in my opinion, the strongest part of Gakkou Gurashi. Although the premise is rather simple, the story-telling is superb. Admittedly, the pace got a little slow during some of the middle episodes, mostly during some more moe-type events, however this is well balanced out when the anime returns to the story at hand. Foreshadowing was mixed in perfectly: small elements are hidden into each episode without being too hard to notice - perfect for the amateur detective within. \\n\r\nThe first episodes were certainly the best in terms of pacing, and it is disappointing that the rest of the anime couldn\u2019t quite keep up the excellent standards. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed every episode, and the psychological horror factor was pleasantly strong and unique. For once, we have a dark anime involving high school girls that doesn\u2019t rely on bouncing breasts, graphic murders, a harem or a revised script of Madoka Magica. \\n\r\nAll in all, despite it\u2019s flaws, I find Gakkou Gurashi to be an incredibly fresh-feeling anime. With twists, plenty of \u201coh my god, what?!\u201d moments and some moe thrown in to the mix, Gakkou Gurashi\u2019s plot is certainly a prime example of simple excellence. One does not need a huge, 100% original plot with confusing twists and turns to earn a good 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Gakkou Gurashi disappoints in the aspect of characters, which is, in my opinion, the most important element in any anime. Although the characters are in no way boring, annoying or overly stereotyped, they retain a \u201cI\u2019ve seen this so many times before\" feel. You have the cute and clumsy type A protagonist, the strong \u2018fighter\u2019 one, the motherly one, the serious one and the one whose lack of presence is their main, some might even argue only, defining feature. In terms of twists, the biggest twist one can find in any character of Gakkou Gurashi is that they are actually a lot less mentally stable than other characters assume, which isn\u2019t exactly shocking or particularly valuable to the plot as far as I know. Perhaps its for this reason that I found the moe episodes a bit of a bore. Although Yuki\u2019s hallucinations are an interesting element, she, along with the rest of the cast, bring little to the anime as a whole. This anime would have earned a much higher score if it wasn\u2019t for the bland characters, which earns only 5/10 for me. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all it\u2019s flaws, I still enjoyed Gakkou Gurashi and it was one of the more interesting anime of this season that I think everyone who likes dark, psychological anime with a bit of horror mixed in should definitely give a go. The characters, background tracks, pacing in later episodes and moe moments were on the disappointing side, however as a whole the plot, execution, voice work and art were very much satisfying and up to par of what I expect of, well, any anime. In terms of enjoyment alone, I would award this anime a 7/10. Although as the anime progressed, it did not remain as \u2018wow!\u2019 as I found it during the first two episodes, I don\u2019t regret ranting on to my friends about this amazing new anime that I had started watching the night before, fiercely recommending it to them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is well worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nAverage score: 6.7/10 (rounded to a 7)",

It's nice to see a zombie show that isn't just entirely rolling in despair and horror but predictable plot twists, gimmicky devices and being over-hyped left me feeling like it was trying too hard to be different and overly emotional.\r\nYou get a pretty good sense of what you're in for after the first episode which lleaves off with a good amount of tension and excitement but it feels like that fell short in the following episodes as we see more of the same without any real forwardmomentum. A good chunk of the drama and conflict comes from flashbacks that explain how we got to the current events but serve more to make future plot twists predictable. It's not bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable but I think there was room for so much more.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the art felt like it relied too heavily on darkened filters and the contrast between cute and dark to force emotion. However, there were some pretty incredible things thrown in with subtle changes to the openings and endings each week as well as small, hidden gems tucked away into scenes that made the art interesting in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do grow, they do face hardship and they do have to overcome something in themselves. I'm likely in the minority here but, even with that, I didn't find them enjoyable. It felt like they were too stereotypical to me and I didn't really find myself worrying about what could possibly happen to any of them. \\n\\n\r\nI am glad I caught this and I think it's likely one of the only zombie shows I'll watch all the way through. It's a good anime and it's worth picking up. I just wish they would trade in some of the gimmicks for a little more polish.",

            "content": "Gakkou Gurashi Review:\r\nFirst time review\r\nHere\u2019s what I think about Gakkou Gurashi, Gakkou Gurashi is amazing but it could\u2019ve been done better.\r\nAt first I didn\u2019t pay much attention to this series, so I just put it on my watch list. When I finally watched the first episode, I crapped my pants. I watched this show without knowing anything about it, I didn\u2019t know the genre, I didn\u2019t watch the trailer, and I never see any screenshot (the summary is misleading), so it was a real shock for me and it makes me wanting more.\r\nNow here\u2019s the problem with the following episodes, they aren\u2019t consistent. The episodesjumping back and forth between flashback and present times, throwing us off from the main plot (\u201cis this still flashback episode?\u201d, \u201cis this present time?\u201d, \u201cwait, this is present time but still in a flashback\u201d, like that). But it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re bad episodes instead they are all great.\\n\\n\r\nThe flashback shows the event before it all happens, with Megumi\u2019s and Miki\u2019s point of view, and I loved the way they handle these episodes with a great pacing building up to the climax while introducing us to the characters and how does the climax hit them real hard. The rest of the episodes are the typical moe slice of life show, where some of them are pretty boring but it\u2019s still gives you a few laugh and smiles while deepening the characters. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters there\u2019s Kurumi she\u2019s the muscle in the group, there\u2019s Yuri she\u2019s the leader of the group but her character is bland in the anime compared to the manga version (which unfortunate because she\u2019s an interesting character), Miki is the newest member of the group (she\u2019s the only character that doesn\u2019t comes to an agreement with Yuki\u2019s condition at first but as the story progresses she\u2019s starting to accept and tries to help her in a way), Megumi she\u2019s the teacher in the group and I say that she\u2019s the best teacher I\u2019ve ever seen, her love to the students are really admirable willing to sacrifice herself for her student safety, Taroumaru is a dog, at first he\u2019s annoying and act as a liability in the group but later we see that he helped the group several times. \\n\\n\r\nNow for me Yuki is the strongest character in this show her delivery in episode 1 proves that, her insanity doesn\u2019t just affect the group but it also affects the audience who watch this show. It makes the audience on edge and having trust issues throughout the episodes. We also learnt that her insanity is what keeps the group sane (explained in another flashback episode), when they put it like that it makes sense, are you willing to live in a world where the only thing you can think of is to survive? Or are you willing to live in a world where you can smile even if the world is ruined? These reason is what makes Yuki\u2019s character meaningful. At episode 11 & 12 is where her character shines, where she finally overcomes her delusion, we would expect her to breakdown and becoming more of a liability but instead it\u2019s the opposite. She managed to save all of her friends (kind of), she\u2019s willing to fight, she helps her friends overcome their sadness and she even gives us the audience a wonderful message.\\n\\n\r\nbut here\u2019s the problem that I have with the final episode, it took the whole episode 11 to build up the climaxes and it ends in a satisfying cliffhanger but later in episode 12 all problems were solved in just around 5 minutes with a solution that are to convenient.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show are great especially the OP, the OP is catchy and upbeat with a very cheerful visual style but as the show progresses the visuals getting darker, darker and darker accompanied with the same upbeat and catchy song this OP works well. The ED is just there nothing really special only in a couple of episodes where the ED stands out. In episode 1 where they reveal the dark secret of this show it uses a music box as the theme song which is very fitting giving us the audience a sense of dread, confusion, relaxing, and depression all in one that was well done. For the slice of life part, the music doesn\u2019t stand up at all it\u2019s just there to serve some scenes but when the show become darker that\u2019s where the music really hits the nail.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this show really fits the atmosphere, when it\u2019s dark the color pellet are grayish and dark but when it\u2019s not the color pellet are all bright and colorful. Now for the zombie design is a bit questionable, it\u2019s because they cover the zombies with a purple aura to restrict the violence and gore in the show, which confuses me why since this show needs that aspect. (because the manga is really gory)\\n\\n\r\nSo overall Gakkou Gurashi is a great show, that has a great characters, great story, and great execution. I watched the anime first and when the anime finished I read the manga but I didn\u2019t read it too far I just read it to the same point as the show, I want to watch the anime first. The manga for me is better but it has a really bad execution and the anime managed to fix this by adding lots of changes which is great but it also loses its consistency. I recommend people to watch this show, it is a must. it's just that this anime doesn't have enough recognition which i find it really unfortunate (like a few of my favorite YouTube anime reviewer didn't even review this show or mention anything about this show which is disappointing to me)",

            "content": "First of all, I'll start by assuming that you've read the synopsis on MAL for it and know what the series is about. However, if you didn't, you might have the opportunity of going into this series without having the first episode's twist revealed. So you might want to head in and check that out first. Like, you might like the whole twist, despite the rate I've given this series and knowing the theme is relevant to what I'll continue with.\r\nIf you're reading this paragraph then I'll assume that you did. Do you like the theme that the anime has presented? Yes? Then you shouldgive this adaptation's manga instead a try. I'll explain why, as I've done a check up on the differences between the manga series and the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's story tried to strengthen the cutsey/moe-ish factor of the show by a fuckton. To do that the show has done certain changes which left out a bunch of scenes where the conflict between some characters has been underwhelmed or totally removed, some events were changed to be more lighthearted or simply replaced with some more slice of life-ish moments. Some moments that define the mental state of the main character better as well as some mental breakdowns were removed from the show. Some events were rearranged to fit the cutsey aspect of the show better and make it be more lighthearted. And on top of all that since they thought the cutsey factor will sell and because we've got girls in the show, you like girls right???, they also added a beach (a pool episode but not really) to it. And due to all of these factors this, the anime will feel lacking and kinda skewered.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to succeed in selling a character that lives in a certain state of mind, you've gotta detail their state of mind as much as possible and the anime's description of the main character's state of mind is simply... accepted by her peers. It is never really explained properly why. The explanation given to us is really, it cheers us up. But in the manga it actually is a little more complex than that. I can't go into more detail because of spoilers here, but note that the manga has given more important details to make her state easier to understand and accept. Her state of mind fuels the tragedy in the series and her struggles. All these things to give depth to her character, and even the characters around her since the effect and the impact her state has on them is also more explored in the manga, all of that, replaced with cutsey moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the series is all damaged, in order for the anime to get serious due to all the changes they've done to the source material it had for a good while to appeal to flashbacks in order to describe the current state of how things are, making it seem as the worst has passed and they're making the best out of a bad situation and living somewhat casually at the current time. In the manga, the pacing is better. And the worst part is that the pacing makes the final events of the series feel completely convenient, from a casual watcher of zombie series' standpoint. There are some things will feel awfully convenient happening. Like, no, stupidly convenient. Like, shoplifting something, being caught, and you asking \"Can I steal this PLEASE?\". And they're like, yeah sure. Then you leave, yay, free shit. I again obviously can't give details on this, because spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSo what can you expect from the anime itself? A story that doesn't describe its characters and the struggles they went through properly, banking on the fact it's cute and hoping that it's cuteness will be a catalyst to an impactful ending, banking on a couple things that are very likely to market. Is that the same case from the manga? Well, I can say the story takes itself more seriously, and things won't feel nearly as convenient there. There's some skipped content in the anime. (a bunch of chapters actually, consecutive even for a bunch of them) There's a character in the series (The dog) that is merely an episodic chapter in the manga series which in the anime is pretty much part of the main cast. The dog is anything but an integral part of the group. And something that will happen to the dog is explained way better rather than not at all.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it quite frankly, the things the anime has done quite well are its intro that gets progressively more fucked up as the series progressed, which I thought was a nifty touch, but I can't say I am a fan of the moe artstyle, or the slice of life-ish moments that took away development from the characters and the group as a whole the manga had. Anything else? The serious moments were done mostly well, but the series is mostly killed by its pacing. As I've said, when it's not in flashbacks, it seems like they're living somewhat of a peaceful life and the worst has already passed, making it all the more ridiculous how by its end, everything that will happen will simply feel convenient. And while the manga also tries to look cute, it does not do it at the cost of telling a more complete story about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a more solid story with better characterization and better focus on the characters and of the theme this anime has, just go for the manga. The manga is decent, it explores the impact someone delusional and why they're delusional overall impacts the group, and the view of everyone on it and the impact this has on them. The anime tries to exploit this mental state as a tool towards building slice of life-ish moments that took away from the story. The manga tells a more natural, better paced, not nearly banking as much on the \"please notice me I'm cute\" factor. The problems of the group and characters are solved with less convenience even though there's some of that inside of the manga too. The world will be described better than in the show and in this particular type of setting, knowing the dangers of the world is very important. Overall I'd say the anime adaptation was an adaptation mostly ruined by marketing tactics. The manga series while not incredible, it still does a decent job with its theme and it uses its strengths mostly right.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're not interested in the theme or just don't want to bother with the manga, you could just avoid this series entirely. The reason I compared it with the manga so much is to explain why the adaptation was bad and if you are really into the theme, you have a far better alternative. I can't recommend you going into the anime for any reason, in good faith, when you have a better alternative for the same story in a different format.",

When you start to watch a show that's supposed to be about the twists and turns and you're just sitting there predicting what's about to happen and getting it right, the show has failed to entertain me. I'm about to get some messages telling me how I'm wrong and how this show was \"ZOMG so dark and deceiving and KEWL and TOO DEEP FOR U TO UNDERSTAND\", but I don't care. Sorry not sorry.\r\nLook, I liked the first episode. But I wish I had stopped right after the first episode. That episode on its own would've left mesatisfied, but it just kept going and getting more and more hard to watch. And not because of blood and guts.\\n\\n\r\nI adore slice of life anime. \"Azumanga Daioh\", \"Nichijou\", and \"Strawberry Marshmallow\" are some of my favorite series. Heck, I even tolerated \"Lucky Star\" well enough (except Patty. I hate Patty. Fuck Patty), so I'm not here to complain about the slice of life elements. I'm also not here to complain about the dead horse known as \"zombie media\". If it's well-written and clever, I can watch a zombie show or movie just fine.\\n\\n\r\nI AM here to complain about the show's predictability and the characters. You can immediately guess what was going to happen throughout the show, and that almost ruined it for me. But even worse was how the other characters treated Yuki. They keep saying how she is their ray of hope and how they can't possibly tell her anything that happens, but allowing someone to stay in denial in such a serious situation is NOT GOING TO HELP, IT IS GOING TO HARM.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you might be thinking of arguing with, \"yeah, Gingy, but when serious stuff happens, we can't let kids know. We have to distract them and keep them from knowing the darkness of the world\". Yeah, because they're kids. Yuki is the same age as the other girls, so why they keep putting her in denial makes little to no sense. She's not a child.\\n\\n\r\nI really tried to like this show. I really did. There were some moments that were fine, and the first episode did a great job of catching the eyes of a lot of anime fans. However, I wasn't pleased. \\n\\n\r\nI probably made someone mad with this review. Sorry. I'm not going to argue back and forth about why you liked the show and I didn't. I'm just going to sip my Calpico and watch some \"Azumanga Daioh\" to regenerate myself.",

            "content": "This anime was a pleasant surprise, I started it after hearing somewhere that the first episode was an amazing watch if you jumped right in without knowing anything about this anime. So I stopped right there, and watched the first episode with little to no prior knowledge. If you are reading this review prior to watching this anime trying to decide if it is worth your time, I would advise you not look too much into it, but simply stop reading now and watch the first episode and make you decision based on that.\r\nWith that out of the way I'll get on with the review.\r\nIssomething unenjoyable simply due to it being too predictable? I think that this is something that will be the difference between really enjoying this show and becoming frustrated with it for some. I've definitely been frustrated with it in the past in some shows, like every twist in turn I saw coming a mile away. However for this anime, where I'll say I saw most of the twists coming (aside from that first one, dayuuum). I think that this was a conscious decision by the writers of the show. There was lots of foreshadowing floating around just begging to be noticed. And I think in some ways, that actually added to the show for me. Just like when you read a book, or poetry, foreshadowing within a piece of work can really enhance its effect. Long story short, I think that a predictable story still has the potential to be a good one.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this show was, not the most intricate I've ever seen, nor the most original. However it was certainly enjoyable. Some of the finer points of what the hell is going on are left unanswered at the end of this series, but that was never really the focus of this show to begin with, and the story really isn't where this show shines. Much of the time the story doesn't focus on the impending zombie apocalypse outside their doorstep, but more on the day to day living, struggles, and psychological issues that have ensued in the aftermath, and how they learn to move on and live a happy life regardless. Not to say that there isn't any zombie killing and drama, because you will have your fill of that I assure you. I won't say much else about what happens other than that the ending doesn't really leave you hanging, but it could definitely use a little bit more work or direction as to what comes next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was consistent and well animated. There is also one or two scenes that stick out in my mind where they really went out of their way to leave an impression.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't say I noticed the soundtrack in very many scenes during this anime aside from a few, but I think it suited it well in the scenes I did notice it. Also I must say the OP was very enjoyable, I normally skip OPs but this one I watched almost every time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow this I think is where the show really leaves its mark. The show has a rather small cast of characters, ranging from the airhead (and mentally unstable) Yuki, Kurumi (Shovel-chan), Yuuri (Responsible big sister type), Megu-nee (Teacher), and Mii-kun (Intellectual). They balance each other out quite well. And I must say that their interactions were all very enjoyable to watch. Now Yuki in particular will either drive you nuts or you will adore her. I certainly enjoyed watching her bubbly, ridiculous, and at times, downright crazy statements and interactions with others. There was more than one time where I fully expected her to go full psycho mode and just start kicking some zombie ass, despite her rather small size and friendly nature. Yuki was the character that I think really made this show excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that this show was a good watch, but the ending could've used a bit more work, or closure.",

            "content": "If you somehow managed to read this without knowing what this anime is about, do yourself a favor and stop reading, because I won't be able to talk about Gakkou Gurashi without revealing the big plot twist of episode one.\r\nStory:\r\nThe great thing about this is, it surprises you either way. If you expect a moe slice of life anime, you will be surprised at the survival horror. If you expect it to be a full-blown horror show, you will be surprised that it is a moe slice of life show nonetheless. When not being threatened by zombies, the girls do their best to enjoy thelife they have with whatever possibilities they have. Gakkou Gurashi does not work on twists alone, it also has story progress, which is something even many \"normal\" slice of life anime miss out on.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMoe is not everyones cup of tea, I don't have a problem with that though. Here it is used as heavy contrast to the horror elements, not unlike the way Madoka was planned out. But since it's still a slice of life anime, it also works the usual way. As a very nice bonus, there are several hints thrown into episode one towards the big reveal as well as a constantly changing opening.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really liked the background music in Gakkou Gurashi, as well as the voice acting (though I have to admit they did play into stereotypes). The bubbly happy opening theme stuck ot more and more as the visuals for it changed and the tone got more serious towards the end. It actually ended up being more disturbing than cute, which is probably a good thing. The ending songs were very touchy, though nothing that stuck inside my head for long.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe girls started out as stock slice of life characters, but over the course of the show, they were able to show more facets than what they seemed to be at first glance. I wouldn't go so far saying they have hidden depths (except maybe Yuki), but they were enjoyably not the fixed stereotypes they could have been. The most important thing however, is that I cared about their well-being. Everytime something bad happened to them, I felt really sad. This includes the dog.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this anime. I laughed and cried, sometimes within minutes of each other and I hoped that everything would turn out okay. It is not often that an anime grabs me like this one did. Maybe my rating is influenced by my emotional involvement while watching, but can this really be an argument against it? You may be put off by the mixture of two so different genres, but if you don't have a problem with that, Gakkou Gurashi is an anime you won't regret watching. If you've read the manga and are a purist, you will also find changes you may not like, but this review is about the anime, not how it was adapted.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10",

Story is, frankly speaking, rather standard issue, but it is worth a glimpse for it's atypical main cast and problem approach.\r\nthis anime does NOT have:\r\n-shallow characters. They may not have a full psychoanalysis conducted, since, you know, ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE takes place, maybe? Calling them shallow is just stupid.\r\n-actual gore\r\n-zombie shots. as in, they're censored when they don't need to be shown. It is not bothersome though, just picturea moaning, shambling corpse clad in aura of darkness.\\n\r\n-much fighting scenes\\n\r\n-obnoxious fanservice. the only instance i recall is when they wear swimsuits for cleaning water tank and when they bathe the dog in underwear.\\n\r\nSo, this is not a story about zombie apocalypse with HS girls in it, but rather about HS girls coping with zombie apocalypse.",

            "content": "-CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS-\r\nOkay first of all let me make it perfectly clear that I have never ever read the manga and just recently heard about this anime from a Top Horror Anime List on  Youtube. On this list it was depicted as something more cutesy like K-on or even God may I say it, Lucky Star (no offence to the people that like that show of course). So this made me very, very, VERY curious of why a show with enough moe to officially kill off Fuko from Clannad, would be on such a list. Though when I watched it I was completely astoundedby how much a show can trick you!\\n\\n\r\n12 EPISODES\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance this show seems to have a story any other slice of life comedy. Usually in many comedies like this the characters are put into weird situations in order to appeal to their audience, and in this case they use a very unrealistic club. Enter the School Living club where 4 lucky girls live their days completely and utterly at school, along with their advising teacher.  In this club they go through their daily lives just like they do at home and even to the point that they do literally sleep at school. This club is also in charge of helping out other clubs as well as taking care of the school's dog, if thats what you wanna call that fur ball. Though by the end of episode one your whole take of this breath of fresh air is turned completely upside down, one word, ZOMBIES. Here's the kicker, their is a major twist to how they actually introduce this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art itself is very vibrant and well moe. The art reminds me of a cross between Rolling Girls, and Charlotte. The characters are especially well drawn with fluid animation. One of my favorite things about it would probably be the way they do both the comedy scenes between all the main characters, and then the fighting scenes where all the tones become much darker. The anime itself is directed by Masaomi Ando who was involved with the storyboards of both Accel World and Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse, which you can definitely see the similarities in visuals, animation, and art style. One of the other things I need to mention is you probably need to watch the opening every time, because with each episode the opening slightly changes due to the events of the last episode and even gives you hints on what will happen in the current episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself is decent nothing magnificent. The opening is a very catchy song. One of the other tracks that also stands out would probably be the soundtrack that translates over as \"Day Good Night,\" which is a soft music box melody and sometimes piano. Its usually played during more of the dramatic and more dark scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nHere I will summarize the 5 main characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Takeya- She's the shows main protagonist as well as the comic relief. She's very naive and even looks the youngest out of the group with her black kitty hat and pink socks. She's the baby of the group as well as the anchor that holds down all hope of stability among her and her friends even though she doesnt know it. She loves school and cares deeply for all of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi Ebisuzawa- Is the typical tsundere of the group. I guess you could say she's the brawn of the group who is constantly tasked with the harder jobs among her and her friends. Her weapon of choice though is a shovel. lol\\n\\n\r\nY\u016bri Wakasa- The big sister of the group who is also the president of the club. She is usually the most mature and level headed of the group but can be scary when provoked, especially by the dog.\\n\\n\r\nMiki Naoki- The brains of the group who acts more distant due to the fact she hasnt known the other girls as long. Shes kind and well mannered, but doesn't agree with the other girls decisions. She is in the grade below the other girls.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Sakura- The advising teacher and founder of the School Living Club. She is very friendly with her students and tends to get closer to them more then other teachers due to the fact that she is young. She would do anything to insure that her students are safe.\\n\\n\r\nTaromaru- The club pet and trouble maker.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is probably in my official top ten list. It combines horror, comedy, slice of life, and moe in a way that I don't think has ever been done. It's so funny and so sad at the same time and can even make you laugh and send shivers down your spine in one episode. If you like a combination of HighSchool of the Dead and Madoka Magica this anime is for you, without the unneeded fan service though. So yeah I highly recommend this show and give in a solid 9 overall. I'd probably give it a 10 if they make a season 2 that builds off the first season and makes the show even better\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a SPOILER FREE review!\r\nOkay,now that I assured you that nothing will be spoiled in this review let's start out with the first episode.We are being introduced to the main girl from the bunch,Yuki.\r\nYuki is a funny high school girl,who loves all her friends,has no care in the world and enjoys her time in school.Although she doesn't like to study that much,and solve math problems in her classes,she still likes her teacher Megune who really tries to teach the uninterested Yuki.We get to meet the school live club,and their members Kurumi,Miki and Yuuri.We follow their lives in this 12 episode anime.Sadly MAL screwed upand already spoiled the setting of the anime,I swear this anime had one of the best first episodes of the first year if you went in blindly..\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nA generic trapped in the zombie apocalypse scenario,but featuring 4 cute girls and a dog.I read the manga and the anime did a really really good job of following it and added some amazing details to the adaptation.Good story but a bit too generic I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10 \\n\r\nOne of the strongest parts is the well done animation and art.You will see a lot of foreshadowing during the episodes,also great addition of details in lots of scenes.Really well done except I don't like moe girls and that art style,but for some reason it went well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe sound really added up to the whole experience,and made the anime more uncomfortable for the viewers(in a good way)to show the situation in which the girls are right now.Great voice acting,and I loved the background music used through the anime.Also catchy opening and a melancholy infused ending paired really well.By the way the op and ed change almost every ep so I recommend watching them every time \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI think some of the characters needed more development and that's why I didn't rate it too high.Except the main girl Yuki and Miki,the other two girls didn't show any progress.Kurumi is probably the most popular from the cast because of how badass she is with her shovel,aka the shove knight of the group,but I'm dissapointed a bit that she was just the muscle of the group and nothing more.I could talk a lot about the mental progress of Yuki and Miki but since this is a spoiler free review I'd like for you people to enjoy the show without knowing much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:Between 6-7\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I couldn't enjoy the show.I liked it a lot,but it was just too much for me because the show is a bit heavy for the feels.Young teenagers shouldn't go through this..I'm sorry Yuki,Miki,Kurumi,Yuuri.You didn't deserve this.I wouldn't recommend you this show if you're feeling depressed,or feeling sad from other reasons because for me the show felt a bit like the movie The Road,it just isnt good for your health and your mood.It is a good anime ,but watch it if you have a prepared comedy after each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\nDark.",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi! is a series that I would be more than glad to say it is one of the best series I have seen so far, especially Animation and Sound wise. This story deals with the topics of apocalypse, death, survival, coping and moving on in a way that made me feel satisfied with this experience. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIf the plot of the show could be summarized in one sentence, it would be this: Cute anime girls trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. This anime is literally that. It deals with four girls in a private high school who are stuck inside within two floors of theschool, all while one of them is living a delusion that everyone is fine and alive, while this isn't true. There are a few episodes that feel like a filler episode, but they end up having a key moment to the plot and the progression of the series. Either way, the story runs smoothly, and my favorite episode has to be Episode 3 where it gives a bit of an explanation about how the outbreak started. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of the things that I genuinely loved of this series was the contrasting art styles. The girls are portrayed with bright and shiny colors, filled with life, while THEY (This is how the Zombies are regarded as) are filled with dark colors along with an aura of death and dark colors. Not to mention, there's also the grainy, old movie art style that is done with scenes showing the past. One thing I did enjoy of the art was the intro, where the art style in the first episode did an animation of a bright and cheery setting, much like any other SoL anime, but as the anime progresses, the borders look more grainy and old, the school is shown as decaying, and the girls basically showing signs of sadness and despair. The art style is one that is bound to be remembered for years to come. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music used for this series was amazing in my opinion. Seeing the intro for the first time gave me a sense of cheerfulness with how upbeat it was, but as the episodes progressed, with me knowing what was really going on, I felt uneasy with the song, knowing it didn't fit with the situation, but it gave a sense of irony with the whole show. One of my favorite songs from anime came from the 5th episode of the series and it was the ED that played when Miki listens to her friend's CD player and the song that came with it gave a sad, depressing, sulky tone to the end of the episode, which fit perfectly with the series itself. The song reminds me of the songs sung by Mary Elizabeth McGwynn from the Silent Hill series- sad, depressing and dark, but it fits the setting of the game. That song gave me the exact same feeling to the example I just mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\r\nIn this anime, there's essentially 6 characters: Yuki who is a cheerful girl who is curious and cooperative with the club activities she is given, but she is actually mentally unstable and living in a delusion of her life, due to her mental breakdown from the initial outbreak. Kurumi is basically the person with strength in the group, using a shovel to defend herself and is normally sent to do riskier missions for the group. Yuri is the \"president\" of the club and has a motherly figure to the other girls, but she is actually mentally fragile, becoming more and more unstable as things worsen. Miki is an underclassmen that is calm and pretty much a bookworm. Taromaru is a puppy who is the mascot of the club and is pretty much a member of the club. Finally, the last character is Megumi-Sensei who is the club adviser and shows a kind nature to the girls, but is constantly interrupted by the girls (This is explained in the anime). What is so good about the characters is how they change as the show goes on. This is especially the case of Yuki, who acts childish due to her delusions in the beginning, but ends up letting go of her delusions and makes an attempt to become a more useful member of the group. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series made me hooked after the first episode since you get to see how they survived for a period of time after the outbreak. As I mentioned, the animation and music of this series was one I genuinely enjoyed, the plot was unique to the genres of horror and slice of life, and I enjoyed seeing the characters change as things worsen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I personally think is underrated, considering the symbolism that occurs throughout the series (especially in the final episode), I felt invested in the characters, hoping that they would survive and I give a lot of props and credits to the people who animated this series, which the contrast in art style is one I personally will remember for a while. If you're a fan of horror, survival, or Slice of Life anime, I recommend this series. It's worth the time.",

These zombies are not the typical zombies you might have in mind.\r\nThis survival anime starts with a twist at the end of the first episode, and this will hook the viewer. This twist was slightly expected for me, but when the anime makes it clear, it is slightlydepressing.\\n\r\nUnfortunately if you are looking for a mystery masterpiece, then you are at the wrong place. If you want a story full of suspense and mystery that does not get solved until the end, I recommend Shinsekai Yori. One of the biggest gem. This anime is for people who just want a casual story with a hint of suspense. This isn't going to get you thinking too much, but it is very fun to watch.",

            "content": "Gakkougurashi is about a group of girls who found shelter during a zombie invasion in their school, with one of them suffering denialism and living a normal school life.\r\nFirst, without any spoiler:\r\nOverall I'd say that the series is fine but not very original; it doesn't take any risk. The main protagonists are schoolgirls and they have to deal with zombies... It sounds just like the beginning of a bad joke. It's easy for us weeaboo to feel worried about schoolgirls as we're used to see them literally everywhere.\r\nSurprisingly enough though, it is a really serious show that can sometimes be really sad or stressful andthat's a really good point. Moreover the soundtracks help a lot and aren't just there to fill the \"sound environment\".\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting and quite human; it also was a good surprise. They are mentally suffering of the result of the apocalypse and not just thinking of it as a pain in the ass. They are scared, depressed or even having some kind of PTSD.\\n\r\nOne more thing about the show in a whole is that not everything is explained to the spectator right after something happens, leaving the spectator making it's own theories using real hints, not too obvious, but still interesting.\\n\r\nAnd finally, the end is satisfying. I will not say here if it's good or bad, just that the end... exists. As a spectator, the end let's you with a feeling of fulfillment; you do not especially need another season to feel satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the show, but I know that I'm not really a demanding spectator. Still I think that from an objective point of view, or at least the least subjective possible, the show is worth giving a try despite it being quite clumsy or unoriginal. It still has a plot that can be interesting as we see the characters trying to survive, keep the mood up as much as possible and dealing with the constant denial of Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for the review without spoiler, thank you for reading me all this way, I hope I've been helpful !\\n\r\nI must apologize for the mistakes I've most likely made as I'm not from an English speaking country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow with MAJOR spoilers:\\n\r\nI've warned you.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I found the end okay, but I wasn't fully satisfied about it. Again it feels to me like whoever came up with it took the easy path by letting everyone survive. Okay Taroumaru dies. But he suffers from another problem, he is a bit too much of a Deus Ex Machina, as he saves Yuki despite having been bitten. I know that zombies keep something about their habits from their life, but if I recall correctly Taroumaru was pretty keen on jumping to the face of Yuki right ?\\n\r\nEven his death doesn't feel right, as he gets back from being a zombie just to be able to die in Miki's arms.\\n\r\nAnd OF COURSE, the vaccine. How convenient ! All this story about the basement and the bio-weapons scared me a little for the end of the show and it seems I was right about it.\\n\r\nAnd finally for the epilogue, how the heck did Sakura Megumi know about the other shelters ?\\n\r\nShortly I feel like the end is just a bunch of really convenient coincidences for the characters that were not really welcome for the viewer.\\n\r\nDuring the 11th episode I was expecting that everyone would eventually tragically die... I would've been so down for the following days that my familly would constantly be asking me why, but still I would have preferred that as it might have been a really sad end with much feels without any compromise. Insead Taroumaru died and they left a TOTALLY EMPTY SCHOOL WITHOUT ANY ZOMBIE, SERIOUSLY ! How incoherent it was that the zombies did not come back.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading !!",

            "content": "(note: spoiler for episode ONE....even though I'm pretty sure the synopsis spoils it too. avoid this review and the synopsis if you want to go COMPLETLY blind)\r\n  I really adored this anime, for there is something about cute girls facing disaster that makes me enjoy an anime. I honestly wish I could have given it a slightly higher score, however, problems with a few of the characters, a bit of the story, and a few minor things with the art prevent me from awarding it that.\r\n   First off, the characters. It took me a while to realize this, but most of thecharacters don't have much going for them. Yuki is an exception due to her unique situation, and Miki, although defiantly not the best character, also has some decent development. However, characters like Kurumi and especially Yuri don't have the best development and are almost completely clich\u00e9. They don't have enough focus on their backstories, development, and just how they act and change (or well....development.) With this said, Kurumi was still a fun character to watch and had slight development to her. As for Yuri......meh. \\n\r\n    The story was good. I, for the most part don't have much to complain about except for one thing that really bugged me. I can't really go into much details because spoilers....so I will say this. \\n\r\n     I was slightly confused with what Yuki's was thinking was during the mid point of the series (involves her freaking out and running out of the room after the mall trip.) \\n\r\n     I hope you guys who seen it know what I'm talking. I'm trying extremely hard to avoid any spoilers.\\n\r\n     Also, some people found later plot twists slightly obvious. I wasn't one of them, but I could see why someone would think this. \\n\r\n     The music was good. It fit the mood and the op was KAWAII! The art was good and consistent, but my goodness there was one scene where an emotional moment was high by fan service. (I'm specifically talking about that scene with Miki and her friend in the mall.) I'm not against fan service, but that was a scene where Miki really should have worn pants or her usual skirt. However, in the grand scheme of things, this isn't major.\\n\r\n      In general, this series was good although has a few issues that should have been smoothed out. Despite these flaws, I have no problems in fully recommending school-liv... I mean Gakkou Gurashi\\n",

(School-Live!) shifts perspectives and situations at will, making for a unique experience that has the ability to leave viewers unsure of whether or not to smile or hold their breath.\r\n\"A line drawn in blood, separating reality from fantasy.\"\r\nHere are the show's genre tags: horror, mystery, psychological, school, and slice of life. This is easily one of the most contradictory, creative anime I've watched in a while, but it blends all these genres together into a shocking combination. Many people, myself included, have seen better fight scenes, better jokes, better story lines. To say that Gakkougurashi does any of these with an expert's precision wouldbe false, but I found none of the story elements to be unbearable or cringeworthy. While some of the action or chase scenes seemed to be plot convenient or unrealistic, nothing seemed out of place. The story seems solid, and it definitely foreshadows future events well and forces the watcher to make connections.\\n\\n\r\n\"Two palettes\u2014light in one hand, and dark in the other.\"\\n\r\nAfter a while, it becomes easy to discern between \"Yuki vision\" and normal vision. I found myself unsure of which version of the world I was seeing: something imagined, or something real. Bright colors and cute characters are in stark contrast with the shadows, gore, and quote-unquote citizens lurking around every corner. Character designs are pleasant and memorable (Kurumi is my personal favorite), and fine details hint at plot elements and whatnot. One thing to watch out for is the opening and ending sequences. As the story progresses, so do they.\\n\\n\r\n\"From cheerful to grim, and some dark foreshadowing.\"\\n\r\nMusic and sound effects are a vital part of any film. Even the absence of sound can be meaningful, and it's typically very difficult to mess up the sound aspect of an anime. However, Gakkougurashi has the same problem as another very popular title: \"Clannad: Afterstory\". If you've seen it, think back to that episode, where they insensitively played the cheerful ending song right after a major turning point in the story? If you don't know what I'm thinking about, imagine someone cracking jokes and singing happily during a funeral progression where everyone else is mourning. If that metaphor doesn't do it, then I'll say it bluntly; it's normally a good idea to change the music to fit the current point in the story. The cheerfulness of the ending and next-episode preview break tension in the story, but bring the show full circle from slice of life to slice of life. Make it what you would, but be ready for drama and trauma. Don't be mad if the show adds insult to injury through song.\\n\\n\r\n\"Yuki, Kurumi, Yuuri, Miki, Megumi, and Taroumaru.\"\\n\r\nThe characters are what I consider the most important part of this anime, much like all others. It's not unusual to have a cast of four girls, usually filling out the main categories. Fortunately, none of the characters overdo clich\u00e9d stereotypes or archetypes. Four high-school girls, a teacher, and a dog are stuck in a post-apocalyptic world. None have any particular survival skills: Yuki is eternally cheerful and Kurumi can swing a shovel, but they're all \"mostly average\". What I find interesting, and the most rewarding aspect of the show, is the psychological interaction that goes on between the characters, their environment, and themselves. Escaping a harsh reality, making difficult decisions, being forced to make and break bonds... They're all common themes of a post-apocalyptic horror show. While the characters' personalities aren't explored in depth, what redeems them is their relationships and emotions with the others. You can see the reasons behind their behavior, the things that are holding them back. An individual's logic and common sense say one thing, but their experiences and feelings may say another.\\n\\n\r\n\"To enjoy, even while knowing the truth.\"\\n\r\nWhether or not this show is enjoyable is a moot point. Sure, it's a slice of life about school and cute girls and fun. It's also a horrifying story with extremely dark events. I found it hard to enjoy the casual and relaxed parts of the episode because of the previous' events being on my mind. It definitely isn't a bad show, or one that isn't entertaining or gripping, because trust me\u2014I found Gakkougurashi very, very interesting. The only thing is, all the slice of life starts to feel like a falsehood in comparison to the psychological horror.\\n\r\n\"My recommendation.\"\\n\r\nI had no idea what to expect of this show before I watched it, and it was still completely unexpected. Gakkougurashi was definitely not a disappointment, and while it isn't a drop-dead masterpiece, I would say it was a good usage of my time.\\n\r\nGeneral things? Opening and ending are very nice, they change with the show. Pay attention during them, I do suggest that you watch them, at least every couple of episodes. Be prepared for plot twists and \"oh sh*t\" moments. Some of the foreshadowing and such was very well done, particularly a scene in the last three episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\"A TL;DR summary.\"\\n\r\nStory: 8. Room for improvement, but is not lacking. Feels a bit disjointed or illogical at times, but it's not incomprehensible or nonsensical.\\n\r\nArt: 8. Constantly switches between happy time and not-happy time. Depicts world in different ways, rather intriguing and works well with the theme.\\n\r\nSound: 7. Does its job, but breaks the tension after climactic episodes. Sort of annoying.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9. Some characters lack personality or background, but all interact very well together and the psychological part makes them a whole lot more interesting.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6. Slice-of-life elements feel like filler because of the other aspects of the show.\\n\r\nOverall: 8. Recommended for fans of psychological fiction, but not very much for fans of slice of life.\\n\\n\r\n... I'm sort of annoyed with how this review turned out, but it's something. Watch this show, it's always better to see for yourself than to hear it from another.",

            "content": "Quick Disclaimer. Due to the nature of the show, I'd highly recommend you at least watch episode 1 of Gakkou Gurashi if you haven't already, because in able to talk about the plot and stuff, it is near impossible to talk about this show without spoiling the twist that happens in the first episode. So be warned.\r\nPeople give the moe artstyle a bad rap. Yeah, sometimes it is nice to have some grittier backgrounds or character designs, but if it fits the setting well, than there really isn't wrong with it. It may not be your thing, but it isn't inherently bad. However, there area select few shows that take this artstyle and subvert it by making the viewer think you are watching a \"cute girl doing cute things\" anime. Gakkou Gurashi is definitely one of those shows, and for the most part, it makes it work.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this show is that it uses it's artstyle and it's slice of life moments to amplify the serious nature of the show. You could interpret the slice of life scenes in Gakkou Gurashi to be just that, slice of life. However, I think the major purpose of the slice of life scenes is subtly hinting that the characters are trying to put on a facade in a bad situation. Try to put a smile on your face to hide the fear that you have. The artstyle works in the same way. I wouldn'tve been as creeped out if the character designs were more realistic or the artstyle wasn't bright (it does tone itself down when it needs to). When comparing the light and fluffy stuff like this to the stuff that is actually going on in the plot, it makes for some really unsettling scenes I could just be optimistic about this, but this is what I think the creator's intent was, and except for a few parts in the last 3 or so episodes, it works brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThis setup with the artstyle and designs would not have worked if there weren't any decent dramatic and tense moments to accompany the slight hysteria that the former brings. And while these moments were a little few and far between, just a little, they actually work at making you feel a little uneasy, something that anime horror just doesn't do well most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing about the setting. I really appreciate the fact that the creators focused on the characters and their experience within a zombie apocalypse instead of actually focusing on the zombie apocalypse. The zombie genre is so overblown nowadays that we know basically what happens: get supplies, run from zombies and bad people, watch people you love die, etc. Gakkou Gurashi realizes that you know the basics of the zombie apocalypse setting and can jump right into the stories of the characters without needing to info dump about zombie apocalypses. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a little bit disappointing honestly, but not by much. The characters aren't actually bad, but I feel that since there were only 5 actual characters that needed developing that they could have done a better job with them.\\n\\n\r\n The main focus, Yuki, was handled well, and how her whole dilemna surfaces, as well as how she deals with, was handled tactfully.\\n\\n\r\n Mii-kun really wasn't much of an interesting character, but her development was handled decently enough. Her backstory episodes were incredibly well done, though.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi is easily the fan favourite of the series, and it's easy to see why. She kicks zombies asses with a shovel, what else could you possible want?\\n\\n\r\nMegu-nee was a decent character, but I feel her \"twist\" was handled poorly. They foreshadowed it so much to the point where it was obvious 4 episodes before it actually happened. Subtlety is definitely one the shows weaker points, which is evident with this character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yuuri Wakasa. Honestly, there isn't much to talk about with her. She is the least focused on and therefore the least interesting character. She has big knockers though, so who cares!\\n\\n\r\nSince I've basically already talked about the art, let's move onto sound. The soundtrack really is not memorable, except for one absolutely heartwrenching song that replaces the ED in episode 4. It's a brilliant sendoff for that particular episode, and the song itself is both bleak and beautiful at the same time. It sounds like that slow 50's music, and it is just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I guess I have to talk about the opening as well. The song isn't really that great, but I have to give credit to Lerche for changing the animation for the opening as the anime went along. When a major key plot point arises in an episode, most likely the anime will accommodate for it in the animation for the next episode's opening sequence, which was a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nGakkou Gurashi does something that horror anime rarely does right, which is make you feel scared. When a dramatic scene pops up, you can feel the uneasiness come over you, at least a little bit anyways. This is one of the few adaptations that I can say improved over the manga in at least a few spots. Lerche did a great job adapting it up until the last 3 or so episodes. Those episodes felt either too rushed or too heavy on the SoL to really be that impactful to me. Also, there was way too much reliance on Deus Ex Machina for me to really give praise to the ending of this anime. There haven't been many good anime that have come out of 2015, but this is definitely one of them. Second Season please.",

            "content": "The mixing of genres is a very common thing in works of fiction, but it goes without saying that they won\u2019t always mix well. You could look at that peanut butter and chocolate, and say that it\u2019s a great idea, but the peanut butter coated chocolate probably won\u2019t be as big a success as the chocolate-coated peanut butter. What I\u2019m saying with this delicious analogy, is that a bit of consideration needs to go into what you\u2019re crafting, and if you put too much of one thing where you should have put another, then the end product isn\u2019t going to be very good. In thecase of Gakkou Gurashi, the same thing can be said, and the question that shall be answered here, is whether we have a new merger on our hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in Japan, because why wouldn\u2019t it? A group of girls is a part of The School Live club, and lives in the school, as the name may suggest. Already this premise is strange, and it\u2019s hard to imagine what sort of intentions will be behind it, until we get to the end of the first episode and see why living in the school is so crucial. It turns out that a zombie apocalypse has occurred, and these four girls and living in a well-equipped school, because they have little other choice.  At this point this are more or less a mix of two much-overused things, moe and zombies, but what really hooks you with the show is the psyche of one of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Takeda Yuki, our main character, and the typically bubbly girl you expect from this type of show. Through the first episode, we are literally led on a chase as we follow Yuki through the building (chasing a dog) and her behavior is markedly different from that of her lower classmate. It turns out that the zombie apocalypse has broken the poor girl, and in the relative safety of the school, she has forged a bubble around herself, living in an illusion where everything is all right, and anyone who might be dead, is actually alive. This premise is what roped me into the show, as I pondered when this girl broke and whether or not she\u2019d remain that way and it gets increasingly interesting as we see how the other club members react. For once, the zombie apocalypse is taking a different approach, and it offers something that\u2019s worth the time, unfortunately, the moe doesn\u2019t really blend with that well, and so it feels like a lot our time is wasted.\\n\\n\r\nWhere we should arguably have focused on navigating the deadly lifestyle, with a girl who doesn\u2019t see the death, we are instead wrapped in her illusion with her, and can only glimpses the hostile world through breaks in her psyche. This is imaginative in a sense. It arguably places us in Yuki\u2019s feet, and that would theoretically increase our immersion, but instead it feels like a waste of time, and too much of that time is paid to her delusion than to the world. Ultimately, the genres aren\u2019t mixed. They\u2019re kept in the same room as one another, but they occupy different sides, and when the do decide to talk; one is noticeably louder than the other is. It is interesting to see how the delusions manifest, but because they can manifest in a safe area (or in a place where we already know nothing is at stake), the anime is allowed to deliver its moe ham-fistedly with very rare moments where the natures join hand.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Gakkou Gurashi had the potential to be something great, but preoccupations with other things present an unavoidable roadblock. It\u2019s worth the watch to see how two entirely different things can come together, and as a cautionary display of how they come together poorly. It does have some interesting elements, but they seem worthless in the greater scheme of the project. Ultimately, I give it a 6/10   \\n",

            "content": "One of the best things that has happened to me was that I didnt read the synopsis for this anime before starting it and it gave me quite a shock at the end of the first episode.\r\nI first checked the tags and I found SoL,horror,psychological and I felt curious about how they were gonna pull this off and I have to say they managed it quite well.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThe raw idea of 4 girls(I didnt include Megu-nee and you will know why after you watch it) stuck in a school in the midst of a zombie apocalypse was fine.But some the episodes give you the feelingwhat the actual f are these girls are doing in such a situation,I mean there was an episode where they go to a mall to get some supplies but later end up in a shop buying dresses.\\n\r\nThe first 5 to 6 episodes were not that good where they do stuff like that while having zombies waiting at the school's main door,sounds fun.But later around 8th or 9th episode it gets darker.Also most of the comments for this anime on the site I watched said that it was depressing but I dont think it was that depressing to the extent that you start crying after watching it(I maybe wrong on this one due to my ability to remain emotionless to a large extent).\\n\r\nThe ending was kind of unsatisfying, more like your mainstream happy happy ending' although it would have been much better if everyone died in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 5\\n\r\nThe art was ok. It wasnt like it was amazing or it was total crap but it was just plain.Also the zombies looked like huge piles of poop which could've been improved.The same applies for sound.There wasnt any soundtrack which was creepy af.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nThe first thing I would've done if I were in such a situation is to take that freaking shovel and kill that pink head and that useless dog.I mean they only exist to consume food supplies and bring trouble.And it was surprising to find Shovel-chan not doing that.I also learned that you can drive a car just my playing NFS line of games.Seriously who the heck would think \"There are zombies outside,lets clean the tank and have a swim in the pool.\"There were not many characters but that pink head was really annoying.But also it was fun watching her as her mental insanity made this anime more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThis anime sure had its moments but honestly I an never imagine anyone ever doing the stuff that these girls do while in such a situation.The ending was actually pretty good,not the song but the way they perfectly summarize stuff in those pictures while the credits were rolling.These minute details made this anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis anime is not for all audiences.Not many people may like a depressing(apparently) show like this one but overall if you overlook the stupid stuff they do in the first few episodes, it turns out to be quite interesting.Also Mii-kun looked exactly like totsuka saika ;) .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The way they structured the story was in a forwards to backwards layout, which can only really be pulled off (well) in pscyh anime... but they did such a magnificent job at using the FTB layout to recap the story. When we get post-apocalyptic stories, we generally dont question why its set in this era because its just as it is ... a post apocalyptic-anime OR they give a basic desciption when the MC shows up and gets told some tragic past ofanother dude (who probably dies by the end of the anime... lol) and that shuts us up and we continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nGakkougurashi gave a simple reason, which I would have been satisifed with and then began to tell the outbreak story in snippits of each girls backstory, which I never knew I wanted to know until I knew why everything was how it was. Clever right? Confusing? not at all! Its done very well, along with beautiful animation and movement. \\n\\n\r\nThe moe style isnt my everyday cup of tea but it adds to the overall effect they were going for combining horror with cutesy. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters get a nice development but they werent all in depth. Enough information was given for the right amount of knowledge to understand what was happening and I guess thats all that matters. You will enjoy Gakkougurashi!!",

            "content": "|||SOME SPOILERS|||\r\nGakkougurashi! is an anime that deceives first impressions. It presents itself in the first episode as a generic moeblob SoL. However, by the second episode we realize that the show is in fact zombie/horror. The interplay of the two genres is the most unique aspect yet the biggest downfall of Gakkougurashi. \r\nFrom the beginning of the second episode, it is evident that the contrast of moe-horror is put there to shock us, and it is is in fact quite disturbing to see the delusions of the main character, Yuki, as she attends empty, blood-smeared classrooms and talks to characters who aren't there. Her energeticand cheerful attitudes to the zombie apocalypse that she is unaware of are sometimes chilling, but most of the time they're simply annoying, as if the creators are trying to say \"this is a placeholder for a generic moe thing to say/do\". \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest shortcoming of Gakkougurashi! is below the level of story/art/sound/character... It has proven that MoeSoL does not mix with zombie horror without a little direction. Take this keeping in mind that \"mix\" =/= \"transition\". While Madoka is an anime that transitions from innocent to dark, Gakkougurashi! continues to alternate genres throughout the show. This creates a surprisingly jarring experience and causes mental exclamations such as, \"Why are you cleaning the Effing water tank and treating it like a pool/bath/beach episode? There's survival shist to do!\" I think that he MoeSoL parts would have been a lot more interesting if they were designed to be \"creepy\" and \"fake\" (what I mean by \"direction\"), but they are actually very generic and some are hopelessly sentimental such as the graduation scene. I understand what was trying to be achieved, but the execution falls into the (unfortunately) deep chasm before its goal.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nGakkougurashi is a character-driven anime and doesn't really have a story except for the characters holding out against zombies and using their school as a shelter. Instead we'll focus on the storytelling style itself, which is generally done well. The handling of the timeline is done in a way that allows the teacher, Megu-nee, to be both in the story and absent from it at once; the structure of \"middle-beginning-end\" suits the show well and the Megu-nee plot twist is done well enough to become one of the two high points of the show (the other being episode 11). I don't mind flashbacks, and there are a lot in this show. However, they simply didn't fill in enough of the backstory to be worthwhile. STORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe animation didn't stick out as either good or bad. As long as it isn't noticeably bad, I never have a problem with animation. The art style is fine as well, and suits the cutesy setting. The thing that makes the art distinct is the color palette during flashbacks and during the higher-risk parts of the show. The washed-out color never really gets old for me, and the backdrops have a lot of detail which really contribute to the general mood. ART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nSound is similar to art as in there's generally no problem if it works. There was nothing that stuck out in neither a good sense nor a bad sense. The OP is kind of meh, but I reckon they're taking the piss out of upbeat SoL openings. Music matters a lot more to me than art (my two favorite shows Kill La Kill and Cowboy Bebop have great soundtracks) and more time into sound would have probably resulted in a stronger show. SOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe characters are generally not done well and all of them lack depth. However, my biggest problem is with Yuki herself, who is obviously mentally broken. The show wants us to take for granted that the only symptom of this is that she hallucinates people to life. Not only does the show not realistically explain how or when this happened (Because PTSD? Just after Megu-nee died?), it also assumes that she is perfectly normal otherwise. Anybody can tell that this is just odd, and the show could have had a lot of fun with creepy scenes(say, of Yuki alone in a classroom muttering to herself and covered in blood tearing the limbs off a teddy bear or whatever.) There are also times when it looks like Yuki finally sees a hole in her delusion and will begin to see the world for what it really is. This never happens and she comes in the next scene perfectly well and her delusion still as intact as ever. Mii-kun, in my opinion, is a great character who's complexity could have been explored a lot more. We are simply served up a semi-yuri relationship with another girl, Kei, who is soon killed and that is the basis for our character. The whole concept of \"beyond just living\" could have been a more prominent theme of Mii-kun's character and the show. The other two characters, Yuuri and Kurumi, had minimal backstory and were generally boring. Megu-nee is probably an interesting character but her role is kind of implied to be outside the setting of the show. CHARACTER: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nGakkougurashi! is a show that is greater than the sum of its parts. What we're given is a unique idea and good concept that is executed generally okay. The show, while it has its flaws, managed to keep me engaged through its moments of twistedness and suspense, and kept me guessing what would happen next and who the characters were (I'm still guessing). I'm not going to lie. I did shed a tear at various parts of the show as some parts were truly sad, and I did feel a connection to the characters. Gakkougurashi! is an anime which has done an admirable job attempting to explore unique concepts. I hope shows in the future will build upon this concept.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGAKKOUGURASHI!:  7/10\\n",

            "content": "So, this all started months ago when I decided to watch, with no prior knowledge, episode 1 of this particular series. Needless to say I was surprised and intrigued, so I resigned myself to wait the season out in anticipation of watching the series in bulk in a binge-watch situation in order to get the most out of it; in the end, I'm pleased, interested, and satisfied with the end result.\r\nStory: Well, it's a black/white story of a group of characters being thrust into a dire situation that has a bit of mystery and a good dose of psychological trauma, all presented with a sortof sugary glaze of \"moe,\" art, dialogue, and interaction. It can be freely argued that this mix doesn't work out well, but as a fan of David Lynch and Todd Solondz styled films, I can easily say I like the staggered mix of normality and trauma; it's not perfect, but the comedy is there as a set-up for a newer serious bit. I like that. The formula works for me. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's \"moe,\" style throughout; nothing else to really say about that. The characters are drawn lively and the occasional moments of \"service,\" which do happen, (I will not deny this,) are, in my opinion, easily disregarded if you are watching this open-minded and looking for story. Animation is good, period.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The intro is a trap, haha. I like that juxtaposition. The outro's vary, and I think there are about four different ones; each corresponds with ending emotion of the parent episode. I would like to point out that there are some moments, (helps to watch with head-phones for this effect,) that the music or sound corresponds with the viewers emotions. Think, \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" piano notes, though obviously not as profound. Just good arrangement, overall .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, with a group of girls, in anime, you get the usual mix, but I think that Yuki and Miki are the ones you should focus on. Miki is a natural foil to Yuki and it's interesting to watch their relationship evolve. The other supporters are good, and do also add the development and understanding of the relationships between characters, but if you are looking for a good contrast focus on the former two. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I like trasngressive film, I like deconstruction, and I like nice characters being tossed into difficult situations. I was satisfied with this showing. It almost brought back memories of,\"When they Cry,\" with the fun art and dark story. I find that this show delivers on surprise value when you go in oblivious. The last 3 episodes, if you like the characters, should help elicit some emotion; tears may be too much, but I definitely felt a lump in my throat during the last episode, especially.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series was a surprise. I knew after previewing the first episode that I would want to watch this in my usual binge style and at the end of the day I was satisfied. The ending may feel a bit of a drag, but just put your feelings in the passenger seat and enjoy the last scene that leads towards hope and the future. Sure, nothing is concrete, but someone in the grand, outside word received a touching sentiment, and in the end, isn't that enough?",

            "content": "If you have managed to avoid all information regarding this show up until now...GOOD, plug your ears, cover your eyes, and go watch the first episode RIGHT NOW before you come across spoilers. I was not so lucky. But don't worry if you really want to read a review, there are no spoilers here.\r\nThis series is what i would call \"GENRE BREAKING\" Gakkougurashi is to slice of life moe what Puella Magi Madoka Magica was to magical girl anime. \r\nThis is a slice of life moe series to be sure with the typical school setting, but what makes it unique is the situation in whichthese main characters have found themselves. Everything starts off as you'd expect, bright and cheery. But sooner or later you begin to realize something is amiss, and when you do you'll also realize all the quirky and fun activities these girls take part in have a much more important purpose than simply having a fun and youthful school life. They start off fairly subtle with it but by about the mid point of episode 1 most people should begin to catch on to what might be happening with the visual cues. That is if the fact that they live at school and have a dog aren't enough of a clue already.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as you would expect from this genre of show, bright and colorful with fairly a simplistic art style along with some stereotypical character designs.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of writing they also use some fairly common character archetypes of this genre. From the the lead character whose a clumsy playful idiot, to the sporty fighter girl, calm collected and mature for her age motherly girl, the girl whose always worried, to the friendly teacher who really has no leverage as an authority figure, they hit most of the clich\u00e9s. Oh, and also the trouble making sidekick pet.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't particularly special but they do hit the right tunes to top off every moment.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a refreshing twist on a pretty stale genre. While it does stay bright and cheery for the most part, it gets a little deep and depressing at times. I absolutely recommend you give it a chance even if and especially if you absolutely despise moe.",

            "content": "I watched this out of nowhere, it was pretty good.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI mean, its a couple high school girls in a zombie apocalypse, it's not that original. \r\nis what I wish I could say~\r\nHonestly, I loved the story and it was pretty dark. Seeing through Yuki's eyes and all of the dead as alive, it was a total spoop and I definitely wasn't expecting it to get so dark so fast lmao. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nI absolutely LIVED for this art. It was so eye-opening when the art style changed from Yuki's perspective to how it actually was in reality. It made me feel for the other characterson how it's not really all cupcakes and rainbows.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I'd like to add is how the changing art in the openings impacted me. On every couple of episodes, the openings would turn a little bit darker by showing some more parts of the dark reality. By the last episode, it was almost completely different and I really loved that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were great. The song in the opening is probably stuck in my head forever. help.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of these characters were pretty generic to me at least. We have the mom of the group, the athlete, the edgy child, and the Little Miss Kawaii. But I do like Yuki's character development. It was pretty satisfying, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually found myself really enjoying this show. The ending episodes kept me on edge the whole time lol. But like, they could have ended it better in my opinion. The psychological side of things made this show really fun for me to watch, and I guess the moe can't be helped.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI think that this anime was pretty good, but I really didn't care too much for the ending. I at least think that people should at least give it a try watching it.\\n",

            "content": "In almost any form of art, the use of contrast can be a very powerful tool to enhance the appeal of your work. By taking two different items and setting them against each other, it can multiply the overall value and effect of the product versus those two items being standalone. It can make paintings have a captivating appearance, give food a memorable flavor, and, in the case of movies and television, give a unique experience that makes it stick to the minds of the audiences watching. There is, however, a catch to this: the right amount of each item must be balanced against eachother lest one overpower the other or it turn away potential customers/viewers/etc. So how does the use of contrast affect the anime School-Live? The answer is important - after all, it's what the entire show hinges on.\\n\\n\r\nSchool-Live is an anime that wishes to contrast two different atmospheres, cute and creepy, in its 12 episode runtime. It combines a cute high-school slice of life show with that of a zombie apocalypse. The reveal that there's horror in something charming is sometimes hidden from the viewer to make the turn of events more shocking, but in the case of School-Live, it's its worst kept secret. The show's synopsis, poster, and tags all give away what's happening. Even before the big reveal, it's pretty clear that something's wrong inside the show's world.  That said, the show's use of zombies isn't really where the main focus lies. Instead, it uses this as a tool to test the survival, and psychological skills, of our main protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is given a slight role to the group. Kurumi is the twin-tailed fighter of the group and uses her trusty shovel to fight off the occasional zombie rush. Yuuri serves as an organization leader of the group and is shown keeping down a list of supplies as well as \"approve\" of certain events. Miki is the newcomer and though she is the youngest of the group of girls, she is the smartest and most practical of the group. Finally, there's Yuki, the chipper voice of morale and mascot of the show. A black hat with cat ears is worn over her head filled with ideas of what to do during the group's downtime. Together they make the \"School-Life\" club, a club dedicated to doing what they can to \"help\" other groups and make school the best place to be. The price for this dedication is to stay on school grounds at all times, but considering what's going on outside, it can hardly be considered a downside.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the club the 4 girls form isn't really an official club - rather, it's the way that they help keep their sanity in check. The supernatural fear outside combined with the claustrophobic environment inside can get to a person, so pretending to have ever-popular school events such as a sports day and field trips can break the monotony of survival. This is where the show wishes to use its contrast. It shows a typical school life setting against the fear of a horrific death. Every event is limited not by a school budget or time, but rather what the girls have on hand. Throw in the chance of something horrific happening during each day in their fortress and you've got a show that certainly finds a place for itself.\\n\\n\r\nThose looking for a chance to see some intense girl-on-zombie fighting will be sorely disappointed. Sure, Kurumi swings a shovel a few times but it never focuses on the action. Instead, it offers two alternatives: goofing off and twisted tales. The former is to deliver the \"cute\" half of the show's contrast (as well as attract the audience who enjoy idle, silly fun). The latter is the core strength of the show, as we get to see how these girls truly feel about the events that have occurred and the fears of what the future may bring. Yuki is the obvious choice for this category, as she simply pretends nothing went wrong and thinks every day is another fun and fantastic day at school. I do find her to be a bit immature, though. She's a senior in high school, and yet I feel like I'm watching a kids show when she performs her antics. Miki is for my money the best of the cast. Her story is a personal one, much like the others, but the emotions feel amplified as a result of the lack of interactions she gets as well as the isolation she has from the rest of the world. The main cast get a school and make up fun activities - during Miki's origins, we get none of that and instead get a greater fear of the unknown. It's arguably the greatest moment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith these details in mind, does School-Live find a balance between its two genres? For some viewers it does, but I can't say it did for me. The show has a habit of pointing out a few flaws in their own show but ultimately struggle to answer them. The biggest example of this include part of the field trip episode. There's danger looming all around and, especially later in the show, a fear of supply management as resources start to dwindle down. Yet there's enough time for swimsuits to be tried on. The excuse \"We are girls, after all\" doesn't really work here and suggests that the show is also trying to attract an audience via alternative means. A better strategy would be to stock up on more of the zombie's weaknesses (sound and light based items, such as glowsticks and child alarms).  Another example stems from how coincidental everything is. With the school's vast amount of natural resources,  it definitely feels apt for survival. This seems to be hinted at something greater, but not enough detail is given. A good question to answer would be how long do the zombies live for? Right now, I am to believe they are immortal unless they are explicitly killed. In the end, it's a supernatural story so anything the author wants can be put into place. This latter point is only minor, since this is the first part of the story. However, a little enticement for the future can go a long way with keeping people interested - it comes off as more credible than trying on swimsuits.\\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate issue will lie with the audience. I enjoy some slice-of-life but it's not a genre I can say is my favorite. Sure, it's cute watching the girls run around and make stupid jokes, but I really don't gain too much from it. I'd much rather see a form of progress across the city or more of what's happened with the world rather than be confined in the halls of the school. Considering that's half of the show's appeal, it's quite clear that I'm not meant for the show's audience. That said, it'd be foolish for me not to admit it's a necessary evil. Had the show entirely be focused on the mystery and horror, it probably would've received more criticisms of shock value and wouldn't have found as large a fanbase. That's really the takeaway of using the contrast strategy - the balance in the creator's eye may be imbalanced in the eye's of the viewer. That's why we all have different likes and dislikes, after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation studio behind School-Live is Lerche. There are a few shortcuts here and there (the CG zombies in one scene being the #1 shortcut) but they do a fairly good job. Bright, cutesy colors for when everything's fine and shades of purple, black and dull gray for when zombies are involved. Arguably the scariest thing about this show may be the character's eyes - their irises are a bright ring that contains a dark colored pupil. They're sort of unsettling to look at. The music for the show consists of goofy, lighthearted pieces and some dramatic tones - mood music, mainly. It sports a catchy OP \"Friend Shitai\" and a relaxed ED \"Harmonize Clover\" to end episodes on a lighter note (with the tongue-in-cheek \"Good Night\" displayed after the end of early episodes). The real grab would be the moody piano piece \"We took each other's hand\", used perfectly for Miki's scenes and again amplifying her backstory. The voice acting is also good. The seiyuus know how to deliver a dramatic scene or a scream when needed. Yuki's is a bit too \"bubbly\" for me, but it's appropriate for her character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give School-Live a 6/10. It's a show that's not for everyone - again, this is a show for people who want a slice-of-life AND a bit of psychological horror. If you're more in the former camp and don't mind a darker show, this will probably be the anime for you. If you're more in the latter camp, I'd advise to pass on this one unless you need something a bit lighter, as strange as that sounds. School-Live is a short and interesting watch that shows that even a strange contrast can give a show staying power.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!",

Not only the amalgamation of such a disparity of genres results as forced, bland and unimaginative, but it truly tops itself when in the last two episodes the most obnoxious developments occur and the only demise in this whole fallacious mess is the one that made less sense and truly took a toll on my sanity.Despite an interesting start, you will be quickly disappointed by one-note only characters and problems, absurdly developed solutions to the most critical conditions, \"power of friendship and love\" put in the most hideous of places, magically appearing, conveniently placed plot devices at the right time, and senseless casualties.\\n\\n\r\nDo youself a favour and bury this utter disappointment in the deepest recesses of Tartarus where this abomination rightfully resides.",

            "content": "School-Live! is a series that has much more under the hood than one would expect. I want to preface this review by saying that the impact of what this series has to offer is better realized if the viewer goes in blind. With that said, concept only takes a series so far, and while this one has quite the interesting concept, it doesn't nearly reach its full potential.\r\nIF YOU'VE READ THE SYNOPSIS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT JUST IN CASE, FROM HERE ON OUT THERE MAY BE MINOR SPOILERS\r\nSchool-Live! follows the lives of the School Living Club, a club consisting of four students and one teacher(as well as a dog), as they go about various club activities. This club isn't like any other club however. It's the only club, and its members are seemingly the only survivors of a zombie outbreak. Our main character, Yuki, doesn't seem to realize what kind of situation they are in, as she attends classes in empty, beaten down classrooms. She plans School Living Club events, all the while, the other survivors, Kurumi, Miki, Yuuri, and Megu-nee try to come to grips with their situation and how to potentially survive. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this series would be \"Psychological-infused Moe\". The main focus is split between the girls being concerned about Yuki and her current state, and the zombies and how they plan to survive. The problem is that these two tones don't mesh very well together. Had this series focused on one or the other it could have excelled. Unfortunately, splitting its time between both causes both aspects, and ultimately the plot as a whole, to suffer. The zombies never feel like a legitimate threat, and a plot device used later on in the series feels all but shoehorned in in an effort to give the plot more depth. Meanwhile, the moe aspect of the series lacks as well, as characters come off more as annoying than cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAside from Miki, the viewers learn next to nothing about any of the characters, making it very hard to emotionally invest in any of them. Their reliance on one another becoming the driving force behind what makes them want to make it out alive. The girls actively try to keep Yuki from losing it, and she returns the favor, although she doesn't realize it. This is about as far as the characters come. They just aren't interesting enough to the viewer to care about them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes of this series are very good, and show what this series could have been had it focused on just the Psychological side of things. Instead it ends up being a series that had potential and a good concept, but is relatively forgettable. \\n",

There was very little tension or stress in the majority of the episodes. Little exploration of how the characters respond to their predicament besides on a shallow level. They had a cool thing going on with one of the girls. I would've liked to seen how the other girls cope with maintaining a facade of normality around her while dealing with survival related stress and hormones. There was really no character development for half of the major characters despite a majority of the episodesdedicated to telling their backstories.\\n\\n\r\nFelt like a moe blob slice of life with some zombies. This took me off guard a bit because I came into watching this expecting a lot of psychological horror. Still mildly enjoyable but it could've been more.",

            "content": "Before I start to review, I highly recommend you go watch at-least the first episode of School-Live! Because this review will spoil the first episode. This anime in general is full of surprises, it looks simply on the outside, but the story has a deeper meaning to it.\r\nThe Video Review is up on my Channel, but here is the written Review.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nOur story starts as 4 generic moe school girls are spending their time at school. There is an airhead, tomboy, serious girl and a big sister, also there is a dog. Sounds pretty generic so far, here is the twist, they form theSchool Living Club meaning they live at their school. Wait why do they live at their school? Everything seems fine at the start, but then reality kicks and it turns out these girls are living in a zombie apocalypse. How\u2019s that for a twist.  The story tells the beautiful and hopeful story of 4 girls trying to enjoy their last days of school. What I mean is despite, the circumstances the girls live in, they try to go on about their lives as normal as possible as if nothing happens, and it tells this beautiful story that no matter how bad things are, there is always hope. The reason why the girls try to act normal as possible, is because Yuki has pretty much lost it, and decides to not to see the reality of all the bad things, however, because of her joyous personality, the other girls play along with her, as it also gives them that needed break from the horrors.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story is not told exactly in order, so the pacing feels off, but at the same time it felt like it was done on purpose to really throw us off. There is a mixture of light hearted plots to more serious intense plots, but during the light hearted moments, it really feels like it was dragging on, because the interesting parts of the plot are during the dark and serious times. Also the ending felt too convenient, and there is quite a bit of plot holes in the ending, but overall the story is executed very well, with twists and turns.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Yuki Takeya, a cheerful, airheaded childish girl. Funny enough she is oldest out all the main girls, and she is an upperclassmen, while the others a underclassmen. The biggest difference about her character is that she doesn\u2019t see the world for it is, and still thinks everything is normal in her eyes, and the first episode pulled this off perfectly, as we got to see what Yuki sees before we the reality of the world. She doesn\u2019t possess any particular talent, but her presence is much needed for the rest of the group, as she provides the them with relief, as they take a break from the apocalypse. And I love her character development, because as the show goes on, she starts to notice reality as we draw closer to the conclusion, and it\u2019s plainly visible how strong she grows, after her initial appearance.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi Ebisuzawa, aka best girl, is the tomboy of the group. While also being the dedicated badass. She is usually sent on doing the more dangerous stuff, because she is quickest to adapt to the situation. With her trusty shovel, she protects the group from the zombies. I love how she is shown to be the strongest one of the group, which she is, but she is also at the same time vulnerable, because deep down, she is still just a young girl, and we get to see what breaks her.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri Wakasa plays the big sister role of the School Living Club, while also the club\u2019s president. She acts as all motherly towards everyone, as she is usually very calm and mature. She cooks for everyone and keeps all their supplies and resources in check. Even though she puts up a strong and resilient front, when she breaks down, she really breaks down mentally; she is probably, surprisingly the most unstable member of group.\\n\\n\r\nMiki Naoki, is the last member of the School Living club, as she joined last. Her past is revealed later along the line. She plays the role of the straight girl, she doesn\u2019t understand Yuki\u2019s situation entirely and is confused whenever around her. When the group first picks up Miki, she is initially shy and fragile, however over the course, she gains more confidence around her, as she finds something to fight for, and realises what she has. \\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters are Taomaru a dog, the group picked up along with Miki. And Megumi Sakura, their teacher, who suggested the idea of forming the club in the first place. I love the fact that all the characters play a role of helping each other out, and it\u2019s those interactions really bring out the best of each character, and it shows how their relationship affects their decisions and personalities. I love the fact we get to see what breaks the characters, because these girl\u2019s put on a deceiving cute, cheerful front. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that is very noticeable about the art style is that it\u2019s really deceiving and clever. The characters and world is drawn in a very cutesy and moe art. The characters all look moe, and it\u2019s very contradicting to the whole apocalypse atmosphere. What I love about the art is how it separates Yuki, from everything else. Something noticeable is Yuki\u2019s outfit, which bright pink whereas the others a green, and if you were to index them, the green outfits become pink, while the pink becomes green, it\u2019s so cleverly done and hidden. Unfortunately there is not a lot of zombie action, in fact the majority of the time, you don\u2019t see the zombie clearly. Again this also done cleverly, the zombies are covered in black clouds at first, but as the anime goes on towards the end, they become clearer, indicating that Yuki, is drawing closer to reality, and it\u2019s amazing how they did that with the art. There are simple animations, but the art style in general, is all they really need to give impact. The only thing I don\u2019t like what the animation decides to do from time to time is show fan service, especially if it\u2019s either supposed to be an emotion scene or just for the sake of doing it, because, the art style does not benefit from fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe score of anime is ok, and it does its job, there is some nice soothing music along the line, but nothing really stands out and adds to the atmosphere of scenes. The opening is quite enjoyable if you like upbeat music, it\u2019s very cute and upbeat which is a contrast to the show in general, however, I do like how the opening animation changes each time as we draw closer to the finale. The endings are a much slower paced and fits very well with the show. Both song have this sad vibe towards them, but at the same time it lifts your hopes up, and somewhat becomes a happy song about hope. And I love that about endings, giving signs of hope.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first I did not care that this anime looked cute and moe, because I don\u2019t mind the art style at all. But the fact that they were able to surprise me from the very first episode with that twist, I was all in to watch every episode as soon as it came out. Because I really want to know how these girls are surviving. And at the same time it tells a beautiful story of hope. There is quite a bit of slice of life moments, which can drag on, leaving you waiting for the more interesting serious parts of the show. But I would consider the genre a slice of life first, before it\u2019s a supernatural horror. The characters are really entertaining to watch, and it\u2019s good to see how each one of them develop over the course of the anime, by trying to survive in their dire situation. Even though the slice of life moments drag on sometimes, they are much needed to show us that their still hope, even facing dangerous situation. And I love this anime for that.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8.5\\n\\n\r\nAs we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 9. Because the story is beautiful and I love stories about hope. The fact the twist at episode 1 pulled me into the show immediately. It\u2019s definitely an interesting and unique concept, that pulls off their twists very cleverly. There are moments that drag, and the ending felt a bit overly convenient, but it\u2019s still a good story in general.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 7. The animation and art style is cleverly done, contrasting the moe art style to the horror theme. The way they show Yuki\u2019s vision is done so cleverly as well. The animation is simple and there is a quite a bit of unnecessary fan service. The soundtrack is nothing special, and nothing really stands out. But I love the upbeat opening, and the sad to happy endings of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 9 from me. Every character is shown a soft side, but they are also shown a weak side. And they all play part in each other\u2019s lives and given plenty of development of the course, by showing all their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. From the very episode twist, I was hooked onto the show. I like my moe once in a while, but when they throw this wrench in my face, I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes of screen and was excited for every episode every week. I love stories about hope, and the characters development was very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score after rounding it up, I give School-Live! an awesome score 8.5/10. It was my  favourite anime of the Summer 2015 season. I recommend this anime to any fans of the moe genre, because despite the twist, it has enough elements from that genre to be enjoyable. I recommend this anime fans who are looking for a story of hope and supernatural fans at the same time. It\u2019s not necessarily a horror, but it has elements to it which adds to the atmosphere.",

            "content": "I daren't write too much as the bottom line is this is a fairly gimmicky and unremarkable slice-of-life show. It's certainly not the first anime to try and contrast cute girls and horror. It might be the first zombie apocalypse slice-of-life show, though I wouldn't quote me on that. The first episode has a predictable bait-and-switch setup. It initially seems like a cutesy slice-of-life comedy where four young girls do fun things as part of the school life club, but it's revealed that the fun atmosphere is all part of the main character, Takeya Yuki's, delusion, and most of the club's activities are for survivalor distraction in the midst of a zombie apocalypse which has left them stranded in a school swarmed by the walking dead. There are a few other twists thrown into the story, which you don't need precognition to anticipate, but ultimately this is simply your typical cute girls doing cute things show, where in this case not everything that happens to the girls in question is good.\\n\\n\r\nSo why dare I give this a 5, and not a 4 or a 3? That's because of the presentation. I wasn't joking in my Ranpo Kitan review that Lerche seemed to put more effort into the production of this anime than the mystery author tribute. They seemed to put some thought into how they could visually represent the differences between 'reality' and Yuki's deluded version of it, and that extends to changes in the OP and ED animations as the series goes on. Also, while the setup is gimmicky and honestly stupid, it does result in some more in-depth development of the girls' personalities that makes it more engaging to watch than it would otherwise be.",

            "content": "I'm going to say it now, Gakkougurashi has only been popular because it's not something that you would expect from a moe looking show. The strong contrast between the character design and the world building is what helped gain its popularity. \r\nIn terms of story and it's development, there isn't much to go along. It is very restricted to a \"slice of life\" theme. Although I am  going to admit that I was surprised by a few plot twists/ revelations. I am hoping that there will be a second season because like most 12-episode long anime, this one is open-ended.\r\nNow, onto the characters. Ifound myself not liking the main protagonist, Yuki. I get it, she has a psychological condition and she's the sunshine amidst their storm but she is the most unreliable idiot ever. I know! She's written like that. It's supposed to be cute and endearing. Well it's not. I feel sorry for Kurumi, Rii and Miki for always ALWAYS keeping her ass out of danger. I don't really mind the other characters but for some reason they remind me of K-On! Yuki is the more annoying version of Yui; Rii for Mugi; Kurumi for Ritsu and Miki is a mix of Azusa and Mio. I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nNext let's talk about the animation and art style. Scratching the rage inducing Yuki, I think the art is garbage on this one. I just don't know if I got the censored version but would it kill the creators to do a proper zombie instead of just animating a dark aura around them? Too me it's a little (LOT) lazy. Most of the scene where there are a lot of zombies are also blurry/ out of focus. Come on! I think I can handle a little gore. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, is the anime good? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, because I admit that some of the scenes are very heartbreaking to watch. I didn't expect to bawl my eyes out in the last two episodes but I did. No, because of the lazy animation, lack of character and story development. \\n\\n\r\nIf you watch Gakkougurashi without knowing that it is a deconstructed slice of life then the anime might blow you away. But since I knew from the start that it is not what it seems I kind of raised my expectations a little higher and got disappointed. (So yeah, I might have spoiled myself the enjoyment of this anime)",

I don't know anything about the manga, other then it differs slightly, but I wished the anime hadn't been as vanilla on the whole as it was.  Compare this to similar shows like Higurashi and Yuki Yuna, I felt that this anime got the moe girls combined withthe 'wtf' moments down, but failed to maintain it's strength over the entire show.  It kept swapping between very mundane slice of life moments, to small glimpses of the psychological horror genre.  \\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching the story evolve, from the changes from the first episode opening to the seconds, and the tiny details you notice (like the roof in episode one) when you re-watch it.  \\n\r\nOn the whole, it was okay but there was a sense of a slight letdown that it wasn't as crazy as it could have been.  I wish that the following scenario had happened, but it might have been in the manga and could be included in a season 2?\\n\r\n-----SPOILERS------ \\n\r\nI really wanted the big reveal to be that the main character killed all her zombie classmates and that's what caused her to withdraw and hallucinate because she didn't want to remember.  I think it would have made the show much more intense, and I felt them leaving was a cop-out ending because it didn't actually resolve anything in the overall plot.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nSchool Live put's together two things that I thought wouldn't really work and they are moe and horror yeah not exactly a great combination yet somehow School Live made it work pretty damn well.\r\nThe story begins with Yuki Takeya and her friends who are part of the School Living Club  so basically they live at school however underneath the cute exterior there is a more darker situation happening around them.\r\nFirst off let me start by saying this show will in some cases mindfu*k you because the first episode was executed perfectly it made me think this was just a cute girl's anime,but no the end shows the real world in a zombie apocalypse which was definitely a surprise.\\n\r\nDespite the moe aspect you get from the girls this can be a suspenseful anime since they are school girls it's going to be difficult taking on zombies especially when those zombies used to be your friends and classmates so seeing this group of characters taking upon the challenge of surviving this nightmare was genuinely terrifying, luckily since they are moe looking girls there are moments when the show goes into that cute mood, but it always reminds you of the dark life they have to survive in.\\n\r\nThe story does take it's time to develop giving us episodes of the girls or some of them messing around while avoiding Zombies, but it also gives us backstory on specific characters too since the group wasn't always like this from the get go and as the story progresses it gets darker and darker as the girls start finding out that the Government and even the school knew this was going to happen eventually which is why their school was so well equipped for such an event.\\n\r\nI like how the story also takes a different kind of approach with the Zombies as most zombie shows like High School of the Dead show them as vicious monsters whereas School Live shows them in a way where the zombies actually react to certain things like when Yuki announces for all the students to go home the zombies actually left the school which shows that they have some kind of memory from before they were turned into zombies, this was something that really interested me since we haven't seen zombies shown in a way like this very often.\\n\\n\r\nNow there aren't a huge array of characters and all of them are female which is interesting seeing as their school girls you shouldn't expect them to go on a killing rampage so instead they try the best they can to survive with what they have.\\n\r\nYuki Takeya is the main girl and is the most unusual of the group, she loves school and is pretty the glue that keeps the group together, she has a very positive personality always coming up with ideas to make everyone feel happy especially when the mood feels down however behind that happy face is a very traumatised girl who has created her own illusions where all the damage and carnage doesn't exist to her and she thinks that everything is still normal, she is a pretty complex character and does go through a lot of stuff, but you can't help respect her happy attitude in a dead world.\\n\r\nYuuri Wakasa is the president of the School Living Club, she pretty much takes care of the living jobs like cooking, electricity and even lessons, her personality is very calm and mature though serious as she cares greatly for the others although there are times when she does get angry when Yuki or the others start messing around.\\n\r\nKurumi Ebisuzawa is the one who does the more dangerous missions like taking on Zombies or even driving a car, you'll never see her without a shovel which everyone jokes is her boyfriend however she is a mature girl and acts very calm even in difficult situations which the others look up to since she is one who does all the fighting for them, though like Yuki in some ways she is also scarred from the horror's she's seen yet carries on fighting instead of putting a barrier around her.\\n\r\nMiki Naoki is the newest member of the group, she originally wasn't with the group instead she was holed up in a mall with her friend until the others found her, Miki is a kind and shy girl though finds it difficult to put up with Yuki's illusions yet she is close friends with her as Yuki calls her Mi-Kun since she is older and tries to act mature for her so she can make her happy.\\n\r\nTaroumaru is the clubs pet who was found just shortly before Miki as he had holed up with her until he wandered off and found the others which he lead to Miki, he is definitely a free spirit often running around and causing havoc for the others, but he is a loyal friend and has even helped them multiple times.\\n\r\nMegumi Sakura is the club advisor and the only teacher left in the school, she is a sweet person and originally lead the girls after the apocalypse started, she is highly looked up to by Yuki and teaches her from time to time along with keeping the others in check.\\n\r\nSadly since this a zombie show there are deaths, not gonna reveal who dies, but I would keep a look out because it can be pretty sad when someone does end up dying.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle surprisingly worked despite the character models being in the moe criteria it actually fitted with the whole horror setting and probably made it more terrifying because you wouldn't want to see cute girls being torn apart by zombies, the detailing between the illusions and the real life was really good and terrifying as seeing a squeaky clean room suddenly turn into a blooded mess would send shivers down my spine sometimes, the school was nicely designed too as you had the normal areas where the girls usually were and then you had a secret area that they didn't know about which reminded me a lot of secret areas you see in zombie games like Resident Evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe horror, mystery and Psychological aspects were done very well because these 3 mix in together to give you a pretty confusing time as there are multiple points that make you think is this real or is that real and a prime example is Yuki's illusions which for the first half really do throw you off especially when it shows Megumi who is a big part of these illusions, but you eventually come to understand why Yuki does this, whenever the anime does show zombies it mainly keeps them silhouetted or has a gloomy blaze around them which does make them pretty scary whenever the girls encounter them.\\n\\n\r\nThe school and Slice of Life aspects help to give you a breather from the horror moments, but these parts can be genuinely sweet and entertaining because you really see the connection these girls have along with the different feelings they go through as they question the life their in and whether it'll get better so you really become attached to these characters and really hope things get better for them, although this aspect is a little ruined by the sneaky bits of fanservice put in like random underwear being shown and a pool episode, I like my fanservice, but in this style it just doesn't fit I mean this isn't High School of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a great zombie type anime that really delves into the psychological impact it can have on people and the horrors they have to go through, so if you're looking for an interesting zombie show that also has cute girls then you'll probably enjoy this.",

            "content": "\"School is the greatest thing ever\"\r\nGakkougurashi, or the much easier to say School-Live, is a fun, happy anime about the antics of four high school girls, their teacher, and a pet dog, as they participate in their club, where the only rule is that they cant leave the school. But that's okay, because they have lots of food, water, a swimming pool, a garden on the roof, and tons of space to run around in. The school is set up wonderfully for people to live in round the clock, it has solar power in case the power grid goes down, its own water filtration system,and a fun science room. \\n\r\nThis anime has some really good characters, including\\n\r\nYuki: The carefree character that just wants to have fun and LOVES school\\n\r\nShovel Girl: She carries around a shovel everywhere she goes, surprisingly nobody says anything to her about that\\n\r\nLeader girl: The Club president, runs the garden and cooks the meals, makes everything run smoothly\\n\r\nBook Girl: A new recruit to the group, is getting used to their situations and Yuki's antics\\n\r\nMeegu na: The adviser for the club, she does all the paperwork to keep everything official. She is the voice of reason for Yuki, but is mostly ignored by the other characters.\\n\r\nDoggo: He runs around and gets into mischief, he can even open doors and interrupts classes.\\n\r\nThe intro is pretty good, the slight changes throughout the anime break it away from the normal \"cute girls doing cute things\" intros that just show off the characters and call it good.\\n\r\nIve watched this anime twice, and it is much better the second time around, once you know all of its secrets, it makes the whole thing much better to watch from the beginning and see how the anime works around those secrets and makes them actually obvious if you know what your looking for. \\n\r\nSometimes I do think that this school is a little over prepared though, its like they built this thing to survive a apocalypse or something.\\n\r\nWas a 7, now an 8/10 after watching it again. \\n\r\nBut don't worry about the girls, I'm sure they are doing fine.",

I normally don't cry with anime but the ending did make like 2 tears go down my eyes. With that being said, the ending left a big cliffhanger and a lot of questions were left unanswered. I don't like anime that do that to me...>.< WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME!\r\nanyways, back to the review....\r\nMy biggest completewith this anime is it's \"slice of life\" genre. I don't like the slice of life genre because it gets boring for me pretty easily. I will admit though, that school live balances out the slice of live genre's pretty well with it's other genres. Even though I don't like the slice of live genre, all the other genres in this anime had me hook. I just had to know what the heck happened.

This anime has a mix of slice of life with survival all at once. This anime was misleading for me, the majority of the times it wasslice of life rather then being much more realistic of the current situation which I did not enjoy.

            "content": "Let me start off this review by saying straight off the bat that I'm a fan of the Slice of Life genre but I'm not into moe. (Heck, I dropped K-On early on! Generally, I just need something more than just  cute girls doing cute things.) The only way this could have appealed to me is knowing the twist that's brilliantly setup and revealed in the first episode. So yes, I didn't go into this blind but this is the kind of show you can enjoy watching even after knowing about its twists and ends.\r\nTo begin with the aspects I definitely liked from theshow: First, the characters. While the main character, Yuki, does get annoying and grating in the beginning. Like Miki, possibly the most level-headed character on the show, she will start to grow on you. With only a cast of 4-5 people, it would be pretty hard to mess up giving them character development in the span of 12 episodes. Fortunately, Gakkougurashi! knows how to show their personalities in it all. I would have liked to learn more about Yuuri (since Miki, Kurumi, and Yuki had their own time to shine so to speak) but while her backstory wasn't completely divulged, the middle-latter part of the series gave us a solid look into how she thinks and her personality. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, can we talk about the soundtrack? It's not the usual kind that I generally rave about but the sound design and soundtrack is just so well-done in this series. When it's not being its usual peppy self, there's a Corpse Party or rather horror J-RPG game feel to it that's very fitting. Not to mention, in certain scenes where the background music is dropped or slowed down to a disturbing tempo and tone, it just gives me the chills! It heightened the mood and feel of the series, that's for sure. I wondered before how horror anime can scare me, while I didn't exactly get scared shitless from this one, it's definitely eerie and unsettling. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the story! I loved the premise and definitely wasn't disappointed with how its executed. It was a blend of cutesy SoL (which I learned that I later didn't mind too much,) and a bleak post-apocalyptic vibe to it. Honestly, if it were up to me, I'd like more of the latter rather than the former as I feel like it weighs the story down a bit pacing-wise. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some moments when I wanted to slap the club members upright in the head and say \"Is this really the time for this?!\" but it's part of its charm. I would have ranked it higher and liked it even more if after the reveal, there was more seriousness introduced early on instead of easing us into it by the middle of the season. But I liked the second half for what it is when they delved further into how each character survived and why their school is the way it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm glad I took the time to watch this series. It has been recommended to me a few times and they're pretty much spot-on with the recommendation. If you're anything like me who is looking for something more than just \"cute\" (there's this one scene that broke me in the series where I just went \"k-k-kawaii!!!\" though so beware!) and who are fans of seeing people survive in bleak post-apocalyptic settings, then watch this!\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely not a perfect show (the pacing can be frustrating but it's not too bad - I'm just not really a fan of the cutesy stuff) but it will entertain, make you laugh, break your heart, and even make you cry. Will it be memorable? Not entirely. But in the end, it's a good watch!",

Then when the anime came out I was excited too see it translated onto screen but then as it started getting later into the episodes I gradually go more disappointed as it changed the story from how it originally was (there was already changes but i let them slide), then I found myself enjoying it less and less.\r\nThis is by far a series which would be better enjoyed withoutreading the source material and then reading it after if you want a continuation, it somehow in its animated version made some of the characters unbearable and changed its own characterisations, but on a plus side it had decent animation/art with a nice soundtrack and an upbeat and enjoyable opening song, it even managed too portray some scenes in an excellent way which made me want too rate it a 6, but it had too much moe, yes i know its moe girls with zombies the series but they were supposed too be in their late teens but just how it was portrayed and the odd fanservice just made the viewing slower when I wanted more explanation on the world they were in.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I believe it had a lot of potential too live up too its original but poor filler and writing left it feeling lackluster and like there should have been more. But if you love moe filler with a dash of disturbing scenes with zombies I'd suggest you watch this.",

            "content": "I had a lot of faith in this show that it would go above and beyond in blending the generic slice of life school show with it's zombie/apocalyptic twist. I was extremely wrong and I argue every story beat works against it, you either get a dark and seemingly tense episode or something cutesy for people to jack off to. The story was very generic but I enjoyed the unique things like Yuki's amnesia/hallucination thing, I don't know exactly what it is called but I know I haven't seen it before in anime (ironic), but if it wasn't just an excuse to spurt out aboring cutesy episode like where they have a party at their roof pool(?) then I'm sure it could've been interesting. And the fact that the school was almost entirely self sufficient and somehow knew about this disaster, that wasn't explored at all either. We get all these tidbits of information that you expect to learn more about and maybe even want to but they're completely forgotten as the story progresses. There was unbelieveable potential in this show that unfortunately probably didn't care less about it.",

            "content": "The Gakkougurashi! one of those waste of time anime. It tries to show children and teenagers psychology on stressful situations it even emphasis it over typical apocalyptic survival zombie genre. If you came to watch how zombies take over the world you will be really disappointed.\r\nAlso what was really bad, the story line wasn't a linear one, lots of flashbacks, and some episodes should even really be at the beginning of anime. Instead the authors understood that their baby was really bad and tried to hide under the a cover of flashbacks.\r\nElse, lots of wasting time, they could had made it a lot shorter. Ieven had to skip forward some scenes, they were showing nothing of significance.\\n\\n\r\nSurprise surprise, I was betting who would die first and I lost my bet rly rly bad... Asking zombies not to kill and listening to their pledge was so lame... omg... omg ...\\n\\n\r\nLast and not least, the ending was a disaster.... They could had just be \"done\"! with everyone, instead they did a complete reverse and want to go for season 2. Rly wtf with this ending....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
