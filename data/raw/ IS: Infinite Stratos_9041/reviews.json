            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nIS: Infinite Stratos..\r\nIf my Greek isn't so rusty, I would confidently say that \"Stratos\" means \"Skies\"\r\nBut after watching this anime for the first time, I could conclude that Stratos actually means \"Harem\" \r\nWhy? Because when you're the only guy in a girl school, THERE'S INFINITE HAREMS POSSIBLES! Thus they should rename this anime to Infinite Harems!\r\nNow to tell you the truth, I was a bit reluctant to watch this. Oh sure, harem turns me on, like any normal guy, but mecha genre really turns me off.\r\nBut after looking through the mecha suit design, \"Hey! You can still see the girls! They're notcovered under huge piles of metal!\" So I decided to give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nWow... Was I wrong about this being a whole mecha genre. They focused more on the harem part! What proof do I have you ask?? Other than the fact he is the only guy?? Well in the ending, they add every new girl he added to his \"harem\" running along with him. HOW DOES THIS NOT SHOW THAT THE ANIME IS GOING TOWARDS THE DIVINE HAREM ROUTE!\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is up to date with your standard mecha genre anime so I see no disappointment there for those who loves mecha with a harem. No, not mecha sex you perverts! And don't you go googling \"Inyoku Tokkyuu Zetsurinou\" or \"Dyogrammaton\" neither!\\n\r\nNothing to add about sound, it's well balanced.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, onward to the characters! The main aspect of every harem animes! \\n\\n\r\n-Male lead who walks into girl while changing [CHECK] \\n\r\n-Dense Male Harem lead [CHECK] \\n\r\n(If all the guys were dense like the typical male harem leads, we wouldnt need birth control)\\n\r\n-Childhood friend who is likely to be friendzoned by the producers cause somehow anime directors hate Childhood friends [CHECK] x2\\n\r\n-High class lady with a high ego whom parodies western people [CHECK]\\n\r\n(Why do some japanese people think Westerners are all egoistic? Who knows *rolls eyes*)\\n\r\n-A hyper active and high pitched girl with an attitude [MAYBE EVENTUALLY]\\n\r\n-Chinese girl wannabe with a chinese restaurant (Macross frontier reference??) [CHECK]\\n\r\n-TSUNDERE!!! [CHECK]\\n\r\n-YANDERE!!!! [HOPE NOT O_o]\\n\r\n-Glasses Girl [CHECK] \\n\r\n(Well his teacher might go into his harem for all you know!)\\n\r\n-Bossy older sister who is good at everything [CHECK]\\n\r\n-Fangirls of the bossy older sister who are Yuri-able [CHECK]\\n\r\n-The three musketeers! Or the three girls who always appears as background characters! [CHECK]\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo???? [WOULD BE RIDICULOUS IN A MECHA ANIME BUT WHO KNOWS???]\\n\r\n-Girl crossplaying as a guy with the ability to change very fast due to the fact she has flat chest.. [CHECK]\\n\r\n(Correction: My friend corrected me that in the future, technology is so advance, that breasts can be compressed)]\\n\r\nIm not being sexist here. I think it's a good thing women are advance and inventing machines....\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the criticism, this anime is enjoyable if you just wanna watch something haremic (Yes I invented that word!) but with a touch of action, mecha specificly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, for all you harem lover who enjoys imagining themselves in a school full of girls and you're the only guy then this is the anime for you!\\n\r\nEven if you do get a renob like me by watching mecha animes. (Oh please don't google renob up...)\\n\r\nFor you mecha lovers out there, this might be a disappointment but fear not, every season, new mecha animes are coming in so there's still hope! So put down that gun.. Yes.. slowly, put it down.. Sit back.. and relax...",

            "content": "One of the problems with the anime industry is the tendency to overuse stereotypes and themes, and many of the studios in Japan continue to operate under the idea that the shows they create will generate a profit in some manner (regardless of the content), through DVD sales or merchandise. The sad fact is that many producers barely break even from one season to the next, which then prompts arguments of piracy, licensing, pricing, distribution costs, etc, all of which seems more than a little strange as while it may appear that the studios have some perfectly valid arguments, they've neglected to talk about onething - the anime they make.\\n\\n\r\nEvery season viewers are subjected to a barrage of average or substandard fare that serves no other purpose than mindless juvenile media, yet these shows continue to be made because the entertainment industries always prefer the safe bet over a \"risky\" venture. That said, there are always one or two anime that manage to rise above mediocrity, but there's still a very large gap between being good, and being great.\\n\\n\r\nIS  is, first and foremost, a reasonably popular ongoing light novel series by Yumizuru Izuru that began publication in May 2009. Six volumes have already been released under the MF Bunko J label (part of Media Factory), and the seventh is due out in April 2011. In May 2010 a manga adaptation by Akahoshi Kenji began serialisation in Monthly Comic Alive, with production on the anime adaptation beginning later that year.\\n\\n\r\nSet in the near future, the story initially seems to be about powered exoskeletons called Infinite Stratos, an advanced piece of technology that is more powerful than any existing weaponry, but can only be used by girls and women. Because of this, society and the world have had to adapt so that females are now in authority, but all of that changes when Orimura Ichika, a 15 year old student, is found to be the only male in the world with the ability to pilot the machines. Because of this, and for his own protection, he is forced to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy.\\n\\n\r\nSeems a pretty straightforward set up right?\\n\\n\r\nIn fact this show is so straightforward and predictable it verges on being dull. Aside from being a light novel/manga adaptation (which seems to be the rage these days), the storyline is about as generic as one can get in anime, with almost every stereotype and \"popular\" theme on display. The plot initially seems intriguing until one realises that the whole concept of Infinite Stratos is nothing more than an excuse to put a \"special\" teenaged guy in a school full of hormone crazed girls, and let them have fun with each other. The storyline is only peripherally about the problems resulting from the development of the Infinite Stratos machines as they never really come to the fore until towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are only the surface issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is limited in terms of design as many aspects of the visuals are adapted directly from the manga. Unfortunately this doesn't really do the show any favours as aside from a degree of futurism in the backgrounds and the conceptualisation of the exoskeletal armours, everything else is the epitome of genericism. The big book of harem characters has been used extensively for pretty much everyone, with all of the lead roles looking more like cardboard cut-outs that would readily grace any other generic high school anime of this type. Granted there is a degree of facial expression, but that's not enough to raise the character design in any measurable way.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully there are two areas where the visuals actually manage to pass muster. The backgrounds are coloured and detailed rather well, but there are some scenes where the quality improves dramatically in order to focus the viewer's attention on the action. In addition to that, the animation is pretty good throughout the series, but the quality work only really comes to the fore during sequences of IS combat.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where Infinite Stratos does manage to attain a degree of respectability is the acting, but even that's not really saying much. After all, this is a harem romantic comedy with some science fiction and fanservice thrown in for good measure, so viewers shouldn't expect Shakespeare. It's surprising then, that Uchiyama Kouki actually manages to play the role of Ichika rather well, and the same could also be said of Hikasa Youko et al in the roles of the girls who want to find out how well Ichika can use his weapon.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, all of the exclamations, weird noises, mannerisms, and changes of pitch and tone that one would associate with this type of show are on offer, but while they're handled rather well by the seiyuu, there's simply too little going on for them to really show off their talents. The main reason for this is the mundane script, and viewers may find themselves suffering from bouts of deja vu during specific scenes, especially if they've recently watched any other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the background tracks are nice enough and there is some variety to be had thanks to the composition skills of Nanase Hikaru, but the problems lie in the choreography, and more importantly, the relevance. There are occasions where the score seems out of place with the on screen action, and while this is due to a slight error in the timing in some cases, more often it's because the background music simply doesn't mesh with the scene. This is also true for the opening theme, Straight Jet by Kuribayashi Minami, which already has difficulty standing out since it's a pretty standard J-pop affair so the last thing it needed was poor choreography. As for the ending theme, Super Stream, this generic little ditty is sung by the actress of whichever female character is managing to keep up with the manliness of Ichika during the credit sequence, while the other female seiyuu performing backing vocals.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of manliness, it should come as no surprise that there's little in the way of it here, but then this is justified to a degree by the fact that Infinite Stratos features a female dominated society. Ichika is the typical harem lead who doesn't seem to have a clue that so many girls like him, especially as he has very few redeeming features and a slight complex about his older sister, and in true harem fashion he even forgets or misunderstands childhood promises so the story can have that little bit more drama.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just him.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are just as poor when it comes to characterisation, although thinking about it, maybe poor isn't the right word. They fit into the story rather well, they may look like cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime but they do retain some individuality. They can be annoyingly self centred and stupid, but they're supposed to be hormone crazed teenaged girls so maybe that's normal (apologies if you're a hormone crazed teenaged girl who doesn't act self centred and stupid).\\n\\n\r\nOh wait. Most of them are supposed to be tsundere characters (all of them except the one with the short blond hair in fact), so maybe poor was the right word after all.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little in the way of actual character development as the derived and contrived nature of the plot and story doesn't really allow for any great introspection from any of the roles. There are many potential opportunities to push the characters in a totally new direction, but these are not taken as the whole series is less about telling a good story, and more about cashing in on the harem bandwagon.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of its flaws, Infinite Stratos will undoubtedly find a home in the hearts of some viewers, which is perfectly fine if you like this type of show, and to be honest much of the series is reasonably inoffensive, especially if the viewer has managed to sit through any other harem anime. That said, it should be pointed out that the concept of the story had the potential for being something special. The idea of a society dominated by women due to the development of a new weapon offers up questions of gender roles, societal balance, political machinations, technological advancements, etc, etc, all of which are treated as minor annoyances that get in the way of finding out which girl Ichika is going to choose.\\n\\n\r\nGranted there are some good points to be found in various aspects of the series, but these are outweighed by a lacklustre storyline, poor characterisation, and an overall sense that everything has been done before.",

            "content": "With the dawn of the second season, I think it's time to revisit an old friend. In this review, I will attempt to describe IS: Infinite Stratos and it's components, then give you it's worth as a series.\r\nThe basic premise of Infinite Stratos is set in a world where armored mecha suit, the Infinite Stratos is invented, thus rendering all other technology obsolete. One catch, this suit can only be worn by women.\r\nWhile this was an interesting premise, the setting itself just attracts questions. Why can only women wear it? What has the effects of this technology had on society? What happened to the politicalrelations of the world after this technology? What governments has used it?\\n\\n\r\nSadly, none of these questions are satisfyingly answered, because the next portion of the premise is going to make the TRUE premise apparent. While the original premise demanded world-exploration and examination, none of that is shown because the series basically only sets in one place: IS Academy. The place where Students aspiring to learn the techniques of IS from all over the world, where the armor/suit is used as an entertainment device(I will get to this later).\\n\\n\r\nOur Main Character is Ichika Orimura, an average High School student and the only male on the planet so far to discovered to have had the capability to use Infinite Stratos. And because of circumstances, he has to head to IS Academy, a place where he will be the only man.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of this setup, the show faithfully follows the route to harem, where 90% of the girls wants the Main Character's D, otherwise is interested(and certainly the main protagonists). Since it sets itself up as a Harem series, what is should do is explore the characters who are complex and makes us care for them, let's see the components of this series:\\n\\n\r\nCoherency/Continunity: While the series sets itself up as a series that begs exploration of the world's politics and what happened in the world after the invention of IS, this is merely a setup where the main character can have a school full of girls all to himself.\\n\r\nThe idea that women started to dominate the world is hardly ever shown, since the show secludes itself in the IS Academy. Where contrary to common sense, depicts females just about every other Harem series does! I will get into the characters later. The main point is, the social/political changes is shown without any changes!\\n\r\nAnd the fact that IS is a weapon(more powerful than any, mind you) begs the question on why has it not been used militarily? A weapon this powerful would have the government SCRAMBLING for it, and certainly not only used as an entertainment device(LOLWUT?). The idea if that if it is women who controls it would lead to world peace is completely illogical and is given as a fact. Any person has the power to commit evil, and being a part of a gender does not exclude you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The worst aspect of the series are the characters. Virtually all but one of the female cast is depicted as a Tsundere, and often violent too and nothing outside her stereotype. Rin the Chinese girl and Houki the Japanese girl are basically the same in terms of personality. While Cecilia the British girl have nothing really defines her other than \"Ojou-sama\" type of character. The only one that is not depicted as a Tsundere is Charlotte, whom is wonderful.\\n\r\nAnd the main character? About as generic as you get, and so dense that you can't even find it on the periodic table. Ichika is a self-insert character that has to deal with the woes of \"GIRLS ALL AROUND ME! OH NOEZ!!\" Difficult to achieve an level of empathy to and overall a dumbass to peoples' feelings to an unrealistic degree.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: The production of the series is relative above average. By no means is it bad. but the sound is rather generic and nothing I could remember to write home about, although the opening song was somewhat memorable. The character designs are generic by today's standards, again, nothing to write to home about. Although there are several prominent Seiyuus acting in the characters, such as Kana Hanazawa. But obvious incoherencies is show, such as one episode, a character fights the main character but is somehow stopped by Chifuyu's sword... Out of nowhere\\n\r\nBeing a mecha anime, there are also fight-scenes featuring the Infinite Stratos'. Probably the best part of the series, unfortunately, are short, insignificant, and CGI-animated\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Wait, what? Oh, the plot. Simply put, there isn't much other than a string of events that puts Ichika in various situations where the main characters fall in love with him. Infinite Stratos, as well as the expected consequences of it existing, is not a part of the plot. A random IS does show up and destroy stuff, but next episode, that is no longer a worry.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nIf you are here looking for a good plot that maps out the consequences of it's premise, turn around. If you are here looking for an above average harem story with quality characters, go elsewhere. Truthfully, without the ridiculously unnecessarily armored IS, this series is just a generic RomCom Harem series that is barely funny at all.\\n\r\nThere are bunch of holes in the plot and story. If you are looking for fanservice and cute girls(relatively) or Charlotte Dunois with a splash of CGI-animated Mecha fighting, come right in.\\n\\n\r\nADDITIONALLY:\\n\r\nIf there's one thing thats also great about this series, it's that the series does not pretend to be deep or anything that it is not, making it far less cringeworthy for some viewers to enjoy.",

            "content": "There are many ways to describe your own thoughts about an anime: you might say you liked it, you might say you hated it or you might say it's Infinite Stratos.\r\nInfinite Stratos is a major example of what a series about love, action, robots and comedy would look like if you were to remove the action robo-love comedy parts. Still, there are invisible quantic panties so yeah, that's science and storytelling for you.\r\nAs for the plot, it all revolves around naked girls and some kind of powerful lethal war machine that can only be used by naked girls called Infinite Stratos. You might wonder howthis is even possible to produce without anyone asking \u201cHey, is this really what our ultimate weapon is supposed to be like?\u201d, but then again in the first minute of the show you learn that there is a single male who's able to pilot these mechas so it doesn't really matter. Not like there's a reason for him to be able to fly them of course. Either the author didn't have a better idea to shove a single dude inside a bunch of horny girls or the protagonist is actually a tranny himself, it's up to your own interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nLuckly after a couple of minutes the robots will not matter anymore, and that's good since robots are bad because they don't have tits or quantic panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus then shifts to the world all-girls school of piloting the unimportant robots, which is located in Japan. And since it's an all-girls school located in Japan, all the girls are in heat 24h/24, and they ask for dicks. Probably even the girly man protagonist, but oddly enough that's never outright stated. That doesn't change the fact that he's got the only dick in the school, if not the whole planet, so that creates a very deep dilemma between supply and demand.\\n\\n\r\nI could really empathize with the story since I really like girls who like dicks. Especially if it's mine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are divided between girls hungry for dicks and a girly man who's also hungry for dicks. The protagonist's sister also is supposed to have a dick her/himself, which explains the incest-homo vibe some episodes will give you. If you search on the internet enough you might also find pictures of him giving her a blowjob, so that's an irreFUTAble evidence. I greatly appreciated this freudian subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound could be better or worse but you won't get a chance to care either way. It's still not as majestic as Kanokon I guess, yet there's this pretty neat union between horrible graphics and horrible storyline which lets you wonder if the bad quality was done on purpose to create a better blend between the two feats. It's kinda like the shitty experimental style of some deep hipster anime, so I recommend elitists and pretentious viewers to watch this anime as soon as possible.\\n\r\nYou won't be disappointed. It will be hard enough (to have any expectations at all, I mean).\\n\\n\r\nSince this is my number 1 anime I will rate him first, so 1, but each category is rated objectively so my opinion is better than yours. Unless, obviously, you are a naked girl with invisible quantic panties.",

This is a major plot point that is heavily referenced and alluded to but never actually explained beyond being referenced because this show doesn't need to have a coherent storyline or characters. \r\nThe only reason anyone watches this show is for the qt girls, Germany and France are qtest btw, whose personalities are just based off various pages from TV Tropes. None of them are really important to the plot atall, they're all basically the MC's doms because he's useless as all hell throughout the plot and constantly needs to be coddled. He also can't seem to figure out that all of the girls want his D despite them all literally being on it constantly. Autism is a common trend for Harem MCs apparently.\\n\\n\r\nNothing from this show is really all that memorable, the art is ok, the soundtrack is what you'd expect from a generic harem show like this, the plotline can be compared to something like Spongebob or King of the Hill. It doesn't even try to push the fanservice that much until the next season or the OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nI don't see how anyone could enjoy this show unless they've watched pretty much every other Harem out there.

I'll just say write in why i scored the way i did in each of the categories given to me.\r\nStory (6-fair) - Well I've watch a lot of anime. i have over 400 in my collection. and to tell you the truth,watching all of them you'll soon realize that plots are rehashed all the time. It might be a different setting, characters, and events, but if you dig deep into the basic plot, you could usually count the different kinds they're using. This anime is no exception. its your typical harem scenes. One guy and a bunch of girls. plot line revolves around girls pilots, and the only Guy in the world who could pilot the Power Armors. of course, the girls fall in love with him because hes such a nice guy, revolving around that plot, they placed in action, power armors, and a mystery. Its not your award winning story, but if you want original, those things are usually reserved to the drama anime. I gave it a 6 because plots thin, but very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9-great) - I like the art direction to this one. Its nothing i haven't seen before, but animation is smooth and consistent. Unlike some anime, that seem to dull down when you get to the middle of the series, or seemed rushed, and cheap during some fight scenes like in gurren laggan, so far its been consistent halfway thru the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7-good) - Sound, well i really didn't notice anything good or bad about it so i gave it a 7. Its good, Not great, but not bad either. All in all, nothing significant to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8-V.Good) - Characters are good, aside from the robots and the fighting, the anime does touch up on the character development. Not so much for the girls, but more of the main star and only guy. Stories usually revolve around the girls and how they are connected to the main guy. Big diversity of characters too, given the fact that its an international school, and so far, Japan, England, France, and Germany, are represented. Good mix of characters and personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9-Great) - I really like anime like this. Nothing hard to think about, and i like the interaction of the characters. Primarily because its one of those fast anime. There are only 12 episodes to this series, its halfway, and they're very aggressive about the story telling. I like this anime also because i'm partial to Sci-Fi and Mechs, and Power armors. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8-V.Good) - Overall i gave this one an 8. I enjoy watching it, and there are a few anime out there that i do actually wait for to come out to watch the next episode. Its not a smart anime, bring nothing new to the table, but highly enjoyable. Even the little humor that is inserted here and there are noticeable. But if you taste is not like mine, you might not like it. All i can say is watch the first episode, if that doesn't hook you in, then the rest wont either. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy",

            "content": "One word: Copypasta.\r\n---Story---\r\nIf you have seen Shuffle or any other harem ecchi anime don't waste your time with this bag of cliche already been done poo, because this is a bad rendition of Shuffle with mechas. Seriously. Complete with a retarded protagonist who wouldn't know know a girl was interested in him even if she sucked his dick, a childhood friend apart for six years who will be doing some of the sucking, a big sister, a tsundere high class stereotypical blonde blue eyed english girl (definitely gonna be sucking his dick), and of course it all takes place in the over used setting ofboy in an all girls school, all the girls doing some dick sucking too. I predict a kuudere too. I don't see a yandere though it would be too thoughtful of the anime staff to put anything in there that would make you think bad things and possibly offset merchandising.\\n\\n\r\n---Characters---\\n\r\nJust looking at the character list it looks like a total rip off from strike witches (which in turn ripped off from other anime) Charlotte looks EXACTLY like Erica Hartmann, Laura Bode-whatever has that same dumb eye patch that Mio does and even Lin Yin Fang (chinese foreigner dur dur) reminds me of Lucchini. Bravo \"8bit\" and dumb producing name.\\n\\n\r\n---Sound---\\n\r\nNothing memorable. Dumb ass stupid generic OP that tries to copy what Railgun's OP did well. Don't even remember the ED was probably dumb too. No not probably, definitely.\\n\\n\r\n---Art---\\n\r\nNot bad the cgi looked a bit wonky but I don't really like cgi so I'm biased. The air fight in the beginning honestly wasn't that bad if a tad over dramatic and confusing but it was just a cock tease. ---UPDATE--- Second episode action was pretty good actually.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\r\nI'll watch the next episode but only to see the blonde tsundere's ass handed to her predictably.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Second episode slightly better than the first but the ending was SO DUMB. Ooooh why do I feel these feelings? Anh! Ichika-Sama!!! So. Dumb. So. Rehashed. I also am hating the childhood friend more and more. I've seen her character a hundred times and better.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Third episode was stupid stupid stupid. The blonde goes from absolute hatred to complete \"let me juggle your balls\" in what must be an amazing bankai hypnosis ability that the dense brick Ichika has. We introduce the stereotypical energetic chinese foreigner \"second\" childhood friend (as if one wasn't enough) who also is under Ichika's hypnosis expanding his rapidly growing cliche harem to three. Well I'm a bit wrong when I say cliche, I've never heard of having a first AND a second childhood friend but on the other hand who would be so stupid as to introduce a weak plot device like that.",

            "content": "To put Infinite Stratos in simpiler terms.....IT'S A CLICHE, LAZY, HAREM. Long story short: A universe that has mechs piloted by only females , but one guy is able to pilot it without any reason. So the government sends him to school full of chicks so that he can pilot better and learn. Oh, did I mention he's dense. Beyond, Naruto dense! Also, the girls in the school want to be in his pants. Horny much?  Now for the girls:\r\nThe following competitors are:\r\nHouki- Stupid, USELESS, tsundere childhood friend who has the brain capacity of 10 year old.\r\nCecelia- The Ojousama of jolly good England whohas a superiority complex to Harem lead, but then gets her ass beat and turns a 360 and starts getting wet for him.\\n\\n\r\nRin- 2nd Stupid, ANNOYING, tsun-tsundere childhood friend who fails at being the next Asuka and that is one of the harem girls I show a deep animosity for.

            "content": "Infinte Stratos has absolutely dreadful plot but top notch harem romance comedy and fan service. The key to enjoying this anime is to completely ignore the attempts at plot throughout the anime while savoring the characters and their fanservice. Infinte Stratos' premise is begins with our main protagonist, Orimura Ichika, just happens to be the only male that can pilot the Infinite Stratos mecha unit, which was thought to be only compatible with females. Thus our main protagonist is sent of to the IS academy and becomes the only male in a sea of females. And by stint of being male, he becomes the mostpopular student in the academy -_-. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simply torturous to watch. Throughout the series, major story developments have been random and sporadic; the events throughout the anime seem to have no relation to one another. Major events often occur suddenly only to fade away without leaving any trace of their occurrence or importance. The premises and themes used all have their potential, they were just extremely poorly developed by sloppy writing. The societal structure of woman dominating men which would have provided numerous opportunities for genuine conflict and for Ichika to develop as a main character is completely ignored. Various fancy names and technical terms are thrown around without explanation of their significance or origin. The power levels between characters are not only ambiguous, but also inconsistent, so no apparently growth in IS piloting skill actually takes place. The complete abolition of plot would have made IS much more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development simply fails due to its ties with the plot. Ichika undergoes no development at all; his skill at pilotnig the IS as well as his thickheadedness remains constant throughout the story. The development of the girls themselves lacks the drama needed to make their supposedly difficult pasts believable, which results in a general lack of empathy for the characters. Important plot elements used in character development are grazed upon so shallowly that they fail to be thought provoking and emotion evoking and end up as just laughable. The development itself is sometimes overly drastic; some characters experience complete 180 shits in attitude and personality that do not coincide with the resolutions of their non-existent drama. \\n\\n\r\nOnce their development has been completed however, the characters become astoundingly entertaining; the actual characters are easily the strongest part of the anime. Ichika, although undergoing no development, was never really a weak or herbivorous character, given his tendency to feed and massage the ladies around him. Each female character can be easily related to a certain trope or character archetype, but they are portrayed as more than just moe anthropomorphisms of abstract personality fetishes, although this certainly does not mean that the characters are not moe. Each character is given personality traits and quirks outside of their defined trope that makes them more real and likeable; even aspects that seem trivial are given some detail. Most entertaining is the interactions between characters, the abundance of various personalities allows for different chemistry mixtures that spice up situations that are otherwise very cliched and trite. Although all the reactions are often predictable, the characters are executed soundly and the situations are still fun to watch. Easily the weakest character is our main protagonist himself, as he remains a thickheaded punching-bag for the girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality for Infinte Stratos is quite high, which is a shame given it's agonizing plot. Immediately noticeable is the cast of seiyuu; most characters are voiced by a well established seiyuu famous for her roles in other anime. Not surprisingly, the voice acting is top quality; special props goes to Kana Hanazawa for the most moe anime voice this season. The music is of satisfactory quality with a catchy opening theme and a decent ending theme. The animation for the ending theme is actually not a harem-o-meter; the most recently captured character runs closely behind Ichika and moved to the back of the line as the next character is captured. The art itself is clean and vibrantly colorful, up to today's standards as a 2011 anime. The IS personal units themselves are well designed and easily differentiable from each other. The battles themselves are quite well done, with dynamic camera movements drawn well and plenty of special effects. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of negative reaction Infinite Stratos has received is definitely understandable; I myself at first whined and pussy bitched about the horrendous plot, and found the character interactions to be predictable and boring. However approximately half-way through the season, I finally accepted that Infinte Stratos was not the awesome mecha anime that I expected, but was instead a decent romantic comedy. Suddenly the plot became much easier to ignore since I stopped looking for it, which allowed my mind to be more positive and accepting of the character interactions, making them more entertaining. Therefore, although still accompanied by the frequent face-palm, I found myself smiling much more naturally and frequently as I watched this anime, and was sufficiently entertained.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions, comments, criticisms and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not.",

            "content": "Even before I touched the play button on Infinite Stratos (IS), all I've heard about it was \"wow so generic\", \"so boring T_T\", \"another one of those stupid harem ones\". Screw what people think, but I still started watching with a rather pessimistic opinion. IS is generic, but what's so bad about being generic? Isn't the entire definition of being general the idea that it follows the popular and majority trend? Truthfully, an anime that is only accused of being generic doesn't provide ample and concrete evidence of being a bad anime. In fact, I believe that IS is progressing rather nicely. Despite the setbackfrom the uneventful first few episodes, the later episodes really suggest some exciting developments into this \"generic\" load. Nevertheless, before you read on, think about why you even watch anime. Is it only to avoid watching generic animes and, as a result, stuffing your brain full of random crap that you don't even like or are you truly watching anime for the enjoyments and benefits it gives, regardless of the peripheral labels and whatever's been said about it? Hopefully it's the latter, because if you chose the former, then there really isn't a point in reading on since I'm pretty sure you've already made up your mind about Infinite Stratos. \\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nDespite the previous paragraph of me showering praises on IS, I'm getting out my flamethrower and shoop da whooping the story and setting. Seriously, the plot doesn't make any god dam sense. Infinite Stratos follows the life of Ichika, as he transfers to the Infinite Stratos (basically a mechanical body armor) Academy as the only guy since apparently only girls can use IS. There he meets a few childhood friends ( girls of course) and seduces a couple more distinguished students -- basically a harem type setting. When I first saw the mech stuff, I thought \"crap, what a ripoff mating between code geass and gundam.\" Hey! We have these giant bigass robot suits and we're just going to fly around in them for fun! Achieving something with IS? Tehe no need for tha- OF COURSE YOU NEED A FOKIN STORY. Seriously, screw this plot. It's illogical and pitiful. This is where the \"generic\" accusation hits Infinite Stratos hard in the nuts (or somewhere else for girls). The lack of an adamant plot development, coupled with absolutely no innovation on the mecha aspect vehemently cripples the story potential of Infinite Stratos. Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled around randomly by IS. Suddenly there's this event, then there's that event, and etc... IS doesn't show the viewers the way it's heading, if it's even heading a way. For some viewers who are ravenously persistent for a bite of plot, Infinite Stratos has left them to starve in the crappy 3-D world.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art... what can I say. I guess animes have large budgets nowadays because the art is absolutely fantastic. Ahh...Charlotte...she's drawn so cute and so awesomely 2-D styled that it really makes me feel better watching the parts with her in it and makes me feel nicer towards the entire series. If you take an incredibly obsessive preference in art like me, then Infinite Stratos will not disappoint you in that aspect. Prepare those pencils and papers, and the mouse on the pause key. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nEverytime I decide to watch an anime under the harem label, I prepare myself for immutable facepalms and headdesks at how pathetic the male character will be. Lucky for my brain cells, Ichika didn't kill as many of them as other harem animes would have (It's ridiculous how much calculus I forgot after watching certain parts of To-Love-Ru). Ichika is a bit spineless at times but overall he has the right spirit. The problem with having that typical \"I'll protect you\" spirit is that it's overused to the point where they forcefully yell it out every, oh let's say 5 minutes. And of course, that'll cause this bunch of lovey-dovey mushy crap to magically appear and ruin whatever positive feelings I have towards the anime. Ichika had less of those experiences, but nevertheless, he is still lacking the standard of determination, seriousness, and independence that I look for in male protagonists. As for the girls, all of them (except for a few of them when they are in their super WTF tsundere mode) were decent and tolerable. Laura and Charlotte were probably my favorites. Laura, for the groundbreaking determination she shows later that's rarely seen in harem types, and Charlotte simply because she's so cute.  Everytime Charlotte says \"Ichika, you pervert\" with that shy look on her face, my infinite quantum black hole of a heart melts a little. I would have given the characters a 10/10, but Ichika's lack of skill and an adamant personality, and the other average characters unfortunately lowers the aggregate score to an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nI certainly do enjoy IS very much. It gives me the feelings of living in such an academy and the excitement of endeavoring in those events (both unfulfillable in the mundane 3-D world). However, one thing that I find IS to be lacking in is consistency. During one fight, Ichika is suddenly god-hack mode powerful. In the next fight, he's pathetically weak and a pushover. This inability to adequately address his skill level on a stable standard shows mediocre planning and over-exaggeration on idea conveyance. Another hole in the enjoyment of Infinite Stratos is the predictability of some battles, and how incredibly annoying it is to always have Ichika lose the battle when he's about to win because of some retarded reasons like \"running out of energy\". Overlooking these two flaws, Infinite Stratos can be very entertaining for some personality of people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos has amazing art and pretty good characters, however, it only gets an average 7. It's tragic to see an anime with a high potential of proving itself despite being criticized for being \"generic\" only to fail miserably with the lack of a concrete plot. It's truly tragic. If the producers only spent a bit more time to develop a plot for IS, I believed that it could have well received higher scores and reviews. However to me, it seem like the producers kind of just half- assed their way through, trying to make an exciting action packed harem type anime, without actually having to plan for an exciting action packed harem type anime. You know what they say about life. \"Nothing is free\".",

            "content": "First of all i would like to start this review with the fact that THIS IS NOT AN  \"Genres: Action, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Shounen\"  but it's a  \"Harem, Romance , Mecha with a spoon of Action and a pinch of Shounen\"  , i dont even feel the need to add a Sci-fi genre considering this is a mecha anime . \r\nAnd second is that this show has nothing original in it , the Mecha looks like Strike Witches with some add on , the characters are like any harem characters , the story  ( still undeveloped )  gives you nothingto even consider a storyline or just leaves you with some questions , the sound is okey , nothing new , nothing original .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 1 :  \"The story\" \\n\r\nI would say , what story , the only things given are the fact that only females wear the mecha suits and for some reason the male character  ( THE MALE since i have seen no other males so far )  can also use them and a fight at the very beginning with an unknown  \"enemy\" . \\n\r\nAnd that is it , ohh i forgot , the scientist who created these mechas is missing? if i recall it and there are only a  \"few\"  mechas  ( a couple hundred for the entire world ) .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 2 :  \"The art\" \\n\r\nI would say it's very ordinary , nothing really stands out as good . The movements seem fluid but like i said , just ordinary .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 3 :  \"The sound\"\\n\r\nAgain , nothing special , the OP seems okeyish but it's like i seen something the same more than once and it doesn't really make it more interesting at all . \\n\r\nThe ED is far worst than the OP imo , something used like a thousand times . The only sound that is okey and blends well is probably the  \"during the view\"  sounds you encounter , they fit good enough with the scenes played .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 4 :  \"The character\"\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of this show imho . \\n\r\nYou have the thick like a brick male lead with a  \"wanabe\"cool attitude surrounded by girls ;\\n\r\nThe blonde with blue eyes  \"foreign high-class\"  stereotype with a superiority complex that  breaks?  down immediately after facing off the main male character and falls in love with him , going from hate to love in like  \"snap\"  ;\\n\r\nThe  \"childhood friend\"  who's an usual tsundere  ( like many other )  who is also a kendo master? and has a promise  ( of love probably )  with the main character that he forgot , before she had to leave  ( like many other ) ;\\n\r\nAnd in episode 3 we're introduced to  another?!  childhood friend , who is also chasing after the male character with a promise of  \"being together forever\"  that the male character conveniently misunderstood being the brick , oups i mean thick as he is ;\\n\r\nAnd the cherry on top for all of them is the fact that there are a lot of misunderstandings between them or subtext or one sided emotions that create a lot of awkward scenes that usually end up with the male character getting wacked or something like that .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 5 :  \"The enjoyment\"\\n\r\nI would like to say that i started off kind of enjoying the show , with good expectations of shounen mecha action  ( mostly because of the first minute of the show and the setting used for the show , an academy for training to fight? )  but by episode 3 kind of all of it was shattered with the 15 times use of the word  \"childhood friend\"  to  \"clear\" misunderstandings , and totally setting the show on a harem / romance path .\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL  i would say this show is like a combination of Strike Witches + Chrome Shelled Regios +  \"insert random genre/show stereotype\" x 'n' . The probably only  \"original\"  ( as in  \"i have not seen that many\" )  is the having of two  \"childhood friends\"  introduced as such , and they clearly try to sell out this in episode three one way to many times . \\n\r\nFor mecha / harem / romance fans this will be a show they probably will like , but for people who expected to see mecha / action this will be an annoying show .",

            "content": "Here's the deal: I have a dream anim\u00e9. It's a show that's primarily mecha, with the robots piloted by humans and function like body armors rather than bigass robots that tower over the skyline (Zero--and pretty much all the other Maverick Hunters--from the Megaman X franchise inspired this). I wanted a little romance on the side, and awesome fights here and there, with possibly a few moments of comic relief. Character designs should be clean and crisp, with detail in the eyes and the mecha suits. Fanservice is not desired, but allowable to an extent. A male or a female lead would be fine, solong as the female lead doesn't lead the series into a shoujo dive.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping this in mind, I searched for shows that have any one or a combination of these characteristics. I searched high and low (I wasn't aware of MAL at the time I watched Infinite Stratos), and I eventually stumbled on Infinite Stratos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n- Clean and neat, with the occasional excessive cheek tints. (AWESOME!)\\n\r\nFanservice:\\n\r\n- Bordering the allowable and the excessive, but nevertheless still allowable. (Fine.)\\n\r\nMechas?:\\n\r\n- Yes. Battle suit-style mechas. (F**K YEAH!)\\n\r\nTags:\\n\r\n- Mecha (AWESOME!)\\n\r\n- Romance (NICE)\\n\r\n- Harem (...huh?)\\n\\n\r\nThen the plot dawned me. Frankly I was initially disappointed to see that the title closest to being my dream anim\u00e9 was quite possibly the largest harem I've ever encountered (and frankly, it still is). At least Gundam 00 had 4 Gundam Meisters; Code Geass had a myriad of pilots; even Megaman X had Maverick Hunters and Navigators. And here we have Infinite Stratos, set in an instructional school in a setting where females are the only ones capable of piloting these mecha suits--with the exception of our lead character. (Whether this is positive or negative is entirely up to the reader.) I'll leave my ranting for now, and move on with my review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos introduces itself by giving us a heads-up on what's going on in their world: mecha suits called Infinite Stratos (or IS for short) are the latest in technological innovations, but only females can control them. A worldwide pact was made to prevent the use of these suits for war; instead, the suits are used for sport, and a school off the coast of mainland Japan teaches students how to use them. Obviously, the school would be an all-girls school, with a peculiar exception of a student: Orimura Ichika, the only male in the world who can pilot an IS.\\n\\n\r\nThe show manages to compress all this in one episode, which was good. The bad part was that they didn't follow it up. They didn't give so much as an amply descriptive story behind why Orimura is the only male who can control an IS (they tried it near the end of the series, and even by then it was still largely vague). Also, for some magical reason only females can pilot the suits. No explanation given. It's probably just a plot device to maintain the \"harem\" status of the series, but it doesn't help the story at all besides giving the viewers girls and more girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe 12 episodes of this series are roughly about class competitions, a single person's flashback, and one mission that was supposed to be a climactic ending but certainly fails to do so. If Infinite Stratos is bad at somethine, it's the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHere Infinite Stratos tries to redeem itself (and at least in my case the redemption effort works). Art in this show is clean and fluid--just the way I like it. People are drawn quite well, and nothing is left without detail. Even the GUIs of the students' workdesks and the classroom screens are well-made. Mechas are presented in 3D when in combat, and in 2D when in static frames. I think this is a plus, since the 3D action scenes are certainly eye-catching (I mean, with all those lasers and boosters and all that). Color schemes for the mechas aren't really stellar, but at least they match the mood of the show. Also, if you're going to do a mecha show, you have to pay attention to the mecha designs. Luckily, Infinite Stratos does this well, and the mechas certainly look great.\\n\\n\r\nEnvironment-wise, it's pretty much standard. You won't expect any vivid settings from a school that's pretty much isolated at sea, but at least they try their best to give it a futuristic feel. Personally, I liked the art direction of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose animation goes here as well, and the fight scenes are well-done. Not the type of fight scenes you'd expect from a 12-episode harem series, but still well-done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's something Infinite Stratos is definitely good at. Sound in this show is quite excellent; the quality of BGMs on battle scenes are at a level that probably won't match the storytelling. Opening and ending themes are also well-done. Look, if you want to get a general feel of Infinite Stratos without watching it, then go look for its OST tracks. You pretty much get all the good points of Infinite Stratos by listening to the OST alone. (There's no harem in OSTs, right?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't give this a score lower than 5 is because of a certain French girl (this statement also happens to be a weird Titanic reference). The rest of the characters are pretty much shallow; actually, they're just \"pretty.\" Not even the lead character stands out. Our lead Orimura is just a dense boy with a strange admiration for his older sister (no worries, it isn't incestuous); his childhood friend is the usual tsundere; the English girl is just simply arrogant and aggressive (but she's not annoying, though; I did like her at one point); the Chinese girl is also a tsundere (surprise, surprise); the French girl is the only character that has an actual backstory worthy of being called a \"backstory;\" the German girl is the one with a weird obsession for both Orimura and his sister (this is the kind of obsession you should worry about). I've pretty much described the other 4 characters. I'd really like to do defense on the French girl, but she comes out near the middle of the series, so I'll leave it for you guys to watch and find out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis might seem confusing, since I gave some components pretty low scores. I already mentioned that Infinite Stratos pretty much embodies my dream anime (only ruined by a harem element). In this sense, I did give it a chance, and I did like it. I suppose it was because of the suits? Perhaps I really just wanted to see mecha-stye battle suits. It was so close to being my dream anim\u00e9. So close.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, Infinite Stratos is lackluster. My scores for Enjoyment are pretty much fed by bias; had I had a different idea for a dream anim\u00e9, Infinite Stratos would have scored pretty low. However, if you're into harems and fanservice, and if you have the slightest interest in mechas, then you might just like Infinite Stratos. I watched the show like how I leisurely go hiking on a mountain. You don't hike to meet and talk with your fellow hikers; you hike to enjoy the view. That's what I did with Infinite Stratos: I didn't watch to understand the people inside; I really just watched for the view. And by my standards, it was a pretty good view.",

            "content": "Whenever I watch anime, I try to keep a critical mindset. This doesn't mean I examine and inspect every aspect of the show, but that I try to discern the things it does well and the things it doesn't do well so that I may develop an informed opinion of it. Sometimes, however, I don't really want to bother with that, and I just want to sit back and enjoy myself without having to worry too much about reading through the lines, and usually I'll reserve moeblob anime such A-Channel or Hidamari Sketch for this role. This time, however, I decided to go with aharem.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was not a good decision.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos has a standard harem setting: the slow, kind, and incredibly normal male main character, Orimura Ichika, transfers into an all-girls military academy that trains teenagers to pilot 'IS', highly advanced power suits which can be piloted only by women and, mysteriously, our male hero. Okay, so maybe that's not very standard, but it certainly isn't as awesome as it sounds. The all-girls setting naturally paves the way for a harem (though pretty much the whole school wants to shag Ichika), this particular one consisting of five main archety-COUGH I mean 'characters': the tsundere childhood friend, the posh foreigner, the genre-savvy bishoujo (well they're all bishoujos, really), the stoic social retard, and a second tsundere childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nNone of these characters are developed particularly well, any development being completely clich\u00e9 or just simply not existing \u2013 this is particularly evident in the case of our main character, Ichika, who remains constantly stupid, hard-headed, overly-optimistic and COMPLETELY oblivious to his harem throughout the entirety of the show. No, I don't like him, why do you ask?\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, regardless of the characterisation, the story doesn't very much help to relieve it: the opening sequence shows the group battling a mysterious IS, with heavy hints at a bigger plot in the background being dropped all over the show, with a major one presenting itself roughly halfway though. The thing is, though... that this 'secret and dark background plot' never actually happens. All the introduced implications are completely ignored by the finale and never dealt with, leaving one with a bitter taste regarding the last few episodes due to its nature as a random 'monster of the week' crisis, and whilst the 'harem' plot shows some development, it is quickly shunted back to square one.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the majority of the series focuses on Ichika's school life and the various perverted situations he finds himself caught up in. But, as a general rule, this rarely works very well, and Infinite Stratos is no different, eventually becoming outright annoying due to Ichika's obliviousness to everything. And its not exactly as if the aesthetics help matters much: the animation is low quality and in some areas, outright shoddy, using some weak form of 3D CGI for the IS suits that doesn't work very well and can be very jarring to switch to; the audio is, frankly, completely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos is an anime that achieves at, basically, absolutely nothing. Everything about it is completely standard, and represents exactly the issues the anime industry is facing with harem-based romantic-comedies. Nothing whatsoever is resolved by the conclusion, and the show just pissed me off more than anything else. As you have probably gotten by now, I don't recommend watching this in the least. 2 out of motherfucking 10.",

            "content": "PLEASE READ: This is a review of both IS seasons. Scroll to the very bottom of this review to see IS S2 review (it's legit I promise!!)\r\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with over-used generic stories. Nothing, really! Except when they're like IS. The anime that failed from the start. Though I can't say I'm surprised, with predictable story, characters, there's nothing to keep me guessing or wondering what's going to happen next.\r\nI can sum up the story with a couple of common words:\r\nBoy\r\nGirl(S)\r\nHigh school\r\nMechas\r\nNow go ahead and guess: Will the story be interesting or not?\r\nThere you go.\r\nInstead of putting us into a world where thereality of a Woman > Man type world with mechas and perhaps applying Marshall Mcluhan's four laws to that, and showing us the complexities of it's layout. Instead we get, teen boy hustled by horny teen girls.\\n\\n\r\nPlot? Oh I'm sorry, THAT WAS THE PLOT!!! \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though: the story takes a while to introduce the full cast using a few episodes dedicated to each girl. In some parts there are fights and a tournament, terrorists yadda yadda blohmadda.\\n\\n\r\nThe art suffice to say was, great!(it is in no way close to any of the other factors in terms of weight) The settings were detailed enough so I could recognize the general things. You could identify the main characters easily as well (although you can't remember their names cause they're blander than me blending water). The fights were, pretty good but the MC should really ask people to stop giving his butt to him as a damn Christmas gift. All I can say is, decently-good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine as well, but no really interesting music to get your blood pumping.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Shit. Now I know what you're thinking, \"Hey don't be too harsh, the characters are vibrant and have different personalities\". I say NO. Let me explain:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a good character? Personality sure! but what other qualities should they have? A decent art model yes. But what makes the character         -stand out from the rest-? There we go. \\n\\n\r\nPicture those 5 girls. Imagine in your head about how they interact with Ichika. Now take away Ichika. What do you see now? Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that saying where you say \"I can't imagine X without X\". Yeah well that's mostly used in a positive context. Here? Bad.\\n\\n\r\nOk I found their names and here: let's see how this goes now.\\n\\n\r\nHouki: Childhood Tsundere. Enough said.\\n\r\nCecilia: Proud, stuck-up rich girl who likes Ichika.\\n\r\nRin: Chinese Loli (pig-tails are bonus OH YEAH!!)\\n\r\nCharlotte: Blonde girl who tried to be a guy.\\n\r\nLaura: Angry German Loli with military background.\\n\r\nBONUS: Chifuyu: Angry older sister, constantly hits Ichika. Gets mad at him for unfair reasons.\\n\r\nBONUS: Tabane: Created the idiocy that was IS.\\n\\n\r\nSee? Aside from the 2 bonus characters, I can't see any sort of character in these Haremettes. All I see is some saltless-butter of a bunch of dolls. This is the problem in most harems. (ignoring the fact that harems in general suck) The girls are nothing without the dumb MC to anchor them to be pseudo realistic in any sense. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot Ichika.\\n\r\nHe sucks......I won't go too much into it I'll point form it.\\n\\n\r\n-Too stupid to exist.\\n\r\n-Boring personality\\n\r\n-Scared of girls\\n\r\n-Did I mention boring?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I forced myself to watch this because it was so bad, I really had to see just to what extent of bad this was. No I don't torture myself to watch anime, I did this as a self experiment to see just what to expect when going into this type of genre. It didn't disappoint my expectations at least (good!) because they were zero (oh...). But seriously, I was bored as heck. I was very tempted to skip to the second halves of the episodes to see some action... then to my dismay finding out that there was no action in some episodes. Boring Boring Boring. *SPOILER* Not even that climactic battle with Laura was good, it was just stupid in all places. *END SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was bad, I'd hate to see it's manga/LN version because I bet that's a bunch of useless writing.\\n\\n\r\nI obviously expected too much from this anime. No wrong. I expected too much of what I WANTED from this anime. Instead, it did the usual pander otaku schtick and rolled with it. Obviously it was a harem/romance/romcom/highschool/mecha anime. But still, just seeing these always piss me off at how blatantly Japan doesn't care to try and even try something new for once.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings could really have been expanded on. Like I said, Marshall Mcluhans 4 laws could have been applied here.\\n\\n\r\nEnhancement: No brownies here, this is too easy to explain.\\n\\n\r\nReversal: Instead of it's intended purpose of space exploration, it could have added on to that, explaining how technology can be manipulated into a purpose of reversal.\\n\\n\r\nRetrieve: What earlier actions/service could have been brought back because of the intricacies of IS? \\n\\n\r\nObsolesce: What does this technology make obsolete. Again too easy.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have showed these 4 laws applied in greater detail. EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW MARSHALL MCLUHAN, there could have been some more focus on looking at the mechs do stuff. But no, Ichika and his teenage crisis with his girls is wayy more important. (sigh)\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said. It was doomed from the start when it said Harem, Ecchi and those buzz words right off the bat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways here's my IS S2 review.\\n\\n\r\nIt's shit.\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you take a guy and put him in a school full of girls? You get the piece of garbage known as Infinite Stratos! Oh light novels how I adore you!\r\nBack when I was a young anime fan I absolutely loved this show since I was a dumb fourteen-year-old adolescent who was only watching anime just to see some boobs. And while my love for boobs has only grown with more conviction and strength over the years, my taste in narrative has certainly changed a lot as well with my ever growing disdain for light novel adaptations. In this work ofmasterclass story writing, the author decided that the plot would involve the shy and bland light novel guy archetype. This version of light novel guy is incredibly dense. Like REALLY dense. Like REALLY dense. I cannot possibly empathise how actually dense the main character is in words since the brilliance of Light Novel Guy has transcended words alone and moved up to another plane of existence beyond what is possible for human comprehension. I say this because NO damn guy would ever react the way in which Light Novel Guy does or could possibly be this dense.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, before I get into Light Novel Guy allow me to explain the 'plot' for this anime. Set in the future, Japan has developed mecha exoskeleton suits called the 'Infinite Stratos\" or IS for short. However, for some reason (the show never actually explains why) only women are able to control and power these machines, that is, until one day, Light Novel Guy touches one of the suits and for some reason he becomes the only man in the world to be able to control and use the IS suit, in which he is shortly sent to a school  in which he is taught how to properly manage and use the IS suit for combat. And that's it. The narrative goes nowhere with its idea or theme. Every now and again, the show will introduce a new character to spice things up or randomly throw in some villain out of thin air but the show remains incredibly linear. It's a shame too since there is so much wasted potential. Think about it. A world in which only women can control these suits resulting in a monopoly in both power and in war. The show could of delved into gender roles, the dominance of females over males, how society has changed as a result of this invention but the writer does nothing. Just throw a bunch of women, create a harem and show a bunch of tits. Obviously this tactic worked, considering the immense popularity of this show. It's unfortunate how light novels don't even have to try to be good for them to be a hit with filthy weebs.\\n\\n\r\nWith the 'plot' out of the way let's get back to explaining Light Novel Guy. As I said, Light Novel Guy is incredibly dense, like many other Light Novel leads but in this show you wonder how the guy is still alive and able to perform basic human functions since he is that clueless and stupid. Every time a girl is clearly tying to confess their love to him he doesn't even realise even when it is so obvious. Speaking of that, why on Earth do all these girls fall in love with this guy so easily? I mean, sure he the only guy in the entire school but I think sand-paper would be a better alternative to this guy. Light Novel Guy has the personality of a brick wall with no likeable characteristics or even motivation. He is simply a person who exists in this universe that just so happens to be at the centre of this narrative. He does nothing, he is nothing and I'm getting bored just talking about him so let's move on. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for the shot-gun round in which we blow through the rest of the supporting cast! Let's go!\\n\\n\r\nHouki is the childhood friend with big boobs and also happens to be a Tsundere. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nCecilia is the British Big Boobed one. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nLingyin is another childhood friend. She is Chinese. She has small boobs. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nLaura is the Nazi, I mean the German one who gets a SMALL amount of backstory and development but hardly enough time is spent on her to flesh her out. Guess what? She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nIf it sounds like I'm being really vague and lazy with these characters, that's because the show doesn't give me a lot to work with. All of them are equally generic and boring and going through them individually would essentially just be me repeating the same thing over and over again. However, there is one character that does get some development, when compared to the rest of the cast anyway. A full episode is devoted to developing Charlotte's character and her backstory, while not entirely original or even all too fleshed out in the grand scheme of things, was actually handed with a lot of care. Sure, she does fall in love with Light Novel Guy after this and her character goes nowhere after that but at the very least there was something. I just find is really annoying that all of the girls fight over this guy as if they were moths attracted to a flame.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the fights, I felt them to be entirely boring. The IS suits are CG but in all honesty it's not too bad; it's just that the fights lack tension. These suits are so goddamn strong that it removes any narrative steaks the show may of had. In addition, Light Novel Guy also has about a million power-ups at the most convenient of times to save the day or to win in a fight which, again, removes any tension from any fight. It doesn't exactly help either when about ten million boob shots and ass shots are shoved into my face every single second. The show does try to make some scenes really dramatic but they're undercut by the tits flying left, right and centre. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service is a big part of this show and I find it tasteless to say the least. Every event or arc is simply an excuse just to reveal as many breasts as possible since the show has no aims or narrative. This problem, believe it or not, is even worse in the second season but that's for another day. Now, I want to elaborate that I have nothing against fan-service in anime. To be perfectly honest, I enjoy it from time to time since I am being pandered to, and hey, that's how those things kind of work, but when your show is nothing but panty and boob shots, it feels like a desperate attempt at keeping the audience's attention since the narrative or characters are not strong enough to do it on their own. When a show uses an abundance of fan-service it is generally a clear indication of bad writing (unless the entire show is built around the theme of sexuality such as Kill la Kill) as the author uses it more so as a selling point for his work rather than through an interesting story. I understand why it is used; to fish interest in this heavily saturated and competitive industry, but I often lose respect because of it. If it were something like Bakemonogatari, where they intermix fan-service with unique and creative shots, with great dialogue, I'd be fine. But this show doesn't have that at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is alright; I did like the opening and ending tracks however. They're generic pop but they work and are very catchy none-the-less. Infinite Stratos is yet another example of a terrible Light Novel adaptation and proves that just by throwing a bunch of tits on screen, anime fans will eat it up. It worked on me when I was fourteen, so I'm sure it's working on others. Although this brings up the question. Why am I watching this now if it clearly is not aimed at me? Why should I care what the fourteen-year-olds are doing? That's because these fans deserve better than this. Just because a show is aimed at a particular audience, it still is no excuse to be absolutely lazy with your writing and storytelling. Anime, despite all of it's mishaps, is a medium in which holds some of my favourite pieces of media ever created. The genre has a lot of potential, which is why it saddens me to see this show, which is so badly and lazily put together become more popular than actually good shows out there. Either way, Light Novel Guy can go fuck himself, but then again, he is too dense to probably even understand what 'fuck' means...\\n",

            "content": "I haven't read the manga yet and the review is simply based on this anime, I'm fully aware that there are still a couple of more episodes to go, and it is too early to make any conclusions. Ok, amigos how do I rate this anime:\r\nStory- 7\r\nOk, so the anime is about a girl genius, Tabane Shinonono, who invented an exoskeletal suit called \"Infinite Stratos\" or \"IS\" for short, which  can only be operated by women thus gives them greater dominance in society and  leaving men to be wussies ( I wonder what happen to the nukes?) but the story is more focuson the misadventures of the un-expecting Ichika the only muchacho who can operated an IS and with his harem, other genres are  trivial, but it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\\n\r\nArtistically-wise, It's good, but the technicality bad. Well, I'm referring to the mechs or IS's in a technical way is too overly decorated. Going to the school uniform, well, the way it is drawn it kinda conforms to the time but as in any school genre it  ain't 100% uniformed, co'z every girl in the academy sport a different style: like when it comes to their socks: some wore high knee, some wore low knee, while there are others sport ankle length socks and as always they come either in black or white, but quite a few wore panty hoses . There is the shoes, which loafers are the usual choice by many, while quite a few have there own style of foot wear and let's not forget the skirt's length, in a schools genre the length of the skirt is either short or very short (Oh my I can see their panties from here), but rarely does it goes long, and in the case of this anime, I'd say that this is the only one that I know which the length of the skirt or the whole uniform itself (since it is worn like a one piece dress with 3 layers beneath ) whose length varies from one girl to another.    \\n\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\\n\r\nI just like the opening theme, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nIchika Orimura - As it is said he is the only muchacho in the academy, actually he never intended to attend the academy in the first place . It's just that he happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and can't seem to keep his hands to himself when he touched an IS, which by the way it reacted to him, thus he got drafted into the academy and he seem to do pretty good in getting into a lot of uncomfortable situations involving his harem. And as in any harem genre, he is oblivious and very much indecisive as what to do with them,  he operates a Byakushiki  a close quarter melee IS and he only has Yukihira type 2 saber as his weapon because of his kendo background, not surprising since he was trained by his Nazi sister Chifuyu.\\n\\n\r\nHouki Shinonono - Ichika's childhood friend (the 1st one), she's a tsundere which make up part of the harem, she and the muchacho (male lead) could have been lovers if she and her family were not not taken away and placed under protective custody due the sensitivity of her sister's work. She's an top notch kendo (and Iaido) practitioner, and she looks good in the uniform that she wore, in fact her style really trends up to that particular time (which is the future). She harbors feelings for the muchacho, however she can also kick his butt......when she's jealous and pissed. She's the first chica who slept with the muchacho (in separate beds of course) and she was almost see naked ( unintentionally that is). Since we now know what her personal IS look like which is the Akatsubaki, it is yet to know as to what it is capable of, judging from her kendo and iaido skills it is believe that her unit is a close quarter melee .\\n\\n\r\nCecilia Alcott - the 2nd girl who entered the muchacho's life, overall, she's a bitch at first to the muchacho but later on warms up, she always brags about her being part of royalty (even if she's just been orphaned....according to info) and being a representative from the UK (my ass). She's very clingy to the muchacho and would be rude to anyone who comes near him, she's the forth girl which the muchacho has see naked (being topless in the beach counts and it's her fault ). Her uniform make her look like a granny, well she would look hotter if she wore the same style as Houki. She operates the Blue Tears a sniper platform IS, not much for a melee, since she relies on her unit's drones to get close to an opponent.\\n\\n\r\nRin (or Lin) Yin Fang - 3rd chica to come into the muchachos life, actually she's suppose to be the 2nd girl into his life since she happens to be the muchacho's  2nd childhood friend, she's rather petite, flat chested and wore her uniform like a whore, but she make up for being a good cook ( according to info) though in this anime she only presented the muchacho her sweet and sour pork dish and she can also be a handful for the muchacho when she's pissed or jealous. she has a medium melee or  frontal assult type of IS which is the Sheng Long, which aside from having Impact Cannon, it is also equipped  2 big meat cleavers when joint up it becomes a spear with 2 tips at opposite sides, I guess she's a kung-fu practitioner to have that kind of melee weapon.\\n\\n\r\nCharles or Charlotte Dunios - 4th chica to come by, at first she was able to fool the muchacho that she's a man (and so as everyone else), until he accidentally saw her naked while taking a shower, which by the way she's the 1st girl whom the muchacho has accidentally seen naked, twice, (being in the men's bath doesn't count, and Houki doesn't count either) and she the 2nd chica whom the latter slept with - in separated beds of course. Unlike other members of the muchacho's harem, she's more open minded and she's the only one whom the muchacho can related to . At first she wore a male uniform with a close turtle neck, then later on she sports a female school uniform, but the sneakers make her look like a middle schooler . Her IS is a mass produced 2nd generation unit called \"Rafale Revive\" which is a versatile multiple weapons platform, capable of sniping, assault and close quarter melee, and is probably be a formidable match to everyone else  except for Laura's IS. Later on she decided to come out clean and declared that she's a girl and not a boy to the disgust of everyone else towards the muchacho, so much so that he's about to be killed by a jaded Rin.     \\n\\n\r\nBodewig Laura - the 5th chica to come by and gave the muchacho a slap in the cheek ,  she's a genetically designed super soldier  (according to info) and has a VT system implanted in her. Her school uniform makes her look like a member of the Nazi since she did came from Germany, at first she dislike the muchacho because she blames him for her idol (Chifuyu) for leaving Germany, but after beating her in the tournament with help from Charles or Charlotte she warms up to the muchacho and even giving him his first kiss.  She also declared him to be her husband (though they are not even married yet) after saving him from a jaded Rin and she's the 2nd chica whom the muchacho saw her naked which she intended it or maybe she really does sleep naked, she's the 3rd chica whom the muchacho slept with... in the same bed this time and nothing happen between them. Her Schwarze Regen is a heavy artillery, assault and a close quarter type IS, which is equipped with an AIC that can be used as a defensive shield against an incoming assaults or attacks. She's also a member of Schwarzer Hase special forces in Germany whose members also wore ridiculous eye patches even if they have both their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOrimura Chifuyu - Ichika's big sister and is also his homeroom teacher, she's also his first kendo instructor . She the muchacho's only immediate family, she's a highly skilled kendo and iaido practitioner, she competed in various Mondo Grosso tournament and won (why don't they just call it an IS tournament?) except in the finals where she had to drop out in order to save his brother. She has a Nazi like method when teaching, dealing and training her students and seem to have dominatrix attitude with the way she dress and the way she wore a bikini and probably the way she wore her lingerie.\\n\\n\r\nYamada Maya - Ichika's other class instructor who looks too young to be one and seems to be the same age as a 3rd year student, but her big boobies and sweet character make up for her kiddie stature.\\n\\n\r\nTabane Shinonono- Houki's big sister,  who sports rabbit ears and wore a granny dress, she has a voice of a girl from the 6th grade. She designed the exoskeleton unit called \"Infinite Stratos,\" she was able to exercise leverage against any nations who wanna use her design for war by implement an \"IS Treaty\" that regulates the used and distribution of the IS units. \\n\\n\r\nOthers-.......well they are just trivial, so why such rating, co'z I like the way the how the author designates  the roles and situations of the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell' let's face it, what makes this anime enjoyable is the muchacho's way with his harem, which  get's him in a lot of cabeza del dolor (headaches). Also, the IS units who were duking out with one another, but the main piece de resistance is the ultimate battle with a drone and knowing as to who the main villain is. Which, by the way I'm suspecting Tabane Shinonono since she designed the IS in the first place and she's the only who has a monopoly with the IS Core design so it's possible that she can make an IS capable of functioning without a human operator.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's enjoyable and that's that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The main character is a retard who happens to be the ONLY male in the world to be able to operate an IS. The reasoning for this is explained later in the series, but if you haven't watched it then I won't say how. Did I mention how he had a sister complex? Anyway, this show contains almost all the harem cliched elements that one show could have.\r\nElements:\r\n[X] Tsundere\r\n[X] Robot Girl (Laura)\r\n[X] Retarded male character\r\n[XX] Childhood friends\r\n[X] Girl with glasses\r\n[X] Reverse trap\r\n[X] Bossy older sister\r\n[X] Main character walks into someone else changing(This happens way too often -___-)\\n\\n\r\nThose are the things that I remember seeing off the top of my head. I watched the show around 3 months ago and just now decided to write reviews. Anyway, Ichika is also oblivious to the extremely obvious signs that the females are giving showing that they want the D and it's not even funny. It's actually really annoying and stupid.\\n\r\nI think this is how it went down:\\n\r\nIchika: \"I'll go out with you.\"\\n\r\nHouki: \"R-really?!\"\\n\r\nIchika: \"Out shopping that is!\"\\n\r\nMe + Houki: -_____-\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nThe artwork is average. It doesn't look any different than any other show that aired around the same time. Pretty standard modern anime designs. Nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe sound is  average, but I really liked the ED. I downloaded the song. Nothing really needs to be said about this other than average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty bad. Cecilia was really annoying and went from tsun to dere in one episode. It might not really be a big deal, but that's just not right. Ichika is a complete idiot and gives off the idea that he has no fucking clue what is going on around him and somehow that gives him the attention of the entire academy. The girls there must have low standards or not like men with brains at that school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nHonestly, the only thing I enjoyed about this show would have to be Charlotte. I'm a huge moefag and she was just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nThis show is really no different than any other harem. It's pretty average. If you like average, then this is the show for you. If you like looking at pretty faces, then I recommend you watch this show.",

The story mostly surrounds a boy who gets put into an all girls school because he's the only male that can operate these machines. Why is he the only male? Why can females only use them? Don't ask, you're here for tits. This is the equivalent of to love ru but with mechas. But don't get too carried away because there is no advancements from the MC to the females. \r\nThe main character is basicallyautistic so get used to him not catching on to the clues that the girls around him want the cock. He also needs help because he literally can't do shit so that's when the girls come in to aid him in everything.  Now i can dive into a super informative review of how this anime sucked or how it did decent or whatever, but you don't need to.You sit there, pop a squat (or occasionally pop a stiffy) and you watch for tits and ass and all that. Want amazing plot or just a good romance? Spice and wolf or Toradora. Want a good Mecha? Idk any good mecahs but find one that's highly ranked and go for it. Same goes for season 2 of this show since the formula is repeated. \\n",

Because when you're the only guy in a girl school, THERE'S INFINITE HAREMS POSSIBLES! Thus they should rename this anime to Infinite Harems!\r\nNow to tell you the truth, I was a bit reluctant to watch this. Oh sure, harem turns me on, like any normal guy, but mecha genre really turns me off.\r\nBut after looking through the mecha suit design, \"Hey! You can still see the girls! They're notcovered under huge piles of metal!\" So I decided to give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nWow... Was I wrong about this being a whole mecha genre. They focused more on the harem part! What proof do I have you ask?? Other than the fact he is the only guy?? Well in the ending, they add every new girl he added to his \"harem\" running along with him.

            "content": "One of the problems with the anime industry is the tendency to overuse stereotypes and themes, and many of the studios in Japan continue to operate under the idea that the shows they create will generate a profit in some manner (regardless of the content), through DVD sales or merchandise. The sad fact is that many producers barely break even from one season to the next, which then prompts arguments of piracy, licensing, pricing, distribution costs, etc, all of which seems more than a little strange as while it may appear that the studios have some perfectly valid arguments, they've neglected to talk about onething - the anime they make.\\n\\n\r\nEvery season viewers are subjected to a barrage of average or substandard fare that serves no other purpose than mindless juvenile media, yet these shows continue to be made because the entertainment industries always prefer the safe bet over a \"risky\" venture. That said, there are always one or two anime that manage to rise above mediocrity, but there's still a very large gap between being good, and being great.\\n\\n\r\nIS  is, first and foremost, a reasonably popular ongoing light novel series by Yumizuru Izuru that began publication in May 2009. Six volumes have already been released under the MF Bunko J label (part of Media Factory), and the seventh is due out in April 2011. In May 2010 a manga adaptation by Akahoshi Kenji began serialisation in Monthly Comic Alive, with production on the anime adaptation beginning later that year.\\n\\n\r\nSet in the near future, the story initially seems to be about powered exoskeletons called Infinite Stratos, an advanced piece of technology that is more powerful than any existing weaponry, but can only be used by girls and women. Because of this, society and the world have had to adapt so that females are now in authority, but all of that changes when Orimura Ichika, a 15 year old student, is found to be the only male in the world with the ability to pilot the machines. Because of this, and for his own protection, he is forced to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy.\\n\\n\r\nSeems a pretty straightforward set up right?\\n\\n\r\nIn fact this show is so straightforward and predictable it verges on being dull. Aside from being a light novel/manga adaptation (which seems to be the rage these days), the storyline is about as generic as one can get in anime, with almost every stereotype and \"popular\" theme on display. The plot initially seems intriguing until one realises that the whole concept of Infinite Stratos is nothing more than an excuse to put a \"special\" teenaged guy in a school full of hormone crazed girls, and let them have fun with each other. The storyline is only peripherally about the problems resulting from the development of the Infinite Stratos machines as they never really come to the fore until towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are only the surface issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is limited in terms of design as many aspects of the visuals are adapted directly from the manga. Unfortunately this doesn't really do the show any favours as aside from a degree of futurism in the backgrounds and the conceptualisation of the exoskeletal armours, everything else is the epitome of genericism. The big book of harem characters has been used extensively for pretty much everyone, with all of the lead roles looking more like cardboard cut-outs that would readily grace any other generic high school anime of this type. Granted there is a degree of facial expression, but that's not enough to raise the character design in any measurable way.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully there are two areas where the visuals actually manage to pass muster. The backgrounds are coloured and detailed rather well, but there are some scenes where the quality improves dramatically in order to focus the viewer's attention on the action. In addition to that, the animation is pretty good throughout the series, but the quality work only really comes to the fore during sequences of IS combat.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where Infinite Stratos does manage to attain a degree of respectability is the acting, but even that's not really saying much. After all, this is a harem romantic comedy with some science fiction and fanservice thrown in for good measure, so viewers shouldn't expect Shakespeare. It's surprising then, that Uchiyama Kouki actually manages to play the role of Ichika rather well, and the same could also be said of Hikasa Youko et al in the roles of the girls who want to find out how well Ichika can use his weapon.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, all of the exclamations, weird noises, mannerisms, and changes of pitch and tone that one would associate with this type of show are on offer, but while they're handled rather well by the seiyuu, there's simply too little going on for them to really show off their talents. The main reason for this is the mundane script, and viewers may find themselves suffering from bouts of deja vu during specific scenes, especially if they've recently watched any other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the background tracks are nice enough and there is some variety to be had thanks to the composition skills of Nanase Hikaru, but the problems lie in the choreography, and more importantly, the relevance. There are occasions where the score seems out of place with the on screen action, and while this is due to a slight error in the timing in some cases, more often it's because the background music simply doesn't mesh with the scene. This is also true for the opening theme, Straight Jet by Kuribayashi Minami, which already has difficulty standing out since it's a pretty standard J-pop affair so the last thing it needed was poor choreography. As for the ending theme, Super Stream, this generic little ditty is sung by the actress of whichever female character is managing to keep up with the manliness of Ichika during the credit sequence, while the other female seiyuu performing backing vocals.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of manliness, it should come as no surprise that there's little in the way of it here, but then this is justified to a degree by the fact that Infinite Stratos features a female dominated society. Ichika is the typical harem lead who doesn't seem to have a clue that so many girls like him, especially as he has very few redeeming features and a slight complex about his older sister, and in true harem fashion he even forgets or misunderstands childhood promises so the story can have that little bit more drama.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just him.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are just as poor when it comes to characterisation, although thinking about it, maybe poor isn't the right word. They fit into the story rather well, they may look like cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime but they do retain some individuality. They can be annoyingly self centred and stupid, but they're supposed to be hormone crazed teenaged girls so maybe that's normal (apologies if you're a hormone crazed teenaged girl who doesn't act self centred and stupid).\\n\\n\r\nOh wait. Most of them are supposed to be tsundere characters (all of them except the one with the short blond hair in fact), so maybe poor was the right word after all.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little in the way of actual character development as the derived and contrived nature of the plot and story doesn't really allow for any great introspection from any of the roles. There are many potential opportunities to push the characters in a totally new direction, but these are not taken as the whole series is less about telling a good story, and more about cashing in on the harem bandwagon.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of its flaws, Infinite Stratos will undoubtedly find a home in the hearts of some viewers, which is perfectly fine if you like this type of show, and to be honest much of the series is reasonably inoffensive, especially if the viewer has managed to sit through any other harem anime. That said, it should be pointed out that the concept of the story had the potential for being something special. The idea of a society dominated by women due to the development of a new weapon offers up questions of gender roles, societal balance, political machinations, technological advancements, etc, etc, all of which are treated as minor annoyances that get in the way of finding out which girl Ichika is going to choose.\\n\\n\r\nGranted there are some good points to be found in various aspects of the series, but these are outweighed by a lacklustre storyline, poor characterisation, and an overall sense that everything has been done before.",

            "content": "With the dawn of the second season, I think it's time to revisit an old friend. In this review, I will attempt to describe IS: Infinite Stratos and it's components, then give you it's worth as a series.\r\nThe basic premise of Infinite Stratos is set in a world where armored mecha suit, the Infinite Stratos is invented, thus rendering all other technology obsolete. One catch, this suit can only be worn by women.\r\nWhile this was an interesting premise, the setting itself just attracts questions. Why can only women wear it? What has the effects of this technology had on society? What happened to the politicalrelations of the world after this technology? What governments has used it?\\n\\n\r\nSadly, none of these questions are satisfyingly answered, because the next portion of the premise is going to make the TRUE premise apparent. While the original premise demanded world-exploration and examination, none of that is shown because the series basically only sets in one place: IS Academy. The place where Students aspiring to learn the techniques of IS from all over the world, where the armor/suit is used as an entertainment device(I will get to this later).\\n\\n\r\nOur Main Character is Ichika Orimura, an average High School student and the only male on the planet so far to discovered to have had the capability to use Infinite Stratos. And because of circumstances, he has to head to IS Academy, a place where he will be the only man.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of this setup, the show faithfully follows the route to harem, where 90% of the girls wants the Main Character's D, otherwise is interested(and certainly the main protagonists). Since it sets itself up as a Harem series, what is should do is explore the characters who are complex and makes us care for them, let's see the components of this series:\\n\\n\r\nCoherency/Continunity: While the series sets itself up as a series that begs exploration of the world's politics and what happened in the world after the invention of IS, this is merely a setup where the main character can have a school full of girls all to himself.\\n\r\nThe idea that women started to dominate the world is hardly ever shown, since the show secludes itself in the IS Academy. Where contrary to common sense, depicts females just about every other Harem series does! I will get into the characters later. The main point is, the social/political changes is shown without any changes!\\n\r\nAnd the fact that IS is a weapon(more powerful than any, mind you) begs the question on why has it not been used militarily? A weapon this powerful would have the government SCRAMBLING for it, and certainly not only used as an entertainment device(LOLWUT?). The idea if that if it is women who controls it would lead to world peace is completely illogical and is given as a fact. Any person has the power to commit evil, and being a part of a gender does not exclude you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The worst aspect of the series are the characters. Virtually all but one of the female cast is depicted as a Tsundere, and often violent too and nothing outside her stereotype. Rin the Chinese girl and Houki the Japanese girl are basically the same in terms of personality. While Cecilia the British girl have nothing really defines her other than \"Ojou-sama\" type of character. The only one that is not depicted as a Tsundere is Charlotte, whom is wonderful.\\n\r\nAnd the main character? About as generic as you get, and so dense that you can't even find it on the periodic table. Ichika is a self-insert character that has to deal with the woes of \"GIRLS ALL AROUND ME! OH NOEZ!!\" Difficult to achieve an level of empathy to and overall a dumbass to peoples' feelings to an unrealistic degree.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: The production of the series is relative above average. By no means is it bad. but the sound is rather generic and nothing I could remember to write home about, although the opening song was somewhat memorable. The character designs are generic by today's standards, again, nothing to write to home about. Although there are several prominent Seiyuus acting in the characters, such as Kana Hanazawa. But obvious incoherencies is show, such as one episode, a character fights the main character but is somehow stopped by Chifuyu's sword... Out of nowhere\\n\r\nBeing a mecha anime, there are also fight-scenes featuring the Infinite Stratos'. Probably the best part of the series, unfortunately, are short, insignificant, and CGI-animated\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Wait, what? Oh, the plot. Simply put, there isn't much other than a string of events that puts Ichika in various situations where the main characters fall in love with him. Infinite Stratos, as well as the expected consequences of it existing, is not a part of the plot. A random IS does show up and destroy stuff, but next episode, that is no longer a worry.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nIf you are here looking for a good plot that maps out the consequences of it's premise, turn around. If you are here looking for an above average harem story with quality characters, go elsewhere. Truthfully, without the ridiculously unnecessarily armored IS, this series is just a generic RomCom Harem series that is barely funny at all.\\n\r\nThere are bunch of holes in the plot and story. If you are looking for fanservice and cute girls(relatively) or Charlotte Dunois with a splash of CGI-animated Mecha fighting, come right in.\\n\\n\r\nADDITIONALLY:\\n\r\nIf there's one thing thats also great about this series, it's that the series does not pretend to be deep or anything that it is not, making it far less cringeworthy for some viewers to enjoy.",

            "content": "There are many ways to describe your own thoughts about an anime: you might say you liked it, you might say you hated it or you might say it's Infinite Stratos.\r\nInfinite Stratos is a major example of what a series about love, action, robots and comedy would look like if you were to remove the action robo-love comedy parts. Still, there are invisible quantic panties so yeah, that's science and storytelling for you.\r\nAs for the plot, it all revolves around naked girls and some kind of powerful lethal war machine that can only be used by naked girls called Infinite Stratos. You might wonder howthis is even possible to produce without anyone asking \u201cHey, is this really what our ultimate weapon is supposed to be like?\u201d, but then again in the first minute of the show you learn that there is a single male who's able to pilot these mechas so it doesn't really matter. Not like there's a reason for him to be able to fly them of course. Either the author didn't have a better idea to shove a single dude inside a bunch of horny girls or the protagonist is actually a tranny himself, it's up to your own interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nLuckly after a couple of minutes the robots will not matter anymore, and that's good since robots are bad because they don't have tits or quantic panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus then shifts to the world all-girls school of piloting the unimportant robots, which is located in Japan. And since it's an all-girls school located in Japan, all the girls are in heat 24h/24, and they ask for dicks. Probably even the girly man protagonist, but oddly enough that's never outright stated. That doesn't change the fact that he's got the only dick in the school, if not the whole planet, so that creates a very deep dilemma between supply and demand.\\n\\n\r\nI could really empathize with the story since I really like girls who like dicks. Especially if it's mine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are divided between girls hungry for dicks and a girly man who's also hungry for dicks. The protagonist's sister also is supposed to have a dick her/himself, which explains the incest-homo vibe some episodes will give you. If you search on the internet enough you might also find pictures of him giving her a blowjob, so that's an irreFUTAble evidence. I greatly appreciated this freudian subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound could be better or worse but you won't get a chance to care either way. It's still not as majestic as Kanokon I guess, yet there's this pretty neat union between horrible graphics and horrible storyline which lets you wonder if the bad quality was done on purpose to create a better blend between the two feats. It's kinda like the shitty experimental style of some deep hipster anime, so I recommend elitists and pretentious viewers to watch this anime as soon as possible.\\n\r\nYou won't be disappointed. It will be hard enough (to have any expectations at all, I mean).\\n\\n\r\nSince this is my number 1 anime I will rate him first, so 1, but each category is rated objectively so my opinion is better than yours. Unless, obviously, you are a naked girl with invisible quantic panties.",

This is a major plot point that is heavily referenced and alluded to but never actually explained beyond being referenced because this show doesn't need to have a coherent storyline or characters. \r\nThe only reason anyone watches this show is for the qt girls, Germany and France are qtest btw, whose personalities are just based off various pages from TV Tropes. None of them are really important to the plot atall, they're all basically the MC's doms because he's useless as all hell throughout the plot and constantly needs to be coddled. He also can't seem to figure out that all of the girls want his D despite them all literally being on it constantly. Autism is a common trend for Harem MCs apparently.\\n\\n\r\nNothing from this show is really all that memorable, the art is ok, the soundtrack is what you'd expect from a generic harem show like this, the plotline can be compared to something like Spongebob or King of the Hill. It doesn't even try to push the fanservice that much until the next season or the OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nI don't see how anyone could enjoy this show unless they've watched pretty much every other Harem out there.

I'm just your regular Joe that has a lot of anime and likes to watch em, so i wont go overly critical to my review. I'll just say write in why i scored the way i did in each of the categories given to me.\r\nStory (6-fair) - Well I've watch a lot of anime. i have over 400 in my collection. and to tell you the truth,watching all of them you'll soon realize that plots are rehashed all the time. It might be a different setting, characters, and events, but if you dig deep into the basic plot, you could usually count the different kinds they're using. This anime is no exception. its your typical harem scenes. One guy and a bunch of girls. plot line revolves around girls pilots, and the only Guy in the world who could pilot the Power Armors. of course, the girls fall in love with him because hes such a nice guy, revolving around that plot, they placed in action, power armors, and a mystery. Its not your award winning story, but if you want original, those things are usually reserved to the drama anime. I gave it a 6 because plots thin, but very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9-great) - I like the art direction to this one. Its nothing i haven't seen before, but animation is smooth and consistent. Unlike some anime, that seem to dull down when you get to the middle of the series, or seemed rushed, and cheap during some fight scenes like in gurren laggan, so far its been consistent halfway thru the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7-good) - Sound, well i really didn't notice anything good or bad about it so i gave it a 7. Its good, Not great, but not bad either. All in all, nothing significant to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8-V.Good) - Characters are good, aside from the robots and the fighting, the anime does touch up on the character development. Not so much for the girls, but more of the main star and only guy. Stories usually revolve around the girls and how they are connected to the main guy. Big diversity of characters too, given the fact that its an international school, and so far, Japan, England, France, and Germany, are represented. Good mix of characters and personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9-Great) - I really like anime like this. Nothing hard to think about, and i like the interaction of the characters. Primarily because its one of those fast anime. There are only 12 episodes to this series, its halfway, and they're very aggressive about the story telling. I like this anime also because i'm partial to Sci-Fi and Mechs, and Power armors. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8-V.Good) - Overall i gave this one an 8. I enjoy watching it, and there are a few anime out there that i do actually wait for to come out to watch the next episode. Its not a smart anime, bring nothing new to the table, but highly enjoyable. Even the little humor that is inserted here and there are noticeable. But if you taste is not like mine, you might not like it. All i can say is watch the first episode, if that doesn't hook you in, then the rest wont either. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy",

Seriously. Complete with a retarded protagonist who wouldn't know know a girl was interested in him even if she sucked his dick, a childhood friend apart for six years who will be doing some of the sucking, a big sister, a tsundere high class stereotypical blonde blue eyed english girl (definitely gonna be sucking his dick), and of course it all takes place in the over used setting ofboy in an all girls school, all the girls doing some dick sucking too. I predict a kuudere too. I don't see a yandere though it would be too thoughtful of the anime staff to put anything in there that would make you think bad things and possibly offset merchandising.\\n\\n\r\n---Characters---\\n\r\nJust looking at the character list it looks like a total rip off from strike witches (which in turn ripped off from other anime) Charlotte looks EXACTLY like Erica Hartmann, Laura Bode-whatever has that same dumb eye patch that Mio does and even Lin Yin Fang (chinese foreigner dur dur) reminds me of Lucchini. Bravo \"8bit\" and dumb producing name.\\n\\n\r\n---Sound---\\n\r\nNothing memorable. Dumb ass stupid generic OP that tries to copy what Railgun's OP did well. Don't even remember the ED was probably dumb too. No not probably, definitely.\\n\\n\r\n---Art---\\n\r\nNot bad the cgi looked a bit wonky but I don't really like cgi so I'm biased. The air fight in the beginning honestly wasn't that bad if a tad over dramatic and confusing but it was just a cock tease. ---UPDATE--- Second episode action was pretty good actually.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\r\nI'll watch the next episode but only to see the blonde tsundere's ass handed to her predictably.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Second episode slightly better than the first but the ending was SO DUMB. Ooooh why do I feel these feelings? Anh! Ichika-Sama!!! So. Dumb. So. Rehashed. I also am hating the childhood friend more and more. I've seen her character a hundred times and better.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Third episode was stupid stupid stupid. The blonde goes from absolute hatred to complete \"let me juggle your balls\" in what must be an amazing bankai hypnosis ability that the dense brick Ichika has. We introduce the stereotypical energetic chinese foreigner \"second\" childhood friend (as if one wasn't enough) who also is under Ichika's hypnosis expanding his rapidly growing cliche harem to three. Well I'm a bit wrong when I say cliche, I've never heard of having a first AND a second childhood friend but on the other hand who would be so stupid as to introduce a weak plot device like that.",

Long story short: A universe that has mechs piloted by only females , but one guy is able to pilot it without any reason.

Horny much?  Now for the girls:\r\nThe following competitors are:\r\nHouki- Stupid, USELESS, tsundere childhood friend who has the brain capacity of 10 year old.\r\nCecelia- The Ojousama of jolly good England whohas a superiority complex to Harem lead, but then gets her ass beat and turns a 360 and starts getting wet for him.\\n\\n\r\nRin- 2nd Stupid, ANNOYING, tsun-tsundere childhood friend who fails at being the next Asuka and that is one of the harem girls I show a deep animosity for.

            "content": "Infinte Stratos has absolutely dreadful plot but top notch harem romance comedy and fan service. The key to enjoying this anime is to completely ignore the attempts at plot throughout the anime while savoring the characters and their fanservice. Infinte Stratos' premise is begins with our main protagonist, Orimura Ichika, just happens to be the only male that can pilot the Infinite Stratos mecha unit, which was thought to be only compatible with females. Thus our main protagonist is sent of to the IS academy and becomes the only male in a sea of females. And by stint of being male, he becomes the mostpopular student in the academy -_-. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simply torturous to watch. Throughout the series, major story developments have been random and sporadic; the events throughout the anime seem to have no relation to one another. Major events often occur suddenly only to fade away without leaving any trace of their occurrence or importance. The premises and themes used all have their potential, they were just extremely poorly developed by sloppy writing. The societal structure of woman dominating men which would have provided numerous opportunities for genuine conflict and for Ichika to develop as a main character is completely ignored. Various fancy names and technical terms are thrown around without explanation of their significance or origin. The power levels between characters are not only ambiguous, but also inconsistent, so no apparently growth in IS piloting skill actually takes place. The complete abolition of plot would have made IS much more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development simply fails due to its ties with the plot. Ichika undergoes no development at all; his skill at pilotnig the IS as well as his thickheadedness remains constant throughout the story. The development of the girls themselves lacks the drama needed to make their supposedly difficult pasts believable, which results in a general lack of empathy for the characters. Important plot elements used in character development are grazed upon so shallowly that they fail to be thought provoking and emotion evoking and end up as just laughable. The development itself is sometimes overly drastic; some characters experience complete 180 shits in attitude and personality that do not coincide with the resolutions of their non-existent drama. \\n\\n\r\nOnce their development has been completed however, the characters become astoundingly entertaining; the actual characters are easily the strongest part of the anime. Ichika, although undergoing no development, was never really a weak or herbivorous character, given his tendency to feed and massage the ladies around him. Each female character can be easily related to a certain trope or character archetype, but they are portrayed as more than just moe anthropomorphisms of abstract personality fetishes, although this certainly does not mean that the characters are not moe. Each character is given personality traits and quirks outside of their defined trope that makes them more real and likeable; even aspects that seem trivial are given some detail. Most entertaining is the interactions between characters, the abundance of various personalities allows for different chemistry mixtures that spice up situations that are otherwise very cliched and trite. Although all the reactions are often predictable, the characters are executed soundly and the situations are still fun to watch. Easily the weakest character is our main protagonist himself, as he remains a thickheaded punching-bag for the girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality for Infinte Stratos is quite high, which is a shame given it's agonizing plot. Immediately noticeable is the cast of seiyuu; most characters are voiced by a well established seiyuu famous for her roles in other anime. Not surprisingly, the voice acting is top quality; special props goes to Kana Hanazawa for the most moe anime voice this season. The music is of satisfactory quality with a catchy opening theme and a decent ending theme. The animation for the ending theme is actually not a harem-o-meter; the most recently captured character runs closely behind Ichika and moved to the back of the line as the next character is captured. The art itself is clean and vibrantly colorful, up to today's standards as a 2011 anime. The IS personal units themselves are well designed and easily differentiable from each other. The battles themselves are quite well done, with dynamic camera movements drawn well and plenty of special effects. \\n\\n\r\nThe amount of negative reaction Infinite Stratos has received is definitely understandable; I myself at first whined and pussy bitched about the horrendous plot, and found the character interactions to be predictable and boring. However approximately half-way through the season, I finally accepted that Infinte Stratos was not the awesome mecha anime that I expected, but was instead a decent romantic comedy. Suddenly the plot became much easier to ignore since I stopped looking for it, which allowed my mind to be more positive and accepting of the character interactions, making them more entertaining. Therefore, although still accompanied by the frequent face-palm, I found myself smiling much more naturally and frequently as I watched this anime, and was sufficiently entertained.\\n\\n\r\nQuestions, comments, criticisms and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not.",

            "content": "Even before I touched the play button on Infinite Stratos (IS), all I've heard about it was \"wow so generic\", \"so boring T_T\", \"another one of those stupid harem ones\". Screw what people think, but I still started watching with a rather pessimistic opinion. IS is generic, but what's so bad about being generic? Isn't the entire definition of being general the idea that it follows the popular and majority trend? Truthfully, an anime that is only accused of being generic doesn't provide ample and concrete evidence of being a bad anime. In fact, I believe that IS is progressing rather nicely. Despite the setbackfrom the uneventful first few episodes, the later episodes really suggest some exciting developments into this \"generic\" load. Nevertheless, before you read on, think about why you even watch anime. Is it only to avoid watching generic animes and, as a result, stuffing your brain full of random crap that you don't even like or are you truly watching anime for the enjoyments and benefits it gives, regardless of the peripheral labels and whatever's been said about it? Hopefully it's the latter, because if you chose the former, then there really isn't a point in reading on since I'm pretty sure you've already made up your mind about Infinite Stratos. \\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nDespite the previous paragraph of me showering praises on IS, I'm getting out my flamethrower and shoop da whooping the story and setting. Seriously, the plot doesn't make any god dam sense. Infinite Stratos follows the life of Ichika, as he transfers to the Infinite Stratos (basically a mechanical body armor) Academy as the only guy since apparently only girls can use IS. There he meets a few childhood friends ( girls of course) and seduces a couple more distinguished students -- basically a harem type setting. When I first saw the mech stuff, I thought \"crap, what a ripoff mating between code geass and gundam.\" Hey! We have these giant bigass robot suits and we're just going to fly around in them for fun! Achieving something with IS? Tehe no need for tha- OF COURSE YOU NEED A FOKIN STORY. Seriously, screw this plot. It's illogical and pitiful. This is where the \"generic\" accusation hits Infinite Stratos hard in the nuts (or somewhere else for girls). The lack of an adamant plot development, coupled with absolutely no innovation on the mecha aspect vehemently cripples the story potential of Infinite Stratos. Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled around randomly by IS. Suddenly there's this event, then there's that event, and etc... IS doesn't show the viewers the way it's heading, if it's even heading a way. For some viewers who are ravenously persistent for a bite of plot, Infinite Stratos has left them to starve in the crappy 3-D world.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art... what can I say. I guess animes have large budgets nowadays because the art is absolutely fantastic. Ahh...Charlotte...she's drawn so cute and so awesomely 2-D styled that it really makes me feel better watching the parts with her in it and makes me feel nicer towards the entire series. If you take an incredibly obsessive preference in art like me, then Infinite Stratos will not disappoint you in that aspect. Prepare those pencils and papers, and the mouse on the pause key. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nEverytime I decide to watch an anime under the harem label, I prepare myself for immutable facepalms and headdesks at how pathetic the male character will be. Lucky for my brain cells, Ichika didn't kill as many of them as other harem animes would have (It's ridiculous how much calculus I forgot after watching certain parts of To-Love-Ru). Ichika is a bit spineless at times but overall he has the right spirit. The problem with having that typical \"I'll protect you\" spirit is that it's overused to the point where they forcefully yell it out every, oh let's say 5 minutes. And of course, that'll cause this bunch of lovey-dovey mushy crap to magically appear and ruin whatever positive feelings I have towards the anime. Ichika had less of those experiences, but nevertheless, he is still lacking the standard of determination, seriousness, and independence that I look for in male protagonists. As for the girls, all of them (except for a few of them when they are in their super WTF tsundere mode) were decent and tolerable. Laura and Charlotte were probably my favorites. Laura, for the groundbreaking determination she shows later that's rarely seen in harem types, and Charlotte simply because she's so cute.  Everytime Charlotte says \"Ichika, you pervert\" with that shy look on her face, my infinite quantum black hole of a heart melts a little. I would have given the characters a 10/10, but Ichika's lack of skill and an adamant personality, and the other average characters unfortunately lowers the aggregate score to an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nI certainly do enjoy IS very much. It gives me the feelings of living in such an academy and the excitement of endeavoring in those events (both unfulfillable in the mundane 3-D world). However, one thing that I find IS to be lacking in is consistency. During one fight, Ichika is suddenly god-hack mode powerful. In the next fight, he's pathetically weak and a pushover. This inability to adequately address his skill level on a stable standard shows mediocre planning and over-exaggeration on idea conveyance. Another hole in the enjoyment of Infinite Stratos is the predictability of some battles, and how incredibly annoying it is to always have Ichika lose the battle when he's about to win because of some retarded reasons like \"running out of energy\". Overlooking these two flaws, Infinite Stratos can be very entertaining for some personality of people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos has amazing art and pretty good characters, however, it only gets an average 7. It's tragic to see an anime with a high potential of proving itself despite being criticized for being \"generic\" only to fail miserably with the lack of a concrete plot. It's truly tragic. If the producers only spent a bit more time to develop a plot for IS, I believed that it could have well received higher scores and reviews. However to me, it seem like the producers kind of just half- assed their way through, trying to make an exciting action packed harem type anime, without actually having to plan for an exciting action packed harem type anime. You know what they say about life. \"Nothing is free\".",

            "content": "First of all i would like to start this review with the fact that THIS IS NOT AN  \"Genres: Action, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Shounen\"  but it's a  \"Harem, Romance , Mecha with a spoon of Action and a pinch of Shounen\"  , i dont even feel the need to add a Sci-fi genre considering this is a mecha anime . \r\nAnd second is that this show has nothing original in it , the Mecha looks like Strike Witches with some add on , the characters are like any harem characters , the story  ( still undeveloped )  gives you nothingto even consider a storyline or just leaves you with some questions , the sound is okey , nothing new , nothing original .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 1 :  \"The story\" \\n\r\nI would say , what story , the only things given are the fact that only females wear the mecha suits and for some reason the male character  ( THE MALE since i have seen no other males so far )  can also use them and a fight at the very beginning with an unknown  \"enemy\" . \\n\r\nAnd that is it , ohh i forgot , the scientist who created these mechas is missing? if i recall it and there are only a  \"few\"  mechas  ( a couple hundred for the entire world ) .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 2 :  \"The art\" \\n\r\nI would say it's very ordinary , nothing really stands out as good . The movements seem fluid but like i said , just ordinary .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 3 :  \"The sound\"\\n\r\nAgain , nothing special , the OP seems okeyish but it's like i seen something the same more than once and it doesn't really make it more interesting at all . \\n\r\nThe ED is far worst than the OP imo , something used like a thousand times . The only sound that is okey and blends well is probably the  \"during the view\"  sounds you encounter , they fit good enough with the scenes played .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 4 :  \"The character\"\\n\r\nThis is the worst part of this show imho . \\n\r\nYou have the thick like a brick male lead with a  \"wanabe\"cool attitude surrounded by girls ;\\n\r\nThe blonde with blue eyes  \"foreign high-class\"  stereotype with a superiority complex that  breaks?  down immediately after facing off the main male character and falls in love with him , going from hate to love in like  \"snap\"  ;\\n\r\nThe  \"childhood friend\"  who's an usual tsundere  ( like many other )  who is also a kendo master? and has a promise  ( of love probably )  with the main character that he forgot , before she had to leave  ( like many other ) ;\\n\r\nAnd in episode 3 we're introduced to  another?!  childhood friend , who is also chasing after the male character with a promise of  \"being together forever\"  that the male character conveniently misunderstood being the brick , oups i mean thick as he is ;\\n\r\nAnd the cherry on top for all of them is the fact that there are a lot of misunderstandings between them or subtext or one sided emotions that create a lot of awkward scenes that usually end up with the male character getting wacked or something like that .\\n\\n\r\nChapter 5 :  \"The enjoyment\"\\n\r\nI would like to say that i started off kind of enjoying the show , with good expectations of shounen mecha action  ( mostly because of the first minute of the show and the setting used for the show , an academy for training to fight? )  but by episode 3 kind of all of it was shattered with the 15 times use of the word  \"childhood friend\"  to  \"clear\" misunderstandings , and totally setting the show on a harem / romance path .\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL  i would say this show is like a combination of Strike Witches + Chrome Shelled Regios +  \"insert random genre/show stereotype\" x 'n' . The probably only  \"original\"  ( as in  \"i have not seen that many\" )  is the having of two  \"childhood friends\"  introduced as such , and they clearly try to sell out this in episode three one way to many times . \\n\r\nFor mecha / harem / romance fans this will be a show they probably will like , but for people who expected to see mecha / action this will be an annoying show .",

            "content": "Here's the deal: I have a dream anim\u00e9. It's a show that's primarily mecha, with the robots piloted by humans and function like body armors rather than bigass robots that tower over the skyline (Zero--and pretty much all the other Maverick Hunters--from the Megaman X franchise inspired this). I wanted a little romance on the side, and awesome fights here and there, with possibly a few moments of comic relief. Character designs should be clean and crisp, with detail in the eyes and the mecha suits. Fanservice is not desired, but allowable to an extent. A male or a female lead would be fine, solong as the female lead doesn't lead the series into a shoujo dive.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping this in mind, I searched for shows that have any one or a combination of these characteristics. I searched high and low (I wasn't aware of MAL at the time I watched Infinite Stratos), and I eventually stumbled on Infinite Stratos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n- Clean and neat, with the occasional excessive cheek tints. (AWESOME!)\\n\r\nFanservice:\\n\r\n- Bordering the allowable and the excessive, but nevertheless still allowable. (Fine.)\\n\r\nMechas?:\\n\r\n- Yes. Battle suit-style mechas. (F**K YEAH!)\\n\r\nTags:\\n\r\n- Mecha (AWESOME!)\\n\r\n- Romance (NICE)\\n\r\n- Harem (...huh?)\\n\\n\r\nThen the plot dawned me. Frankly I was initially disappointed to see that the title closest to being my dream anim\u00e9 was quite possibly the largest harem I've ever encountered (and frankly, it still is). At least Gundam 00 had 4 Gundam Meisters; Code Geass had a myriad of pilots; even Megaman X had Maverick Hunters and Navigators. And here we have Infinite Stratos, set in an instructional school in a setting where females are the only ones capable of piloting these mecha suits--with the exception of our lead character. (Whether this is positive or negative is entirely up to the reader.) I'll leave my ranting for now, and move on with my review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos introduces itself by giving us a heads-up on what's going on in their world: mecha suits called Infinite Stratos (or IS for short) are the latest in technological innovations, but only females can control them. A worldwide pact was made to prevent the use of these suits for war; instead, the suits are used for sport, and a school off the coast of mainland Japan teaches students how to use them. Obviously, the school would be an all-girls school, with a peculiar exception of a student: Orimura Ichika, the only male in the world who can pilot an IS.\\n\\n\r\nThe show manages to compress all this in one episode, which was good. The bad part was that they didn't follow it up. They didn't give so much as an amply descriptive story behind why Orimura is the only male who can control an IS (they tried it near the end of the series, and even by then it was still largely vague). Also, for some magical reason only females can pilot the suits. No explanation given. It's probably just a plot device to maintain the \"harem\" status of the series, but it doesn't help the story at all besides giving the viewers girls and more girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe 12 episodes of this series are roughly about class competitions, a single person's flashback, and one mission that was supposed to be a climactic ending but certainly fails to do so. If Infinite Stratos is bad at somethine, it's the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHere Infinite Stratos tries to redeem itself (and at least in my case the redemption effort works). Art in this show is clean and fluid--just the way I like it. People are drawn quite well, and nothing is left without detail. Even the GUIs of the students' workdesks and the classroom screens are well-made. Mechas are presented in 3D when in combat, and in 2D when in static frames. I think this is a plus, since the 3D action scenes are certainly eye-catching (I mean, with all those lasers and boosters and all that). Color schemes for the mechas aren't really stellar, but at least they match the mood of the show. Also, if you're going to do a mecha show, you have to pay attention to the mecha designs. Luckily, Infinite Stratos does this well, and the mechas certainly look great.\\n\\n\r\nEnvironment-wise, it's pretty much standard. You won't expect any vivid settings from a school that's pretty much isolated at sea, but at least they try their best to give it a futuristic feel. Personally, I liked the art direction of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose animation goes here as well, and the fight scenes are well-done. Not the type of fight scenes you'd expect from a 12-episode harem series, but still well-done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's something Infinite Stratos is definitely good at. Sound in this show is quite excellent; the quality of BGMs on battle scenes are at a level that probably won't match the storytelling. Opening and ending themes are also well-done. Look, if you want to get a general feel of Infinite Stratos without watching it, then go look for its OST tracks. You pretty much get all the good points of Infinite Stratos by listening to the OST alone. (There's no harem in OSTs, right?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't give this a score lower than 5 is because of a certain French girl (this statement also happens to be a weird Titanic reference). The rest of the characters are pretty much shallow; actually, they're just \"pretty.\" Not even the lead character stands out. Our lead Orimura is just a dense boy with a strange admiration for his older sister (no worries, it isn't incestuous); his childhood friend is the usual tsundere; the English girl is just simply arrogant and aggressive (but she's not annoying, though; I did like her at one point); the Chinese girl is also a tsundere (surprise, surprise); the French girl is the only character that has an actual backstory worthy of being called a \"backstory;\" the German girl is the one with a weird obsession for both Orimura and his sister (this is the kind of obsession you should worry about). I've pretty much described the other 4 characters. I'd really like to do defense on the French girl, but she comes out near the middle of the series, so I'll leave it for you guys to watch and find out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis might seem confusing, since I gave some components pretty low scores. I already mentioned that Infinite Stratos pretty much embodies my dream anime (only ruined by a harem element). In this sense, I did give it a chance, and I did like it. I suppose it was because of the suits? Perhaps I really just wanted to see mecha-stye battle suits. It was so close to being my dream anim\u00e9. So close.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, Infinite Stratos is lackluster. My scores for Enjoyment are pretty much fed by bias; had I had a different idea for a dream anim\u00e9, Infinite Stratos would have scored pretty low. However, if you're into harems and fanservice, and if you have the slightest interest in mechas, then you might just like Infinite Stratos. I watched the show like how I leisurely go hiking on a mountain. You don't hike to meet and talk with your fellow hikers; you hike to enjoy the view. That's what I did with Infinite Stratos: I didn't watch to understand the people inside; I really just watched for the view. And by my standards, it was a pretty good view.",

            "content": "Whenever I watch anime, I try to keep a critical mindset. This doesn't mean I examine and inspect every aspect of the show, but that I try to discern the things it does well and the things it doesn't do well so that I may develop an informed opinion of it. Sometimes, however, I don't really want to bother with that, and I just want to sit back and enjoy myself without having to worry too much about reading through the lines, and usually I'll reserve moeblob anime such A-Channel or Hidamari Sketch for this role. This time, however, I decided to go with aharem.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was not a good decision.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos has a standard harem setting: the slow, kind, and incredibly normal male main character, Orimura Ichika, transfers into an all-girls military academy that trains teenagers to pilot 'IS', highly advanced power suits which can be piloted only by women and, mysteriously, our male hero. Okay, so maybe that's not very standard, but it certainly isn't as awesome as it sounds. The all-girls setting naturally paves the way for a harem (though pretty much the whole school wants to shag Ichika), this particular one consisting of five main archety-COUGH I mean 'characters': the tsundere childhood friend, the posh foreigner, the genre-savvy bishoujo (well they're all bishoujos, really), the stoic social retard, and a second tsundere childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nNone of these characters are developed particularly well, any development being completely clich\u00e9 or just simply not existing \u2013 this is particularly evident in the case of our main character, Ichika, who remains constantly stupid, hard-headed, overly-optimistic and COMPLETELY oblivious to his harem throughout the entirety of the show. No, I don't like him, why do you ask?\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, regardless of the characterisation, the story doesn't very much help to relieve it: the opening sequence shows the group battling a mysterious IS, with heavy hints at a bigger plot in the background being dropped all over the show, with a major one presenting itself roughly halfway though. The thing is, though... that this 'secret and dark background plot' never actually happens. All the introduced implications are completely ignored by the finale and never dealt with, leaving one with a bitter taste regarding the last few episodes due to its nature as a random 'monster of the week' crisis, and whilst the 'harem' plot shows some development, it is quickly shunted back to square one.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the majority of the series focuses on Ichika's school life and the various perverted situations he finds himself caught up in. But, as a general rule, this rarely works very well, and Infinite Stratos is no different, eventually becoming outright annoying due to Ichika's obliviousness to everything. And its not exactly as if the aesthetics help matters much: the animation is low quality and in some areas, outright shoddy, using some weak form of 3D CGI for the IS suits that doesn't work very well and can be very jarring to switch to; the audio is, frankly, completely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos is an anime that achieves at, basically, absolutely nothing. Everything about it is completely standard, and represents exactly the issues the anime industry is facing with harem-based romantic-comedies. Nothing whatsoever is resolved by the conclusion, and the show just pissed me off more than anything else. As you have probably gotten by now, I don't recommend watching this in the least. 2 out of motherfucking 10.",

            "content": "PLEASE READ: This is a review of both IS seasons. Scroll to the very bottom of this review to see IS S2 review (it's legit I promise!!)\r\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with over-used generic stories. Nothing, really! Except when they're like IS. The anime that failed from the start. Though I can't say I'm surprised, with predictable story, characters, there's nothing to keep me guessing or wondering what's going to happen next.\r\nI can sum up the story with a couple of common words:\r\nBoy\r\nGirl(S)\r\nHigh school\r\nMechas\r\nNow go ahead and guess: Will the story be interesting or not?\r\nThere you go.\r\nInstead of putting us into a world where thereality of a Woman > Man type world with mechas and perhaps applying Marshall Mcluhan's four laws to that, and showing us the complexities of it's layout. Instead we get, teen boy hustled by horny teen girls.\\n\\n\r\nPlot? Oh I'm sorry, THAT WAS THE PLOT!!! \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty though: the story takes a while to introduce the full cast using a few episodes dedicated to each girl. In some parts there are fights and a tournament, terrorists yadda yadda blohmadda.\\n\\n\r\nThe art suffice to say was, great!(it is in no way close to any of the other factors in terms of weight) The settings were detailed enough so I could recognize the general things. You could identify the main characters easily as well (although you can't remember their names cause they're blander than me blending water). The fights were, pretty good but the MC should really ask people to stop giving his butt to him as a damn Christmas gift. All I can say is, decently-good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine as well, but no really interesting music to get your blood pumping.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Shit. Now I know what you're thinking, \"Hey don't be too harsh, the characters are vibrant and have different personalities\". I say NO. Let me explain:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes a good character? Personality sure! but what other qualities should they have? A decent art model yes. But what makes the character         -stand out from the rest-? There we go. \\n\\n\r\nPicture those 5 girls. Imagine in your head about how they interact with Ichika. Now take away Ichika. What do you see now? Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nYou know that saying where you say \"I can't imagine X without X\". Yeah well that's mostly used in a positive context. Here? Bad.\\n\\n\r\nOk I found their names and here: let's see how this goes now.\\n\\n\r\nHouki: Childhood Tsundere. Enough said.\\n\r\nCecilia: Proud, stuck-up rich girl who likes Ichika.\\n\r\nRin: Chinese Loli (pig-tails are bonus OH YEAH!!)\\n\r\nCharlotte: Blonde girl who tried to be a guy.\\n\r\nLaura: Angry German Loli with military background.\\n\r\nBONUS: Chifuyu: Angry older sister, constantly hits Ichika. Gets mad at him for unfair reasons.\\n\r\nBONUS: Tabane: Created the idiocy that was IS.\\n\\n\r\nSee? Aside from the 2 bonus characters, I can't see any sort of character in these Haremettes. All I see is some saltless-butter of a bunch of dolls. This is the problem in most harems. (ignoring the fact that harems in general suck) The girls are nothing without the dumb MC to anchor them to be pseudo realistic in any sense. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot Ichika.\\n\r\nHe sucks......I won't go too much into it I'll point form it.\\n\\n\r\n-Too stupid to exist.\\n\r\n-Boring personality\\n\r\n-Scared of girls\\n\r\n-Did I mention boring?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I forced myself to watch this because it was so bad, I really had to see just to what extent of bad this was. No I don't torture myself to watch anime, I did this as a self experiment to see just what to expect when going into this type of genre. It didn't disappoint my expectations at least (good!) because they were zero (oh...). But seriously, I was bored as heck. I was very tempted to skip to the second halves of the episodes to see some action... then to my dismay finding out that there was no action in some episodes. Boring Boring Boring. *SPOILER* Not even that climactic battle with Laura was good, it was just stupid in all places. *END SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was bad, I'd hate to see it's manga/LN version because I bet that's a bunch of useless writing.\\n\\n\r\nI obviously expected too much from this anime. No wrong. I expected too much of what I WANTED from this anime. Instead, it did the usual pander otaku schtick and rolled with it. Obviously it was a harem/romance/romcom/highschool/mecha anime. But still, just seeing these always piss me off at how blatantly Japan doesn't care to try and even try something new for once.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings could really have been expanded on. Like I said, Marshall Mcluhans 4 laws could have been applied here.\\n\\n\r\nEnhancement: No brownies here, this is too easy to explain.\\n\\n\r\nReversal: Instead of it's intended purpose of space exploration, it could have added on to that, explaining how technology can be manipulated into a purpose of reversal.\\n\\n\r\nRetrieve: What earlier actions/service could have been brought back because of the intricacies of IS? \\n\\n\r\nObsolesce: What does this technology make obsolete. Again too easy.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have showed these 4 laws applied in greater detail. EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW MARSHALL MCLUHAN, there could have been some more focus on looking at the mechs do stuff. But no, Ichika and his teenage crisis with his girls is wayy more important. (sigh)\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said. It was doomed from the start when it said Harem, Ecchi and those buzz words right off the bat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAnyways here's my IS S2 review.\\n\\n\r\nIt's shit.\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you take a guy and put him in a school full of girls? You get the piece of garbage known as Infinite Stratos! Oh light novels how I adore you!\r\nBack when I was a young anime fan I absolutely loved this show since I was a dumb fourteen-year-old adolescent who was only watching anime just to see some boobs. And while my love for boobs has only grown with more conviction and strength over the years, my taste in narrative has certainly changed a lot as well with my ever growing disdain for light novel adaptations. In this work ofmasterclass story writing, the author decided that the plot would involve the shy and bland light novel guy archetype. This version of light novel guy is incredibly dense. Like REALLY dense. Like REALLY dense. I cannot possibly empathise how actually dense the main character is in words since the brilliance of Light Novel Guy has transcended words alone and moved up to another plane of existence beyond what is possible for human comprehension. I say this because NO damn guy would ever react the way in which Light Novel Guy does or could possibly be this dense.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, before I get into Light Novel Guy allow me to explain the 'plot' for this anime. Set in the future, Japan has developed mecha exoskeleton suits called the 'Infinite Stratos\" or IS for short. However, for some reason (the show never actually explains why) only women are able to control and power these machines, that is, until one day, Light Novel Guy touches one of the suits and for some reason he becomes the only man in the world to be able to control and use the IS suit, in which he is shortly sent to a school  in which he is taught how to properly manage and use the IS suit for combat. And that's it. The narrative goes nowhere with its idea or theme. Every now and again, the show will introduce a new character to spice things up or randomly throw in some villain out of thin air but the show remains incredibly linear. It's a shame too since there is so much wasted potential. Think about it. A world in which only women can control these suits resulting in a monopoly in both power and in war. The show could of delved into gender roles, the dominance of females over males, how society has changed as a result of this invention but the writer does nothing. Just throw a bunch of women, create a harem and show a bunch of tits. Obviously this tactic worked, considering the immense popularity of this show. It's unfortunate how light novels don't even have to try to be good for them to be a hit with filthy weebs.\\n\\n\r\nWith the 'plot' out of the way let's get back to explaining Light Novel Guy. As I said, Light Novel Guy is incredibly dense, like many other Light Novel leads but in this show you wonder how the guy is still alive and able to perform basic human functions since he is that clueless and stupid. Every time a girl is clearly tying to confess their love to him he doesn't even realise even when it is so obvious. Speaking of that, why on Earth do all these girls fall in love with this guy so easily? I mean, sure he the only guy in the entire school but I think sand-paper would be a better alternative to this guy. Light Novel Guy has the personality of a brick wall with no likeable characteristics or even motivation. He is simply a person who exists in this universe that just so happens to be at the centre of this narrative. He does nothing, he is nothing and I'm getting bored just talking about him so let's move on. \\n\\n\r\nAlright, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for the shot-gun round in which we blow through the rest of the supporting cast! Let's go!\\n\\n\r\nHouki is the childhood friend with big boobs and also happens to be a Tsundere. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nCecilia is the British Big Boobed one. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nLingyin is another childhood friend. She is Chinese. She has small boobs. She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nLaura is the Nazi, I mean the German one who gets a SMALL amount of backstory and development but hardly enough time is spent on her to flesh her out. Guess what? She falls in love with Light Novel Guy.\\n\\n\r\nIf it sounds like I'm being really vague and lazy with these characters, that's because the show doesn't give me a lot to work with. All of them are equally generic and boring and going through them individually would essentially just be me repeating the same thing over and over again. However, there is one character that does get some development, when compared to the rest of the cast anyway. A full episode is devoted to developing Charlotte's character and her backstory, while not entirely original or even all too fleshed out in the grand scheme of things, was actually handed with a lot of care. Sure, she does fall in love with Light Novel Guy after this and her character goes nowhere after that but at the very least there was something. I just find is really annoying that all of the girls fight over this guy as if they were moths attracted to a flame.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the fights, I felt them to be entirely boring. The IS suits are CG but in all honesty it's not too bad; it's just that the fights lack tension. These suits are so goddamn strong that it removes any narrative steaks the show may of had. In addition, Light Novel Guy also has about a million power-ups at the most convenient of times to save the day or to win in a fight which, again, removes any tension from any fight. It doesn't exactly help either when about ten million boob shots and ass shots are shoved into my face every single second. The show does try to make some scenes really dramatic but they're undercut by the tits flying left, right and centre. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service is a big part of this show and I find it tasteless to say the least. Every event or arc is simply an excuse just to reveal as many breasts as possible since the show has no aims or narrative. This problem, believe it or not, is even worse in the second season but that's for another day. Now, I want to elaborate that I have nothing against fan-service in anime. To be perfectly honest, I enjoy it from time to time since I am being pandered to, and hey, that's how those things kind of work, but when your show is nothing but panty and boob shots, it feels like a desperate attempt at keeping the audience's attention since the narrative or characters are not strong enough to do it on their own. When a show uses an abundance of fan-service it is generally a clear indication of bad writing (unless the entire show is built around the theme of sexuality such as Kill la Kill) as the author uses it more so as a selling point for his work rather than through an interesting story. I understand why it is used; to fish interest in this heavily saturated and competitive industry, but I often lose respect because of it. If it were something like Bakemonogatari, where they intermix fan-service with unique and creative shots, with great dialogue, I'd be fine. But this show doesn't have that at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is alright; I did like the opening and ending tracks however. They're generic pop but they work and are very catchy none-the-less. Infinite Stratos is yet another example of a terrible Light Novel adaptation and proves that just by throwing a bunch of tits on screen, anime fans will eat it up. It worked on me when I was fourteen, so I'm sure it's working on others. Although this brings up the question. Why am I watching this now if it clearly is not aimed at me? Why should I care what the fourteen-year-olds are doing? That's because these fans deserve better than this. Just because a show is aimed at a particular audience, it still is no excuse to be absolutely lazy with your writing and storytelling. Anime, despite all of it's mishaps, is a medium in which holds some of my favourite pieces of media ever created. The genre has a lot of potential, which is why it saddens me to see this show, which is so badly and lazily put together become more popular than actually good shows out there. Either way, Light Novel Guy can go fuck himself, but then again, he is too dense to probably even understand what 'fuck' means...\\n",

            "content": "I haven't read the manga yet and the review is simply based on this anime, I'm fully aware that there are still a couple of more episodes to go, and it is too early to make any conclusions. Ok, amigos how do I rate this anime:\r\nStory- 7\r\nOk, so the anime is about a girl genius, Tabane Shinonono, who invented an exoskeletal suit called \"Infinite Stratos\" or \"IS\" for short, which  can only be operated by women thus gives them greater dominance in society and  leaving men to be wussies ( I wonder what happen to the nukes?) but the story is more focuson the misadventures of the un-expecting Ichika the only muchacho who can operated an IS and with his harem, other genres are  trivial, but it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6\\n\\n\r\nArtistically-wise, It's good, but the technicality bad. Well, I'm referring to the mechs or IS's in a technical way is too overly decorated. Going to the school uniform, well, the way it is drawn it kinda conforms to the time but as in any school genre it  ain't 100% uniformed, co'z every girl in the academy sport a different style: like when it comes to their socks: some wore high knee, some wore low knee, while there are others sport ankle length socks and as always they come either in black or white, but quite a few wore panty hoses . There is the shoes, which loafers are the usual choice by many, while quite a few have there own style of foot wear and let's not forget the skirt's length, in a schools genre the length of the skirt is either short or very short (Oh my I can see their panties from here), but rarely does it goes long, and in the case of this anime, I'd say that this is the only one that I know which the length of the skirt or the whole uniform itself (since it is worn like a one piece dress with 3 layers beneath ) whose length varies from one girl to another.    \\n\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\\n\r\nI just like the opening theme, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nIchika Orimura - As it is said he is the only muchacho in the academy, actually he never intended to attend the academy in the first place . It's just that he happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and can't seem to keep his hands to himself when he touched an IS, which by the way it reacted to him, thus he got drafted into the academy and he seem to do pretty good in getting into a lot of uncomfortable situations involving his harem. And as in any harem genre, he is oblivious and very much indecisive as what to do with them,  he operates a Byakushiki  a close quarter melee IS and he only has Yukihira type 2 saber as his weapon because of his kendo background, not surprising since he was trained by his Nazi sister Chifuyu.\\n\\n\r\nHouki Shinonono - Ichika's childhood friend (the 1st one), she's a tsundere which make up part of the harem, she and the muchacho (male lead) could have been lovers if she and her family were not not taken away and placed under protective custody due the sensitivity of her sister's work. She's an top notch kendo (and Iaido) practitioner, and she looks good in the uniform that she wore, in fact her style really trends up to that particular time (which is the future). She harbors feelings for the muchacho, however she can also kick his butt......when she's jealous and pissed. She's the first chica who slept with the muchacho (in separate beds of course) and she was almost see naked ( unintentionally that is). Since we now know what her personal IS look like which is the Akatsubaki, it is yet to know as to what it is capable of, judging from her kendo and iaido skills it is believe that her unit is a close quarter melee .\\n\\n\r\nCecilia Alcott - the 2nd girl who entered the muchacho's life, overall, she's a bitch at first to the muchacho but later on warms up, she always brags about her being part of royalty (even if she's just been orphaned....according to info) and being a representative from the UK (my ass). She's very clingy to the muchacho and would be rude to anyone who comes near him, she's the forth girl which the muchacho has see naked (being topless in the beach counts and it's her fault ). Her uniform make her look like a granny, well she would look hotter if she wore the same style as Houki. She operates the Blue Tears a sniper platform IS, not much for a melee, since she relies on her unit's drones to get close to an opponent.\\n\\n\r\nRin (or Lin) Yin Fang - 3rd chica to come into the muchachos life, actually she's suppose to be the 2nd girl into his life since she happens to be the muchacho's  2nd childhood friend, she's rather petite, flat chested and wore her uniform like a whore, but she make up for being a good cook ( according to info) though in this anime she only presented the muchacho her sweet and sour pork dish and she can also be a handful for the muchacho when she's pissed or jealous. she has a medium melee or  frontal assult type of IS which is the Sheng Long, which aside from having Impact Cannon, it is also equipped  2 big meat cleavers when joint up it becomes a spear with 2 tips at opposite sides, I guess she's a kung-fu practitioner to have that kind of melee weapon.\\n\\n\r\nCharles or Charlotte Dunios - 4th chica to come by, at first she was able to fool the muchacho that she's a man (and so as everyone else), until he accidentally saw her naked while taking a shower, which by the way she's the 1st girl whom the muchacho has accidentally seen naked, twice, (being in the men's bath doesn't count, and Houki doesn't count either) and she the 2nd chica whom the latter slept with - in separated beds of course. Unlike other members of the muchacho's harem, she's more open minded and she's the only one whom the muchacho can related to . At first she wore a male uniform with a close turtle neck, then later on she sports a female school uniform, but the sneakers make her look like a middle schooler . Her IS is a mass produced 2nd generation unit called \"Rafale Revive\" which is a versatile multiple weapons platform, capable of sniping, assault and close quarter melee, and is probably be a formidable match to everyone else  except for Laura's IS. Later on she decided to come out clean and declared that she's a girl and not a boy to the disgust of everyone else towards the muchacho, so much so that he's about to be killed by a jaded Rin.     \\n\\n\r\nBodewig Laura - the 5th chica to come by and gave the muchacho a slap in the cheek ,  she's a genetically designed super soldier  (according to info) and has a VT system implanted in her. Her school uniform makes her look like a member of the Nazi since she did came from Germany, at first she dislike the muchacho because she blames him for her idol (Chifuyu) for leaving Germany, but after beating her in the tournament with help from Charles or Charlotte she warms up to the muchacho and even giving him his first kiss.  She also declared him to be her husband (though they are not even married yet) after saving him from a jaded Rin and she's the 2nd chica whom the muchacho saw her naked which she intended it or maybe she really does sleep naked, she's the 3rd chica whom the muchacho slept with... in the same bed this time and nothing happen between them. Her Schwarze Regen is a heavy artillery, assault and a close quarter type IS, which is equipped with an AIC that can be used as a defensive shield against an incoming assaults or attacks. She's also a member of Schwarzer Hase special forces in Germany whose members also wore ridiculous eye patches even if they have both their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOrimura Chifuyu - Ichika's big sister and is also his homeroom teacher, she's also his first kendo instructor . She the muchacho's only immediate family, she's a highly skilled kendo and iaido practitioner, she competed in various Mondo Grosso tournament and won (why don't they just call it an IS tournament?) except in the finals where she had to drop out in order to save his brother. She has a Nazi like method when teaching, dealing and training her students and seem to have dominatrix attitude with the way she dress and the way she wore a bikini and probably the way she wore her lingerie.\\n\\n\r\nYamada Maya - Ichika's other class instructor who looks too young to be one and seems to be the same age as a 3rd year student, but her big boobies and sweet character make up for her kiddie stature.\\n\\n\r\nTabane Shinonono- Houki's big sister,  who sports rabbit ears and wore a granny dress, she has a voice of a girl from the 6th grade. She designed the exoskeleton unit called \"Infinite Stratos,\" she was able to exercise leverage against any nations who wanna use her design for war by implement an \"IS Treaty\" that regulates the used and distribution of the IS units. \\n\\n\r\nOthers-.......well they are just trivial, so why such rating, co'z I like the way the how the author designates  the roles and situations of the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell' let's face it, what makes this anime enjoyable is the muchacho's way with his harem, which  get's him in a lot of cabeza del dolor (headaches). Also, the IS units who were duking out with one another, but the main piece de resistance is the ultimate battle with a drone and knowing as to who the main villain is. Which, by the way I'm suspecting Tabane Shinonono since she designed the IS in the first place and she's the only who has a monopoly with the IS Core design so it's possible that she can make an IS capable of functioning without a human operator.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's enjoyable and that's that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The main character is a retard who happens to be the ONLY male in the world to be able to operate an IS. The reasoning for this is explained later in the series, but if you haven't watched it then I won't say how. Did I mention how he had a sister complex? Anyway, this show contains almost all the harem cliched elements that one show could have.\r\nElements:\r\n[X] Tsundere\r\n[X] Robot Girl (Laura)\r\n[X] Retarded male character\r\n[XX] Childhood friends\r\n[X] Girl with glasses\r\n[X] Reverse trap\r\n[X] Bossy older sister\r\n[X] Main character walks into someone else changing(This happens way too often -___-)\\n\\n\r\nThose are the things that I remember seeing off the top of my head. I watched the show around 3 months ago and just now decided to write reviews. Anyway, Ichika is also oblivious to the extremely obvious signs that the females are giving showing that they want the D and it's not even funny. It's actually really annoying and stupid.\\n\r\nI think this is how it went down:\\n\r\nIchika: \"I'll go out with you.\"\\n\r\nHouki: \"R-really?!\"\\n\r\nIchika: \"Out shopping that is!\"\\n\r\nMe + Houki: -_____-\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nThe artwork is average. It doesn't look any different than any other show that aired around the same time. Pretty standard modern anime designs. Nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe sound is  average, but I really liked the ED. I downloaded the song. Nothing really needs to be said about this other than average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty bad. Cecilia was really annoying and went from tsun to dere in one episode. It might not really be a big deal, but that's just not right. Ichika is a complete idiot and gives off the idea that he has no fucking clue what is going on around him and somehow that gives him the attention of the entire academy. The girls there must have low standards or not like men with brains at that school.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nHonestly, the only thing I enjoyed about this show would have to be Charlotte. I'm a huge moefag and she was just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nThis show is really no different than any other harem. It's pretty average. If you like average, then this is the show for you. If you like looking at pretty faces, then I recommend you watch this show.",

The story mostly surrounds a boy who gets put into an all girls school because he's the only male that can operate these machines. Why is he the only male? Why can females only use them? Don't ask, you're here for tits. This is the equivalent of to love ru but with mechas. But don't get too carried away because there is no advancements from the MC to the females. \r\nThe main character is basicallyautistic so get used to him not catching on to the clues that the girls around him want the cock. He also needs help because he literally can't do shit so that's when the girls come in to aid him in everything.  Now i can dive into a super informative review of how this anime sucked or how it did decent or whatever, but you don't need to.You sit there, pop a squat (or occasionally pop a stiffy) and you watch for tits and ass and all that. Want amazing plot or just a good romance? Spice and wolf or Toradora. Want a good Mecha? Idk any good mecahs but find one that's highly ranked and go for it. Same goes for season 2 of this show since the formula is repeated. \\n",

            "content": "In general, harem shows are often just about the ecchi/romance and focuses very less on the actual plot that it's constructed on. \r\nNevertheless, I watch many harem anime just for the lols and the fanservice moments. Sometimes, the character interactions are fun too. \r\nWhere I.S. failed even in doing this much is with its extremely annoying main character, Orimura Ichika. I can't write an unbiased opinion of him because I just hate him so much. \r\nThere is a fair line of how much your character can be based of a stereotype, Ichika is so overly generic (the extremely dense harem king who just gets thepanties wet) that you wish he was gay just so that it would be one of the best trolls ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about a type of mech that was engineered in Japan and can only be used by women. However when Ichika touched one by mistake, they discovered that he was the only male who could operate it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, he gets transferred into an all girls school and instantly, all the girls fall in love with him. Yep, that's the story.............. (-_-)\\n\\n\r\nI watched through it waiting for it to get so bad that it became good but that never happened. I would much appreciate if this became a yuri in an all girls school with Charlotte Dunois as the main character. That ought to bring some fun to this bland piece of trash.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope creators of shows don't assume that if a show looks pretty and has some streotypes thrown in, it would instantly make them a profit.\\n",

            "content": "Ohhhhh sweet! A decent looking mecha series!\r\nWell that\u2019s what I first thought when I picked up Infinite Stratos.  However I would soon realize that I was totally wrong.  The series opens up with an amazing battle lasting for about 90 seconds which shows off some stunning animations and visuals, it also makes the series seem promising.  Then we get to the real story, if you can even call it that.\r\nInstead of calling this the \u201cstory\u201d section I would like it to be called the \u201ccontent\u201d section because there is only sort of a plot in the last 2 or 3 episodes.The plot presented in the end wasn\u2019t even that good because there was hardly any build up to it. So for the most part we aren\u2019t given a plot, which isn\u2019t the problem because if done right a series with no plot could become really successful.  However, like many, it doesn\u2019t do this right.  Each episode would focus on a character or two but the series didn\u2019t even distribute the episodes evenly.  I think they gave maybe 5 episodes to Charlotte and maybe about 1 or 2 to each of the other characters.  However the things that happened in these episodes felt boring and it was just really another textbook Harem with the addition of ISs. \\n\r\nThe characters themselves weren\u2019t even done too well.  Our male lead Ichika really is one of those weak, clueless harem leads, who does one nice thing for each female, getting them to all fall for him.  I really want to know the magic spell that makes all these useless male protagonists have endless amounts of females falling for them but I guess some things remain a mystery.  Why on Earth did the IS have to choose him!?\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters are better but they still had problems. Perhaps it was because there were too many characters in the series and they weren\u2019t given enough time to develop.  But I think the real problem was that some of their personality traits were unrealistic.  Some of the girls would get overly jealous when they saw Ichika with another girl and some characters would even have their whole personality change when they saw Ichika.  Another problem I found was that some girls would appear to be super powerful one week but when a new girl was introduced they would some how lose all that power.  The characters aren\u2019t bad actually and the majority of them are likeable but they could\u2019ve been better if they just toned down the jealousy a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing though, the designs of the ISs were stunning and the battles themselves were really satisfying to watch.  The animation is up to par with most anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn\u2019t really something I pay attention to.  The opening and ending were catchy and the background music seemed alright (although I only listened to it sometimes) and the voice actors seemed to fit the character that they were playing.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were many things that I could think were wrong with the series, Infinite Stratos was actually something I wanted to watch every week.  Yes I did face palm quite a bit when watching this, but at the end of the day I did find this entertaining and it did make me laugh sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day I still felt that the final product of Infinite Stratos could\u2019ve been much better.  It\u2019s not bad but I was disappointed in the direction the series went.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)\\n",

            "content": "I was going to write a review for this earlier, but I decided to rewatch the entire series in one sitting before I did. Infinite Stratos was not what was advertised, I was expecting something completely different than what I got. And the answer is yes, this is not a good show. It will not be remembered in 10 years. The only way that will happen is if the light novels do something drastic. But if it was a bad show, why is my score so high?\r\nInfinite Stratos' story is simple enough, 5 girls all find out ways how to get in Ichika's pants. Theyhaven't really given another story for me to consider, which is expected as apparently the story in the light novels doesn't pick up until the 5th one. So right now, it is a generic harem with mechs. But these mechs aren\u2019t any normal mechs; they can only be piloted by females. Or so the world thought until Ichika stumbled upon a personal IS. He is the first, and as of now, the only male able to pilot them. I can only guess that it has something to do with magic, as physically, males are much stronger than females. Another theory suggests that females can fit into an IS and males can't because females do not have a penis, and Ichika's is so small he is able to pilot one. The story is the shows weakest aspect and do not watch this if you are looking for a deep compelling plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe second weakest aspect of this show is the characters. We have our dense protagonist, Ichika, who couldn't tell if a girl liked him even if she were sucking his dick. He is the definition of clueless and it is quite frustrating to watch him be completely oblivious to all of the girls around him. Then we have our harem members: Houki (Japan), Cecilia (Britain), Rin (China), Charlotte (France) and finally Laura (Germany). Houki doesn't really have any redeeming qualities, except for tits that can sink the titanic. I'm not sure what is up with Japanese girls having the biggest breasts out of any other girl in every anime, but Houki is no exception. Oh, and she's a tsudere... I guess. Cecilia is the stereotypical British snob who makes terrible food. That's the best summary I can give of her as I literally do not know what else to write. Rin is the smallest of all the girls, and never really got anywhere with Ichika. She has a short temper, I guess. But other than that she gets the least amount of screen time. Charlotte is by far the best and hottest character on the show. She has many redeeming qualities including boobs that can change size for the convenience of the plot, deep purple eyes and silky white skin. Not even Ichika, the gayest of the gay harem main characters can resist that... Or so I thought. She is the best character on the show in my opinion. Then we have Laura, the warmongering German who sneaks into Ichika's bed at night. She apparently isn't aware that sleeping in the same bed as a boy naked might give him the wrong (or right, depending how you look at it) impression. Aside from Charlotte, the show has no memorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound in this show is excellent. I typically don't like CG effects in anime but this show does it excellently. The mech fights are beautiful and fast paced. The way the camera moves during them makes you feel like you're part of the battle. The music during the battles is usually hit and miss, but the battles that have good music are noticeably better. The OP and ED are J-pop, so I wasn't a fan of them. There is also not one average looking girl in this show, they are all extremely hot.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this shows flaws, and it has a lot of flaws, I found myself thoroughly enjoyed and thoroughly annoyed at the same time. I am fully aware that this show is bad, but it's so bad it's good. If you want to sit back and watch some mindless entertainment, look no further as Infinite Stratos fits this bill perfectly.",

            "content": "Honestly, IS had all the ingredients to be a great series.\r\nArt (8) and Sound (8) are both wonderful, the animations were great, action scenes were eye-catching, pretty girls were darn pretty, the new Mecha idea was fresh and interesting, the settings were nice, etc etc etc. After the first few episodes I really had high hopes for IS to be able to at least match up against, say, Highschool DxD. But no. IS turned out to be a project with great potential but no ambition.\r\nIt's not like I don't like Ecchi and Harem. I like fan service a lot too. But watching Is I couldn'thelp thinking that it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you what I'm on about.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nThe story couldn't have been simpler. Orimura Ichika, a male student, is thrown into an academy, which trains it's students to pilot the IS weapon system. As it turns out, he is the only male in the ENTIRE school full of young girls looking for a boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nReally? Come on man...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe only male character, Ichika, is an idiot and after intense training from elite students, has OK piloting skills. He is somehow entirely oblivious about the fact that every female in the academy loves him because there's no one else to fall in love to.\\n\r\nAnd then there's the girls. There's the childhood friend (Houki), the prideful blond (Cecelia), the Loli (Lin), the shy girl (Charlotte), and genetically engineered super soldier (Laura), all trying desperately to get Ichika to love them. But Ichika obviously doesn't know that despite many obvious attempts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\r\nOverall, it's a huge let down from my expectations after the first 2 or 3 episodes. There were many copy and paste works and many events in the series were overused. \\n\r\nIn IS they tried to have a bit of everything. Romance, comedy, ecchi, harem, action, mecha, science fiction, the lot. But it just didn't work out. Maybe too many ingredients spoils the soup too.\\n\r\nAnd the most frustrating thing was that, it could have been so much greater! The only redeeming point was the great artwork, soundtracks and the background music which, unlike the story and the characters, were quite outstanding.",

            "content": "Many anime I've seen using the incredibly clich\u00e9 theme of harem generally come out the same, with characters seeming to all fall into a very similar rut at which point you soon start finding every single almost identical to the characters of many other anime. Quite often a somewhat gimmicky twist is tossed in that is supposed to refresh the watcher and make that anime rise above others of the same type. This anime doesn't break that mold, but it creates a great set of characters, and it'll keep you laughing.\r\nStory: The story is probably the biggest lacking factor of this show, it leaves youwanting more story in a way that turns you off. It featured an annoying amount of plot holes, with somewhat crazy crap happening with no specific reason. If you are in the least bit versed in any anime of a similar kind, you will see \"twists\" a mile away. Even though the show features mech battles, they are quite infrequent, and are rarely long enough to satisfy mech enthusiasts.It does hit the typical ecchi anime bumps every ecchi anime hits, with the main lead always accidentally fall on the women around him and then as such, slaps him and gets incredibly mad (blah blah blah). It does have it's golden moments though, and when you finish it, you will be wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Genuinely surprised me. The mechs are throughly detailed, beautifully animated,and the mech battles appropriately flashy and very well done. The characters all have little details that are rarely forgotten when the characters are shown, even if for a brief moment. The varied use of colors makes it pleasing to the eyes, never sinking into territory too dark, light, or bland unless trying to give off that vibe, to which point it displays it well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song is just the typical anime opening, nothing special but at least it's not grating or saccharine sweet like many others I've seen. But when it comes down to matter of sound effects, voice acting, ambient noise, and non-opening music, it does it's job well, making the sound an important part of the show overall, as sound should.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Most characters are well fleshed out, and have a few traits to put them above the rest of the pack. I would have probably given it a 10 for characters if it weren't for how annoying they made the lead character. He is pretty much the \"Oh no! My friends are in danger, I'll go save them even if all my limbs are torn off and my body burned to ashes!\" Although that may be an exaggeration, the main character is painfully similar to so many others. I understand that how oblivious he is adds to some of the comedy, but it's just so predictable and painful to have such a character. He's probably not as bad as I portray him to most, but there is definitely a pattern. Like I said, all the other characters are well done, and are a breath of fresh air in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend you watch this if you are a fan of romantic comedy, ecchi, harem, high school life, and those who like mechs get a fair share of what they desire. As the show does typically forgo the action in turn of a perverted accident scene, mech-heads will enjoy the detail put into each mech and mech battle, no matter how few there are. The characters are typically wonderful and consistent. The show looks great. Although the story isn't the best I've seen, it in no way hinders this fine show. It's sad how inconclusive they made the ending,  but it hints to another season when plot holes can be filled and we can be reintroduced to such great characters.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Highly Recommended",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is a tale of one boy and a huge harem. Ichika is the only male able to pilot a IS well he is always the center of attention. Unfortunately, I could count the fights on one hand while it would take two to fit the female harem members or at least the ones with names. That\u2019s not to say that there isn't anything to enjoy in this school setting story... right?\r\nEvery country gets one personalized IS machine and send their representative to the school where he is located for training. There are plenty of others that get the old run down machines essentially.Ichika, being the only male pilot, gets his own personal machine\u2026 That about sums up the uniqueness of our lead. Otherwise he is dense, but of course too kind for his own good. Typical. However if you are going to watch this harem, then the only thing that matters is the female characters right?\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are good, but even if you start to like one they are introduced one after the other. In total there are 6 in his harem and if you take into account there is twelve episodes\u2026 Well as soon as one is introduced the next one comes to steal your attention. There is little development in the characters never mind the relationships.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is any reason I liked this show it would be Charles. He being the second male IS pilot steals away Ichika from the other females as Ichika tries to bond with this new male presence in a sea of women. Charles is one of the most intelligent and capable characters in the show, and makes the show much more likable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that cannot save something that has no plot. A story centered on mechs that don't have battles\u2026 That doesn't sound very entertaining does it? It seems by episode 10 rolled around they finally finished the introductions and decided to introduce the story. It was just too late. This is the norm for harem shows as they focus on each girl's episode and like IS, they run out. Thankfully they fall back onto battles, but at this point it is too late. If your looking for another average harem be my guest because there is no hidden gems in this show. Hence, i reward it with what MAL calls average: a five out of ten.",

            "content": "Lets make this short.\r\nSummary: Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old Japanese boy who starts a busy high school life surrounded by nothing but girls who can use IS.\r\nThis anime is for people who wants\r\n-light-hearted stuffs\r\n-Harem comedy\r\n-MC who is an average nice guy but sometimes really dumb and relies on others\r\n-Girls falling in love with him after being defeated [ how retarded this is]\r\n-Girls from different countries o.O with different personalities\r\n-Mecha battles\r\n-a little bit of plot\r\n-hot chicks & TsundereS\r\nNot for people who wants\r\n- Seriousness \r\n- Two-sided romance\r\n- Super Intense Mech fight/battles\r\n- Deep plot\r\n- Smart and cool and op MC who understands everything\r\n- more than 2 teachers in theclass.\\n\r\n- Dual Gender Academy\\n\r\n- yanderes\\n\\n\r\nThe Story \\n\r\nInfinite Stratos has a generally well-written story . It has its own originality and it was developed quite smoothly. The mecha stuffs were average as compared to other mecha shows. It is mainly because the story revolves around the love aspect. So its basically like a comedy-harem plot with an extra \"mecha\" aspect to simply prevent it to be like any typical harem anime\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe visuals were standard as They focused more on the interactions between the characters . However the character designs were really great. As you can see from the poster, the character designs were above average and we can really pick off any emotions that characters try to hide, just from their facial expressions . And the character designs highlights every individual in the show and portray them more efficaciously .\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OP and ed was catchy and worth listening to , However the sound effects were horrible. They did not stand out and left no impressions. The sound effects literally did nothing in the entire anime but fortunately there's the great art to back up for it\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the anime. In merely 12 episodes , Infinite Stratos have to micro manage and cover 6 main characters . Of course with the first episode as introduction being left out , 11 episodes to develop the characters were simply insufficient. Another of a harem member kept joining the crew and there's no time to stop ,and understand more about every single character. Almost all the characters were briefly introduced and we do know anything beyond that. At least the \"main\" main character ; Houki was at least more concisely introduced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall\\n\r\nEven though this anime has its flaws , i believe its worth your time . I really enjoyed it and i had fun watching all different personalites coming in at once.\\n\r\nBut dont ever watch this seriously , instead try to enjoy it because of its humour and its light-heartedness.\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nSound-5\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nOverall-7",

            "content": "Hi kids, ever wonder which show killed the LN industry and is responsible for the protagonist-kuns that we get every season? \r\nHere it is then, IS, also called \"the wall of shit that blocks masterpieces\", it got this nickname when it out sold almost all other animes in merchandising and made a huge buck causing almost all the studios to go, \"holy balls, why are we trying hard to make a story when we can just stick in some tits and wait for the cash to start rolling\". And even though this putrid work is now died, its legacy lingers on creating the genre ofLN which is now know as \"pretty pictures and toilet paper\" (including works like cavalry, asterisk, bahamut and many more).\\n\\n\r\nSo for this reason alone it is worthy of the magnificent 1/10 simply because you can't gave 0 out of 10. now on to the actual review\\n\\n\r\nStory - 0 \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any, and if you think any otherwise you are wrong, cause nothing matters, its all excuses, for tits. That's the only story, Tits and Ass, there is no other story beyond it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 0\\n\\n\r\nYou know normally I would say these character are cardboard cut-outs, but I realize I was giving the show too much credit. The characters are actually more like a scribble of a cardboard cut out made out of poop, that no one actually  bothered to cut out. There are two characters in the show, the MC and thirsty girls, and IS does the amazing thing of making the girls so dull I can't even tell the girls apart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the MC, take off your sock, put it on your hand and have the sock puppet say \"tits\". Congratulation, you have made a character with more personality than the MC.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Art - 6, 6\\n\\n\r\nHere is the reason it sold bunkers, because it has \"cute girls\" that allow all the basement dwellers to fap to. The formula that the industry is now treating like it is the formula of making gold, screw story, screw character, T&A\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 0\\n\\n\r\nI hate this work, its author was a tremendous faggot (have no shame, and proclaimed himself a master of writing), its sells poisoned the industry, and its disgusting putrid children basically killed the LN industry (Along with the WN plague lead by Mahouka but that is a different story). So hate it, forever remember IS as what happens when we lower our standards too far, and gave all those generic LN 1 out of 10, put them in their rightful place, at the very bottom.\\n",

            "content": "Before we start this review I would like to state that I have seen all 12 episodes of this Anime, plus the OVA, although I have yet to read the Manga.\r\nThis is my first review, and while this Anime wouldn't be my first choice of Anime to review, I do find it easier to talk about Anime's that I had problems with rather than Anime's that I loved or even liked. With that said I am trying to keep this review as neutral as possible, because while I did have problems with Infinite Stratos, the show isn't all bad at all. I think Lantis dida very good job with the Anime because they know their target audience, a demographic that people like me are rarely apart of.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen this Anime or read the MAL synopsis (which if you haven't, I don't know why you're reading this...) then you already know what the story is about so I'll forgo explaining it again. It's not hard to see that this particular story is aimed towards men/males. With the amount of female fan service and Action in it, any stereotypical male Anime fan would probably enjoy the story a lot. The story in itself is decent. Call it what you want, but on the surface it's your typical Mecha with the Harem genre thrown in. Okay, let me phrase that differently, because the Harem aspect of the Anime isn't just thrown in willy nilly. It's a main part of the story, which is one of the key contributing factor to why IS: Infinite Stratos is as popular as it is. As a female myself, this series could of been really, really good. Maybe it's the fact that the ladies of the IS: Infinite Stratos verse has this special power that no man in the world has, and that is what attracted me to the Anime... but beyond that, nada. This Anime had the chance to take a good plot point and turn it into something great (without getting rid of the fan service or the Harem genre I might add)... but it just fell flat. In the end that is why the story only got a 3/10 from me, because while it really did have so much potential, it just wasted it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the rest of the Anime, the art in IS: Infinite Stratos wasn't THAT much of a bother to me, in this category, the pro's far out way the cons. From a female's point of view, the character designs were somewhat realistic. This Anime did play a lot on the size of the breasts of the main girls, and honestly it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I thought that they kind of toned it down considering I.S is a Harem/Mecha Anime aimed at guys. Apart from character designs, the art is quite good. The backgrounds that were used were quite nice, not amazing considering this anime is set in the future, but nice. The only problem I had with the art; that I know a lot of people have problems with too was the use of CGI. While the Mech scenes had great designs and some amazing backgrounds (see the whole fight in Episode 12), the scenes with CGI gave me huge headache to watch. The CG felt extremely out of place at times and a little bit over used. Maybe if it was consistent throughout the whole show it would have been okay. But it wasn't and I personally felt that the CGI didn't contribute in any way to the fight scenes... but well, that's up for interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I think IS: Infinite Stratos really strives. The Anime's OP is really nice as a whole and has some really enjoyable moments in it. At the start, the OP didn't hold any interest for me and I skipped it for the first seven or so episodes; but then it really started to grow on me around episode 9/10, and by the time I got around to watching the OVA I was really happy that they kept it in there. As for the OST, there weren't any memorable tracks on it that made me stop and go 'Wow, that's really great!\u2019 It was just kind of there and I didn\u2019t really have a problem with it. Now the reason that the sound category gets the highest rating of a '6' out of ten is because of the bloody ending. I don't really have much to say about it- no that's wrong, I have a lot to say about this ending. The only way I could describe my feelings towards it are 'catchy as fuck' and 'on par with the ending for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' which is really saying a lot. I don't expect everybody to agree with me, but 'Super Stream' is currently playing on repeat while I write this review, and I don't think it's going to leave my head any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even feel like talking about the characters, because that's how bad they are. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly we have our main character who is called Aichki or either Ikachi (I'm not actually sure). But for the purpose of this review, I am going to refer to his as 'Gary Stu'. Gary Stu, who is the main character of IS: Infinite Stratos is what I like to refer to as a 'Wish Fulfilment character'. More than anything else, I would love to be able to call him by his name... but I can't. Gary is the affection of every girl he comes into contact with (a fan boy's wet dream come true). He is the only existing male pilot of the IS, and oh, it seems he can do anything these woman can do, but ten times better. I will compliment Gary on not being a complete pervert though.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the girls of this Anime. IS: Infinite Stratos presents us with: a tsundere, a childhood friend and another childhood friend, who guess what? Also happens to be tsundere. These three fight over Gary Stu like it's no one\u2019s business, and of course our Gary is oblivious as ever, because that tends to be the norm in most Harem Anime's. This is where the rest of the characters pick up the slack to get this category up to 2/10. I don't mind Charlotte (Charles) and Laura in the slightest. Charlotte and Laura were the last two characters to be introduced, and I thought Charlotte got the most development (probably not as much as Houki, but she's the first girl introduced and Gary's 'first childhood friend'). I thought it was nice Charlotte didn't start off super and crazily in love with Gary but then progressed to like him as time went on; it was more believable that way. And finally, we have Laura who is my favourite girl of the series. Most of her interactions with Gary were really funny, and made me laugh for the only time in the Anime. I think it was great that she was really clueless about most things and called Gary her 'wife'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow before watching I.S, I watched other's people's reviews to this Anime on YouTube. And to say that I wasn't expecting much of anything when I started this Anime would be an understatement. I marathon'd this whole Anime in one day and It wasn't as horrible as I was expecting. Personally, the first half of this anime was cringe worthy at best. Around episode five, I.S had a score of 2/10 on my personal animelist, because the first half was quite bad. But then episode seven came around and it was lunch time and I had a nice cup of Ramen with me, and I don't know if it was the fact it was the first time that I had eaten that day and had food in my stomach, but I was starting to 'enjoy' the show. The second half is so much better than the first half and almost made me forget how horrible it was.\\n\r\nWhile my review may be on the negative side, I am not saying in any that I don\u2019t recommend this Anime. While I would not recommend it to any of my friends who are also girls, I do have guy friends who have recommended I.S to me. It is definitely enjoyable in some way or another, compared to anime\u2019s like Angel Beats! which took me weeks to watch, when I was able to marathon this show in one day.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hey, season two of IS: Infinite Stratos is coming out soon, and will I watch it??? No probably not.\\n",

            "content": "It's a mobile suit... IT'S A GUNDUMB!\r\nThat is the best way I can sum up this show in one word. GUNDUMB. This anime is one that revolves around a main character named Ichika who can pilot a mobile suit called an IS, an Infinite Stratos. The twist is... wait for it... ONLY WOMEN CAN PILOT THEM! But for some reason so can this lone high school age boy. Why? Anime logic. So... naturally... this boy begins attending an all girls academy for IS training. I know what you are thinking \"How can a boy go to an all girls school?\" Well... anime logic. Thats how.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is lacking in every aspect... except the obscenely ample breasts that most of the characters have. How do these units work? Why can only women pilot them? How are the seemingly random abilities determined? Why does every girl in the school seemingly want to date this incredibly boring, incredibly dense, incredibly bland, incredibly uninteresting and unremarkable boy? These questions and many more are some that will never be answered. Anime logic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have come down harshly on this anime. You may think I didn't enjoy it. You would be wrong. I did like it. Certain aspects of it. Its just that I have experienced exceptional mech animes like Gundam Wing which set the bar for what a mech anime can do with the material. I liked Charles, I liked the dynamic they shared. I liked their bond, I thought that whole thing was rather enjoyable. I liked some of the fights... I liked the oversized boobs... I liked some of the mech designs... I liked the anime style... mostly. The battle scenes were amazing and the natural visuals were some of the best I have seen... but its just that I saw the potential they had and I felt it was wasted.\\n\\n\r\nIf the main character had only had a character. He was so stupid and clueless that as a man it hurt me watching this at times. Heero Yuy, again for Gundam Wing, while not saying a word was more interesting and dynamic than this guy. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway... the anime was alright. Worth a once watch as a time waster. Nothing to write home about and nothing to hate on too much either. Virtus Signum gives this anime a very meh 5/10.",

            "content": "Japan engineered an armed exoskeleton weapon known as Infinite Stratos (IS for short) and it became the mainstream of weapons. However for some reason, only women are able to operate the IS and therefore, women are now favored in society over men. Orimura Ichika is a 15 year old boy and accidentally touches an IS placed in the IS pilot training school. He is found to be the first and only man who can operate IS and forced to enter the training school, which only consisted of girls. And so the tale goes on, of how Orimura Ichika\u2019s life is surrounded by girls, has begun.\r\n-Review:Firstly, as the synopsis states, IS is an armed exoskeleton weapon created by Japan. To some certain extend, it can only be operated by women. But one day, a boy named Orimura Ichika accidentally touches an IS placed in the IS training school, and it resonated with him and moved. Therefore, that makes Ichika, the only male to operate this mainstream weapon. Which also draws him a huge amount of publicity in this series\u2019s universe because first and foremost, IS can only be operated by women. In addition to that, the IS is a mainstream weapon currently being the biggest hype of the Infinite Stratos universe. Imagine you being the only guy to operate this powerful weapon, which has the ability to destroy a few thousand missiles at once (mini spoiler). Certainly the world government, who was in opposition of the IS at first, will take an interest in this matter. \\n\\n\r\nBut the strong points of this series does not lie mainly on the synopsis, in fact this series is highly focused on the daily highschool life of Orimura Ichika (protagonist) in an ALL GIRLS SCHOOL. You heard me, the ONLY guy in an ALL GIRLS SCHOOL. By all girls school, i\u2019m referring to IS academy which is built solely to train women to resonate with the IS. Up to date, it is the only school that offers IS training in the world. So yes, our little protagonist is one heck of a lucky guy. As the series progresses, you will get to witness the cruelty of this world. By cruelty, i\u2019m referring to the possible jealousy of fellow otaku\u2019s as Ichika indulges his everyday life with physically, perfectly crafted girls. Yes, the main teaser of this series, is Ichika\u2019s harem. Honestly if you think about it, this whole setup was for the sole purpose of Ichika\u2019s harem.\u2028\u2028So Infinite Stratos girls? What\u2019s the fun in that? Aren\u2019t they just normal anime girls? Believe me, I had thought for a moment while looking that the illustration, that this was just going to be another comedy harem anime, with newly introduced big chested girls in each episode clinging and slutting all over Ichika after first sight. My part of my interpretation that was not entirely wrong, because the character developments in this series was just plain horrible and they certainly did, cling onto him at first sight. Despite knowing that after watching the first few episodes, I was still intrigued by this series, especially at the girls. Why? \\n\\n\r\nThere was no particular reason actually. Although the first few phrases of character developments was just as mainstream as highschool DxD, I was gradually attracted to the characters after a few revolutionizing events in the series, and when the \u201cfierce competition\u201d between the girls over Ichika came to an understanding and there was actual development and progression between Ichika and one of the protagonist girls in his \u201charem\u201d. After that phrase was over, the story will continue, after all that senseless ecchi. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main portfolios of this anime series, is the dynamic animation between battle scenes. The aerial camera views that were normally used in 3rd person flight simulation games, was flawlessly implemented into the dramatic battle scenes between the IS. In addition to that, the IS armors were well designed, compared to the original, manga design. Much more details and texture was added into the IS armor designs and these details were maintained throughout the anime series. In conjunction to the consistent animation between the IS battles, the frames in between these fights were also very smooth, there was very little \u201clag\u201d during the IS battles which makes it extra enjoyable and boost the viewers expectations. \u2028\u2028However the animation was not throughly consistent throughout the whole anime series. The downside to the animation in this series was mainly during the slice of life events of Ichika. Time to time, the animation seems to slack between the conversation between characters and at other times, the characters facial expression are bluntly portrayed. In addition to the character animation, at times the color contrast on the characters are just plain dull.\\n\\n\r\nIn all mecha related anime, sound is essential to lighten up the tension during a battle. Overall the sound was on an average level. The sound effects were good, it had variation according to each IS suit, and dynamics that were proportional to distance in aerial combat. The opening and ending theme songs were just so so, it was congruent with the opening and ending animation but they arn\u2019t that catchy because of the inconsistent rhythm. However the main downside to the sound was it\u2019s repetitive use of tracks which got boring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nBut if I must say, the main downside of this whole series is infact, the generic stereotype theme of which the characters are adapted from.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is definitely a series worth investing your time into for all those mecha fans, because it brings a whole new battle viewing experience with the enhanced dynamical camera views. Aside from that, the relationship between Ichika and the girls are certainly something to look forward too while waiting for the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos to air.",

            "content": "After seeing the first episode of Infinite Stratos it is obvious that this anime is obviously going to development into a harem with the basic storyline essentially being: only 1 guy in a school full of girls in a school that pilot mecha suits. Surprisingly unlike most harem anime that I've seen, this anime does not constantly bombard viewers with scenes upon scenes of huge misunderstandings and fan service within every minute or so which i found to be quite relieving as these types of scenes can easily get over repetitive. \r\nFrom listening to the opening and ending theme songs of Infinite Stratos i cansay that it is nothing new. it is what one would expect the theme songs of this kind of anime to actually be. In the same time the artwork is nothing special nor is it anything to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime seem to be better than I originally anticipated this anime would have. For starters there is the childhood friend that have not met for 6 years and are both sharing the same room which seems quite cliche. However, i was originally expecting the main character to be some kind of Tsundere character which is slightly true as she can seem cold at times... There main character does not seem to completely match the stereotypical main character in harems that i've seen as he does not seem complete pervert or a complete good for nothing weakling... in some senses the main character does fit the description of a stereotypical male lead in a harem since he seem in some respects as someone who is lazy or an idiot... however even though i have been defending the last two characters to be not 'completely' stereotypical in every way... sadly in nearly just about nearly every harem anime there has to be a uptight chick that constantly looks down on people who happens to be Tsudere...\\n\\n\r\nSo far i have enjoyed this anime and I would recommend anyone who wants to start watching a new anime to watch this... So far it seems that there is a large array of possiblities within this anime and even though many will blatantly say that it is just another harem anime, I would somewhat concur with these people from what I have seen in the first episode... It is possible that the anime will tilt the other way into a typical harem anime but for now it seems more interesting compared to that of any old harem anime.",

            "content": "In the near future, a Japanese scientist engineers a power-driven exoskeleton called \"Infinite Stratos\" more commonly known as the (IS). Possessing technology and combat capabilities far more advanced than any other weapon system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overwhelming weapon, the nations of the world enact the \"Alaska Treaty\", which simply says that IS will never be used for military combat and that existing IS technology must be equally spread to all nations, to prevent any one nation from dominating the others. The introduction of the IS does however have a key effect on society. As IS can onlybe operated by women, the power balance between men and women is broken, with women coming to dominate society over men. Ten years after the first IS were introduced; the world has entered a new age of peace. That peace is destroyed, however, by an unexpected discovery. A 15 year old Japanese boy, named Ichika Orimura, is found to be able to operate an IS. Realizing his potential, Ichika is forced by the Japanese government to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy, an international academy where IS pilots from all over the world are trained. And so his busy school life surrounded by girls begins.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters (6/10)\\n\r\nGuilty Pleasures. Out of everything that I enjoy, I always return to those series that I find to be guilty pleasures. These series are normally something that isn't truly exception, but at the same time are not exactly terrible either. They find a proper balance and appeal to us on a personal level that keeps us coming back for more, despite the fact that they may not be worth a revisit. This is the best way I can describe Infinite Stratos. A pure guilty pleasure and maybe just a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos follows the life of Ichika Orimura, a young man who is the first known male that can pilot the legendary mecha-style exo-skeleton, Infinite Stratos (IS). These units, for unknown reasons, only respond to females. So, when Ichika activates one, you can image the shock. He then enrolls in the all girls school of IS academy. It's not hard to figure out that this series is going to take the harem route and wastes no time getting the characters established. We are first introduced to Houki Shinonono, childhood friend of Ichika and playing the part of the typical tsundere in the series. We are then introduced to the Cecilia Alcott, who immediately challenges Ichika to a duel to decide who should be class president and falls for him under the philosophy of \"He has bested me so now I automatically admire him for no real reason\". Shortly afterwards, Huang Lingyin, another childhood friend of Ichika, transfers in. This is followed by Charlotte Dunois, who disguises herself as a boy and then immediately drops the disguise for relatively no reason. Lastly we are rounded off with another tsundere, Laura Bodewig. Each character, while fairly stereotypical, is a welcomed addition to the show and brings a certain extra appeal to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself wastes no time gathering all the cast together and establishing the reasons for why each of the main female characters like Ichika. Hilarity and stereotypical antics ensue, along with two completely pointless filler episodes and a thrown-out-of-left-field serious turn for the ending. While IS maybe stereotypical in many areas, it does more than enough to break the mold. Ichika, while dense, is a likeable character. He generally misunderstands vague hints the girls give that they like him, enough to a level that the audience can understand and not brush it off as him just being a complete dunce. It also helps that he's a strong character that cares about his friends, helping to add more depth than what we normally see from most harem series. It also helps that each of the five ladies also have very different personalities and we get to know each of them rather well (or at least in comparison to most harem series), with the exception of Cecilia and Huang, who don't get nearly enough development compared to the rest. Aside from that, my only real issue is with Charlotte. They go through great depth to explain why she disguised herself and she forms a bond with Ichika over it. Yet, for some random reason, this is completely dropped in the next episode. So what was the point of even having this scene if the show immediately decides, \"Oh wait, I change my mind. I don't want to do this anymore\".\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues I have with IS is that it doesn't know what it wants to do. The first five episodes do a great job introducing the cast and setting the stage for the final act, but then over half way through we're thrown two filler episodes that take place at a beach and an inn for no better reason than they simply do. While there was some plot established and progression was made, these episodes just get thrown in there and really do nothing to forward the series. While not nearly as bad as The Sacred Blacksmith, they also don't really help in this twelve episode run of the series. It makes it even more confusing because the series takes a fairly serious turn for the final episodes. While the series has generally had a light-hearted tone, I felt that these filler episodes made it even more of a noticeable change than had they not been introduced. Yet all the same, I enjoyed the short story that was told and wouldn't mind seeing more of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nOne of the things that really makes IS a treat is it's art. This is a beautiful series, there is no doubt about it. Characters are well animated and fairly far from static. Environments are beautiful and I really loved the studios decision to change the classroom to a more futuristic look instead of the traditional school scene from the manga. However, the true star of the show are the IS battles. These are, hands down, the best part of the show. Beautifully done, they provide plenty of detail and are far from simplistic. My only complaint was that there simply wasn't enough of them. However, there were more than enough to truly enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art style itself isn't revolutionary, nor is it ground breaking, it does the job and it looks darn good doing that job too. This, in my opinion, is extremely exceptional artwork for a TV series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nSound is another department that, while well done, truly doesn't leave any outstanding impressions. The voice work was very well done, with Koki Uchiyama doing a wonderful job as Ichika Orimura. While not a diverse character, Mr. Uchiyama went above and beyond to give Ichika that extra bit of depth. Yoko Hikasa (Houki) , Yukana (Cecilia), Asami Shimoda (Huang), Kana Hanazawa (Charlotte) and Marina Inoue (Laura) all did a great job as well as the lead female characters, alongside Megumi Toyoguchi (she voiced Ichika's older sister Chifuyu, who is a legendary IS pilot and a teacher at the IS academy).\\n\\n\r\nMusic itself fit each individual scene rather nicely and battle music was well constructed to give a rather epic and emotional feel to it, but honestly I didn't really notice the music too much until the final episodes. This is when the series sound design really shined for me. While nothing truly to write home about, it was well done and fitting for the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos (IS) is fairly stereotypical in many aspects. It also doesn't dive that deep into a plot during its twelve episode run. However, what it does do it does rather well. From the animation, to the well casted VAs, to the premises, IS is definitely above average in every aspect. While certainly not an legendary anime, it's certainly enough for me to consider it a guilty pleasure and recommend it for those that don't mind harem series. Bear in mind that IS flirts more with being mediocre than above average, but it is above average for a harem series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely one of my top ten guilty pleasures, even if it's stereotypical in so many manners. Not to mention it has the most unintentionally hilarious scene I have ever viewed.",

            "content": "First of all my rate was based on MAL, \"6\" means fine... and thats how this anime is.\r\nInfinite Stratos is your generic harem anime with mecha on it, so do the Harem + mecha is a good combination? i said it wasn't, yet it brings a new fresh type of harem anime. Since its really rare to see a mecha anime with harem, and honestly, i hate mecha anime but when i find Infinite Stratos i thought it was a good choice to start watching a mecha anime and its not really bad for the first mecha anime and honestly i enjoyed a bit.and based on what i see from this anime was the harem aspects is far more dominant than the mecha things. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem with this anime was the \"Plothole\" and there is no actual strong story, for the plothole, the story was really \"jump-off\" , i have a big expectation for IS to expand the story to be much better for the last episode, but its doesnt happen. its like any harem anime which easy to predictable what happen next. as for next, the MAIN REAL PROBLEM with this anime was \"What this story about? what the purpose of all this scene?\" that words are quite hanging on my mind when i am watching this, since in this anime they didnt have any quite purpose or goals. so, basically is this anime is failed? No, i dont think so, since its quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all the negative things i have said, lets see the positive side of this anime.\\n\r\n+ Its quite original and rare to see a combination within Harem and Mecha. its a good start for the people who hates mecha anime (like me) to give a shot watching a mecha thing.\\n\r\n+ As i said, the story was not quite strong but the fillers in this anime (like in the beach scenes ) was far more better than the \"main\" plot.  summary, Fillers> Story\\n\r\n+ The battle scenes were epic, the effect and the movements of mecha was really smooth and the details for the mecha itself was really amazing. Its maybe the best parts for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hate mecha anime and want to try some light mecha, IS or Infinite stratos its worth to try, but just dont have a big expectation on this anime.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is a show that had a great setup but cant quite deliver where it has too because of a few problems. The main character Ichika Orimura is the only male in the world who can pilot an IS and because of this he is sent to a school where people learn to use them and due to the fact that he is the only guy there all the girls instantly love him, not exactly great but I can deal with it. and he has to learn how to pilot an IS with help from 5 girls who all are head over heels inlove with him but he cant seem to catch a hint.\\n\\n\r\nStory-6\\n\\n\r\nThe Story revolves around unmanned IS attacking and they have to combat them, now this is where Ichika comes in because his attacks can go through shield and actually damage the IS which works as a great setup for why he should be the hero (since he is focused as the hero) but this fails because literally every time he is about to win any fight it gets interrupted or his shields run out which makes him look weak thats why I gave the story such a low score that and the fact that there really are no antagonist until the second season so there really is no place for a story unmanned IS can only go so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Infinite Stratos is good but there are notable changes when they get in the IS but overall the show looks nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and outro songs fit the show very well but aside from them there's nothing really special about the music but it's still good(The outro is actually a really good song).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where Infinite Stratos real advantages shine the characters i this show are great but im not just talking about the main characters im talking about all of them even the characters who make appearances every 2-3 episodes for just a few moments are wonderful and add so much light to this show. The main 5 girls are very strong as well.\\n\\n\r\nHouki Shinonono who is his childhood friend and the first of his harem we are introduced to she also shares a room with ichika for a short while.\\n\\n\r\nCecilia Alcott is the second addition to his harem and is the IS representative from England.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Lingyin Huang who is actually ichikas second childhood friend and the 3rd member to join his harem she is the IS representative from china and is the only of the 5 to not be in his class.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte Dunois is the 4th character added to his harem and is the IS representative from France she also shared a room with Ichika for a short time while everyone thought she was a boy.\\n\\n\r\nLaura Bodewig is the IS representative of Germany the fifth person added to his harem and a former student of Chifuyu Orimura.\\n\\n\r\nOther then them  Chifuyu Orimura who is Ichikas sister and arguably the best IS pilot in the world and too top it off their teacher, Maya Yamada who is the assistant teacher for Ichika a friends, and Tabane Shinonono who is the creator of the IS and is Houkis sister. All of these characters and the one that I didint mention make this show great to watch.Though Ichikas inability to catch a hint seems to leave many frustrated but I dont mind much and makes for some great moments\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast make this show fun to watch every second just because they are enjoyable and no matter who is on the screen you wont mind, plus Ichikas incredible hard headiness at certain scenes makes for some enjoyable times albeit you may find yourself yelling at the screen for him to catch a hint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\\n\r\nThis show is fun to watch but they do miss some pretty important parts like the story and Ichikas inability to look strong since all of his fights are interrupted or he runs out of shields because he dosent realize how much he uses, the opening and outro are good and fit the show like they were made for it but the fact that 4 of the 5 main females are representative candidates from their selected country's they seem to weak I get that their young and all but still Ichika almost beats them very earlier and it makes their titles seem almost meaningless. Ill be honest I actually love this show it seems to hit all the notes i personally want from a show but I didint want my personal feelings to affect my scoring but to me it's an 8 or even 9 outta 10 but like I said thats just cause I love the show so much.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Harem based shows then id say it's a must watch if you like mech shows you could do worse and there's a nice amount of comedy in here to find every episode entertaining not to mention fanservice including 2-3 instances of nudity but its done in a classy sort of way or better yet as classy as it can be without seeming out of place but it is a show that id recommend seeing at least once.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos; Infinite Harem. My score is a little biased and 'bumped', due to the fact that I like the girls in his harem. I have no problem sitting here watching Charlotte Dunois doing perfectly nothing. \r\nStory: 6\r\nAnyhow, as far as the story goes, it's average. It's nothing too original, but it does stray from the customary harems. You have a world where girls have the power to control these mechas, and there's one special male who too is able to control them. ...The harem ensues. There hasn't been a real 'plot', it's your everyday 'school' life, and the comedy/'romance' surrounding. Each few episodes holdtheir own little 'story'/'problem'. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt's definitely the work of a new Anime series; the art is great. Characters are well drawn, and the effects are spot-on too. Animation is smooth, and nothing looks cheesy or choppy. The OP is well done, though deceiving (the opening itself contains more action than the whole series so far), and the girls + Ichika are quite the beauties themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI'm not one to stick around to watch an OP or ED (though I may watch it once or twice if I like the song), so I can't make any judgment there. From the few seconds of what I do hear from ED though, it's not bad. I know I've sat through the OP at least once, and the song was good enough for me to not skip it instantly. The soundtrack is typical. Haven't heard anything super outstanding yet, and all the BG music sounds terribly cliche. For once there isn't a single character's voice who annoys me (well, still contemplating on the voice of Houki's sister), and the voices for all the characters seem to be suitable. Effects don't sound lame/incredibly fake, and it works for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThere isn't much background stories given on any of the characters. It's all very vague, but I do like them. The characters follow the general harem archetype (tsunderes -- and a lot of them, quiet ones, intelligent ones, etc), but they don't follow it to an extreme; which is a relief. Ichika, the main character, is the lead male in a harem. Need I say more? We've all seen him before, the guy who tries hard and is extremely dense about the loving women around him. He is oblivious (to an extent) of the feelings of those around him, but I sure wish he would start some romance between himself and Charlotte! That being said, the characters remain pretty static, and the changes that do occur aren't really 'developed' -- they're pretty sudden. Regardless of a lack of character development, I've come to love most of them. ^^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI've been able to get some laughs here and there, and I'm a sucker for fan service. The women are beautiful, and there's quite a bit of fan service. Am I enjoying it? Hell to the yes. Episode 11, where I'm currently at, brings the humor to an end, and seriousness/drama kicks in. The fights are lame (to an extent), and the mid-battle conversations are expectantly cliche/stupid. Aside from that, IS: Infinite Stratos has maintained it's ability to satisfy my enjoyment levels.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI wouldn't say it's a must watch, but I would recommend it if you're into harems and beautiful women. It's a love/hate thing. Don't watch this for the action, and don't watch this for something serious.",

What a Lucky Guy!!\r\nStory 8/10\r\nWell the story is all about mechas and some family and childhood friend issues as well as fighting.

They really put the great effort to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe MC is not very strong just moderate,that MC needs to be train. The character is innocent and very funny for me.

            "content": "Story - The idea is good, Female dominant world Female only mechs, and a guy that can use them, which leads to one of the only harems where the guy has a reason to be in a harem, instead of being a regular guy who gets one for no reason. Now if they backed this up semi well the story would have been at least a 7. It is extremely easy to pick apart the story when you focus on it, saying that the world is dominated by females because of these mechs (which let's be honest don't look like they are really so bigand bad) is a foolish claim when they proceed to say that the powerful ones are in quite a limited supply. Looking at the benefits to these over heavy artillery include maneuverability, shield, portability (you can bring it anywhere you walk.) flight and decent weapons. Now assuming that the entire world didn't lose their mind they probably have most of that technology in non mech form to at least the same degree, in fact currently in the real world we have lasers that are quite a bit more powerful than the guns they wield appear to be, so assuming they didn't lose their minds they have hover tanks with mounted lasers, leaving that alone, I highly doubt that anywhere in the world would it be accepted to have females so much more overpowered than males, but that can slide. I won't go into why only females can use them or why he can as the author really doesn't seem to plan to either. Next up is the school where people from around the world, their countries representatives no less, learn to pilot war machines, no, just no, What country do you know of that is willing to train it's adversaries how to use weapons that would likely be used in war (against them), or even their sport that they partake in (against them), just no. Also I feel that I'm misunderstanding something as I have no idea why these barely trained children are \"representatives\" Other than this is a harem so no real story here.\\n\\n\r\nArt - About the only redeeming factor here, I rather like the art in this anime, moreso for the backgrounds than the jiggly bits, and definitely not too big a fan on the character art for the most part. The art is skillfully done with vibrant colours and great detail. I'm a fan of the school uniform but the mechs... not so much, I will give it originality though\\n\\n\r\nSounds - SFX is meh throughout you don't really notice it throughout but most of the characters voices are annoying enough to have your finger on the mute button at all times. Exception Charles, Charles has a wonderful voice actor I'm actually a Hanazawa Kana fan, and she is the only reason that sound gets above a 1.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Here comes the most fatal flaw in this anime, the characters are the most stale unoriginal and annoying characters I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nIchika - He had a good thing going for him with the \"first male IS Pilot\" thing, but then he became the most typical harem character I've ever seen, he is legitimately so typical that it is actually atypical to be as typical as he is. He's an idiot completely unaware of everything around him. He is far to easily surprised and should get an afro.\\n\\n\r\nHouki - Scratch that comment about Ichika being the most typical harem character Houki beats him by leagues and miles. Not only is she the too shy to say  my feelings but I'll act like I own you and get mad because you don't notice how I feel psychically (though if he wasn't such an idiot he probably would have) childhood friend\\n\\n\r\nCecilia - Read Houki except more tsundere and she isn't a childhood friend but instead from England.\\n\\n\r\nFang - Read Houki except a Chinese loli this time.\\n\\n\r\nMaya - (the other teacher) It's been too much of a negative train here so how about something positive Maya is a neat character she's fairly moe and a teacher, yes that much is boring, but she's not useless, which was a big surprise to me generally moe teachers are completely useless 190% of the time but she can fight well and isn't as dumb as she looks, personally one of the only saving graces in the character department. \\n\\n\r\nLaura - She has serious problems, she starts of yandere and then just degenerates into a more forward and more shy version of Houki/Cecilia/Fang, admittedly at a speed I've never seen before. her background seemed interesting for like 10 minutes but don't worry it gets completely discarded after a harem joke or two, luckily she has an eyepatch so you can tell the difference between her and the other three. \\n\\n\r\nChifuyu - She's one of those people who thinks that love can only be showed through being a complete bitch 24/7 Apparently really powerful but she decided to retire because her career and the safety of her brother were colliding or something she is so far the oldest person in the anime at 24.\\n\\n\r\nChar - I lol'd hard at her new nickname. She is the only real reason to watch this show, she is adorable and nice, she realizes that Ichika is an idiot and uses it to her advantage to get closer to him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Not present, the only enjoyable time is when Char is on otherwise it's useless. Neat note: Ichika will most certainly end up with Houki, that's not a spoiler after watching this for two seconds you can come to that conclusion which is upsetting because Char deserves to win, however if he ends up with anyone else it will be effectively the same as an M Night Shyamalan movie and will actually be worse, what a twist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Don't watch this, just find the Charlotte parts on youtube or something that's all you really need.",

            "content": "-PLOT-\r\nIchika Orimura, a first year student stumbles upon an IS machine. IS machines are advanced weaponry made by the brilliant Japanese scientist, Houki Shinonono. Ichika finds out within the next few minutes that he is able to operate the IS machine and (so it is stated in the next few episodes from the first) begins to duel an instructor of a training academy which teaches high school students how to use IS weapons... the only problem is that Ichika is the only male in the entire world who can operate an IS -- the rest only respond to females.\r\nHe finds himself forced into the trainingacademy, meeting up with many of his old friends and making many new ones...\\n\\n\r\n-STORY- (6/10)\\n\r\nI give the story a 6/10 rating because, though easily understandable when the pitch was given, it was a bit scattered. The story seemed to be explained backwards -- what I mean by this is that they explained everything like George Lucas would have, they begin to explain and give detail with the story as the anime progresses, making it a bit hard to follow.\\n\r\nNone the less, I did enjoy the story once I got use to what the hell was going on... but even so, a lot of things were left out. \\n\r\n\"Where did he meet a few of his old friends?\"\\n\r\n\"Who is this friend, she/he was never properly introduced?\"\\n\\n\r\n-ART/SOUND- (8/10)\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the art and sound of this anime. The character design was a perfect mixture between seriousness and cuteness. It wasn't too far to one side, if that makes sense. On top of that, the fight sequences between the IS battles were very smooth, and I could make out what was happening. Very rarely do you see this in some anime. I believe it was because they used some kind of 3D program, so instead of drawing out everything (which might be the cause of reduced FPS), they were able to just simulate it.\\n\r\nThe sound FX was clear cut, and it didn't have a lot of cheesy sound tracks added to it. I think the music was good aswell, though some might dislike the introductory soundtrack, I thought it was very nice. The music they embedded into the video during some battles also either gave the scene a more dramatic, suspensive aura or a more action-packed, \"KILL HIM GODDAMNIT!\" aura.\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER- (8/10)\\n\r\nI'd say I liked all of the characters, the way all of their personalities clashed with eachother to make a decent harem seemed to be put together quite well. \\n\r\nOn a personal level, I love how Ichiko seemed different from the average, run of the mill male character in this genre of anime. He doesn't make mistakes like tripping over a 1 centemeter wide pebble and land hand first on a big chested woman every episode, or not looking away and removing his hand after him and big-chested-woman-A exchange awkward looks... no, instead he seemed mature and there wasn't too much retardation and perversion.\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the females, I didn't give any one of them more attention than the other. They were all equally cared for, and hated by me at different times. In other words, they're the typical females in harem that are extremely pressed towards the main character -- though they get mad at him when he gives more attention to other girls.\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT/OVERALL- (9/10)\\n\r\nThough the story might have been a bit confusing at times I'd give enjoyment and overall rating a solid 9/10 because it had me smiling, feeling sad, or having atleast some kind of emotion other than boredom or annoyance which was directed to the anime itself (not the character's personalities). Some might say that this was a generic harem (but isn't all harem the same? A guy is surrounded by a group of girls that like said guy. That's why I watch it... because it's harem) or that it was poorly written.... and yeah, it may have been so, but at least it kept me entertained throughout the entire 12 episode series, and actually made me want to write this long review about it. A lot of times I stumble upon anime with great story and great detail, but it never keeps me entertained! But of course, to each his own. That's just my view on it.",

            "content": "I usually don't review anime, unless I feel like I could really change someone's decision to watch the show. This is one of those cases, but not how you may think.\r\nStory:\r\nInfinite Stratos has an all around weak story, why? Because there really isn't much of one. Its a pretty run of the mill mecha/harem show. I'm ok with both of those but I prefer a bit more substance. Here's a short story synopsis: \"Guy who can fly mechs for girls goes to all girls mech school, hilarity, action, and ecchi insue.\"\r\nThe story really doesn't explain much about the events that are not part of theromance/harem plot and leaves a lot to be desired. simple explanation would have at least made the story average.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe action scenes are really good, the animation is slick and the art direction is really good all around. And for the people who mainly would watch this for the harem and ecchi aspects, its good as well.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is pretty average, the music is really nothing special, its not bad its just average. I watched the dub, because the accents are apparently hilarious, they are in a sort of endearing way, and overall the characters without accents are really well voiced and there really aren't any characters that stand out as downright bad.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI won't spoil the romance or the characters stories here, but overall I think the characters are good. The lead is annoying and overreacts at times but when he's fired up he becomes an all around good guy. Each girl also has a sort of backstory or previous relationship with the lead. All of these are underdeveloped and relegated to a single scene each. Other than that, each character develops at least a little bit by the end, and honestly there's nothing bad about the characters in my opinion. They are all just good but a bit stereotypical characters.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNow, if it wasn't for the story and some poor choices regarding the characters this show could have been great. I saw that from the beginning, and I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the show as a mindless sort of show to just watch in my down time. Overall, I'd say to watch the first few episodes and see if you can get into it, I did and enjoyed it, but its not for everyone.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nGive it a try, it could surprise you.\\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "I'm not one to bash animes in reviews which is why infinite stratos is killing me, I always enter an anime with an open mind and base my opinion on the story and how well it was done. Where to start, hmm lets see, oh I know! All the girls, now i can understand the writters making the characters mostly girls and I've enjoyed anime like that, but IS takes it, everyone in it was a girl except for the main character, not only that but everyone in it was in love with him. Then the story seemed way too rushed, every episode would belike 3 mashed together, towards the end so much is thrown in it makes it hard to even try to like it. The story is also soo predictable, as are the characters, they could've at least added some twists to the plot. I do have a few good things to say though since i hate being one of those all-animes-suck-these-days reviewer. The art really is good, the characters definately have more detail to them then in other animes. Finally i think IS tried have everything and failed at it, they changed up the location, tried to show growth as characters, and tried to have two fall in love (which nobody could really tell because they failed miserably at showing any progression in any relationship between any characters, they just kept adding more), it was one where everything was there, it was just unbalanced, an poorly thought out, but I will say thanks for trying, it's all anyone can really ask for. If you watch it you'll notice that they could've done soo much more with the characters than what they did which would've made IS pretty good, and thats what disappoints me, when so much potential was wasted.\\n\r\n In case you're wondering, the plot is about mech suits tbat only females can operate but a guy finds out he can use one so now every girl at the IS training academy is in love with him, the rest is pretty much pridictable sorry to say.",

Same background: women are the only ones able to control mechas and, with just one man among them, feelings never shown before suddenly appear... Main difference is that Vandread occurs on space and IS, on Earth... Other thing was that Vandread had an incredible climax, based on a real enemy...\r\nOne single man, surrounded by tons of girls... And just like on any other harem anime, the main character is just stupid enough to not realize the way others feel towards him... Well, this is what makes this kind of animefunny... Plot may not hook you, but all those amazing mechas, with cool transformations and weapons, starring exciting and ultra quick battles, were enough to keep my attention...\\n\\n\r\nSeeing how Ichika is dumb and unable to return all the affection he receives from the other girls is the main attraction in here... Since there are no wars and ISs are made only for competitions, you can't expect an intense plot or epic battles against terribly evil and powerful foes... I noticed that a second season is ongoing right now, so who knows? Is there something really big coming up?\\n\\n\r\nWe can also get an obvious cliche after Laura's appearance. All that stuff that Germany is mean and buys fight with others... This is demonstrated through provocations made by Laura to both Cecilia and Rin, these two representing the alliance between England and China during WWI... It's not like what happened in that time wasn't horrible, but this is 21th century... There's no reason keep arguing over that kind of thing anymore...\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 has a totally unpredictable ending, surprised me completelly... Congrats on that! The real ending was a little disappointing... That forgiven since there's a sequel, so it couldn't end here as well... Animation was the main focus: battles are fast and explosive, transformations are incredible and those mechas (that look more like compact armoured suits) are unique, pretty original and well designed!\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime for chilling out and get some good laughing, no masterpiece... It's focused more on comedy than drama. Still, I've enjoyed it a lot and this is a nice recommendation for those who just want to have fun...",

            "content": "Where do I start?\r\nPerhaps I'll start with the good. IS is a story about the luckiest boy in the world. It's a guy, Ichika, who lands in a school of mecha-wielding girls who have raging hormones. It has it's funny times and the action isn't half bad. Plus, a few characters can provide a really good laugh in awkward situations.\r\nThat's about all I could say though.\r\nInfinite Stratos wasn't the right name for this series. There were two better that I was thinking of:\r\nInfinite Tsundere\r\nInfinite Fanservice\r\nAllow me to go into detail.\r\nInfinite Tsundere:\r\nEvery supporting girl's personality takes a dip in all parts of tsundere personality. One girleven goes from Tsuntsun to deredere in the span of two episodes. One goes the opposite direction in the same span. However, no one diverges from it. It's just a bunch of tsunderes piloting mechas and competing with each other for the love of a guy so clueless that he makes Kamijou Touma look like a genius.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I do mean clueless. Everyone else can immediately note what's going on except him. I'm usually not one to mind the clueless main character role. At times, you could call me a fan of it actually. Ichika pushes boundaries though. Especially considering how every girl goes out of their way to accommodate him. But I'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Fanservice:\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice essentially serves as the plot. If you want to see some compelling story, you won't. I mean that. There's not a moment where you can pick up on a plot until the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's plenty of shower scenes that border on the erotic while thinking about the main character. There's also plenty of boob-grabbing, boob-rubbing, partial nudity, \"accidental\" nudity, body-on-body and just all-around general flirting. Remember, this is a guy that has been thrust into an all-girl school. The girls all act like they've never seen a boy before. I mean, almost every single one. Heck, even a teacher. I'm fairly surprised that he hasn't been violated while he slept. Oh wait . . . \\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nBut in the end, the problem with this series doesn't lie with the lack of plot, abundance of fanservice or the tsundere club.\\n\\n\r\nIt lies with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe world is centered around him.\\n\\n\r\nNo really. This guy, through pure luck, lands into an all-girl school, immediately making him popular. He lucks out to grab the class with his sister, a renown pilot, teaching it, thus making him even more popular. He sees a friend who he hasn't seen in 6 years and she remembers everything about him and becomes the first member of his harem by default. He gets his own personal IS for \"data\" purposes and somehow, despite being weaker than everyone, he's constantly the key to winning.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that every single girl he knows is in love with him in some way. Of course, that's how harems work. But with Ichika, you just won't get it. He does nothing of importance or style to earn the harem. It just kinda . . . happens. And that alone is what drives the series. Girls are unreasonably drawn to him. That's your plot.\\n\\n\r\nOh and danger is drawn to him as well. Though, there's a reason for that. To be honest, it's a bit underwhelming, though.\\n\\n\r\nOh and the characters don't have a set personality or power level at all through this series. They will flip so hard, you forget who they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has too much convenience and not enough plot to be considered something close to a masterpiece. But it is still good fun for the most part.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos . . . A Mecha/Harem/Ecchi/Romance combination of a anime.  That is something that people just do not see everyday.  But to me, I thought it went well overall for the entire season.  Going into this, I had no idea what to expect since I only had a picture and the tags to go on and decided not to read the synopsis.  I feel like I should start doing that more often but anywho I liked this anime overall.\r\nEcchiness.  Yup thats right, it has some of it in here.  I was glad to see the ecchiness to betrue since getting ecchi into a mecha anime is a bit hard but they pulled it off beautifully.  Only down side is the censorship...YET AGAIN!  I am not a big fan of censorship so of course I am going to watch this anime again once the uncensored version comes out.  \\n\\n\r\nThough it is hard to tell, I can see some romance inside some of this anime.  But mainly it is a Harem.  Why is that? 1 guy, bunch of girls, that is why.  Romance side would be some of the stuff in the anime that make up something kind of like a date.  So there is some romance in it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have not noticed yet but this is a mecha anime.  I will let that soak in real quick..........Ok, if you hate mechas, you might not like this.  There are terms in here that could drive people crazy and seeing battles and stuff . . . not your thing, don't watch.  Mechas are my thing so I would reccommend this to anyone who does like mechas.  But if you do not like Harems, then yea, don't watch.  If you are a guy and you don't like harems then I will question your manhood just a tad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a pretty good anime.  It holds up pretty well, has a story and ties in things well.  Censorship is a killer mainly because I hate censorship and it makes me angry for some reason.  If you hate censorship too then I would suggest waiting until the uncensored version comes fully out and watch it then.",

            "content": "Art (9/10)\r\nThe animation was done fairly well. Backgrounds were detailed and characters were animated well. Even the extras were all physically different in some way. The battle scenes, even though there weren't many, were really smooth and exciting to watch.\r\nCharacters (6/10)\r\nThis category is where the anime suffers. First, you have the dense male harem lead, Orimura Ichika. At first glance, he looks like a regular teenage guy who gets the opportunity to enroll in an all-girls school. Many guys out there would give up everything just to be in his situation. However, because he is the typical, dense male harem lead, he is oblivious tothe feelings of the all the girls around him. This happens throughout the whole series so it is frustrating to watch sometimes. Understandably, since he is the only male, all the female characters want to befriend him. The main females come from different countries of the world so there's a bit of diversity in the characters. However, they all possess at least one of the typical harem traits (childhood friend, tsundere, ojou-sama, sadistic etc). With that being said, the characters' interactions were not special. I guess with IS being a harem anime, I should not have expected character development. I didn't really have a \"favourite\" character because there wasn't a character that was interesting.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - Don't watch IS and expect the characters to be great.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very good. I found it nice that the seiyuu voicing the main female characters sang the ED. Both songs were upbeat and fit the general mood of the series. The BGM wasn't really memorable but it was not out of place.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nIt's hard to say that IS actually had a \"story\". A third of the episode was used just to introduce characters. The rest of the episodes (excluding 11 and 12) were mostly about the girls interacting (is that even the right word?) with Ichika. Episodes 11 and 12 wrapped up the so-called \"story\" with a battle scene. If I were to condense the story into a few points, here is what it would look like:\\n\\n\r\n- Teenage boy discovers he is the only male capable of piloting an IS\\n\r\n- Main female characters are introduced\\n\r\n- Male lead interacts with females\\n\r\n- Final battle\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, there aren't a lot of points. However, I understand that a harem anime is not watched for its story so I guess there's no helping it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos met my expectations in general. I wouldn't mind having a second season sometime in the near future. There are some aspects that I would want the producers to improve on but overall, I enjoyed watching Infinite Stratos.",

            "content": "Ah Infinite Stratos. The anime I love but really, really, don't ever tell anyone about. Well. Unless they're already anime fans. Then I'll talk to them about it. Infinite Stratos is my ideal for one specific thing I like to find in anime. What I refer to as \"junk food\". Anime that you can reach into your brain housing unit, flip the off switch and just veg for a bit. Now Infinite Stratos happens to be a very good piece of junk food, but it's still junk food.\r\nWith a standard scifi harem set up and the usual characters showing up with the special addition ofthree foreigners instead of one, two childhood friends, and back to normal with implied repressed feelings for the protagonist's big sister! Woo! There's even a reverse trap. Which would a spoiler if they didn't give it away in any cast image ever put up, including the one on the anime's page here on MAL. Not to mention, how often do you actually see characterized males in harem anime? Especially during the harem assembly phase. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the standard setup IS rose above it's material, making the old archetypes shine as fun and enjoyable characters, and the story's set up is a bit hackneyed, but looks great with it's refurbishment and fresh coat of paint. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for something to compliment your reading of Anna Karenina that will let you switch to something complex and interesting but not so depressingly Russian you're barking up the wrong tree. If you want to put your brain on pause for a little bit and take a micro vacation from work or studying though, Infinite Stratos might be what you're looking for.",

Honestly, if I wanted a dramatic turn of events with tears, shitty \"twists,\" and overwhelming boredom I'd just go marathon a few hours of fart porn while eating yogurt and listening to Sabaton.\r\nThe setup here is great. It's nothing new, exciting, or particularly interesting, but it's *entertaining* and that matters the most in my book. A guy in an all-girls school surrounded by man-starved lolis with half-mechas and co-ed dormitory hijinks. I don't really care if something is groundbreaking, only if I find it enjoyable to experience and can do so withoutmy eyes rolling so far back that they're greasing my butthole. And yeah, IS did that for half a dozen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAaaaaaand then it decided to toss off all the amusing scenarios with a Le Ebin Dramatic Series of Events where any notion of comedy is recycled into something so utterly dull I actually had to lock my cat out because she was getting agitated by my growing irritation. But I forced myself to finish because leaving things half done feels like eating glass tacos.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, is it worth your time? Fucking no. Just like 95% of animes I watch, IS decides halfway through to become something else. I truly do not understand why writers and producers think this is fun or enjoyable, because it's god damn not. It's even more insulting to my time because everything leading up to the 180 was actually pretty good--especially some cool city/backdrop designs.",

The show has the worst girls\\n\r\n-The girls in this show are the worst and have the worst reactions to things\\n\r\n-These girls flip a tit at the sight of Ichika touching a girl on the shoulder \\n\r\n-The girls aare just unbearable, bland, and extremely predictable and also just plain unlikable ( unless you like getting hit at any possible moment)\\n\\n\r\n.This is just harem trash\\n\r\n- the plot sucks and this show has nothing important to say\\n\r\n-the show is unfunny (as the only \"comedy\" is Ichika getting his ass beat off screen)\\n\r\n-this show has the worst cast of characters\\n\\n\r\n. The plot is all over the place\\n\r\n-the show is supposed to have Ichika go to a school to learn to pilot a stratos (mecha suit) for sport purposes\\n\r\n-so why in the name of Kira's shit does the show have him going on military level missions while he's only in high school? I thought the damn suits were only meant for sports!?\\n\r\n-you can't have some idiot who just started piolting a weapon so dangerous that countries banned it for warefare, go on a mission that he could die from because of one little screw up, all while in high school\\n\\n\r\n. the fanservice isn't even good\\n\r\n-The fanservice in this show sucks and isn't intresting\\n\r\n-also it gets in the way of the goal of the episodes so its just a nuisance and annoying\\n\r\n-Man you would think that a harem of all things wouldn't fail in the fan service department or at least give the show some entertainment or value\\n\\n\r\n.Good things\\n\r\n-the stratos suits look ok\\n\r\n-the CGI is not a disaster\\n\r\n-its not Conception\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Infinite stratos is a huge waste of time and I regret every second in watching it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "IS is a 12 episode series that is one of the most highly anticipated amongst the Winter 2011 anime lineup for TV broadcast and  quickly become a fan favorite upon its debut, but does it deliver?\r\nThe story starts with the introduction of Orimura Ichika, a male who for some unknown reasons able to operate an IS, an armored exoskeleton that can only be used by females. Being a qualified IS operator, he enrolled to an IS school that has a population predominated by females  (actually I don't remember any other male character in that school). Being the only male student, naturally all thegirls are quite interested in him and so the harem begun. The series separates into different arcs, each focusing on a female character being introduced as transfer students from a different country, her back story examined and will have their own moments with the male lead. The series spends a good 2/3 of its episodes introducing the harem cast, but at the same time the series manage to introduce bits of elements to move the story forward. The finale is a bit of let down with its inconclusiveness, which may be a good thing for the viewers screaming for a season 2!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has more good than bad points. The environment is detailed enough, the characters are very cute and well designed as they are able to expressed their emotions very well,  more importantly the cast doesn't look generic, each are unique looking and easily recognizable. The mecha designs for the IS exoskeletons are also quite good and unique for every individuals. The visuals for the action scene is also well rendered. As for my minor complaints, there are times that the animation looks inconsistent with the characters looking awkward and scenes that is generally done of poor production quality. Also very noticeable is the inconsistency of the designs with many visuals just keeps on appearing and disappearing with each transition of scenes which sometimes could be annoying and sometimes amusing that it is laughable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series is well covered by its different background music, I felt that the music played in any given scene is just about right and appropriate for the mood it is trying to convey. The OP and ED themes along with its accompanying animation sequence is good enough and feels appropriate for the series.\\n\\n\r\nIS has a fairly good cast of characters. As a harem series, the male lead does a good job and doesn't look annoying on how he is clueless to the feelings of all the lovestruck girls around him. The girls albeit stereotypes that is designed to appeal to its audience, each feels unique and has a personality that is quite different from each other. Each characters has a role to play and was their own moments as the series moves along. Voice acting is very good, the VA has done a fairly good job in portraying their respective characters, I enjoyed listening to everyone as they chat with each other. \\n\\n\r\nIf I'm going to summarize what I felt about this series, it will be \"Infinite Stratos is a harem series done right.\" Despite having inconsistencies in both the plot and animation and a finale that lacks any real ending (season 2 please!), this is a series that I enjoyed all throughout, never a dull moment here. Infinite Stratos is a series that I will recommended to individuals seeking a harem show that contains a mix of mecha, sci-fi, and comedy as these are the predominant genres of the series.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is one of those that remind you why the anime industry cannot have good things, and the potential that it's missing out on. Being a mecha harem set in high school the plot isn't anything new and providing many mysteries and vague answers for more fanservice, so why do I like this show?\r\nStory: 6\r\nIchika Orimura is the generic nice guy harem protagonist put into an all girls because he is the only male able to pilot this female only machine, the IS (by the way this wouldn't fly in America), leaving the entire school of girls to gawk at because they're at thehormonal age of 15. \\n\\n\r\nThe IS are explain in little to no detail and if the show decides to tell you anything you'll be going \"uh huh\" rather than listen and waiting for some asspull that makes Ichika look awesome. The creation of the IS is vague as it was meant to be, but some can say it just there to disguise what this show really is a harem and I would say yes and no. For example the manga Nisekoi is also a harem with an underling story but most of plot consist of shenanigans occasionally referencing the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery is what gets people coming as well as the girls, even if an entire episode is stupid fanservice you have to be willing to judge if yourself can sit through it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art of of IS manages to provide the purposes of comedy, romance, and action. At times during the fight scene the cgi looks ridculous but that's probably due the fact the IS looks silly itself. I don't understand why mecha show make guys look more girly when wearing such suits. The animation of fanservice looks out of place during time giving a generic bounce or focus on ass shots especially with the girls in their training suits (but this a harem so it's passable). Sometimes the animation would take a drastic turn from looking amazing to cookie cutter for example there a sun lotion scene that giving off an eerie feeling rather than erotic one.\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing special, the shading and tones are executed in a way that makes the world and characters look remarkable at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pretty catchy however expect no other great pieces as the music can just be described as battle music number 1 & 2, but despite that at certain times the music is well placed giving the perfect mood. Most of music consist of school life to victorious which might not even notice most of time as the characters talk over them. The characters have individual themes that represent their nationality which are pretty good, but the music playing during romantic/ecchi scenes sound like someone farting in your ears; it's more hilarious than romantic.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub voices are okay however the attempt at giving characters accents to present their nationality makes it sound phony like someone backstage is snickering about some bad fan fiction. While not as distracting it comes off as off putting rather than racist as but you can watch the sub if you want, they all speak in japanese accents for I'm concerned (why isn't Houki given some accent rather than tsundere to be japanese? Would everybody else have to speak in japanese accents?).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThis a harem, there's nothing but cliches. Thought the characters are than their nationalities I'll give them that. As a balanced harem, all the characters have equal chances with Ichika, but like all harems he's blind to their obvious affections though this may have something to do with three of them being tsunderes. \\n\\n\r\nLook, for any tsunderes out there, people don't  kill people they like without being classified as a criminal. You don't have to hit a guy when your embarrassed. If you both play hit each other that's find, but don't expect someone to like you if you hit then given no reason at all. The characters of this show is 50% of that. I'll give Houki and Charlotte a break since they are the nicest of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nIchika comes off as a dense idiot giving the girls false hopes at time, but I'll give him credit for stating that doesn't want a girlfriend rather than pretending to be some dateless loser. Ichika is the nice dense guy that the other girls want who's other refining traits are being a good IS pilot and house husband material. Out of all the main cast I like him the most, because I can write on the list of things I like him \"probably not a serial killer\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI laughed and I diligently watched this show every Saturday when it came out on the Anime Network. It's a harem yeah but I enjoyed the action, the comedy, and the ship teasing scenes even if they weren't with the same girl (most likely because I didn't care who would win), and thought of it as a fun show. The world and characters had care put into them somewhat, SO WHY NOT? I might have enjoyed it more if the IS was more explain but that might be asking too much, I'll just watch another mecha anime if I want some mecha action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nYou see what you get, a romantic comedy syfy harem. No it isn't Nisekoi or Ouran HSHC, but if you have nothing better to than why not watch this season of Infinite Stratos.\\n\\n\r\nYes this season. IS2 is nothing but pandering BS that people feared when this season would be. That's another review for another time.\\n\\n",

'Cuz all the show is really about is every girl getting one guy. \r\nI thought 'Hey, a program about people using Mecha robot things and fighting in tournaments sounds pretty cool' So I started watching this anime thinking that I would enjoy it, honestly in some areas I did, and admittedly some areas even made me laugh. Howevermost the show was just all about girls loving a darn boy that's so stupid to not even realize anything. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this a overall 6 as the art style is very nice and how they did the fighting and the Mecha suits actually looked nice, the sound was decent and I did enjoy some areas of the anime. As for the story it was well thought of with the IS suits and the academy, however the story about the Harem areas where too overpowering for the anime and it wasn't at all decent in my opinion. Heck, even the character development was poor because of all the 'I have to love this one guy that's the only guy in my class' scenario. \\n\\n\r\nSorry for pretty much all the hate, but this show could have been so much better if it stuck to it's original concept of the IS suits and that's it. Please no haters - this is MY opinion, Thank you. \\n\\n\r\n~ Canaan\\n",

            "content": "I don't know if it's just because this pulled through for me as a harem/ecchi/action anime that stood out from the other recent ones I have watched or not;but I was really satisfied with watching Infinite Stratos.\r\nPlease remember that this review is my own personal opinion, and whether you choose to think bad about it is yours to think. I'm also going to say up front, this review will contain SPOILERS.\r\nStory:8: The story didn't bore me at all, or in other words, I wasn't dissatisfied with watching any of the episodes. The plot development wasn't very extensive but was played out very well. Although inthe beginning it seemed as if the harem theme was rushed at you a little too quickly, it smoothed out to a good pace for the rest of the episodes. When episodes were mainly focused on the development of the relationships between Ichika and the other main girls,the anime didn't stray far from the main goal and story plot. Looking back at the anime now, one can say that it is mainly based on ecchi and relationships, and the animators just added mechas that contributed to this factor, but one can also say that the way the anime went about incorporating this factor is very nice. What impressed me the most was when a typical scene appeared,too cliche in other words, but the resolution of the matter was taken in a different way I haven't seen before; that's something that stood out for me. I won't say that there were typical outcomes, that a dog could guess what was going to happen, I mean come on guys, it IS a harem based anime. But Infinite Stratos was a definite change in pace, now that I look at my recent, I've watched too many of these similarly themed anime in row, but IS didn't fail to disappoint and follow in their shadow.\\n\\n\r\nArt7 and Sound10: The Art for a 2011 anime could have been done better, I'll say that the animations for combat and the equipping of the ISs could have been greatly improved on. The sound was IMO the same as all the anime I have watched so far, it complimented very well with the scenes that were presented.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8: My favorite has to be the main character Ichika who's blind ignorance to the desperate girls around him, just put a smile on my face the whole time. His misunderstanding at their attempts were laughable (in a good way) and his personality was something different that I haven't seen yet in a good harem anime. Now for the other main characters, the girls. I won't describe them all but the way each one was introduced was unique in their own way, and I loved every bit of the plot twists that occurred around each one (in regards for their relationship progression with Ichika). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall (8&8): I didn't cheer with joy for this series, nor did I end it with a feeling of \"why did I watch this?\". I think I was completely satisfied because of the mediocre anime that came before this one on my watch list. I went into this anime, not expecting much, but left the first episode with a grin on my face. The harem aspect was done well IMO, comparable to Date a Live. The ecchi aspect...Well you don't really see much but it compliments the series when you do. I'll have to say it isn't shoved in your face for complete fan-service/ otaku fap time, but tastefully implemented with a clever cooperation. Overall this anime was Very good and is one of the few on my list so far that has passed the line of the overall score of 7. I recommend this anime to any mecha/ecchi/harem lover and I guarantee joy or at least satisfaction.",

I personally believe it is because he wishes to protect everyone around him. Which would explain why he is so dense. \r\nHe is surrounded by Girls who want to wait on his hand and foot and doesn't realize it atall. You will want to bash your head into a wall over and over again. That is how moronic he is. And he also said he thought his sister was the hottest out of the group (Did I just say that?). Well, indirectly of course. Seriously, He is a moron. \\n\\n\r\nHave you ever been the one who is slowest, weakest, dumbest and the most inadequate of your family? That is our MC. Yet he only wants to protect those around him. He has died and come back to life. That is what he does best.

Considering I don't usually watch Mecha, this was a \"fresh\" experience.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nIt was clear that the plot was lacking and I felt that could be seen as mediocre episodes were strung together. The mecha fights wasn't anything special either. Infinite Stratos' story was, for the most part, flat.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nThe art was indeed a sight for sore eyes and it was well executed. The art style was standard-fare but brought to life by the light, crisp feel which improved the mood of the series.\r\nSoundtrack 5/10\r\nThe background music wasn't bad, and it mostly improved theambience of the anime. However, some parts were poorly arranged and this led to awkward timing. The OST was decent, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nIt is a challenge to develop the characters in a show with many main characters. There was an attempt to add depth to the characters but it was mostly in vain. The MC, Ichika, was your run-of-the-mill dense male lead and was frustrating to watch at times. However, I commend the fact that each character was unique and had distinctive qualities. I also enjoyed the mysterious air of Chifuyu Orimura's past that was foreshadowing much of the series\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI found myself conflicted at the end of the series. It was an extremely average show, yet I enjoyed it- a lot. From a critical standpoint, Infinite Stratos should be chucked into the burning pile of mediocrity. Despite that, I would definitely watch a continuation of this anime (Yes, I have watched IS:2 and enjoyed it).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about this show and it would definitely have scored better had they worked on refining the edges more. All in all, I would recommend this show.\\n\\n",

IS: Infinite Stratos brings this experience to you  by creating a world where mechas(giant humanoid robots that are seemingly very inefficient in carrying out their duties yet look 9999% cooler) can only be driven by females, cept for a reason this one guy. \r\nThis one guy attends a futuristic school that teaches mecha stuff(history, combat and so on) and is filled withother pilots (all female and either Asian or White, all other minorities don't exist in the future), and explores the relationships he makes throughout his time in school while also fighting other pilots with mechas. This is literally the entire plot of the anime. The main character gets thrown slices or arcs of each female character(cause its a harem if you didn't notice yet) and is forced to deal with their hots for his tots. \\n\\n\r\nSo the story doesn't hold up much but what about everything else?\\n\r\nArt and Sound is fine, I mean what isn't these days, characters are kind of dull, main male character is obtuse, other characters are pretty stereotypical, and have the hick for his masculinity(dirty mind you got there). \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to get at before you leave is that there is a sense of racism in Infinite Stratos which is unsettling and distasteful. Like I pointed earlier, no other minorities but White and Asian exist in the future, as in even the background characters are all White or Asian and other minorities have no place in a UNIVERSAL school. Chinese people are short, English people have awful food and are annoying, Germans are Nazis and so on and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nIs IS worth watching? It ISn't",

I decided to write a review on the anime to enlighten others who haven't seen this anime.\r\n1 Boy. A gazillion girls. nuff said.... when I read the summary for Infinite Stratos i was Psyched. Note the capital P. It had the making of a great anime and a funny one to boot. I started watching and here my ratings for the anime Infinite Stratos:\r\nStory : 7\r\nI gave the anime an 7 due to the fact that I I honestly liked the whole comedy aspect of Orimura Ichika'slife. Each girl was introduced in a unique way, and each had their own appeal to boot. I felt guilty giving the anime's story a 7 due to the fact that I read the light novels and in all honesty they were some of the best I've read. If you don't mind spoiling the next season go ahead and read them as they are great.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nAll of the characters were well drawn and implemented. The IS's were awesome, the fight scenes were great and had a certain *cough* appeal to them when the girls were in them!\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending of the anime were great. I still listen to them occasionally. The OST's were memorable and enjoyable. The only thing that didn't make the cut were the fight noises. It was Really annoying hearing the creak of the IS randomly when it moved. It sounded to surreal in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAs the only boy in the world able to use the IS robot's, Ichika has a great personality. He's not a shy main character who has to have his harem take care of him, nor is he to powerful to be thankful for their help. He's an all around great main character for the anime. Sadly I couldn't find myself relating to him. I mean come on, why can't my cute child hood friends have crushes on me huh?\\n\\n\r\nAll of the girls have their own personality which adds a twist to the anime's comedy aspect. Houki and Cecilia are tsundere while Charlotte is a normal vanilla. Laura seems kind of yandere and lingyin is VERY protective of him. They make for a great crew and can't wait for them to add the two new girls next fall.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment and Overall: 8\\n\r\nI found myself flinching at the more humiliating parts like when Ichika would be caught doing something at the wrong moment by one of the girls. All in all it was a good anime to watch and it deserves a second season.\\n\\n\r\n-Steller, Out\\n",

Well if your one of those people, it'd be best to stand clear, for this anime is not your type. Part of the anime industry are stuck on creating anime with an unclear plot, a plot that doesn't make sense, pointless harems, and too much fan service. But at the same time all of this entertains some people. There are some viewers who do like ecchi and harems, and that's okay, that's your personal preference. I wouldn't call IS a fail but a disappointment because itdid have some potential in it but no cigar. I decided to compare it to the anime Freezing and noticed they were aired almost exactly the same time, so it's possible they were competing with each other.\\n\\n\r\nTo start it off, IS didn't really have a story to it, which was a major mistake. What the creators need to understand is that every anime needs a story. Its like building a house without a foundation. Without a story, the anime almost isn't going to be favored. Now there are some houses that are standing strong without a foundation, and there are also some anime that are still entertaining without a clear plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in IS for the characters were good, but for the mecha part, the IS's they were piloting weren't well thought of. There were parts of it that was just floating...in the air. Nothing were attached to them or anything. They didn't really put much thought into the mecha part but mostly into the harem. The backgrounds on the other hand were pretty sweet though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was alright, the opening and closing themes were pretty good, not bad at all. There were probably one or two songs they played during the action scenes that were just straight up horrible, but music choice shouldn't really affect how much you enjoy an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't bad, but many people can't really like them if a harem is going on and there's not enough time for character development.\\n\r\nBut with only 12 episodes, a harem going on along with fan service there's not enough time to allow character development I guess. *scratches head*\\n\\n\r\nI have the enjoyment category a 9 because despite all the fan service, the harem, the absence of a plot (and I for one strongly prefer anime with good plots), I actually did enjoy IS. It was rather funny in my opinion, and I hope some of you do actually give it a try. \\n\r\nIS wasn't all that bad. If they were truly competing against Freezing, then I can see where the creators were trying to get at but the didn't do such a great job, the anime could have possibly been rushed.\\n\r\nOverall if you don't mind harems and fan service, try this one out. If not then forget this show.",

            "content": "Before I start, I'll just point out right now that I'm not some super-critical guy that strives to slice an anime down to pieces and closely analyze each one. I'm as close to the average anime watcher as you can get, so keep in mind that I talk from the people's standpoint and not some elitist super-thoughtful point of view.\r\nAlright. Here goes. Iced Review: Infinite Stratos (note that at the time of this review I've only watched most of the first half-season)\r\nOverall Rating: 6\r\nInfinite Stratos is your run of the mill, average school-life harem romcom. Honestly, if having one guy in the middle of ahorde of attractive women is not your cup of tea, don't watch the harem genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise is that Japan has developed a new mechanical exo-skeleton suit known as IS or Infinite Stratos that quickly outstrips the use of conventional weaponry. However, for reasons unknown, the IS is:\\n\r\na) outlawed by international law to be used as a military weapon\\n\r\nb) only able to be used by women \\n\\n\r\nIS are instead used in competitions between athletes in mock duels, and the production of IS cores (the things that make IS run) are limited to a small amount so that it doesn't get out of hand. \\n\\n\r\nMeet Orimura Ichika. He's the only guy in the world able to use the IS. So he's seized by the government and plopped down into the IS academy in Japan, the only school that is centered around an IS curriculum (basically the entire point of this school is to train athletes to compete in IS competitions).\\n\\n\r\nRemember how only women can use the IS? Ichika is the only guy in an entire academy of women, and thus the harem romcom begins. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nI would rate this higher if the story didn't try to do too many things at once. If it stuck with mech-combat, it should stick with mech-combat. It's just pointless to try and shove some meaningless mech-combat into a series that's clearly centered around romcom. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, the romcom is good. It's amusing, albeit somewhat predictable, and it's able to keep me entertained. However, if you're expecting any quality combat animation or plotline, steer clear. The series as a whole would be better if it didn't try to half-ass the IS combat and leave things half explained about how IS works. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, the series is more seinen romcom slice of life stuff rather than deep action stuff. The deep action stuff actually looks absurdly bad in comparison to the romcom, so be prepared to avert your eyes or cringe. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you're expecting any in-depth explanation about IS, how it works, and its effects on the world at large, you're out of luck. This series doesn't cover any serious stuff like that. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are above average, the pictures run smoothly and it's aesthetically pleasing to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is memorable, although the OST is a bit generic and not much to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nAlas, the writers were exceptionally lazy in this department. Ichika is the stereo-typical \"completely clueless\" protagonist, his two childhood friends are closely similar to each other as violent tsunderes, Cecelia gives off a cultured lady aura but otherwise has no outstanding traits, Laura is also a tsundere. Every other background girl want Ichika's D. I think the only genuinely likeable character I've seen so far is Charles, for reasons that you'll soon see. Everyone else had their characters 3D printed off the internet. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite the slapadash action scenes, the meh OST and the pretty uncreative characters, I believe Infinite Stratos is enjoyable if you like slice of life romcom harem. Some of it will be frustrating; you will soon lose count at the amount of times you facepalm at Ichika's ineptitude or the amount of times Houki turns from tsun to dere at the drop of a hat. The action scenes will be pretty bad, and the moments where Ichika is supposed to look cool will usually not achieve that effect, but I think the absurd romcom makes up for it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is a lighthearted comedic drama following the life of Ichika Orimura during his eventful life entering a previously all-girl Infinite Stratos academy. The IS academy trains students in the use of Infinite Stratos, which are mechanized power armor suits capable of flight and extreme combat conditions that voided conventional weapons when they were introduced. One catch though...\r\nOnly women could pilot them.\r\nInfinite Stratos is pretty much a straight comedy with a bit of drama mixed in. The antics surrounding being the only guy in an all-girl combat school is ripe with awkward moments and hilariously bad (read: so bad its great) humor. His complexrelationship with basically the entire student body (remember, they're all girls who're interested in the only guy to pilot an IS) can be a bit much sometimes, but there are at least a few moments of GOLD mixed into the series\\n\\n\r\nOf course most of the hilarious moments (and the creepy ones) belong with the main cast. Most of the conflict in the series is between the main cast over who gets Ichika. The main cast includes Houki (Ichika's old childhood friend), Cecilia (a British noblewoman going to the academy), Huang \"Rin\" (another childhood friend), Laura Bodewig (a strange student from Germany), and... Charles (it makes sense in context). The characters are pretty well developed for the short time we've gotten to see them on screen. Among the cast are some genuinely nice characters, others are just a bit weird.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has absolutely no shame about its plot or themes. It goes full-speed into the crazy and awkward with no regard for being \"normal\". From the copious amounts of fanservice, to the very-nearly-an-excuse-plot plot, to the ridiculous (and many times very violent) romantic subplots, this series never misses a chance to go over the top somehow.\\n\\n\r\nI also found that it was voice acted quite well (I only have a tenuous grasp on Japanese, but what I did hear was quite good). The majority of the cast have their characters and their quirks down well. The inflections were frequently spot on and nothing ever seems too overacted. Still, when the cast is required to be crazy, they certainly deliver.\\n\\n\r\nI've gotta say though, sometimes you've got to wonder if this show is going anywhere in particular. I realize that the plot isn't exactly a selling point but come on, is there anything else here? For nearly 14 episodes now (I've seen the first two for season two) the question of why Ichika can use an IS hasn't really even been mentioned. I'm hoping that season two starts picking up the slack on this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother painful one, there are so many awkward moments in this series. It just gets overwhelming. At least every other episode has one such moment played for laughs on Ichika (and is usually followed up by a girl kicking his ass, usually hilarious). This is fine for the episode-a-day crowd, but I was marathon'ing this thing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos (IS) was a very great anime and convinced me that indeed not all animes about mech battle suits end up like Gundam Seed, but actually have great plots and characters you can relate to as well as the comedy and romantic moments we all look forward to :P\r\nThe story behind IS is pretty easy to follow basically women begin to rule the planet because they can dominate using mech suits know as IS, young women are taught the basics of piloting these war machines in the only school that allows  it to be taught, IS Academy, but a big surprise comes whena male student transfers into the school being the only male known who can operate an IS, with this begins long, funny and romantic adventures of a male surrounded by females who r very capable with fighting inside these IS\\n\r\nThe art was great, i loved the animation style of all the characters and the well drawn backgrounds as well as the small details put into every individual shot was great, what convinced me the most was the excellent visuals of the IS, unlike mech suits you would see in shows like Gundam Seed, these were much more better drawn and detailed, and i'm a girl for goodness sake to find myself praising an anime about anything mech related i was surprised :)\\n\r\nThe sound was also great, as everyone quite well knows an anime isn't an anime without the sounds and the sounds people did their job great, i'd like to commend the great voice acting skills and music they put into this show because it was awesome :D\\n\r\nThe characters of this show were ROFL awesome, Ichika is the main male protagonist who seems to be a little thick-headed when it comes to women but still abides by because where he lacks in charm he makes up in bravery and courage and his will to win is amazing, then Houki one of the main female heroines who knew Ichika since he was little, she is very hostile towards any one who gets close to her childhood friend yet at the same time is willing to slice and dice him if he does anything perverted, then along the way we meet more women who fall in love with Ichika such as Cecilia the British representative who falls in love after his amazing skills in battle were shown off to her, Lingyin (Rin) who is another childhood friend of his and secretly loves him as well, Charlotte who orginal intentions were led astray when she falls in love with Ichika when he protects her, and Laura who has a very powerful IS but as well falls in love and make Ichika her wife (LOLZ)\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed watching this anime and i would recommend that you watch it if you are in need of watching an anime or you just need a good laugh or two while also watching action :)",

It fails to tie up loose ends but are we really going to flame something that everyone knows no effort was invested in the first place?\r\n(In other words if you thought the anime sucked because the plot sucked, you sir, are a retard. No shit the plot was going to suck)\r\nwell, not me. It has enough to carry what it wants to showcase but as always, they didn't try and they could have...\r\nmeh...\r\nArt - 9\r\nThis is it, the highlight of this anime.This should be one of the only reasons you decide to spend twenty minutes in an episode. If not the well drawn service, the battle scenes in the sky is worth giving a look. The breath taking scenery and altitude of the fights in the air was awesome. It gives you a slight thrill of being 'in the air'. Be sure to watch it on a big screen with high quality for full effect. Battle suits and etc were also well animated.\\n\\n\r\nOf course if service is your main focus, art is a must have. They went an extra mile with the air battles.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was good, battle sounds, and back ground music was fair. Pretty cool OP and ED themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but fuck you if you're looking for character development in an anime clearing showing off it's service. Why don't you just go looking for water in the desert? We have a Childhood Friend Tsundere, a Princess, The Other Childhood Friend, The Reverse Trap, and the Military German.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some outstanding scenes of awesome that works off the personalities of the characters, but personality doesn't mean development, nor does it mean solid characters that are done well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nI got what I freaking expected and a little more at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, expectations are to be at a very low if you want a high probability of enjoying this anime. Don't go looking for plot or development. Go looking for service, a cheap harem, and some awesome air battles.\\n\\n\r\nI repeat, good quality and a large screen are some things you might want for the full effect. It's not always necessary though.",

            "content": "Oh boy. Where do I begin with this mess. \r\nPLOT:\r\nWell, the first thing I want to address is that there's no plot. At all. In all 12 episodes, the characters go from fight to fight and problem to problem with no real connection between them until the very end. So, if you're looking for a plot that even exists, then don't bother, but very few harems have plots anyway.\r\nPROTAGONIST:\r\nThe second biggest issue is the protagonist. Ichika is quite literally, the densest harem protagonist of them all. Every 5 seconds he's confused about either a concept he's learning in school or a hint one of themany girls are trying to get through to him. He continuously misses it all, and it got frustrating after the first few times. This running gag must have went on for a few times every episode. At least. Let's also not forget that he's generic as all hell on top of that, and doesn't have any distinguishing qualities from the many bland harem protagonists out there. \\n\\n\r\nOne point about Ichika's density that's important to mention is that the light novels later on point out that Ichika is doing this all on purpose so he doesn't get killed by the girls he doesn't choose. By playing dumb, it gives him a buffer. However, I see this as nothing more than a retcon. There are plenty of points where we can hear his thoughts and they clearly displayed Ichika being confused and not understanding the situation at all. If you've seen this point brought up in defense of this garbage show, don't listen to it. The retcon is sloppily done. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point I don't understand is why all of the girls are into Ichika. Harem anime are usually choked to the brim with power fantasy, with the male MC showing off his power for the women so that they fawn over him. However, Ichika is generally not that powerful and doesn't have the 'stupid but powerful' trope that is commonly used. I'd say that this is what I appreciate the most about IS, that it doesn't give in to ALL of the common self insert tropes that these shows follow, but that just leads to other issues. The girls shouldn't be into Ichika at all, aside from Houki and Rin, who were both his childhood friends. Still, once they experience his density first hand, that old desire should disappear quickly. \\n\\n\r\nSECONDARY CHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe harem isn't as bad as the protagonist, but it's still pretty damn bad. Most of the girls are basically all the same character after their introduction. They're from different countries and they all are hopelessly in love with Ichika. I also think their designs are all pretty damn generic except for the main girl, Houki. Something about her is a cut above the rest. That isn't to say that Houki's personality isn't as annoying as the rest of them, but at least she's the most appealing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the entire harem shouldn't have any interest in Ichika. The power fantasy makes up for this gaping hole, but without it, the idea makes even less sense. I mean, I understand that these shows are designed for self insert, but it's still really lazy. \\n\\n\r\nIMPLICATIONS:\\n\r\nThere's an idea that this anime puts forward. Women are the only ones that can plot the IS, with Ichika being the only man in the world that can do so as well. Women are basically the ones who take control of the world because of this, and the anime never addresses this. What does it do with this concept? Puts a male in an all girls school and they all fall over him every second. That's what I call a lost opportunity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nThis anime takes a concept that could have had something to say and turned it into generic harem trash. There's no real plot and what happens in episode to episode are events we've seen in other anime a billion times over. \\n\\n",

He is the only boy in the whole world who can control an IS (a mecha) and for this reason he was forcibly enrolled in a boarding school full of girls.\r\nThree words would describe the show perfecly - Harem clich\u00e9 overload\r\nLet's go more in depth.\r\nStory (4/10)\r\nThe story in this anime had no meaning or purpose. I didn't find anything interesting. The plots were predictable, no, nevermind, the whole story was. If you're looking for something unexpected or in-depth, this show is not for you. It did not push the boundaries of the topic of mechas(and harem) and it wasn't unique in any way\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound (6.5/10) The art wasn't too bad, but the fighting was sometimes harder to understand because a lot of it happened at a distance, and the sound is mediocre, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nOh boy...\\n\r\nIchika -the boy from who's perspective we see the show is the most stereotypical anime main. He has fair reasons for his actions but they are very boring. I can't write anyhting more about him because the show did not provide me with that information clearly.\\n\\n\r\nThe five main girls - I won't even separate them because they're literally all the same, the only things that are different are appearances and accents. None of them have character depth and the show portrays them as if the only thing they want is to get in Ichikas pants.\\n\\n\r\nThough, on the other hand the supports had so much more depth to them. (Chifuyu). I found her the most interesting, though showing her standing like a statue staring at the screen 20% of her moments is wasteful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nTo my surprise, I found this show to be somewhat entertaining, don't know why though.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the show isn't very bad except for its terrible story and character develpment.

            "content": "IS: Infinite Stratos is a terminally dull experience that, in the two days I spent struggling to binge watch it, taught me more than I ever thought I would know about the state of anime today. Even that makes it sound more interesting than it actually is.\r\nNow, just to get this out of the way, I'm not a big anime guy. That being said, I understand to some extent how storytelling works, and this is why I feel qualified enough to tell you why you should not watch the anime in question unless you are REALLY thirsty.\r\nOur story is set in Japan in the nearfuture, at the prestigious IS Academy. In this future, genius scientist Tabane Shinonono has created a technology known as the Infinite Stratos, or IS. The IS are nothing more than mecha suits that, oddly, can only be operated by women, and the academy where the story takes place is where women from all over the world go to learn how to use the IS. Cool.\\n\\n\r\nMeet our main protagonist, Ichika Orimura. He's a fifteen-year old boy who is heading into his first year at the IS Academy. For mysterious reasons, he is the only man in the world who seems capable of operating the IS.\\n\\n\r\nA new viewer who was heading into the show with the above information might, reasonably enough, ask him or herself the following questions: How do the IS work? Why can only women operate them? What about Ichika is special, and why can he operate the IS? How is modern society affected by the IS? How have gender roles been affected? How have the IS been used by world leaders and political powers?\\n\\n\r\nJust as the show graciously did, I am not going to answer any of these questions, because fuck you, that's why. You thought this was a show about giant robots? So did I, when I decided to watch this. Boy, was that ever a gigantic fucking mistake.\\n\\n\r\nWhat IS: Infinite Stratos is actually about is the most oblivious, superficial, uninteresting male teenager ever to be born who, despite lacking any characteristics that might make him suitable for romancing, manages to collect an absurd number of girls who are all after his cock. Given that this show is entirely 'character' driven, I am going to assign scores to the aspects neither I nor the writers care about.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 1/10, for nothing more than existing. There's no reason why the IS can't be operated by men, there's no reason why they've been banned by the military (yes, this world-rending machine of absolute destruction has been prohibited from being used BY THE MILITARY. I said that.)\\n\r\nNothing in this show happens for a justifiable reason. Any time an action scene takes place, it doesn't make any sense, it simply happens. There's little that could have been done to worsen this anime's story short of making it contradict itself from episode to episode.\\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10. Nothing noteworthy here. None of the character designs are memorable. The only features that visibly distinguish any of the characters are the length and colour of their hair, their height, and in the case of a few characters, specific items of clothing. The backgrounds are sufficiently well detailed, but the whole show has a distinctly orange-and-blue hue, as in the colour of the sunset contrasting with the colour of the sky or the ocean. By a long shot the most overused color palette in today's media.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10. The most forgettable part of the show by far. So forgettable I actually forgot what it was like. The voice acting is at least solid, but the music? I honestly couldn't tell you if there even WAS any. (I'm kidding, there was. But there could just as well have not been). A lot of the time, the music amps up--more than befits the scene, actually--and that only amplifies its genericness.\\n\\n\r\nNow. Ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on tight. Let's talk about the CHARACTER.\\n\\n\r\n2/10, solid. I'll explain why this isn't a 1 very shortly.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is, as I mentioned, oblvious. This wouldn't be a problem if he didn't frequently give the impression that he was being a prick to the girls on purpose. I can distinctly recall two exchanges (paraphrased):\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, Ichika, do you want to go out sometime?\" \\n\r\n\"Sure.\" \\n\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" \\n\r\n\"Yeah, just for some shopping, of course.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course (note that this is a different girl):\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm really glad you asked me to come along for some shopping.\"\\n\r\n\"Well, I did need to buy a few things, so might as well.\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even kidding. He is so incredibly dense, frustrating, and incapable of getting the hint that these girls like him that I started to wonder if HE was the mecha all along. My resolve broke about an episode and a half away from the ending, so if that is actually how it goes, then well fucking played. (That's not how it goes, by the way.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, there's a harem. The character is lacklustre, so I suppose the dick must be out of this world, or perhaps the girls are just as brain-dead as he is. I'll list them off really quickly because there's nothing really worth talking about. There are more characters in the show and more are without a doubt introduced in the light novels and second season, but I won't include them because I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nHouki: she is the 'childhood friend'. She's the typical girl who sets up an imaginary restraining order between the main character and any other person of the female form, and gets angry whenever he speaks to a girl who isn't her. Nothing really to talk about here. She gets mad at him. That's it. She's also the sister of the scientist who invented the IS, but I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nCecilia: she is the 'posh foreigner'. A so-called IS representative from the UK, she has been given a role by her country the meaning of which I will not give you because I neither know it nor care about it. This character has pretty much no reason to be part of the harem. She hates the protagonist, has a mecha battle with him, and realises she loves him. She has literally no reason to do so--she has not undergone any development, nor has any chemistry been shown between the two. She gets angry at him a lot, a bit like Houki. Exactly like Houki, actually. She's the same as Houki but more annoying.\\n\\n\r\nRinin: she is the 'childhood friend'. Again. She's the typical girl who sets up an imaginary restraining order between the main character and... you get where I'm going with this, right? The IS representative from China, she is identical to Houki in every aspect other than the fact she's slightly less dislikable, and this is entirely due to the fact she is not around for the first episode or so. I don't remember exactly when she makes her appearance because I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nCharlotte Dunois: she is the 'shy girl'. She is the IS representative from France, and I have graced her with remembering her surname, because she is the only girl who isn't a bitch. Hold it--that doesn't make her a well written character, far from it. She is still far behind the line of feeling like a real person, the standard any good character should be held to. However, she is the only one who did not annoy me while she was on screen, on top of having the best voice actor. She should and would be the girl for the protagonist to date if his programmers had taught him the meaning of the word.\\n\\n\r\nLaura: she is the 'emotionless girl'. The IS representative from Germany, she is the girl who is all action. She hates the main character and attempts to have a few battles with him, at the end of which she gets defeated and realises she's in love with him while also being angry at him. Yes, precisely like the other girl. One of the other ones, take your pick. She has some backstory with the protagonist's sister, who I haven't mentioned thus far because I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. These are the girls who I don't care about and who are all irrevocably in love with a robotic apparition that was sent down by an extremely petty alien race to annoy me beyond belief. I would pity each of them if it was possible to pity cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters in this show, but I actually don't care.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3/10. This was not a torturous experience, believe it or not. There are dangerous shades of the 'so bat it's good' effect here, but this is no M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening. The very few laughs this show managed to eke out of me were not so much because I was laughing at its incompetence, because it's truthfully not bad enough for that. It falls just below the worst place for a piece of entertainment to be, the point of being absolutely dull and boring in every way. This show occasionally managed to make me shake my head and laugh in desperation at what other clich\u00e9 scene or character would be introduced the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10. Look, if you wanna watch a show about a lifeless android and five autistic girls who are obsessed with his cock, with a mecha plot that exists as nothing more than the vessel through which to introduce our male protagonist into a female-only setting, then be my guest. Enjoy the countless, hilarious scenes of Girl N walking in on Boy with Girl N+1 and getting angry at him, or perhaps the belly-laugh inducing scenes of Boy walking in on Girl N while she's changing/in the shower and getting beat up by her. Enjoy this show if you can, you'll do better than I did.\\n\\n\r\nIf you, on the other hand, have even a passing interest in a believable romance, enjoyable characters, or a plot, avoid this show like you would the bubonic plague.",

            "content": "To put in shortly, this was SAO with a school and mecha element put in. The long way to analyze this series however takes a little bit more ridicule. A convoluted and sporadic plot had different conflicts being introduced frequently and with a lack of an overall storyline that nearly begins to get on track but then falls off the rails into another unexplained sub story. Unfortunately, this anime also follows the widely known trope of a harem consisted of literally anyone that meets the main character, which again contributes to a confusing overall story as it pulls away from needed time to explain anddevelop a cohesive plot. As for the main character himself, no real character development is ever truly accomplished. The Ichika from the beginning of the series is the same dense, overpowered, and self insert trope by the end of it. As for the art and animation, its average, nothing special to be said besides its extensive use of 3d models paired with 2d animation, which depending on the viewer can change ones perception of the show overall. Sound design and soundtrack are about the same as well, although the first season's opening was quite good. Ultimately, this show feels like a repeat of archetypes and characters that have been used time and time again across the genre and isn't a series necessary or worthy of your time to add to your watch history.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos... The premise seems promising. One guy. Lots of girls. Sci-fi setting. But in the end it was not a great anime, mainly because of the lack of story and character development.\r\n1/Story:\r\nStorywise, it seems promising, set in the future, a new type of weapons was created... and can only be maneuvered by girls. But wait, there is one guy that can do it too, and it's the main character. After that he's intagrated into the academy, and... it's quite fun to see his interactions with all those girls =D The main issue here is... there isn't really a storyline. We're just observing the maincharacter's interactions with the girls he's competing with to become the best IS pilot. Still fun to watch but lacks a bit of development.\\n\r\nVerdict: 5/10. Too lacking.\\n\\n\r\n2/Art (Design, visuals, animation)\\n\r\nReally good. The futurist design is quite good. Still an academy setting, but there are alot of details in there. The mecha (IS) are pretty well designed too. And best of all, the visuals (quality of the animation, backgrounds, action sequences) are REALLY good. If you watch this without scratching your head, then you will like, for what it is: a futurist harem with some good action scenes.\\n\r\nVerdict: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n3/Sound (Openings/endings, Music, Sound Effects, Seiyus)\\n\r\nThis is another part where this anime shines. The music is pretty good. Each sequence, be it romance, action, or serious story part, have good music fitting it. The opening theme is the anime in a nutshell: disconnect your brain and enjoy the ride =) (didn't like as much the ending theme though). As for the seiyus (Voice over actors), most of them were quite good. Special note goes to Charles Dunois. So cute ^_^\\n\r\nVerditc: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n4/ Characters\\n\r\nMmm, here is another part that is a bit lacking. There is some character development, but not so much. Characters are pretty much one-sided... This could have been better, especially if the main character (the hero) hadn't been as stupid as he is ^^ But, hey, it's part of the show, like in Love Hina, to enjoy all those interactions and get a good laugh of it =)\\n\r\nVerdict: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n5/ Enjoyment\\n\r\nPretty good, pretty good. Despite some glaring flaws, which have been said in previous points, the anime still deserves to be watch. It's just 12 episodes + 1 OVA after all. If you need to get some entertainment, this is it ^_^ I had some good laughs out of this anime. Some soft- echi scenes as well, as this is a Harem -themed anime also. And the story, despite being a bit bland, was not so bad after all.\\n\r\nVerdict: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n6/ Overall\\n\r\nQuite a good anime, but could have been really better. If you have some free time and don't know what to watch, enjoy harem animes with some futuristic and mecha features, then this could be the anime for you. I didn't expect much of it, but it was quite en enjoyment after all =)\\n\r\nCharles Dunois saved this anime I guess ^_^\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, I'm aware it's not perfect (quite far from it in fact), being from english gramatical errors and/or vocabulary, or in the form I choosed to employ, thus I'd gladly accept any well-formed criticizm. \\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "When watching anime, sometimes ideas and logic in general need to be thrown out the window due to the sometimes complete unrealism of the series.  Infinite Stratos, does this on a quite frequent basis.  (I didn't have anything planned for this opening statement.  Let's just get to the review.)\r\nStory (6.31/10):  The story of infinite stratos is about the school life of a boy named Orimura Ichika, who is able to polite something known as an IS, or Infinite Stratos.  The catch to this, is due to the fact that only women are able to pilot these things, so, a boybeing able to polite one is a pretty big deal.  It is then that we peer into his life as we see him surrounded by the hundreds and hundreds of girls that exist within the facility where they train IS pilots.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before we get into the nitty gritty I will give an explanation for what an IS is in case you haven't read or seen the series before.  An IS is essentially a tiny gundam, with the ability to fly and shoot stuff, or perhaps even wield a sword or two.  It's sort of like a mech that only armors the arms, legs, and partially the body and head, while having two giant floating whatever they are, on either side of the pilot.  This idea in and of itself is somewhat flawed, I feel.  The reason is due to the fact that the IS's use, is somewhat muddled.  On one hand, the series says that they're used for recreational purposes and for \"sport\", yet, the series shows us these machines as real genuine weapons, as intended by their primary use.  It's really confusing to think about when the idea is muddled with the actual plot.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious idiotic initial idea of a guy being placed in a world of girls, a flaw that  Infinite Stratos seemed to have, was a lack of a direct plot line or idea.  Every few episodes, the idea of the show changes into something that is completely different than the rest of the show.  I never felt like the show had a really cohesive plot line, rather than being stuck together through production means.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pacing was rather decent in terms of the fact that the series never seemed to rush as much as I have seen before.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, IS had quite a bit of problems in terms of is storyline, but everything did actually come together rather well in terms of what the creators were going for.  Sure, it wasn't the best, but it was somewhat decent to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Watchable\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing\\n\r\n-  mashed different plot points together somewhat uncohesively\\n\r\n-  confusing mech usage\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5.95/10):  Orimura Ichika.  Just...wow.  Whenever a harem series comes into existence, the one thing, the ONE THING that is made every time they make a main character, is to make him more oblivious than the oblivious ability in pokemon.  Ichika follows this general time stream of having this same trait, but exponentially increased.  He possesses the general traits of a \"non-perverted\" harem lead by being the nice guy, being kind to girls, the whole enchilada.  With that, he has the most obvious trait of being the most oblivious guy ever, and it...is...frustrating...to...watch.  This trait made the some scenes somewhat unbearable to watch, especially due to the fact that the girls of this series give completely obvious signs that they like/love him.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find interesting, is that fact that literally, just by looking at the girls' hair, you can probably tell what their personality is.  Moving on to the girls, since they're for the most part, one-noters that only add to the fact that this is a harem series, most of them seem kind of forced.  At least 2 or 3 out of the entire harem seem somewhat forced in terms of liking the guy.  There was never any real sort of progression with some of the girls actually falling in love with him, and it somehow felt unnatural.  (Then again, a harem in and of itself is unnatural.)  Aside from having a huge crush on the main guy, Ichika, they all really feel like cardboard cutouts with a certain distinguishable trait, all except our main female Houki, of course because, main character status.\\n\\n\r\nFor supporting cast, we have a load of characters that range in terms of screentime.  We have some that add to the plot and show overall very well, really, playing more of a part than most of the harem girls in the series, while others are just there for reasons unknown.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast, except for a few choice members of the supporting cast, was quite bland in comparison.  Most of them were quite overused troupes and traits from series past, and there wasn't anything completely out of the ordinary or special.  (I do like Honne Nohotoke though.  She's an exception.)  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Decent supporting cast members\\n\r\n-   Densest...guy....ever....\\n\r\n-   Bland and unoriginal harem girls\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.64/10 and 7.22/10):  While the series has some flaws with its storyline and idea, the artwork has a decent thing going for it.  Created by Sentai Filmworks, the series has a thing for fight scenes with the mechs, which look surprisingly fluid and well...awesome.  The use of 3-D models in the series fits well with the flow of battle that the series uses, and the actual designs are nothing to shy away at either.  \\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, the art is a good thing to have come out of this series in general.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of its soundtrack, IS has the problem that a great number of anime series have, and that is unmemorable tracks.  While the majority of the soundtrack did sound good enough to listen to it, with the OP actually fitting for the series it was in, it wasn't so good that you would remember it for days to come.  To put it frank, the sound was good, don't get me wrong, but there wasn't any track that stood out as something that I would like to listen to over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\n+  Decently good art\\n\r\n+  Good mech designs\\n\r\n+/-  Good soundtrack, not memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (6.82/10):  As a personal fan of the harem genre, one thing that I always like trying to find, is a series where the idea of a harem goes beyond the general one guy surrounded by 5 girls, by giving the story and characters, some substance.  Essentially, what this series does differently than the normal template of a harem series.  Infinite Stratos didn't really succeed in that department.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, nothing stood out as extraordinarily different or even remotely apart from the general formula of a harem series.  Apart from that, the obliviousness that Ichika has is positively ridiculous.  So ridiculous in fact, that I had an aneurysm after raging at my paused screen by the obvious hints (that weren't even hints), that this guy was given. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I won't lie that I enjoyed this series nonetheless on account of it being a harem, (I have low standards), IS doesn't really push itself apart from the norm of a harem series, is for the most part, was pretty standard in terms of plot.  The series isn't fabulous, but it was at least watchable to some extent.  Though personally, this wouldn't be the first choice for rewatching a harem series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.46/10",

IS took a different route into making the mecha series work. Instead of a giant robot, they made a suit. Instead of a war being waged around the world with robots, they are used for sport. To get to the point, IS took a typical mecha idea and made it more intricate, which led to a surprisingly entertaining anime. The best part of the series, just as in any harem anime, is choosing a favorite [country based] female character.Making them fight over the main character just made things more interesting with robo suits. Since IS wasn't as long as most mecha series, it wasn't drawn out and boring, which worked well for its case. Overall, IS is a great anime with nice visuals and designs.",

            "content": "Alright here's my review as to season 1 of IS: (This is recommended for people who like romance action and a fun time not people looking for a very serious anime)\r\nInfinite Stratos: Is a Harem/ecchi/comedy/action series, about when a girl in japan decides to create a human functioned \"mecha warrior\" used for Olympic and sporting uses only. But with only one catch too it... only females can use them... until now. I wont ruin the story so figure out why yourself. So basically this guy Ichika is the only male able to use these robots so he gets put into an all girls school... andof course the guy is clueless in the subject of girls... i'm guessing you know how that goes. Below are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9. I gave it a nine because I really love how the story goes through with the initial thought process it doesn't go every which way like most harem anime do now a days it's very loyal too it's initial script. I would've like a bit more romance to it and that the character wouldn't be so clueless but that would've taken the fun away anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10. Nothing to complain about the artowrk this is top-notch best of the best the graphics were amazing absolutely loved the coloring and animations too it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. I loved the sound effects it had but it didn't have neraly enough unique distinctive sounds, I would've put more into it and the sound quality was a bit off as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9. I loved the way the characters were stereo-typical to there countries and how beautifully they were drawn, I did get mislead by some appearances though so i would've fixed that but overall the character's story lines and their personal effects were amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. This one of course is a personal one but I just couldn't stop laughing and crying in this series, it's one of those times when you just don't know what to do I absolutely loved the back to back action as long as romance! You don't normally get that... plus i'm a sucker for an all male in all girls or vise-versa situation there's not many out there but this one hit the spot! Thanks for reading.. Enjoy!",

            "content": "THE STORY: 5\r\nIf you are wanting a show where plot continues, and characters develop , you aren't going to get it with Infinite Stratos. The plot is very simple. There was a mecha suit designed by a \"mad scientist\", Tabane Shinonono, and only women could pilot it, men could not. Until, Ichika Orimura, gets the ability to pilot one, thus he is sent to an all girls academy. A few more characters are introduced in season two, but they don't really do much but mention plot. Sure, Ichika has a sister, another sister, somebody tries to kill him, do we get explanation to that atall? Nope. As you watch on you will see this as it goes, a bunch of story arcs get introduced, but then they just vanish. This is why things like FanFiction and doujshinshi come in. There are so many failed plotlines in this show that I'm sure fourty percent of the people watching I.S don't like it, and feel like its shit because of its story, then the other ten percent watch it just for echii, and the rest watch it because they like it. I've talked with so many people over on fanfiction, and what I get alot: I.S is great! I like to expand my own story upon it since it doesn't have such a big one to begin with! Do you see where I am going with the story? The very fact that its loathing in development, is all the more merrier for fans to expand upon it.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART:7\\n\r\nI really do enjoy the art when it comes to the Infinite Stratos. For me, it kind of seems like a mix between Power Armor and Stormtrooper gear. I think the I.S looks cool, but thats my own opinion. As far as the animation goes, again, I love it. The fights are action packed, they deliver what you'd expect from 8bit studios. \\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND(MUSIC): 10\\n\r\nI will say I love the music. The instrumentals for the moments of romance, to the music and openings, you won't be disappointed. In fact, I highly recommend you head over to a place like Sound Cloud and listen to one of the piano tracks, or opening theme. It reminds me of Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6\\n\r\nGoing back to what I said about the story, the characters, they aren't as clich\u00e9 as you may think, but some progress a lot more then others, but they shouldn't considering others get introduced earlier, and it basically just goes all over the place. One of the main characters or heroine, Houki, basically changed herself completely through another season! Overall, the characters are enjoyable, but I don't see becoming attached to one, unlike lots of others. The characters are where comedy comes in, heavy-set.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It had great music, opening soundtracks I downloaded as many of my friends did, and the characters were laughable and it had all the...Echhi too. If you enjoy a series of plots that don't lead anywhere, but you like to create and expand your own, you will enjoy this even more then just the romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\nI like this anime. It has a great setting, but it leads to so many different places, but then it stops. Thats the biggest problem! Considering FanFiction.net and Archive of Our Own still seek to keep the fanbase for this work alive, the more serious works there are way better when it comes to story. I highly suggest giving this show a watch, but as I mentioned above if you are looking to get into an anime as to where you LOVE the characters, sort of like watching Clannad, or Akame Ga Kill(two series in which the fans are intended to get emotionally attached), I don't suggest you watch it. This anime is great when you want to wind down, and watch a funny, romantic comedy. Or if you want to expand your own ideas, this show certainly has the setting to start you off.\\n\\n\\n",

This was the best anime evar!\", \"Hey man Infinite Stratos is so sick!\"\r\nSorry to burst your bubble, but it wasn't the best anime i've ever seen... but it's not the worst either. Acually, I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed how I would talk to myself on how stupid Ichika (Main Character) was toward the girls.\r\nSTORY (7/10): The story was alright, I kinda liked how all of the girls had their own history and how they ended up there. Kinda ridiculous how one of the girls was Tsundere toward Ichika.The ending, easy to apprehend, too bad I won't be talking about that o_o spoilers bro. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6/10): Once again, I liked how the characters informed the viewer about their history and how they ended up in their scenario, but this is where the anime kind of suffers. Some of the other characters that are sometimes seen in the episodes are not well defined and placed in the anime as if they were supporting characters, leaving the viewer to think \"What happend to them?\"\\n\\n\r\nSomething that confuses me is that.. This is a Harem-Mecha. Sure okay, that worked in Full Metal Panic, but this defied realism on a certain scale. When flying through the air at maybe 200 km/h, is it possible your face keeps it's shape like its made out of metal? NO. That's what confuses me. They accelerate through the air at ridiculous speeds, yet they can still move their body. Maybe their androids... \\n\\n\r\nAnyways  overall, the anime was good, I admired it's attributes. Not the best, not the worst. :)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 7\\n\\n\r\nIf you're bored, watch this anime, you will enjoy it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is a very enjoyable anime. Flying through the skies with a customized bot, along with tons of action and fanservice... how could it not be enjoyable? It most certainly has a Strike Witches-esque feel to it. And its English dub in particular was absolutely stellar with consideration when it was made (it was produced before Sentai Filmworks got good). I love the regional accents Sentai used for Cecilia, Laura and Charlotte. \r\nBut there's one thing that absolutely bugged the living hell out of me. I'm sure many of you would agree. It's the fact that Chifuyu called Ichika by HIS LAST NAME. Uh,excuse me? They're siblings. No, not \"Cadet Orimura\" or anything similar like that (I probably wouldn't even be writing this if they incorporated that instead); JUST ORIMURA. Yeah, I get that Chifuyu's supposed to be strict and stuff, but what point is she trying to make here? Also, isn't she essentially referring to HERSELF? I mean, she's Orimura, too. It's absolutely dumb. It makes more sense if she called the others by their last name (which she did), but it makes ZERO sense for her to have done the same to Ichika, especially with consideration that she forfeited the second IS championship to save her brother from kidnappers. Actually, scratch that - if you're family, you use first names only. It irritates me even more when Chifuyu calls Laura by her first name, BUT NOT ICHIKA?! This is one thing that should have never been carried over to the dub. I mean, if the original JP is retarded, don't be retarded like them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also ludicrous that other people would refer to Ichika by his last name too, besides Chifuyu. I believe kid Hoki's speech quite practically echoes my thoughts here: \"Everyone here is called Shinonono; that's why it's confusing if you don't call me by my name!\" For whatever reason, did the function of first names completely fly over the characters' heads? For the record, I wouldn't even be ranting about this IF Ichika is only addressed by first name (it really, really should have been that way). If there's one thing that's preventing me from enjoying the dub completely, it's what I've just said. It's a damn shame, really. The acting is done so well... \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 6/10 (4 points deducted from carrying over retarded elements)",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of the entire series, OVAs included.\r\nOverview:\r\n\"Infinite Stratos\" is the result of combining two of the unlikeliest of genres: the ecchi/harem genre and the humongous mecha genre. One can definitely see the appeal of girls doing silly antics over the boy they like while also fighting terrorist threats in very form-fitting mech suits. Unfortunately, that's just about all the appeal most people will find because as far as harem anime go, \"Infinite Stratos\" really is a cliche, and never manages to be any more than decent.\r\nStory (5.5/10):\r\nThe series is set in the not-too-distant future, where women are now the dominantgender i.e. the most powerful and influential people in the world are all women. The reason for this shift in power is the titular Infinite Stratos (IS for short) an extremely powerful mech suit that almost resulted in a nuclear war upon being created and, for some reason, can only be piloted by women. To manage this new weapon, a multicultural school known as IS Academy has been set up in order to train girls who are most qualified to wield it. That's where the main character comes in in the form of Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old everyman who, as fate would have it, is the first and only male able to pilot the machines, and has to attend the prestigious academy for his own protection.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now, I say the world is women-dominated, but throughout the series, we're given very little evidence that this is actually the case. No authority figures are ever shown in the series and there's a really noticeable lack of world-building, as we never get to see much of the world outside the academy, so we're not given any real insight as to what this women-dominated society is actually like. We only have the characters' word, and even that's only mentioned within a few minutes of the first episode and never brought up again. This is what it looks like when a series puts forward an interesting idea then does absolutely nothing with it. It's as though the writer just thought of the concept when he started writing the series but then conveniently abandoned it in the rest of the story, and that's a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even beyond the wasted concept, the series really doesn't do anything we haven't seen a hundred times before. Pretty much any harem cliche that you can think of, chances are it's here. Don't get me wrong, though. There are some parts where good storytelling shines through, the World Purge-hen OVA being a notable example. The problem is that these parts are few and far between, and overall the story is something you should definitely take with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8.5/10):\\n\r\nVisually, \"Infinite Stratos\" doesn't look anything special on the surface. The characters are well-drawn but they don't really look better than anything else that came out around the same time. What looks brilliant, however, is the mech fights, which are really well-animated. Seriously, if there's one thing this series does right, it's knowing how to animate a good fight. There is plenty of CGI involved, but it's very well done and only serves to enhance the quality of the fights rather than diminish it.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8/10):\\n\r\nThe music definitely isn't anything to write home about. It fits the series but there aren't many memorable tracks and they mostly just blend in. The openings are nice, though, and I will admit I found the time to listen to them rather than skipping them. As far as the voice acting goes, the dub is noteworthy in that it has each of the foreign characters use their respective accents. The results are... mixed. Shannon Emerick and Tiffany Grant do great jobs as the French Charlotte and German Laura, but Brittney Karbowski doing the British Cecilia is not great, and easily rivals Black Star as one of her weakest performances. The Japanese characters are generally well-voiced too, especially Houki, which is unsurprising given that it's Monica Rial.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nThere isn't an awful lot to say about Ichika. As I said before, he's very much an everyman, being your typical nice guy who attracts the feelings of multiple girls. He's also very dense and makes some really bone-headed decisions. At the same time, though, he's not without redeeming moments and his determination is certainly nothing to scoff at. There are also hints that he's not as oblivious as he seems, with some even speculating that he's doing it on purpose, which is understandable given his situation. Ultimately, he gave me no real reason to love him but no real reason to hate him either. Instead, I was more-or-less neutral. If I were to pick a favourite character, it would have to be Houki Shinonono. Now, never mind the fact that she sets off two MAJOR cliche alarms (tsundere and childhood friend). While she does start off as quite a bitch, she mellows out completely by about halfway through the first season, and from then on only hits Ichika when he makes her really angry (which happens less often than you'd think) or is about to do something really stupid i.e. she does what one does in any mech series. Additionally, through her past we see clearly that she's far from the most emotionally stable person you'll ever meet, so her tsundere nature is more justified than most. The \"World-Purge\" OVA sealed the deal for me, however, as through the girls' fantasies we clearly see that regardless of how Houki may treat Ichika at times, she's the best fit for him.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noteworthy character is Charlotte Dunois, a transfer student from France. She is notable in that she is the kindest of the girls, with her main goal being to ensure Ichika's happiness instead of winning him over, though ironically she calls him a pervert more than any other girl, to the point that it's practically her catchphrase. While I didn't like her quite as much as Houki, she does come pretty damn close and the series would definitely be a lot worse without her in it. There's also Laura Bodewig, a very skilled IS pilot who was trained as a soldier her entire life and so has no social skills, to the point that she often says ridiculous things with a completely straight face- basically, she's like a female Sousuke Sagara, which makes her highly entertaining to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a character I didn't care for, it's Cecilia Alcott. Not only is her voice rather annoying, but she embodies pretty much every British stereotype you can think of- she's snooty, egotistical, has serious daddy issues and is terrible at cooking (there's even a scene early on when Ichika asks her how many times England has one the 'National Worst Cuisine Award'). Another character I wasn't a fan of is Huang Lingyin, or Rin as everyone calls her, Ichika's second childhood friend who is even more violent than Houki, to the point of being a Yandere, something no-one seems to care about or even comment on. Even worse is that unlike Houki, she doesn't even have a reason for acting the way she does. Thankfully, both Rin and Cecilia decrease in prominence as time goes on, and by the second season have been demoted to \"those two girls\". Taking their places is the Sarashiki siblings, Tatenashi and Kanzashi, though the latter doesn't get introduced until halfway through the season, which is a shame as I found her to be the more interesting of the two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\r\nIn addition to being brilliantly animated, the mech battles are also highly entertaining... when they happen. Unfortunately, there are a few episodes that are dedicated to nothing but tasteless fanservice that add absolutely nothing to the series. There is plenty of comedy, but a lot of it is pretty mundane and repetitive, though there are some really funny moments to be found.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nGreat mech fights notwithstanding, \"Infinite Stratos\" is average in almost every way. The story is forgettable and underdeveloped, the characters are likeable but not anything special and the sound is good but not fantastic. If you're one of those people who enjoys harem anime with all the typical cliches, or just really like awesome mech fights, then by all means jump right in. However, if you prefer anime with an actually good story or some form of originality, then this is a series that's best saved for a rainy day.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n5.5+8.5+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10",

            "content": "This friggin MC is more dense than uranium and more oblivious than a slowpoke that it actually makes it hilarious to watch. The show can be so predictable with it's tropes and stereotypes; at times I found myself literally saying the characters' lines right before they'd say them. Don't get me wrong though, that's why it's such a fun watch.\r\nDepending on which kind of a person you are, you'll do one of two things while watching this show.\r\n1. Turn the show off and get away from the frustration that this MC can evoke from deep within your very soul; leaving your face bleeding from thenumerous atomic facepalms you will endure.\\n\\n\r\n2. Make you die of laughter from the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and dialogue. (That's me.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual reasoning behind my score, the characters and plot are like an unsalvageable burning trainwreck due to their one dimensional depth and their aforementioned predictability. The animation, sound design and music are all fairly par for the course, with the exception of the CG surprisingly working out fairly well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves the fan-service which isn't gratuitous in terms of what you get to see; however it is made up for in the variously sexually suggestive acts that the girls attempt. Speaking of the girls, they're all pretty much stereotypes that fall in love with the MC for a convoluted reason that is ultimately insignificant. Otherwise, you've got plenty of stereotypes to chose from the \"best-girl bin\" so you should be fine.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told though, the best way to enjoy this show is that you should absolutely, under no circumstances, take this show with any seriousness. In doing this you will enjoy playing spot-the-trope bingo and elevate your powers of prediction to an unforseen level. If you can't do this then I'm afraid you will not enjoy the clueless MC that's more thick than an anime mother's thighs cooking porridge. Hope you enjoy!",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is a pretty decent anime, nothing too good or too bad to enjoy.\r\nFirst off, the good points about this anime is the story. It's good so see some original content that brings the watcher into the anime to find out more about it. We get one genius (potentially a sexist too) who has created an exo-skeleton suit called IS (Infinite Stratos) that can only be piloted by woman, and thus split the world into two with women who are now the dominate gender, and the males who are classified as feeble, weak etc. And so enters our dense harem lead Ichika Orimura whocan for no reason at all pilot an IS and is forced to attend an IS Academy filled with girls to fill in the harem and \"one man, limitless girls\" quota that this anime brings to the table. The plot doesn't even try to touch on the subject of bringing equality back to the world, but focuses purely on one boy and his life around girls who are head over heels for him just because he's a boy. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, oh boy the characters of this anime are so cliche and generic. Our main boy and girls is a dense harem MC, a childhood friend, the boastful princess-type, the second childhood friend, the sweet and likable one and lastly the girl with no common sense. While I'm on the subject, let me get the character Dub/Sub voices off my chest. The Sub is 100x better than the Dub. Why? The Subs sound more natural and doesn't seem to sound a bit racist. While in the Dubs, they have fake and poorly voiced accents for the main five harem girls, while the behind-the-scene characters such as the unnamed students are awfully voiced. They sound bland and emotionless without any true effort put into them. For example, one student in episode 2 sounded like a hippie. It's that awful.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the art and music are without a doubt really good with smooth 3D animations during IS screen time and return to the 2D animation afterwards. The opening and ending of this anime are cheerful, sung by female J-pop bands. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, the anime can be enjoyed if you're a fan of mecha, harem, cliche comedy and really don't care about the characters.",

            "content": "If your a guy how does a school just for women that teaches them how  to pilot huge mechas that kick total ass sound? Pretty good am I right? Well in Infinite Stratos that is the reality. A mega harem should you say filled with infinite possiblites and they throw mechas into the mix to keep your attention about it.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nI feel story wise a school that teaches students how to use mechas doesn't sound that original may disappoint you but this doesn't really focus on mechas all that much. It really focuses on Ichika and the huge harem on his shoulders. It setsa very comedic tone to you just to sit back and enjoy women fighting over one guy. Very hilarious if you ask me but I still feel like they could of done more with the mechas instead of the usually fight with one mysterious mecha with somewhat great power bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nIt has a very up to date art style and it looks very beautiful. The color schemes are very vibrant and IS machines themselves don't stand out and fit in nicely with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the OP and ED quite frankly. Not much to note about but they don't feel very distinguished like I would remember them if I heard them again down the road.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nThe development of characters was okay but I really enjoyed the diversity in the characters associated. Lot of different kinds and Infinite Stratos presents them in a way you'll be rooting for which girl wins out over the others. They also made me laugh with about ever little bit presented in the anime it sort of reminded me of things like Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIf like a harem with infinite possibilities this just may be something you need to check out. I know the Mecha genre is really all that popular anymore but the focus isn't really set on the IS Machines at all really. But if you were looking for a good Mecha anime, this is not the best example to show for the genre but it is a good series to start with if your just getting into it and I can't wait to watch the second season.",

Pretty much, the synopsis does a decent job in setting the mood for what the whole anime is going to be on. \"Ichika's busy school life surrounded by girls has begun.\" Yeah... sums up the whole anime real well.\r\nStory: 4\r\nWait... there was a story? The story was essentially girls fighting over one guy. However, introducing the girls one at a time was pretty cool... You get to see all kinds of archetypes from the tsundere to the super attached girl to the bestgirl. Whatever, the story was near nonexistent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was actually good in this. The background was overall well drawn as were the characters. Fighting scenes looked cool and overall a bright style of art that sets the mood for the anime. Cheerful, carefree, and kinda funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OPs and the endings were all pretty good. They were cheerful music that went well with the anime. Once again, cheerful mood... The other sounds, such as the voices and background music etc., weren't that bad either. They essentially fit what the anime was trying to hit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nHmmm.... What to say. Well, when the characters are first introduced, I had hope that they would have a little bit more dimension. The characters do all change... into girls obsessed with the main character. The main character does not change at all and remains a blockhead for the whole series. Some characters are hardly explained, which was annoying. However, the introduction to the characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThis was one of those animes where you chill and watch for the heck of it. Not really much of a story, traditional bathroom scenes, harem scenes, weird scenes? It's really light-hearted, so it shouldn't be taken too seriously. There were funny scenes which made the experience better though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes to could possibly have been good until it took a turn on the harem road and became a flat-out harem anime. It was funny with good art and overall likeable characters, but... no story... at all. I probably wouldn't recommend this unless the person asked for very specific criteria, i.e. mecha, harem. Other than that, there are better anime to watch for mecha, harem, slice of life, action, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review!

            "content": "This review applies to all sessions and releases of the IS anime.\r\nEverytime I remember Orimura's face, the first thought that comes to mind is: total blockhead. The guy is portrayed as the only guy that can run a mech besides ALL the girls in the universe. The amount of harem is huge within the anime. And often, there are \"fights\" between the girls and snarky comments for him. Its a big + for all the non-sense drama.\r\nThe male lead while being special, treated specially and is literally the focus of all the pretty girls is among the biggest sack of bricks that I've seen inanime. He is that dumb and embarrassed. With that being said, my dilemma is if its accidental or intentional. That I may never find out, was it genius or madness that made this character so realistically stupid. A big also is that he is shown as \"weak\" male and that's what drives the anime -- all the OP girls in mechs want to protect this guy because he is too dumb for his own good.\\n\\n\r\nEither way throughout the length of the anime, there are ton of boob touching accidents and embarrassing scenes, often public. But there are no big \"omg\" moments besides a few kiss scenes. With that said, I'm sure you will have a hilarious time watching this because of how stupid the male lead is. If you get the rage to punch his stupid face off, I understand that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good though, because it sticks to the mech genre. It has a good plot direction, because everyone is fighting with mechs (there are no surprise evil villain characters that can use unknown magic of some sort). Everything is mech related.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the art and the sound, they are top notch IMO.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this highly, but not because of the quality of the harem ecchi scenes.\\n\r\nWatch it and facepalm each time he screws up. At the end of the anime, you will have no forehead.",

Everything seemed alright for the student until he found out that the I.S. academy is an all girl school and he just so happened to be the only guy that could pilot an I.S. at the point in time this show takes place. While at the academy he runs meets female students and his harem of girls slowly builds overtime as the show progresses. I thought this shows story was mediocre, there was nothinggreat about it, it just seemed like your average harem anime story with mechas. The art style wasn't amazing but it was better than your average anime. I really liked the opening for this anime, the music blended in with the animation nicely and the song itself was very catchy and is one of my favorite anime soundtracks. The main character just seems like your average male protagonist with nothing special to really bring to the show, but, the girls in his harem all have something unique about them. It could either be their backstories, looks, and or personalities, my favorite is Charlotte. I enjoyed watching this show very much and if you are new to anime I would strongly suggest watching it. I would give Infinite Stratus an 8/10.",

More then Highschool of the Dead or DxD. \r\nStory: Let's just start by saying, it's a no-brainer. There is no plot-twists, no big good-evil battles, just some good mecha fighting, some boobs, and love for Ichika. Ichika is some kind of special boy, who is able to use the mecha's (IS) that only can be operated by women. No, nothing special behind it. He just can. Thus, he is send to the IS Academy, an all women Academy. Yeah, pretty lovelyharem right? So don't expect anything story-wise. Actually, don't watch it for story, since there is none. Show is awesome, but it's not trying to give us a good story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Wonderful. Top-notch. Class A. Quality. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, pretty good. Voices, ambiant sounds, backgrounds, all lovely. And one of the OSTS, Shiro Kishi, god it's one of the beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. And I'm comparing it to Mushishi soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: We have Ichika, as our main lead. 5 girls, all in-love with him. (in appearance order) A childhood friend, a rich princess, another childhood friend, another girl who was sent to collect Ichika's data and was disguised as a boy (accidently, ichika finds out and after some talk, she ignores her orders and go to school with her normal appearance, don't worry), and a girl from Germany. You'll hate her in the beginning, then love her. Actually, considering the generic harem shows, this is a pretty good set of girls.\\n\\n\r\nSome people hate Ichika's character, because of him being a dense dumb, still I find it quite natural. There has to be some field in Ichika's personality for the girls to make their moves. If Ichika was in-love with of the girls, then the rest wouldn't be able to advance, thus, wouldn't make it a harem show. So for this show, Ichika \"has\" to be dense in order to give girls some room to move. But still, f*ck you Ichika. I'm so jealous of you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: Aside from being a harem show, there are pretty good mecha fights thrown in there. I mean, it's some good fighting. With boobs bouncing. GOD I F*CKING LOVE THIS SHOW. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, watch it if you like harems. It's better then Highschool DxD in my opinion. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Imagine for a minute that you are an average teenage boy, and your life is progressing perfectly normally, when all of a sudden you are the centre of attention from the entire world, and everything that is female desires to couple with you. Well, that's pretty much IS: Infinite Stratos in a nutshell, as one might expect from a harem themed anime. And what better way to emphasise the shounen demographic than by including mechas?\r\nNow, before you begin watching this anime, you must be critically aware that it is, first and foremost, a harem anime. Those expecting the latest Evangelion evolution should probably reboot theirthriller cores, lest they find themselves disappointingly skulking back to their DVD boxsets. The basic premise is of course to replace all available characters with attractive female substitutes, usually within feasible dating age for the clueless main character. That is not to say by any means that the characters in IS are any more shallow, but simply a different spin on what a newcomer might be used to. So, without further ado, let's break into the meat of the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nYou might be shocked that an anime which I rank overall quite positively has such a low story score, but it is very prevalent once you watch the anime that it's riding on the back seat. The anime seems to have settled upon an uncomfortable medium between slice-of-life and action that resembles the often-dreaded \"filler\" episodes from long-running action anime - only this happens for each and every one of the twelve episodes. There is, however, quite clearly a progression of time and events (though it is rarely, if ever, mentioned) which is accompanied by typical intra-episode plots. These are quite often forgotten by the next episode, however, as what seems to be a major element in some overarching plot usually gets resolved in the last two minutes of screen time. The verdict? Enough plot to keep the anime from falling apart, but don't have any expectations of story flowing for more than two or three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nThe animation style is clean, and pretty typical of a well-budgeted modern anime. There's not really a lot to note as it is quite consistently good, however it does shine in a couple of areas. The balance of 3D animation is an often-trodden pitfall of newer anime, as too much 3D can really detract from the cartoon-like worlds we are used to. However, like any art style, when balanced appropriately it can be used to great effect, and this is done just right in IS - something I have only really seen before in Psycho Pass. The variety of female styles is also essential in a harem to differentiate the various archetypal women; a point that IS has clearly taken into account. Whether the suspiciously large breasts are of interest to you or not, the wide variation in character design will allow you to very easily distinguish the characteristics of each female - ensuring your all-important ships will be delightfully unique. The only part that lets the art down would have to be the design of Ichika, the male lead, as he resembles pretty much every generic male lead from harem and slice-of-life alike. Of course, this could be seen as a plus point, as his character should be as average as possible to allow viewers to paste themselves onto him; but the fact that there really is no individual style at all makes him yet another copy-paste shadow of a male. Overall, expect well-rounded production performance that appeals visually, but doesn't win out where originality is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThere isn't really a whole lot to comment on with the sound, because as far as the soundtrack goes it's as generic as the genre would suggest. The voice acting is generally good and the OP and ED songs are comfortable to listen to, but being so averagely good I won't say more as I haven't really got an opinion on them. In general, expect your ears to sit back and relax whilst the anime does it's thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI struggled long and hard with grading this particular point, as the characters are usually the most crucial elements of harem-themed shows. I eventually settled for a mildly-disappointing 7, because whilst every character showed great and true potential, there simply wasn't enough time in 4 hours to build up all 6 main characters plus entertain the notion of a mecha plot (which never happened anyway). As far as the male lead goes, the lacklustre back story  probably makes him the least interesting of the 6, though this would be expected of the harem genre. The other 5 girls that make up his main harem are all given very unique styles - ranging from upper-class and distinguished to militant and innocent. If each character is given roughly one episode of screen time, you would expect quite a significant amount of back-story and depth from each character. Sadly, the mecha action decides to kick in mid-way with most of these episodes, cutting precious time that could be used encouraging us to build our ships. The obligatory beach episode doesn't have a lot to offer either, though what it loses in story and character development it makes up for with copious fanservice. Which reminds me - despite the obvious fanservice that occurs every time a girl does something other than speak, the females rarely appear shallow - so the gratification of seeing your ship become even more realistic is slightly more emotional than if they were just breasts on sticks. As a side note, Ichika's older sister does seem someone focused on the ever-elusive plot and probably ends up getting the most depth despite rarely gaining screen time that isn't her frowning or ridiculing Ichika. Overall, squished between the fanservice/breasts and mecha action, there are some archetypal gems to be had, but they need a bit more polishing in the following series in order to become truly golden.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, this anime offers much in the way of gripping entertainment. I probably spend half of my time laughing out loud, groaning to myself, yelling at the characters on screen or pointing out the blatantly obvious - signs that I was completely engaged regardless of my judgement of the content. There would be at least one time per episode where a certain fanservice scene was just too much that I would declare it overkill, stop the video, and do something else for half an hour; only to come crawling back with my fists clenched, eagerly awaiting the next hilarious outbreak of ridiculousness. Try as I might, I could not run away from the show, and when I did it would be because my sleep schedule was completely messed up and I had to take a nap or real life intervened. It would be no exaggeration to say that I obsessed over this show, so you can be sure I will be watching the next series very promptly. As far as the enjoyable content goes, it really comes down to the almost parody-like switching from serious action to a girl's exposed body parts; or the romantic comedy of the girls fighting over Ichika, but instantly forming their harem bonds to protect him from some greater threat. To conclude, whilst there are flaws that appear on the larger scale, the moment-to-moment entertainment is top notch and keeps you glued to the screen, even when you feel like cringing or groaning.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: original score was 8/10, but upon reflection I believe I was too generous (being hasty to submit my first review)\\n\\n\r\nThe Final Verdict: 7/10\\n\r\nMy reasoning behind the overall score of 7 is based on this anime's potential for more content and the frequent higher quality performance that is seen on a per-episode basis. The biggest suffering that Infinite Stratos faces is the lack of episodes - 12 simply isn't enough when you are attempting to juggle harem and mecha/action at the same time. Given that there will be at least another series, we may see the plot improve in later episodes, however it cannot directly influence the individual score of this series. The imaginative potential, however, is vast for such a small show, as the characters are not simply shells but well-rounded archetypes and the mecha style is unique and promising. My biggest reason for pushing up the overall score comes from the sheer entertainment value that the anime provides - the fascination with the show, the quality of the relationships and hilarious comedy is really the unique selling point of this and indeed any harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo why should you watch this anime, if you haven't already? Because it will give you the constant booster shots of instant gratification, whilst keeping your mind fixated on the relationship potential for each harem girl, to the point where the plot just isn't really important any more. Oh, and there are some giant robot suit things that I didn't even really mention, because they're cool but kinda irrelevant. So even if you are tired of watching endless teenage sexual frustration (and you call yourself an harem fan?!), there's something futuristic and metallic (that shoots lasers) around the corner waiting to be discovered...",

I was excited for an action packed anime with very unique mecha suits and filled with intense battle sequences. However, sadly, overall, this anime was a disappointment to me.\r\nOnce I found out that the male lead was surrounded by all women, I grew more hesitant exactly where this anime was going. Although I will admit, I was able to successfully watch the entire series without stopping midway. However, there were multiple occasions where I grew extremely irritated with the character's dependency off of Ichika, aswell as the harsh change in personality with some of the girls. One minute they utterly despise him, the next they are swooning over him, and that sort of thing annoys me greatly.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I was very disappointed with the lack of action throughout the series. They had a chance to take it one of two ways. A more romantic comedy themed anime, or a more serious, action filled anime. Instead they struggled to find the medium between the two, and to attempt to capture this in 12 episodes is nearly impossible. It lacked character development for some characters that really could have shined, such as Ichika's sister.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the five 'winter' animes I watched (I think they were considered winter animes) this was definitely my least favorite, but, still, nonetheless, it was somewhat decent. I enjoyed some episodes, but I also cringed during others. If you like a fun, light-hearted anime but with some decent action scenes every few episodes, then you will probably enjoy this one.",

Well let's get started with the review of IS Infinite Stratos\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nI dunno if I give it a 7 coz the story is not really good for now coz it's only introducing other characters and after introducing they fight.. So it's not really great for that. It reallyleaves me crave for more coz I heard there's a light novel of it and it is still on-going and the fight is Arena type like most brawling battle...\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10)\\n\r\nWell The art is fantastic and great coz it's well made combination of 2d and 3d so what can you ask for? It can even rival the art of the new releases to date. So I'm really thrilled about it.... Most especially the fight scene  in the end.. well spoiler* where they fight Silveria Gospel the one that is in the start of the anime..\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10)\\n\r\nThe Op theme and Ed theme is great and the BGM matches the scene so it's really great.... \\n\\n\r\n Character(10/10)\\n\r\nWell for the character I thought the characters are for fan-service but I've mistaken(too bad hehehe) but it's really great I'm really obsess with this German Character Laura Bodewig for unknown reasons. Well Laura and Ichika won't get well.. coz it's hinted in the last episode that oops spoiler... well it's great it has a well breed of character for a harem one\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nWell I can't keep the Enjoyment of this anime coz of the fight scene it gives me a good laugh every time there's a funny scene you can't keep it\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nIt's a great anime I can't tell it's a masterpiece coz the story is bad... But I hope there's a season 2 so it can keep up with the flow and become a good anime too... well that's all folks! no haters pls :))",

            "content": "Remember that feeling when you get so excited about something and you end up being disappointed? Well, IS gave me that aura and feeling. \r\nLet's cut to the chase..\r\nGundam Seed is one of the best mecca anime out there and I thought IS was its son; however, it was its close relative on Harem. SO.. what's so good about the story? I can't tell you exactly but it has its uniqueness. Apparantly, it has robots called the Infinite Stratos, which can only be used by women. On the one hand, Ichika came in to the all girls school for IS Training because he is theonly guy who could use it (spoiler alert). So.. the interesting plot ends here. Because in all episodes all I can say is \"Harem... HAREM EVERYWHERE\" which is the part that kind of disappoint me the most. I thought it was an action-packed anime but all the things that came in my way was new girl then fall in love with main guy then all of a sudden every girl want that guy. I hate it. It was like, the whole mecca genre was just a mascot of the series so that people will get interested so that's a perfect example of \"Don't judge the book by its cover\" UGH! If only they made it into a shounen anime with lots of action, comedy and villains. But everything turned out to be a shoujo anime for thirteen year old girls. I believe men would like this show because they can have all the naked women that they can watch. but anyway.. its good but not so much.\\n\\n\r\nArt is vibrant and modern. SO it is very good and splendid.\\n\\n\r\nI was interested by the opening but on the sound effects and the ending was just nothing to me. It didn't stand out so don't want to care about it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were just all the typical shoujo characters mixed up in one anime. They belong to different countries and links to Ichika for some Goddamn reason. And to put the cherry on top, the childhood friend gets closer to the main character at the end. (how pathetic and convincing) I think the characters were poorly executed not to mention Ichika's idiocy about Houki's feelings for him. I was sad because Uchiyama Kouki does not deserve this project (I'm sorry) because he had a lot of magnificent roles; plus, he is my hero and my favorite seiyuu of all time. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the most part. The inside jokes, ridiculous women trying to get closer to the main character. Cliche and repetitive moments. Everything seem so bold and naked.. I just liked the fact that only us (girls) can use robots. If they were real, I can shoot multiple weapons to ex boyfriends and ridiculously stupid enemies. (evil laugh) I just wished more action was inscribed here in this series then the art would have justice :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I place it between Mediocre and Good because of the animation and its minor creativity. If you want an anime which will make you throw tomatoes on your screen then why not? But seriously, this one is sucky so if want to watch this fine have it your way.. NOT. MY. FAULT.",

It main purpose for me is to provide relaxation + laugh. If i want a good story i would lookfor a different genre.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't be fool by those bad reviews, this is a great anime as it provide lots of relaxing time for me, to escape the stressful from study and such. I personally wouldn't watch a anime with good story but give me further headache and cliff hanger. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, watch it if you really into harem comedy and never get tired of it. \\n\r\nIf you don't like it, don't watch it and don't talk shit about it, because we all know harem anime are cliche and they don't have story",

It's known for mainly one reason:\r\nYOU LOVE IT OR YOU CAN'T STAND THE FREAKING HELL OF IT!\r\nTo get this out of the way, I fall in the first category. \r\nThis is the most generic, steriotipical, preditable harem in existance. Seriously, the characters are that over-used. But from my point of view, that's part of the reason why I like it. After just finishing a huge dose of WTF?! a la Panty and Stocking, it was nice to kinda relax and let the weak plot unroll itself. \r\nI do have togive Ichika credit. Although he's as stupid as hell when it comes to realizing a girl (in this case dozens) likes him, he's a bit smarter then most harem protagonists.  \\n\\n\r\nNow for the harem analysis:\\n\r\nHouki- tsundere first girl (not really special, but COME ON! Who doesn't love a tsundere?)\\n\r\nCecilia- annoying\\n\r\nRin- still annoying\\n\r\nChar- I. LOVE. THIS. CHARACTER. SO MUCH MOE!!!!!!\\n\r\nLaura- kuudere, I think...? a really REALLY sudden change in personality, so...\\n\\n\r\nPlot: No. Just, noexistinguntilthelasthreeepisdoes. Yeah. No.\\n\\n\r\nAction: Aw, hell yeah! This had some of the best action I've seen in a while. Really cool mechas with badass designs. I SO want to go to this school!\\n\\n\r\nSo in recap, if you want a generic harem with pretty art, no plot, and badass battles, go ahead! Entertaining in a boring sort of way, if that makes sense (actually it probably doesn't). \\n\\n",

            "content": "There are three types of trash in this world. The type you see everyday in the streets, in the sea and in your front yard. There's the type of trash that exists on the internet. From godawful memes to ultra-fanboyism that makes you want to hurl. Then there's Infinite Stratos. \r\nThe series was adapted from the light novels ( what a surprise ), by Izuru Yumizuru of the same name, into 12 episodes by studio 8bit. I decided to look at some other series they did and sure enough they all looked like the same highschool, ecchi, sci-fi/fantasy shit you've seen pretty much a hundredtimes. But in comparison to other shows IS: Infinite Stratos isn't just boring and generic, it's also incredibly stupid as well as offensive to my intelligence. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters;\\n\r\nThey're awful. Complete and utter awfulness. They're unlikable, incredibly dull and generic and massively idiotic. Particularly the main protagonist Ichika Orimura. Infinite Stratos is of course a show that thrives off of wish-fullfillment and therefore it could be understandable that the protagonist is somewhat dense when it comes to romance. But Ichika is so insanely stupid that it becomes infuriating. This is somehwat of a spoiler, but in one episode one of the girls asks him on a date and he thinks it means she wants him to help her shop as a freind. How is this guy popular with the ladies? He's so oblivious to the feelings of the girls it actively drives me insane. He also is of course \"special\" in some way. Obviously this means stupid power-ups and asspulls as well as being a natural at piloting the Infinite Stratos ( the mech-suit the characters use to duel ) as well as being the only male to pilot it. This is never explained and I don't think the light novel has gotten to it either. It's probably idiotic anyways. In order to keep this short I'll simply describe the other characters in one sentence for you ( it's not that hard ).\\n\r\nHouki Shinonono - The main tsundere love interest.\\n\r\nCharlotte Dunois - The nice girl.\\n\r\nCecilia Alcott - The blonde \"ara ara\" girl.\\n\r\nLaura Bodewig - The strong deadpan loli.\\n\r\nLingyin Huang - The more fiery ( and bland ) tsundere.\\n\r\nMaya Yamada - The big boob teacher with glasses.\\n\r\nChifuyu Orimura - The no-nonsense big sister.\\n\r\nThere are more but they basically have nothing to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nStory;\\n\r\nSo Ichika is the only male to pilot Infinite Stratos in a soceity now dominated by women. He must enroll in the IS academy and of course it's filled with girls. And all of them want to fuck him. I'm not even exaggerating. Now, you'd think the show would perhaps explore the idea of a soceity led by women and how Ichika has changed something. Maybe a political party led by men are trying to revolt against them now that a male is in fact capable of piloting these mechs. But nope. The show focuses purely on Ichika and his harem doing different shit instead of actually creating an interesting story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound can be described thusly;\\n\r\nVery dull but overall not complete garbage. It's perhaps passable even if some of the CG began to make my eyes twitch in irritation and the samey music being played all the time start to hurt my ears.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion;\\n\r\nHow bad is IS: Infinite Startos? However bad you're thinking it might be, it's probably worse. It's hard for me to tell you how bad it really is other than to tell you to watch it for yourself. It might seem like \"just bad\" but trust me, it's far worse than that. \\n",

I have watched up still season 2 ep 5 and I just couldn't take it anymore...\r\nStory 7/10: To start off, I thought the story was not actually that bad, It started off strong and really brought me into it.Seeing the male character get slapped around by a bunch of girls and constantly getting beat on turned me right away from it. The story and the backstory to the character made me want to watch it more, each character had a good backstory and it looked promising.. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I'm not that big into the art of anime and only have one specific type of style for anime and this is kind of what I saw and so it attracted me towards it. The fight scenes wasn't all to bad and it had some good looking effects as it went along.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Not that big into sound but I enjoyed it from what I can see.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10: This is mainly for the main character as I completely despise it and it has stopped me from watching it all together. The character is a complete idiot with the lack of common sense for anything that goes on. He charges into battle blindly for no reason, attacking alone and stupidly... There are some times I'll give it to him where he saves someone and I'm like \"Oh that was cool I guess\" but almost ALL the time he's completely blind to the surroundings he's in. His lack of sense for the females as he goes as well is like looking at a 10 year trying to get his first kiss on the playground surrounded by a group of people egging him on. It's honestly embarrassing to watch. I don't know if the manga is just as bad but it honestly threw me right off. He's a asexual guy who is blind to anyone around him and it just infuriates me to the highest degree.\\n\r\nThe other characters I have no problem with as they have not shown any stupidly for me to hate them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: I enjoyed the story and some of the other characters, the art was good and the sounds seem decent. I would not recommend this to anyone if you're looking for a strong male lead who has a sense of direction in life and is not a kid most the time.. \\n\\n",

            "content": "It's one of \"those\" animes and should be viewed as such. What does it mean? Simple - think of the most stereotypical stereotype of harem anime and this is it. Single male protagonist surrounded by nothing but cute girls, a dumb protagonist (and not just oblivious, I mean literally dumb), childhood friends, it's all here. Though at the same time the show is actually quite pleasant, if forgettable.\r\nThe protagonist, Ichika, is the sole male in an all female environment and, obviously, all the girls (I mean 100% of them) have the hots for him. Obviously, he's utterly and completely oblivious to this. He's also adumbass and not really that OP in the end. So your best bet is to block him out and focus on the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is a quite nice and likeable cast, albeit typical. You got one bushi tsun childhood friend, you got an oujousama (with an oddly high pitched voice for this type of character - actually a good choice for some reason), you got another childhood friend with a Chinese restaurant (because that's all the Chinese ever do, obviously), an uptight German (one that they couldn't decide if they were making a loli or not at that), and so on. There's also a bunch of support characters (the ditzy busty teacher, the strict Ichika's older sister, Rin's sister etc) but the main focus is on the leading 5 girls (yes, 5, I omitted one to avoid spoilers for thr sake of avoiding spoilers because you see that one a mile away). Obviously they are bickering and trying to get in Ichika's pants for reasons I can't comprehend (did I mention he's a dumbass?) but at least they are good on the eyes and stuff. Especially in the obligatory swimsuits, hyeh hyeh.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mecha anime there is some combat but not a lot and not particularly impressive. To be honest, the opening battle (which is a spoiler btw and is expanded upon later in the show) is the most exciting of all. They're fine, but you won't be biting your nails in excitement. There isn't really all that much fighting as the series focuses more on characters and interactions rather than mechas and combat. Good news is there isn't all that much fanservice either. Of course there're some bath or beach scenes but nowhere near the obnoxious T&A shots of other shows, which is actually a nice change.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals-wise the anime is okay. I liked the art style and character designs so I enjoyed looking at it as well as watching. A pinch of your typical \"meh\" CGI here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is fine but unimpressive. The ending theme is quite catchy and I liked the credits animation with Ichika & Co just running. At least until the addition of Laura in her Wehrmacht pants. The rest of the sound track is \"there\" and I recall none of it despite having watched the series just recently, which means it's unmemorable. Voice acting is fine as well, nothing extraordinary in either positive or negative.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's pretty clear by now, considering the abundance of \"okay\" and \"fine\", that this is a pretty mediocre anime. Nothing that will knock your socks off. But when you see it for what it is, a typical harem anime with some mechas, you just might enjoy it. I know I did, thus I will give it a 7/10, which might be a bit generous but I don't consider my time spent with it totally wasted.",

Let's see the plot is inventive on how it combines mechas with the isolated guy in a girl mob situation, yet it also spends time on each and every one of the main characters respectively, some of which are rather overused in my opinion.\r\nAnyway, even if you hate the ideaof a massive school with only one guy in it idea, they really don't waste time on that detail except for comedy. Mainly it is a combat anime with really cool fighting effects, there are cool mecha abilities, some of which seemed ripped off of other animes yet I'm not gonna comment.\\n\\n\r\nIn its own right it does a good job of telling the story even if it seems rushed, if you have time pick it up it is worth it if you're looking for a decent anime.",

But im the type of guy who likes this stuff but overdoing and implying it into a mecha driven storyline = you have one big mess. Thats what Infinite Statos was trying to achieve by giving the viewers fan service while keeping the mecha IS system, but failed ultimately in the end.\r\nIf the author came at it with only mecha and a light heart fan service then I think this anime would have gonefar. But in reality they threw too much and the mecha mechanics went down the drain. Don't get me wrong, the mecha fights are still enjoyable but I found it lacking as the story progress and the story switches to which girl the guy chooses. Ultimately that is what killed Infinite Stratos from being the great anime it could of have been.  \\n\\n\r\nRecommended for: Ecchi, Harem, fan service, and a touch of mecha lovers\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: Did I mention this anime also has reverse trap =3\\n",

I thought it got boring at sometimes but then would usually recapture my attention with cheesy or decent action scenes. Felt like the series was kinda compacted and squished to fit the entire series within 12 episodes.\r\nPros: Definity a good \"idea/concept\" for the story, very interesting topic i thought. Mild fan service and decent if not a little above par action/fighting scenes. A lot of characters that are likable and enjoyable.\r\nCons: Felt like its all compact, would be better if they put more development in certain areas. good story \"idea\"with his situation just felt like it could have been developed or refined a little better to make this anime great instead of just good. In the area of romance in this anime i thought i was very confusing and rushed: it's like invisible then boom. (best way i can describe it)\\n\\n\r\nOther: I really like the main character, those types of main character are my favorite: Brave, Strong, Determined, But thick-skulled and clueless.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend;Might point you in other directions but if you like Mecca, harem, action, romance, kinda comedy then this might be a good choice for you.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos is probably my favourite anime of all time. Now, its certainly not the best one I have watched, but the amount of enjoyment I got out of it was unbelievable despite that. The whole series generally has a happy, jokey kinda mood, and all the characters are great, if not all that believable.\r\nWarning: Some spoilers may be contained below\r\nStory:7\r\nThe one thing IS was truly lacking in was a good story plot. While most animes spends maybe 7 or 8 eight episodes before letting you know who the series enemy was, IS didn't show the actual villains of the series until the second season.They also used rather predictable methods to add in new characters to the plot, and 1 or 2 predictable mini plot lines. However, at the same time, you didn't see some of the things coming too you, and the story generally made you laugh due to its craziness and predictableness, making up for its short comings. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nIf there was one thing IS excelled in, it was their art. Everything in the show looked amazing, from the mechs to the school, to the nature itself. Everything had time and effort put into it, and looked great because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nIS had a great sound track, simply put. The music matched the show wonderfully for all scenes. The only problem was, I fell there was almost too much of it. But because it was very good choices for each scene, it was not too much of an issue. Also, the opening theme song of IS is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nNow, I did character as an 8 for 1 purpose: Itcha, the main protagonist. The reason? He may just be mentally retarded. While I loved every other character in the story thoroughly, Itcha drove me mad on several occasions due tot the fact that he doesn't notice ANYTHING. literally. There is at least one instance an episode where he misses something huge, and its generally involving one of the girls being in love with him. Also, another small problem the plot had was 2 of the characters didn't actually have a backstory too them. While they did most of the characters rather well, they just happened to ignore 2 of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite all IS's short comings, I loved this show religiously. I loved all the humor, I loved how it looked, I loved all the quirky characters, I loved how it sounded, and I loved how it played out. And the mechs just made it all better. It was one of my all time favourite watches.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, Is was a very good anime to me. It had a rather nice plot, but didn't develop massively until season 2. It looked and sounded great. It had a large inventory of lovable characters, if some annoying at times. And finally, it was enjoyable. Massively. All in all, I recommend this anime to ANY harem or mecha fan. And if you love both, perfect!",

            "content": "Just finished watching this anime for the 3rd time so I figured it is time for a review. \r\nStory 5\r\n The story revolves around a mechanical suit called a IS that is so advance it makes all other weapons out dated and here is the kicker this suit can only be piloted by women, with the expectation of Ichika Orimura. I gave the story a 5 cause their really is no main plot and so many questions go unanswered, why can the IS only be piloted by women, also it was said to IS was made to be used in space, but apparently that wasscraped and it is now used for sporting events. As stated before the story has no main plot in episode 4 a unmanned IS appeasers and goes wild and it seems like this is going to lead somewhere, but after a couple episodes this plot disappears. Other than lack of a story line I found IS to be quite funny in entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nThe Animation was very well done, especially the CGI for the IS also the characters where well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nThe sound effects for the IS and the fight scene where pretty good, This was one anime where I really like the English dub over the subbed version. In the subbed version even though most of the main characters are from different countries they all sound Japanese, where as in the Dubbed version you can tell what country the character is from by the way they talk. Also has on of the catchiest opening song I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6 \\n\r\nI didn't find the charters very creative the seem like the typical characters you find in a harem anime. First you have are male protagonist Ichika who is so dense it is pathetic, of course if he wasn't so dense he would probly get in to trouble more than he already does. Then you have your typical  female characters, like the childhood friend and such. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\r\nI gave a 9 for enjoyment cause I found even with all the major flaws this series was pretty funny. I found myself laughing a lot most at how dense are male protagonist is and the situations that happen because he is so clueless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a  anime with a good plot turn around, if you are looking for a anime series that is funny and has a good light mood  and you don't mind fan serves, then why not give IS a try.",

Plus, girl cadet as the fighting machine isn't that terrible at all, just the single guy in the all girl school doesn't seem normal to make the balance of the characters.\r\nNevertheless, I have to give the high credit of 6/8 for the artwork, butthe plot itself might got a little messy as the real challenge is just begin by the climax of the characters against the final evil guy. The plot could be interesting maybe if add up some few episodes or more to find out more about the questions. Might expecting the 2nd season to understand the story more.",

Youknow where this is going.\\n\\n\r\nIf you come to watch this in hope for some kind of Action-packed Mecha story with School Life thrown in the middle, thus creating a balanced story,... you're wrong. Dead wrong.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the things that happens onscreen are pure Harem material. Bad Harem materials too, at that. When there is some Mecha action, it's usually just a student tournament or some unexplained anonymous hostile robot that went haywire.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the fanservice. It's so much, it annoys me.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and they also tried their hands on the comedy aspect. It didn't go well\\n\\n\r\nAnd the Finale still have some unanswered questions. Which I'm not gonna list because it'll be a bit spoiler-y\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it could have been better\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to comment on the art style. Not too shabby, but not too fancy too.\\n\\n\r\nBut what catches the eyes most are the ISes' 3D models, which are well done. They fit into the background without looking out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes a quite good too. There are a few recycled scenes, but they never really bugged me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is on the average side. Nothing much to note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the flaws of this series. THEM CHARACTERS!!\\n\\n\r\nIchika is your official, by the book, clueless nice Harem protagonist. What's out of the book about him, is his level of by-the-book-ness. \\n\r\nSeriously, this guy is so bland and clueless, it almost hurts. He somehow doesn't notice that the girls like him.\\n\\n\r\n Even though one of them kissed him the other day and was on bed with him, (nothing R-rated though) he was still acting without any kind of self-awareness, to the point where i was like \"is he gay or something?\"\\n\\n\r\nBut really, if he was gay, they might as well as change the whole cast into guys and it would make much more watchable series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the girls...\\n\\n\r\nHouki is the childhood friend. And a typical Tsundere. Nothing much to say about her.\\n\r\nCecilia is the Princess-type. She's initially annoyed by Ichika, but grew to like him quickly. Nothing much too.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh you know what's better than a childhood friend?! TWO childhood friends!\" That's probably what the author was thinking\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Ling or Rin, i don't know, the sub differs form episode to another. She's this second childhood friend, also a bit Tsundere. But she is mostly overshadowed by Houki, because she appeared first.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Charlotte. She attended the Academy as a guy. Which was of course, found out immediately by Ichika. So she's the Reverse-Trap\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Laura. She's actually interesting. But as time goes, she turned into a bland character.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting characters are really forgettable. Like the glasses teacher with big boobs, i forgot her name. And Chifuyu, Ichika's older sister. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos is a generic School Life Harem story masked with the face of Action premise. Whether you love or hate this, depends on your initial hope when you started watching\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't expect much, you'll probably be satisfied\\n\\n\r\nBut if you're one of those poor souls, like me, who expects many action, you'll be thoroughly dissapointed",

            "content": "I have to say, when I heard about Infinite Stratos, I was intrigued. A not-too-distant future with mecha that can (mostly) only be piloted by women? The male protagonist has to face the difficulties that being the first male pilot thereof bring, while surrounded by attractive women? Sign me up, man. Unfortunately, Infinite Stratos is, in application, less concerned with the initial premise, and more concerned with crafting various scenarios that allow the \"harem\" aspect to really be shown. This is not necessarily damning in and of itself, but a few other problems prevent IS from being the series I think it had the potentialto be.\\n\\n\r\nThe first fact is something that most viewers will find hard to deny: with a few notable exceptions, the vast majority of IS is fairly generic. Most of the girls who keep appearing to follow Ichika around fall into this category as well, having little characterization and undergoing strange personality shifts from their initial appearance. Some are hit by this harder than others, and one is actually fairly interesting and innovative (I thought her few episodes were probably the highlight of the show), but overall the setup is rather clich\u00e9d. Not bad, in and of itself, but definitely not new or developed to its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I thought this series had was the (in my opinion) strange shift in tone that happened towards the end of the show. The ending, in my opinion, didn't really \"jive\" with the rest of the series and kind of sticks out as...not quite the same as the rest. It kind of seemed like the writers were trying to create a \"big finish\" for the season and the characters, but honestly I think something with less grandeur would have been okay if it pieced together better with the other 10 or so episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSo, ordinarily I'd give a show like Infinite Stratos something like a 6, for an overused scenario and (IMO) strange ending. However, the series was helped by many of its base aspects (nice art, great sound, a couple of interesting characters amid the mostly flat ones), and given that there were a couple of episode I really did enjoy, my final verdict is a 7, for \"incomplete overall, but with some attractive aspects\". If you're looking for a series that is going to draw you in with its complex plots and deep characters, Infinite Stratos isn't really going to suit you. But if you want something that's both fairly easy to follow and has some spots of quality amid the overall rough surface, you might want to give it a try.",

The protagonist will be surrounded by four beautiful girls as they try to make him fall in love with them.\r\nThe anime aired from January up to March of 2011 and finished with 12 episodes plus one OVA.\r\nSet in the future, war between men and women wouldn't last more than three days. Women had been superior to the men, as they are able to pilot the powered exoskeleton called IS or Infinite Stratos, made by Dr. Tabane Shinonono.\r\nThen, military offices werehacked and missiles launched as soon as Dr. Tabane showed the entire world her life-changing invention. Unexpectedly, an IS appears, piloted by an unknown woman who had stopped all the missiles and disappeared like it never happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts ten years later, as one guy, named Ichika Orimura, during an entrance exam, accidentally moves an IS and becomes the world's first male ever to move an IS. Media came in and everything else. Then, he was transferred to the IS school, the world's first and only IS school. Unsurprisingly, it's full of girls. Not one guy can be seen but Ichika.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses like it's light novel counterpart. He engages in battles concerning rivalry and to unravel the secrets of the powered exoskeleton. To add more, the girls he becomes friends with develop actual feelings for in and they always try to get his attention. \\n\\n\r\nYup, all of that and it's still a harem. Yes, it has a plot, but I didn't feel it. just School life Harem with the mecha twist. It seriously needs another, more serious season. I really felt bad that the mecha genre wasn't taken seriously. It can be longer and more serious. If the anime was longer, characters can be developed more and won't be discarded quickly like in the show.",

            "content": "I have written reviews for both extremely good anime or extremely important anime, but I felt I lacked the one thing ever reviewer needs, a review of something really bad. Enter IS: Infinite Stratos, when I think \"I need to review something bad that I've watched through completely and this was the first thing to spring to mind, sit back and hold on to your nipple hair folks, I'm about to rip this anime a new asshole!\r\nStory -10/10: ...Wait, what do you mean I can't give it a negative score? You mean the lowest I can go is 1? God dammit.\r\nStory 1/10: The story ofIS is, like almost every other harem, a poorly thought-out excuse to have the main character surrounded by females. So basically here's how it is, it's the future (apparently) and we now have crazy exoskeleton mechs that can be magically summoned from watches or earrings (hell you could probably spawn one of these things from a tampon that's been rotting for ten years), and these mechs are so powerful the military said \"these things are to dangerous for combat, lets give them to students as a sports item!\" Now the thing is only females can use the IS mechs. Enter generic oblivious harem male lead #1364, hell this dude is so generic and lacking character dept he might as well be a lego brick (more on that later!) who is discovered to be the only male who can use the Infinite Gundam suits. What you're left with is 5% mech action and 95% lego brick being so stupid he can't figure out all the women around him are fighting over his cock. Like I said, this plot is nothing but a pitiful excuse to have a guy surrounded by chicks, and don't even get me started on the plot holes! For example, if the future is so advanced we have magical power armor bikini's we can summon out our assholes at any given time why does everything look the same, seriously, there isn't even so much as a flying car. And how in the hell does Charles *spoiler alert, although it's a spoiler you'll figure out within about 20 seconds of first seeing the character* manage to hide her breasts in a skin tight male version of a two piece when her breasts are that goddamn big, bandages only go so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: Something IS doesn't completely fail at? Blasphemy! IS uses your generic character templates for all the characters, I don't know who start these templates but people really should learn to make unique looking characters. And when the characters aren't duking it out they move so little they look like cardboard cutouts with moving lips. The mech fight however are kinda well done (as little as they are) and so it gets a better score in this category then it would normally deserve. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10: The music in IS is... Wait... I'm trying to remember a few songs from this show... I can't seem to remember any, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MEMORABLE ONES!!! The music in IS is incredibly generic, and yes I know I've been using that world a lot, but that's because this entire anime is in every sense of the word generic. As for the voice acting, want accents so fake they'll make you want to punch yourself in the nuts? Watch the dub. Want something where the acting might be bad but at least you won't be able to tell because you'll be too busy reading the subtitles to pay attention to the sound? Watch the sub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10: I have made it no secret that I feel nothing but pure homicidal rage towards almost all harem male leads. The reason for this is because they're all the same in terms of stupidity! But our Lego brick here, he's something special, he somehow manages to be even stupider and more oblivious then almost every other one. We're talking about the kind of guy where a chick could strip down completely naked, crawl into his bed, and say \"I want you to have sex with me\" and he still wouldn't realize she wants his cock (this isn't an exaggeration, this exact scenario actually happens in the show). Oh and apparently he has incest-y feelings towards his sister when he sees her in a bikini but has absolutely no impure thoughts while he's giving her a full body massage, fuck logic, fuck it in the ass until it bleeds! As for the other characters, it seems the show has decide that rather then making all the characters your stereotypical harem female arch-type characters (the childhood friend, the big sister, the tsundere, ext...) it would just make a bunch of characters, and give basically everyone of them all these traits, cut out the middle man, have several characters with different personalities is so yesterday, time to make all our characters as Lego brick-ish as the main lead! (would someone please come to my house and stab me in the throat?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: What enjoyment? I would have had a better time scraping my head against a concrete wall for two hours then watch this crap. Okay fine, some of the mech fights were okay but that's about it! \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10: Do not watch this shit, honestly, this show will kill your brain cells the same way staring at the sun will kill your eyes, but at least the feeling of going blind while your eyes slowly boil in your eye sockets is far more pleasant then watching this. You do not need to see it and you do not want to see it, avoid this thing like it's a rat carrying the bubonic plague.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nInfinite Stratos is that harem that is kinda in the middle for me mainly because there are about the same amount things I like and don't like about it, at least for a Mecha it was alright.\r\nThe story begins with Ichika Orimura who has been discovered as the only male to pilot an IS so he goes to the Infinite Stratos Academy to learn how to use one and while he's there he meets all kinds of interesting female IS pilots.\r\nNow for the first series there isn't really much of a story other than Ichika learning about the IS and introducing the mainfemale characters so that the harem can be created, but what was interesting with the characters in this show is that they actually included different countries like Britain, Germany, France and China alongside Japan and I have to give a bit of credit for the dub actors trying to personalise these accents even though it can be a bit cringy, but it was a good effort nonetheless.\\n\r\nIt was pretty interesting how the IS units worked and that they can be only used in combat until the shields run out along with the different variety of IS units that other countries have been making so they can out compete each other and along with Ichika and the others training with the IS units too which were always mixed results of either failure or improvement.\\n\r\nConsidering this is a Harem too the female characters always argue with each other, but it they do start to become more friendly rivals rather than trying to kill each other over the course of the series and some of their moments trying to out do each other were pretty funny sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is a large selection of characters, but the characters in this show were really mixed for me since there were some I liked and some I disliked.\\n\r\nIchika is definitely the most dense Harem Protagonist I've seen because even though he tries his absolute best to protect the girls whenever they try to make a move on him or flirt with he just doesn't get the picture and it always annoyed the hell out of me, surprisingly though he isn't the worst harem protagonist I've seen.\\n\r\nHouki Shinonono is the first female MC and out of all the girls in this show she is the worst, now usually I can tolerate Tsunderes, but Houki was pretty much whining most of the time and seemed like she was always in a bad mood unless she was alone with Ichika and even then she was still pretty annoying.\\n\r\nCecillia Alcott is the second female MC and she is the Brit of the group and despite being a rich girl who thinks she's superior to the others she can have a sweet side making her slightly more likeable than Houki at least, however she is a bad cook and even if you try her sandwiches you'll somehow die.\\n\r\nLingyin Huang or Lin for short is the third female MC and she is the Chinese representative of the group, she is a more hyper Tsundere and can be almost as annoying as Houki sometimes, but thanks to her hyper nature she isn't and settles for second worst, she like Houki is one of Ichika's childhood friends.\\n\r\nCharlotte Dunois is the fourth main female MC and the French representative of the group, she is actually more sweeter and kinder compared to the other girls making her very likeable, but when she was introduced she had to pretend to be a boy because of family issues until Ichika discovered her secret.\\n\r\nLaura Bodewig the fifth and final member of the harem is the German representative of the group, Laura was friggin awesome despite starting out hating Ichika because his sister Chifuyu trained her a couple of years ago she wanted to beat him to impress Chifuyu until her IS malfunctioned and Ichika had to save her, after that she became a more friendly person to the other girls, but because she was a military girl she didn't really understand a lot of the things in Japan and whenever she tried to get closer with Ichika she mainly blushed making her an adorable badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was ok I liked the design of the IS units and how each was different for the female characters as they varied in size, armaments and even colour, the IS academy looked pretty cool definitely a place I would like to go to so I can train in a Mecha suit and the uniforms aren't too bad either as they can also be different depending on the persons style.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the action was alright not amazing, but it got the job done even though most of the time it's the girls and Ichika fighting each other along with a few robot IS suits attacking them, it was interesting seeing the girls and Ichika using their IS unit's weapons and abilities to outsmart their opponent.\\n\r\nThe comedy was actually funny sometimes, although whenever the girls fought each other over Ichika is was always mixed because sometimes it felt annoying whereas other times it was actually funny.\\n\r\nThere is bit's and pieces of fanservice too even though there isn't an Ecchi tag there definitely should be especially if you're going to show your female characters in the shower or showing off their swim suits at the beach which definitely requires the use of an Ecchi tag.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this wasn't a pretty ok Mecha/Harem anime and compared to other Harems I've seen it's definitely one of the more likeable ones so if you're interested in seeing girls from different countries fighting over a dense protagonist in mecha suits then you might enjoy this.",

The main picture is misleading, so  is the synopsis. When you see the pic and the synopsis you think this will be some kind of beasty arse Action/Mecha anime.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story deserves a 2 because it barely even makes any sense. They HAD to make the MC a dumb idiot just for us to even know whats happening. All of the girls fall love for the MC for no actual reason.  There's not reallyany point of mentioning the IS except to make the MC in a harem and make girls fall in love with him. The main plot is basically fanservice galore. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nIt was pretty good. Though I think some of the outfits (IS) are weird though. The rest was cool but I just really like the style as much I guess?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the OPs and EDs but I don't even remember the soundtrack. -3-\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nOh gawd can this get any worst? They are so cliched and unoriginal that it makes my eyes burn! The MC was just a dense idiot. They have pretty much every type of girl that any Harem has ever had! Laura was probably the only one I liked then BAM! She became Ichika's dog. Lost all respect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nWat. Some parts were funny/ok.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 \\n\r\nNo just no. The plot only ever came at the very end. I would recommend  just watching ep. 1,11, and 12.",

There are just certain things about it that I didn't like. The main character, Ichika, is the first male pilot of an IS and is then given his own personal IS upon arriving at this new private school for IS pilots. He is the standard oblivious male that doesn't understand he has about 4 girls attempting to be with him: two childhood friends, two former adversaries, and one very nice transfer student. This is one thingthat is frustrating when I know it shouldn't be, because it is just a show, and it is written as such that he is to be oblivious, but come on. How far do these girls need to go for them to notice them? \\n\\n\r\nStill the action of the show isn't half bad, along with the development between the characters, and the use of the word buttocks (which I found hilarious). The different IS that come from each country show how each are rivaled for power, and they throw in an all inclusive America made IS that just causes all the problems in the last few episodes, which shows some of the view towards the U.S., but if you are just looking for something to fill the time, or you enjoy a good laugh then go for it.",

            "content": "This anime was quite the accidental find. I stumbled upon it after googling Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, a manga which I find intriguing, fan fiction. I found the only entry was Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei: Infinite Stratos style. Now being the curious soul that I am, I typed it in to the search bar and clicked on the manga. After that I immediately watched the anime, which is in my opinion, a lot more clear and enjoyable than the manga. But now to the point, the review.\r\nStory-6\r\nThe basis of the story is this: IS stands for Infinite Stratos and is a mecha like suit thatis employed for battle, and only women can operate it, except for Ichika Orimura. Now while this concept interested me, I quickly found out it was a harem manga, therefore eliminating most of my interest, as I have read and watched too many to be still entertained. The story is typical, it drags its feet at times but the battle scenes and small dilemmas kept me reading.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound-8\\n\r\nNow I'm coming out with this right now, I am no expert when it comes to art design or sound quality. The art, I think, is quite beautiful, nothing completely amazing, but better than most. The sound also, particularly the voice acting, is great. Except if I had to take a shot for every time Cecilia and Charles broke accent, I wouldn't last 5 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nIchika is a likable enough main character, he's straight forward, kind, and oblivious to the point of retardation (necessary for harem). Not really much else to say here other than a weird tendency to get misunderstood for liking his sister. The other characters are lackluster and quite typical: tsundere childhood friend, arrogant English woman, another tsundere childhood friend, and an awkward German lacking social skills. Now the only reason this did not plunge to a 2 is for one very cute French girl: Charlotte. She might as well have cut out my heart and ran away with it. I have never, ever, been so captivated with a character in all the manga and anime I have ever watched/read. I won't spoil anything, but some moments she and Ichika share are just too cute.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nI don't know why, (or maybe I do) but I have been engrossed with this anime. Sure the story and characters could use some work, but just some of the moments in the anime make it quite enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nMediocre story and characters (except for one), great art and sound, and overall quite enjoyable, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just enjoy anime and this short series.",

A whole new world of shounen anime has opened up before me. Everything was good. The character, the plot, the overall art is just outstanding. Everything is all in place, and the girls' appearances are just enough to make Houki envious of them. This is one of my most favorite animes. But then, even a very good masterpiece also has major flaws, that I wish, would be included in season 2. Like, whenRin and Ichika were being attacked by an unmanned IS. Who have sent that? I wish some people would have known, but then, there are some things that are meant to be a secret and then be revealed later in season 2. But then again, this show is just so good. Oh, and I wonder why didn;t Laura win? Also, this is one of the animes that had the unnoticed girl win, and not the best girl. (Too bad for me,though)",

IN THE WORLD! So being the only man who can pilot these he is given a personal IS that collects information. The female leads also own an Personal IS and they are:  Houki Shinonono, Lin Yin Fang, Charlotte Dunois, Cecilia Alcottand Laura Bodewig.(They are not all introduced at the same time) .So the typical harem elements start too kick in all the girls are in utter amazment and want to date him and so the harem begins. \\n\\n\r\nArt - It reminds me alot of to aru majustu no index the main character also looks alot like Ichika. the art is constant abnd well detailed the IS themselves are well detailed. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound used does fit the situationand makes the anime more enjoyable. Alot of effort went into soundtrack (imo). The intro and outro suit the anime well as the music give the scene more atmoshere and more enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCharcters - Follows the general harem character Male is clueless that the girls who he spends with have feelings for him. Doesn't want to show she like Male (Houki). Stuck up girl (Cecilia). The tsundere (Lin). The girl who gives advice and  sometimes unintentionally shows/uses breats on Male and doesn't know how to show affections (Charlotte). The girl who forces Male into being life partner (Laura)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - funny and action packed some  fan service(nothing extreme) \\n\\n\r\nOverall i give it a 7\\n",

The very thing that makes this series weak, is also what makes it so entirely pleasant to watch. All it is is one big cliche piled on top of another, not to mention the stereotypes, while this really leaves no room for deep character development beyond your traditional harem blah blah blah it is FUNNY. I kid you not i laughed through nearly every episode, it  wasn't because it was necessarily smart humor or intellectual well thought out jokes, its becausethis entire series is one big joke. To take it as anything but a joke will lead you to hating it. So if you just want something funny and quick, go ahead and watch it!",

            "content": "I hate how dense the main character was and I hate Houki, Cecilia and Rin. The main character is a good example of a cliche male anime character who is so dumb to even notice or read someone when it comes to feeling. What makes it even worst is that his reaction is like a kindergartener who totally has no idea of a male and female relationship. Even Dunois had pointed out that she is wondering if he did it by purpose as he is so unrealistically dense when reacting to someone who clearly gave a clear sign of indirect love confession. And Houki, Ceciliaand Rin are one of the example cliche female anime characters who abused the main characters mostly for no good reason other than being selfish... The story could have gone better is the romance part is omitted as it is poorly executed. Somehow I like Dunois the most. She is the most proper decent girl in this series so far. And the German girl is weird but somehow funny. She reminded me of Trinity Seven. I don't mind Trinity Seven style's harem as it is unique and unorthodox.",

The sci-fi elements are great, the mecha battles are animated so well, they look just incredible and are also genuinely exciting! The whole future world is great, not to in your face, but you can tell its the future, it all looks incredible to say the least. We have a cast of surpassingly multi-layered characters considering from the outside this show looks like Evangelion + 5 women swooning, its not, its far better than that. The storyof the first season is broken up into several nice well rounded arcs, each consisting of a light novel each, yet it flows nicely across the whole season to. This show is funny, its cute, its at times very boyish, at times very girlish, and it has less fan services aimed at 15 year old virgins than i expected, which is great and kind of nice to be honest. I loved this show, i like all the main cast, i love the art, the sound, the story, everything. It far supased my expectations. I can't wait for the second season!",
