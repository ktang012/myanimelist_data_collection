            "content": "\u201cAre human beings truly equal?\u201d\r\nUsing a pretentious question as an opener is common in Light Novel adaptations. It's a fast way to both grab the attention of the inexperienced viewer and to introduce the general intentions of the show. However, questioning the equality of the entire human race is a comical idea. The question itself only functions as a rhetorical question and even then, you gain nothing from the inevitable \u201cno\u201d as an answer. It is a question that serves no purpose, a problem that is reflected throughout the show\u2019s entire runtime. Unfortunately, the problems don\u2019t end there. Welcome to the Classroom of the Eliteis not just a show that suffers from purposelessness but also from a poorly constructed setting and plot, a less than stellar presentation and from being bound to generic LN formulas.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nWhile I might already have voiced my opinion on the initial quote, I have to give credit where it\u2019s due. Unlike many other LN adaptations that also start off with some vapid quote, Elite Classroom chose one that actively represents one of the key parts of its own setting: Assigning students monetary worth through points based on merit, and dividing the classes by said merit. This is where the first glaring issues pop up. Now, leaving the whole classes can only advance as a unit thing (which is stupid) aside, the point system is inherently flawed. Reason for that is the sheer universal usage of said points, they can basically be used to buy anything you need: Games, gold teeth, a deluxe meal, you name it. There are close to no boundaries, it goes as far as being able to not only buy old tests from upperclassmen (which are exactly the same as the ones you\u2019ll have), but even test score points. This creates several problems: tests you can buy from upperclassmen have several times the worth of the price, as they guarantee a significant growth in your own monthly points which paired with buying test points makes it impossible to drop out of school because of said test scores - a threat that just in the beginning was announced with much fanfare. Apart from promoting to a higher class, the points seem like they barely matter. Premium meals may cost more and you won\u2019t be able to live a king\u2019s life, sure, but it seems like whether or not you have many points doesn\u2019t make much of a difference. You can still visit the school leisure pool, and I\u2019m sure there are other free activities on campus, too. The sheer absence of tutoring upperclassmen, people selling used products on student markets or similar events and the like make it feel as if the setting and its rules weren\u2019t thought through and make the whole school seem lifeless. There are also some rules which seem to have been added in hindsight because the plot demands it. If you have someone\u2019s device number (Phone number? Seemed like it was some kind of machine all students get?), you can search their location via GPS. Because nobody could possibly have a problem with not just the school but every student that knows your whateveritis number being able to learn of your whereabouts whenever they feel like it. Also there are security cameras. But some buildings have none. Because plot reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe school itself is also poorly realized. It is funded by the Japanese government in order to nurture the future elites of the nation. Scratch that, they aren\u2019t just funding the school, they are blowing about half of their nation\u2019s wealth at the school: A gigantic mall plus employees, a luxus ship cruise, a fucking island. They somehow have the money for all of that (and more) and still make positive returns, which seems nigh impossible considering who these supposed \u201celite students\u201d are. If you forgot that the school in this show is supposedly the top school in all of Japan, I don\u2019t blame you. It mostly feels like just an average school academically apart from the utter morons that are Class D. Now, I get that they are supposed to be the lowest class, but please. This is the single top school in all of Japan and there are people failing tests although they know exactly what questions will be in the test? Some of them are on the top school in Japan to play sports? Attempted rape, frequent violence between students, heck Class C is a group of organized delinquents. Don\u2019t even get me started on that 20-something year old black man that can only speak the most basic and broken english. It\u2019s like the setting itself is treated like an afterthought just 2 episodes in. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that\u2019s treated like an afterthought is creating an opportunity to get invested in the show. The main reason for that being the characters we could possibly get invested in that, sadly, all without exception are no more than the mere prescription of a \u201cfictional character\u201d. They are neither relatable nor likable. In a story like this you\u2019d want well-developed, human and likable characters with well-constructed motivations so you can root for them, but the show instead presents you with an empty shell of a human being as a main character and another multitude of characters that consists - without exception - of character tropes that you\u2019ve already seen more times than you can count, but with a \u201ctwist\u201d added to them. These twist are also treated like an afterthought for the rest of the show, seemingly randomly reappearing as if the author forgot they even exist. It feels like they are just a superficial way to create a feeling of depth and complexity when it isn\u2019t actually present, they are played like cliffhangers and then never expanded upon and it just grows even more frustrating every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji as the main character makes any possible investment in the show incredibly difficult. While he was commonly compared to Hachiman from Oregairu, that comparison is like comparing a highly modern army jet to a pedestrian. Ayanokouji at his very core is just another boring self-insert protagonist, albeit not as annoying as the irritatingly popular whiny harem protagonists. Not only is he incredibly smart, skilled in martial arts and literally another \u201clab rat\u201d, his absolute skill earns him the respect and affection of every major character in the show. Be it the hottest girls in his class, the student council president or even teachers. Everyone wants a piece of the Ayanokouji. While first presented as a snarky, judgemental cynic, he quickly devolves into just another LN wish fulfillment protagonist with nearly unlimited powers. Powers so incredible they can bend our very perception of reality and reason (because it totally makes sense that you can constantly monitor the whereabouts of any students whose number you have, especially if that solution is presented the first time AFTER you\u2019ve already used it. Nice Deus Ex Machina, Aya).\\n\\n\r\nAs is tradition, the reasons for the female characters\u2019 affection towards him is the result of several arrays of coincidences.\\n\\n\r\nCase 1: Ayanokouji is just casually taking a walk in the evening when suddenly he sees Horikita and her brother beating her. Being the distant and self-serving dude he is, Ayanokouji quickly rushes in to save her, displaying his high proficiency in both martial arts and witty one-liner responses in the process. Over the course of the series, Horikita gradually grows to like Ayanokouji, or rather gets increasingly \u201cjealous\u201d of other girls spending time with him or being treated well by him. While the conflict between Horikita and her brother is underlyingly present throughout early parts of the show, it quickly gets neglected and serves only as momentary shock instead of as a part of a meaningful narritive.\\n\\n\r\nCase 2: Kushida forgets her phone and Aya is fast enough to see the elevator Kushida took descending, although it should be ascending. He follows her and of course just when he arrives, Kushida first unleashes her \u201cother personality\u201d. Kushida stays around Ayanokouji because she doesn\u2019t trust him to keep this secret, although there is no reason for him to tell anyone and he has nothing to gain from it. Kushida then grows to like him over the course of their less than healthy relationship, but her \u201csecond personality\u201d, how it came to be and why its existence is important is never explained. This is a trend.\\n\\n\r\nCase 3: Not only is there an entirely random fan of Sakura in the shop she visits to have her camera repaired, he also is a crazy, delusional stalker. When he sees Sakura alone in the mall, he follows her. Sakura, being the highly intelligent elite school student she is, quickly runs into the darkest alley possible and the dude tries to rape her. Ayanokouji again saves the day using Sakura's GPS location which is somehow possible because he has Sakura\u2019s whateveritis number, a concept which only gets introduced in hindsight. Sakura, having been saved from rape of all the things that could possibly happen in a tightly secured elite school, falls in love with her savior. Not only is rape used for its shock value, but also to create a feeling of affection. It\u2019s horribly executed and terribly cheap and distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nHaving characters you can get invested in and root for is detrimental to the story that Elite Classroom is trying to tell. In this fierce competition for class points, we have to grow to like the students in the class we are supposed to root for. For there to be any stakes in this story,  the goal to reach class A needs to be supported by a strong cast of characters and for expulsion to feel like a real threat, we need to first be invested enough in the characters to not want them to face expulsion. Expulsion, unlike quickly disproven by the point system\u2019s flaws, must be strictly carried out for it to feel like the potential and everpresent danger that it is supposed to be. Elite Classroom accomplishes neither of both and thus turns from a potential engaging experience into a boring slog that just keeps dragging on forever. This, however, is not the only shortcoming of EC\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first half of EC can be summarized as \u201cmessy school shenanigans with Ayanokouji\u201d, this does not apply to the second half. What it is, however, is the figurative aftermath of shit hitting the fan. The shit is all over the place. We go from a plot twist at the end of episode 6 instantly to a pool fanservice episode and a mission to peek on girls in the changing room, then jump on a luxus cruise to a survival island. On that island we get to see thrilling mysteries like whodunnit - panty thief edition. Great. Ayanokouji\u2019s backstory, him being an ex-lab rat and all, sometimes gets thrown into the mix in the form of flashbacks, instead of, you know, actually developing that even remotely interesting storyline that could provide a commentary of Nietzsche\u2019s idea of the \u00dcbermensch. We get students horsing around on a survival island that they could just leave any time they feel like instead. Honestly, at times it feels like the original author hasn\u2019t even read a [insert name of any of the episode titles authors\u2019] 101. I\u2019m by no means an expert on philosophy but so many opportunities to provide a quality product are wasted on instead focusing on generic and pointless LN filler.\\n\\n\r\nThis contrast of the supposed smart story and characters and the generic LN formulas it is presented in is also reflected in the series overall presentation. It is hard to take a supposedly serious and smart story seriously if almost all of the main female characters have breasts as large as soccer balls and they are repeatedly the focus of the camera. If you act like you can present a mature take on authoritarian education, society and social mobility, why bother with an episode of losers trying to record girls changing with hidden cameras and act as if that\u2019s funny to anyone smart enough to grasp the former concepts? The episode titles at times get so tryhard they use the quote \u201cAbandon all hope, ye who enter here\u201d for the introductory episode of the island arc, a place that you can leave whenever and where the worst result you could get is not gaining extra points. If anything, the quote seems to address the viewer, because anyone who genuinely believed the series could overcome the hurdle that is forgetting the previous fanservice episode should by now also have lost hope for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\n I will admit that I am by no means the target audience of this show. Elite Classroom is just another rendition of the generic high school LN adaptations that have some spacey plot later on in the novels which you will obviously not see in the anime. If you, unlike me, are not yet fed up with these fast-food-LN adaptations and think adding a certain \u201csmart and serious\u201d spin to said formula is an interesting take on the genre, EC will by all means satisfy you. To me however, watching this show was more of a chore than anything. I find these archetypical LN stories to be both boring and bland, and EC is no different, but with an additional stamp of \u201cfailed attempt\u201d on top.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the Classroom of the Elite is a failure. The weak, badly written plot forces generic LN formulas into its narrative which makes the serious \u201csmart\u201d tone of the show seem pretentious. The setting is poorly constructed and its rules are so full of holes they contradict the story\u2019s goal and make investment into the show nigh impossible. The characters are walking tropes and for the most part unbelievably unlikable. While there were some few good attempts at foreshadowing and some okay dialogue (although most of it seems unnatural and forced), they aren\u2019t even close to enough to make watching this show worth your time and as such I cannot recommend watching this show unless you are a High School Light Novel enthusiast.",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Youkoso and while care has been taken to minimize story spoilers there may be spoilers in character analysis   \r\nIn Society are humans really treated equally or are they treated according to the standards in society \r\nBased off a well-known light novel series of the same name Youkoso gives us the opportunity to ask one of the fundamental questions that most teenagers would ask as they enter High school. In society are all human beings treated equally and does this by introducing us to a prestigious high school that has an impressive recordof providing excellent students for society. The first episode itself made a pretty good impression on me and looking back at it im glad that I decided to stick with it to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in near future Japan the anime is centered on Koudo Ikusei senior high school a well-known and prestigious high school that was created by the government to help nurture and develop the next generation into skilled adults that will benefit the country. Having both state of the art facilities and freedom unknown to high school students the school can be said to be a paradise but this is far from the truth.  But while having the best of facilities at their disposal the pressure that the school puts on its students that it sees as its lifeblood is intense and far more than what one would expect in a normal school. For the students that are lucky enough to get admitted into this prestigious school they must work twice as hard as their grades while also defining them also affect the amount of points that they get each month. In this school, full of elite student\u2019s competition, subtle plans and mind games are rife where every mistake can cost you points or worst cause the whole class to be punished. In this environment where classes see each other as mortal enemies only those with conviction, creativity and adaptability can hope to survive and prosper. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Youkoso follows the life of Kiyotaka Ayanokouji a high school freshman that upon the start of the school year finds himself assigned to the schools Class D the lowest class of the school\u2019s class system and widely regarded as the worst class and seen as a dumping ground where the school sends people that it has believed that it cannot control but cannot expel without good reason. Here he is joined by an intense and quiet girl named Suzune Horikita an ice queen that aspires to join the prestigious class A and Kikyou Kushida a popular and cheerful girl that\u2019s widely seen as the class idol. Together these three and the class must do what they can to survive in the intrigue\u2019s that take place between the classes.  \\n\\n\r\nKiyotaka \\n\\n\r\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji voiced by new voice actor Shouya Chiba is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school freshman that in the beginning of the series was assigned to Class D Kiyotaka from initial appearances was a person that was quiet, laid back and indifferent and is someone that seems to be prefer to remain in the background and not draw attention to himself.  Despite his moody and rather indifferent nature Kiyotaka is shown to be someone that can be responsible and kind and is shown to care a great deal about his friends and allies. Though not someone that has a sense of justice in him Kiyotaka is someone that hates seeing people that he knows being out in danger and would try to help them when that happens. While seemingly laid back and indifferent towards others it is noted that Kiyotaka when he becomes serious and motivated can come up with some really interesting and smart ideas that make use of his good perception skills and showcase one of his more prominent traits which is his cunning. Despite his averse to getting involved in troublesome situations Kiyotaka is shown to be very good at dealing with and managing various difficult situations which is an interesting trait about him that hints at his true personality. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Kiyotaka and the members of his class deal with one crisis after another it becomes clear that beneath his normal self Kiyotaka also has a personality that he hides and conceals from the others including his friends. In this personality which is perhaps his true one Kiyotaka\u2019s personality is drastically different from the one that he normally exhibits. In this personality Kiyotaka is shown to be a calculating and manipulative person and also a smart one that is not above using people for his own ends. In this personality Kiyotaka\u2019s strong intelligence and observational skills that he had to keep hidden in his default personality is now much more visible and more readily used when Kiyotaka gets serious. As a character, I felt that Kiyotaka was an interesting character whose dual nature in the form of his two different personalities are what actually define him. The contrast between the two different personalities I felt were well done and while some of the traits of the two do pass between the two personalities from time to time like his fast thinking nature it\u2019s when we see Kiyotaka in his true personality that his character truly shines. While Kiyotaka may have villainous tendencies due to his manipulative personality it\u2019s important to note that this is a result of having an in-depth knowledge and understanding of how the real world actually works. Overall the character of Kiyotaka I felt was a well-designed one that showed that careful observation and rational decisions along with a little manipulation can ensure that what they all hold dear can be protected. I felt that Shouya Chiba actually did an excellent job in his first main roles for me. \\n\\n\r\nSuzune \\n\\n\r\nSuzune Horikita voiced by new seiyuu Akari Kito is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a member of class D Suzune is a quiet, well-mannered but distant person at the start of the series.  In the beginning Suzune exhibited the classic ice queen type personality that\u2019s commonly seen in animes. In addition to exhibiting the quiet and unapproachable nature that\u2019s the key point of the ice queen persona Suzune in the beginning was also a thorny person that preferred to act using her own judgement than rely on others showing that she was also someone that did not trust others easily. In the beginning Suzune also had a rather curious view on friendship in that she did not see a need for it in the beginning. As a result of her ice queen like personality Suzune in the beginning was seen by many within the class as something akin to an oddball and not widely trusted by her classmates. Indeed, at this point in time she was also the same as well as she regarded friendship and bonds with something akin to disdain. As the series goes on though thanks largely to the efforts of Kiyotaka and Kikyou Suzune\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as the class begins to suffer from assaults from other classes. Though reluctant at first Suzune gradually becomes friendlier to others but still keeps a certain distance from others. Though still dismissive about friendships Suzune begins to understand that friendship and unity within the class will be important if they were to endure within the school and starts to care more about her classmates advising and helping them when needed until she is satisfied that they are safe.  In this we can see that Suzune\u2019s starting ice queen personality gradually starts to be thawed out as she begins warming to several of her classmates and trusting them the most prominent of them being Kiyotaka.\\n\\n\r\n As Suzune\u2019s ice queen personality thaws her true personality eventually is gradually revealed to us. While still quiet and preferring to stay logical Suzune is shown to be a very determined person that also has great conviction and is not the type of person that will back down from arguments especially when engaged in arguments with others. Suzune is also shown to have very good decision making and analytic skills that when combined with her excellent perception skills make her formidable in defending the class in meetings. Suzune\u2019s most prominent trait without a doubt is her truthful and direct nature in that she is someone that hates being dishonest and unlike Kiyotaka can be relied upon to state the cold hard facts of something quite readily. Despite being a very determined and strong person from initial appearances beneath that mask it can be said that Suzune is actually the opposite in that she\u2019s lonely and vulnerable and wants to rely on someone that she can trust. Within the series this acts as the main focus for the relationship that Suzune has with Kiyotaka which is also one of the main parts of the shows story. Though their relationship started off rather poorly over the course of the series their relationship gradually improved and Kiyotaka become one of the few people that Suzune trusted. As a character, I felt that Suzune was a well-designed character that showed some excellent character development as the series went on and in the process becoming one of my favourite characters. The gradual change from an ice queen to someone that stood as one of the best defenders of Class D I thought was a change that was well designed. I felt that her seiyuu Akari Kito really did an excellent job portraying the character of Suzune in one of her first main roles. \\n\\n\r\nKikyou \\n\\n\r\nKikyou Kushida played by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of High School Fleet and Urara Meirochou fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a classmate of Suzune and Kiyotaka. A 16-year-old girl and a high school freshman Kikyou is a kind, positive and well-mannered girl that\u2019s kind to everyone that she meets and is widely regarded by many to be the class idol within the class. A considerate and understanding person Kikyou has a very direct personality and seems to be someone that values friendship and bonds quite highly as she cares a great deal about each one of her friends deeply. However, while she appears to be a simple-minded girl that\u2019s not well versed in manipulation beneath his mask of hers is a different personality that Kikyou hides from the others. Underneath the angle like personality that she presents to outsiders Kikyou surprisingly has another personality that is radically different to her surface one. \\n\\n\r\nIn this Kikyou\u2019s personality though still direct is very rude and is not afraid of voicing her true feelings about other people directly. She\u2019s also shown to be quite manipulative and quite capable of using blackmail and lies to force people to obey her. Despite this radical change in personality it\u2019s interesting to note that this side of her isn\u2019t exactly evil by nature but rather seems to be a protective measure that was created to protect her from harm. Perhaps more so than in her default personality Kikyou seems to be in great fear of being isolated and being lonely.  The character of Kikyou Kushida I felt was an interesting character that while supportive of the main characters and to the class emphasized one of the main themes of this anime quite well. The theme being that everyone wears a mask in society. The contrast in her personality I felt was interesting as was her relationship with Kiyotaka. I felt that her seiyuu Yurika Kubo did an excellent job in portraying her.  \\n\\n\r\nHonami \\n\\n\r\nHonami Ichinose played by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Asterisk Wars and In a world God only knows fame is one of the main support characters and is one of Kiyotaka and Suzune\u2019s main allies in the series. A 16-year-old girl and high school freshman Honami differs from the two in that she\u2019s actually a member of one of the classes that actually form the school class B in particular. Despite being from another class though Honami bears none of the malice and hatred that other students in the school have towards class D and instead treats them equally and with respect. A cheerful, positive and honest person Honami can be said to be Class B\u2019s version of Kikyou as their personalities are very similar to each other. Kind, caring Honami is someone that seems to wear her heart on her sleeve being kind and caring towards everyone that she meets regardless of whether they belong to her class or to others. Her kind and caring personality ensures that within her own class to which she acts as leader that there are no fights between classmates and that everyone treats each other with respect thus also ensuring that they won\u2019t start fights with other classes. Though a rule bound person by nature Honami is also shown to be flexible with rules and will happily bend them if it means that she can help someone in need. Though kind and caring in normal mode she\u2019s shown to be stern and unforgiving to people that threaten her fellow students and openly despises people that do so.  Honami I felt was an interesting character in that unlike the rest of the cast she did not seem to have a mask and her base personality appears to be genuine. Her attempts to help the members of class D with their plans I felt was a good indication of cooperation that can take place between classes. Nao Touyama I felt did an excellent job in her portrayal of Honami. \\n\\n\r\nAiri\\n\\n\r\nAiri Sakura voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Digimon Adventure Tri and Aoki Hagane No Arpeggio Ars Nova Cadenza fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a classmate of Kiyotaka. A 16-year-old high school freshman Airi is a kind, quiet and timid girl that in the beginning of the series preferred to remain in the background and avoid getting involved in other people\u2019s affairs. Though kind and well-mannered in the beginning of the series Airi wrestled with the distinct problem of having low self-esteem which made her jittery and prone to becoming nervous when people talk to her which manifested in her attempts to defend her personal space rather determinedly. As the series goes on it becomes clear that Airi like many other characters on the show actually has another side to her that\u2019s just as unexpected as the others in that she was a model of some renown within her world. This mask of hers which is similar to Kikyou\u2019s I felt was interesting as it grew out of her desire to avoid being lonely while at the same time being able to help those that may be in similar states to her. After a particular drastic event in the series Airi\u2019s personality gradually starts to change becoming more open with herself while also trying to be more confidant in herself and more importantly trying to get to know people that helped her. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character I felt that Airi was an interesting one in that her struggle for equality was on a more personal level than other characters and was based on Airi\u2019s innate personality traits notably her quiet and timid nature. The decision to use a model as an alternate side to her personality I felt was a good move as models in addition to showcasing products can also serve to help other people by their modelling as well. I felt that Mao Ichimichi did an excellent job in portraying the character of Airi.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV (Animation &Arts/Music and Voice)\\n\r\nIn terms of art I felt that the design of the school and its attendant facilities was done pretty well and indeed the school did give the feel of being similar to a small town or outlet rather than a high school. The uniform designs for the school I felt were also well designed and looked pretty smart as well. Character design I felt was also pretty good with each character being unique and well designed.  In terms of animation I felt that animation was clear and beautifully detailed. In terms of music I felt that the series had a pretty good opening and ending themes with the ending being particularly strong. Voice acting for the series I felt was superb with Kiyotaka\u2019s voice actor Shouya Chiba and Suzune\u2019s seiyuu Akari Kito deserving particular praise for their portrayal of their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Youkoso was an interesting anime that had as its main strengths an interesting premise, story, characters and the underlying themes of society that it tries to address. The main premise of this show is of course the prestigious high school that the main characters attend in the story. The school while seemingly perfect both in terms of facilities and reputation is only a facade for within it hides a very strict school system where a student\u2019s performance in their studies and exams determine their worth to both the school and to society. To reinforce this system the anime makes use of an interesting system that serve to underline the central purpose of this school. The system is an interesting concept in itself in that it acts both as a central resource for the everyday needs of the students but also an objective for the students for failure to do well in the school will see the number of points that they gain every month lessen.  The idea to make this system a combination of not just a currency that can be used but also an indication of how much worth the school see\u2019s in both the class and the students within was an interesting move and tied in well with the school\u2019s unique culture. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the series main themes is that of equality which is best shown in not just the division of students into classes but also in the number of masks that characters must adapt as part of their personalities to exist in society. When combined with the personalities of characters that appear to be kind and unassuming on the surface the masks aspect works well to add more depth to the characters. This aspect of the anime itself I felt was pretty interesting. While the struggles between the classes served to highlight the differences in status between the classes with lower letter ones being superior to the higher letter ones and best seen in the disdain that class A and C members have for class D. Whats interesting is that the this isn\u2019t repeated in all areas as Honami and Class B shown in their interactions with Class D showing that in the end it\u2019s the question of perception. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series also plays a part in dealing with the theme of equality in that it pits the members of class D widely regarded by the school as outcasts against a school who is determined to make things difficult for them. This struggle against great odds by a class of misfits that make use of a variety of tactics to even the field to give them a better chance of victory I felt only serves to make this anime that much interesting. Watching Kiyotaka and Suzune work together to counter the plans of the other classes and the school sure was fun to watch. Overall Youkoso was an interesting anime that had not just an interesting premise and a great story but also great characters that it used to tackle a number of interesting themes that are really relevant in society and in terms of final score I think it definitely deserves a 10 in my books. The only lament that I felt about this anime was that it was only a half season so we aren\u2019t able to see more of what Kiyotaka\u2019s true personality is like. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not claiming to be a veteran when it comes to watching anime, but I've seen enough where viewing shows with a typical high school setting just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Of course a lot of the shows in this genre come with a twist or two, and Classroom of the Elite is no exception. However just because an anime uses the classic school life formula doesn't mean that it will be successful. While it's true that some shows are able to effectively pull off the school life setting, lesser anime, like Classroom of the Elite, fail right from the get go.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode one dives right into explaining the setting and sets up the general story of the anime. Viewers learn that the school in which the characters are attending is a special academy where students are divided into four classes based off of skill and other criteria that is never really discussed (you'll soon learn that the lack of a proper explanation for things is a reoccurring theme with this anime). Unsurprisingly, the two protagonists, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji and Suzune Horikita, are put in class D, the lowest ranking class. The story is supposed to be about their rise from the bottom to the top of the academy's hierarchy, but there's one major problem; They make relatively no progress toward achieving this goal throughout the course of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into more detail on this, let me explain an unique plot element that the author introduced for the anime: a point system. These points are given to students and represent multiple things, including currency and class ranking. The students lose points for bad grades, behavior, etcetera and earn them by achieving various things, many of which are unexplained. Points are allocated after each month, and one of the first twists in the anime is that class D failed to earn any points after their first month at school (pfft. What losers), thus throwing them into a state of turmoil. Now this system could have been used in so many ways that would have easily benefited the plot of the anime. However the distribution of these points is so convoluted and rarely touched upon that in the latter portion of the anime I felt like their importance completely vanished. Characters would just go up to a chart and say things like \"Oh look, our class has X points and the others have Y points. Cool.\" and then move on. The few exceptions are when Ayanokouji actually uses the points in an inventive manner to do things like purchase old test answers and boost the grade of a classmate's exam. Unfortunately, the point system wasn't nearly as explored as it should have been, and it failed to reach its full potential.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said that the goal in this anime (at least from what I could discern) was for the core cast to strive to become the best in the school? While its true that class D (with the exception of  Ayanokouji at first) desperately want to rise to the top, we rarely see anything significant done by them in order to achieve this goal. At one point Horikita gave a commanding speech in which she warned the other classes to look out for class D. From my perspective, this was just an empty threat. In fact, more often then not, the anime showcases the members of class D struggling to simply earn any points at all much less hoping to compete against their rivals. The anime constantly presented us with many \"tough\" scenarios that were supposed to leave viewers impressed with the protagonists for finding creative solutions to them. The problem is that many of these situations were too lackluster for me to even care about them in the first place. These mediocre events ranged from trying to have everyone in the class pass an exam without failing miserably to finding a panty thief. There are literally no stakes, and this was deleterious to the anime's success.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, I did sort of like Ayanokouji and Horikita.  Ayanokouji's casual and disinterested attitude was sort of refreshing, and his along with Horikita's social ineptitude was interesting, especially when they were forced to interact with other characters. Now the primary issue that I had was that both of them have a similar personality. They're both social outcasts who have a hard time fitting in with the rest of the class. Granted, they each posses differing views on things like friendship and whatnot, but it sometimes got really boring hearing both of them talk to each other in their monotone voices all the time. Also, they each hardly interacted with the other characters (Horikita more than Ayanokouji) unless they were forced to, which left the rest of the cast terribly underdeveloped. To compensate for this, the producers would give the other characters (most notably Kikyou Kushida) random quirks in order to make them seem more interesting. This ultimately failed because I didn't really care for the characters too much in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the budget went into eyes and fanservice. The characters' eyes always seem to shine bright with vibrant splotches of color. While high in detail, the focus on irises makes everything else seem lazily designed in comparison. The only exception to this is when a character is used for fanservice appeal. During these sacred moments, the characters' bodies suddenly gain a ton of depth, shading, curves, and enlarged breasts (unless they're male, in which case they become overly muscular instead). Hallelujah for these ecchi scenes, am I right!? Seriously though, if the animation quality was consistently like the short and almost always unnecessary fanservice scenes, then I would have been really impressed with the show's visuals. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I didn't despise Classroom of the Elite or anything. I was just disappointed by the show's laid back attitude. Everything felt anticlimactic or unnecessary and it seemed like the creators were too afraid to take any risks and instead chose the safe and easy path. And in doing so, Classroom of the Elite became yet another mediocre anime that will certainly be forgotten by most as time goes by.",

            "content": "This is the 1st time for me to write a review for an airing anime....... So I'll try and keep it fresh.\r\nI mean, it's a light novel adaptation. It'll be interesting, right? The concept built for students who aim high in a prestigious school. It's about to get bumpy as it doesn't go as well as expected.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is really interesting. As a reader of the LN, I say that it's a combination of Oregairu and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. But to be clear, wouldn't you find it entertaining as it really gives of a good vibe just from the 1st episode? A system which determines thefund and rankings depending on students' behavior. A large amount of points(cash) every month, students plotting to set things up.\\n\r\nTrying to reach something against people who you really want to help but yet to know how... Of course there will be something problematic for the main characters as story progresses. The high looks down on the low, plays with them and sells them out.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the eyes but for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji the main characters. His eyes kinda looks empty to me.. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Visuals:\\n\r\nWell, it looks nice to me. Especially the shading.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music/Voice Acting:\\n\r\nWhy wouldn't the audio quality be at its best shape?\\n\r\nLiking the bgm. The OP is composed by ZAQ, it's so good and I like how she sings! The ED's main part is what shines brightest for its song.\\n\r\nWell, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji's monotone voice acting isn't really a problem to me...... The voice acting's good as for the others.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIs this Hachiman Hikigaya and Yukino Yukinoshita?\\n\r\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji seems mundane but he's interesting when it comes to intellectuals and people's action course.\\n\r\nThere's still no actual development yet and there's no one I really dislike.. So let's just say I like them. They all have pasts that we yet to explore. It's quite obvious.\\n\r\nI just want things to be resolve so everyone will be happy. Every single quote they give off at the end of an episode is how it portraits character's upcoming setting.\\n\r\nThe fact that Kiyotaka Ayanokouji knows \"how to\" piano and calligraphy like me, I'm just gonna continue and watch how he does...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nShort and clear. Interesting, high-class art, why would you hate music? Reused characters' personalities; don't mind. I like where this is going. Why I really am interested in this was because of its setup. Who you are and where you'll take action at. It's an interesting setup to me. I like the main characters' will to surpass what they couldn't do before.",

            "content": "When you think of the word \u2018school\u2019, the first words that come to mind might be textbooks, lecture, exams, and careers. Schools are designed to prepare for students for their future after all. However, that\u2019s not entirely the case for Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, a school that tests their students beyond the academic level. Youkoso Jitsuroku Shinjou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e (also known as \u201cClassroom of the Elite\u201d) is an anime that explores how survival in the outside world depends much more than just your academic skills.\r\nFrom my early impressions, this anime stood out from some light novel adaptations as it deconstructs the educationalsystem. This especially earns my attention as Japan already has a tough educational system so deconstructing that idea felt like a unique idea. In essence, this anime explores how the fictional Koudo Ikusei Senior High School takes initiative at preparing its students to survive in the real world. Granted by the government, the school has a budget system and students are supplied with points (100,000 every month). These points essentially translates to money as students are advised to use them wisely. The catch is that classes will receive points only based on their performance. Get the idea now? It basically exposes the idea of responsibility for these young teens as they realize what they\u2019re in for.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode introduces some of the main cast including main male protagonist Kiyotaka Ayankoji. It won\u2019t take long to realize that he has a rather dry outlook on life and often try to avoid being noticed. My impression of Kiyotaka reminds me of the main male protagonist from Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru as both him and Hachiman has similar personalities. His isolated personality doesn\u2019t make him stand out as a character on the surface but it gets really interesting when you listen to his thoughts about others. It\u2019s further evidenced by his poor social skills as he has difficulty making friends with others. As such, Kiyotaka\u2019s role in this anime feels different than from the usual light novel stereotype. As the episode progresses, I feel like some people can relate to Kiyotaka as well. Then, there\u2019s Suzune Horikita, the unfriendly cold beauty that gets involved with Kiyotaka from the same class. Similarly, she has a personality that also appears to be unsociable with others although she purposely tries to avoid making friends. In her mind, friends aren\u2019t necessary and holds her back. On the other hand, there are also very social people in their class like Kikyou Kushida. She\u2019s like the antithesis of both Kiyotaka and Horikita. Unlike them, Kushida is very good at communicating with others and has a friendly personality. Yet behind her bubbly appearance also lies a girl that masks her true image. Either way, it\u2019s shown that the main characters in this series all have the same objectives and that\u2019s to survive at their prestigious school.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cast of characters, Class D\u2019s students are easily the most prominent compared to the others as most of the series revolves around them. It\u2019s ironic since Class D is often looked down upon because of their grades and performance. Nonetheless, we get to see how they adapt with the school\u2019s points system. Some characters like Kiyotaka and Horikita manages their resources well while others carelessly uses it to satisfy their own desires. Not to mention, Class D seems to always get involved in some sort of drama from the very beginning. These include the plot involving Airi Sakura, an inspiring photographer and a stalker. Ken Sudou (one of the 3 Fools of Class D) even gets into a complicated drama that almost had him expelled from the school. The anime showcases these drama as any of these events can be relatable and happen in real life. Later in the show, the school even tests their students with an actual survival test that really brings the reality of what it means to survive. To be honest, I think all these concepts brings the potential of this anime to light. It highlights what some of the main characters are capable of and how they influence others. Unfortunately, this anime is presented as a distilled adaptation so don\u2019t expect a complete series. In other words, it leaves some important territories unexplored such as Kiyotaka\u2019s mysterious past, Kushida\u2019s darker personality, and among others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my interest of the main characters, the others in this series rarely stand out particularly those from Class B, C, and even A. The only ones that caught my attention occasionally are Mio Ibuki and Kakeru Ryuuen (Class C), Honami Ichinose (Class B), and Kouhei Katsuragi (Class A). Student council leader Manabu Horikita initially had my interest due to her relationship with Suzune. However, the anime doesn\u2019t really capitalize on exploring their relationship. Most of Class A seems to stand out only by status as none of their key members gets important focus such as their leader, Alice Sakayanagi.  There\u2019s also not much focus on the school faculty except for Class D\u2019s homeroom teacher Sae Chabashira. In essence, viewers coming into this anime will likely remember this anime\u2019s characters mainly from Class D than any of the others. Background stories are vaguely delivered that holds characterization back as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a premise, expect this anime to really dive into drama often. If you\u2019re not a fan of such genre, then it will likely make your heads turn. By drama, this anime explores social problems such as isolation, fear of anxiety, identity issues, and fear of rejection. Even the simple concept of trust is tested in later episodes. Not to mention, this anime seems to have hidden dark intentions from its character cast. In addition, do expect lighthearted comedy to pop up from here and there. Unfortunately, this show doesn\u2019t escape from light novel pitfalls such as panty jokes, swimsuit fan service, and generic misunderstandings. As I mentioned before though, the humor of this anime can get distracting at times although it doesn\u2019t hold the show back in general. Oh and don\u2019t expect any actual romance like some gimmicky shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Lerche, I must admit that the visual quality stood out compared to some of its other works. The characters look vibrant, colorful, and smooth with their appearances. This is especially true for Horikita as her character design matches those of a class beauty and Kiyotata\u2019s stoic personality also matches perfectly with his face on most scenarios. Character expressions and body language is indeed important in this anime as it discreetly shows how characters behave. Luckily, the anime pulls that off. The setting also looks appealing as it looks visually impressive as an upper class community. However, the anime still relies on some fan service from the old book. Kushida and Honami are the guiltiest of these examples as the camera seems to focus on them suggestively at times. Oh and before you forget\u2026swimsuits.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it can be overlooked on occasions, character voice mannerism is an important part of the show especially with the main cast. Kiyotaka is perhaps the most noticeable as we observe his thoughts and words. The way he talks often lacks emotions but noticeable for the way he speaks. Similarly, Horikita\u2019s cold personality is easily reflected by her tough voice and attitude. However, there are some character voices that I found annoying to the ears in particular with Kushida and occasionally the nicer guys in this anime. The theme songs has a J-pop style tune that while doesn\u2019t stand out too much is stylish enough to carry themselves. OST of this show balances between its eerie and lighthearted tone depending on the circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this anime can be a hit or miss for people. Some will enjoy it with the ideas it has to offer while others will discard it from their memories. However, I think this anime does do well to deconstruct the school system. Too often these days, our society relies on education to determine an individual\u2019s social status. This show demonstrates that it\u2019s not always about academic skills that matter in the real world. That being said, I think the story and main characters are what attracted me to this show. However, I can\u2019t say that some of the other characters are noticeable for their roles. The story itself is also incomplete so it will feel like an advertisement of the light novel. However, I\u2019d still give this show a try for this anime\u2019s style and way of portraying its society. The fact that some characters can be such assholes and exploring social issues will wake up our minds to reality. \\n",

Tired of the typical virgin/otaku who blushes like a kid when seeing girls ?\r\n- Has an average/good plot.\r\nWhat's good on the show : Characters 9/10 and story 9/10.\r\nThough some characters are kinda cliche (not gonna name which ones), the important thing is thatmost of them play a role when the time comes, some of them do not show their real personality (won't spoil this) or their true intentions at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself its simple, an elite school divided in 4 classes, each one with a range of points based on their behavior and test scores It also has some interesting plot twists and there is not really a clear objective of what's will be the road of the story, specially on the MC who doesn't seem to care for scoring/getting friends, girls money, helping others or anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has different objectives: some want to get in class A, some other just want friends, some others just wanna kill time in school. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its 8.5 but i rounded it to 9 because i think this show deserves a higher general score. I consider it to be slighty underrated.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I've finished watching it.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score would be 8.5 because there were 2 episode fullfilled of fanservice and just a random story in both of them, which i consider something bad considering the whole season is just 12 episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "With no prior knowledge of the series, I only picked this anime up because I was seeing fairly glowing reviews and an impressively high score on this site. Unfortunately, I'm in the undesirable position of being one of the bearers of bad news: This show is dreadful.\r\nClassroom of the elite starts off fairly weak, presenting some vapid quotes like, \"Are humans really equal?\" and an opening sequence that displays a general lack of care. It only took me a few minutes to realize what I was watching was yet another light novel adaptation (if you're not familiar with light novels, the fact that this showis an adaptation of one is not a good thing). The premise is almost entirely unoriginal, but I've always thought that it's not so much about originality of concept, but rather how one uses the ideas and inspiration they take from other stories to craft something unique or memorable of their own. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that there is nothing of quality to speak of in this show. Not even remotely. The story is derived from countless battle school anime where kids in a given school fight for ranking and prestige. In this case, they prove their worth through academic standings. To \"spice things up\" the kids have to live on campus and receive an allotted amount of funds each month that fluctuates depending on their performance. The class we follow starts out at the bottom rung of the hierarchy, class D, and we are to see their journey to class A. The execution of this concept is poorly handled, though, in part due to a simple lack of imagination and a pacing structure that would give Charlotte a run for its money. At this rate, I have my doubts the kids'll make it to C, as the show has quickly devolved into a sort of \"adventures with Ayanokouji-kun and friends...\" \\n\\n\r\nYes, everything about this is hacky, even down to the details of the kids having to live on campus, but again this wasn't even the upsetting part. The unfortunate truth is anyone looking for any sort of unique or inspired take on the already super saturated \"highschool battle school\" subgenre is going to be severely let down here.\\n\\n\r\nAll that's left worth talking about is our characters... I was hoping they could save this sinking ship but I'll just come out and say it: They are all walking tropes. No attention to detail or complexity. no substance, no layers, just barebones cliche here folks... You've got the hot-headed jock, apathetic student, the overly friendly chick, the perfect girl, the mysterious loli, the uninterested main character. They all fit into little frameworks to a T. As I was watching I couldn't help but think, \"Are these guys serious?\" I'm failing to think of a show as egregious in its display of its cast (if you could call it that), showing us, in earnest, how completely void of personality each and every one of them are. I was frankly embarrassed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's talk about this terrible main character for a second. If one ever needed to know what not to do when creating a main character for a story, they'd need look no further than this. You may be inclined to believe he is a breathe of fresh air from the \"whiny, spineless\" main characters that we so often get from these adaptations. But it's just another variation of the same garbage, really. First off, to pull off the \"uninterested main character\" archetype to any degree of success, you have to be at least a competent writer (see oregairu). It's extremely difficult. The reason is because when you have a main character who doesn't give a damn about anything and has no goals whatsoever (or at least doesn't present them for the audience to know), you run the risk of the audience saying things like, \"Why should I even care?\" That's the one thing you don't want. Ever. Because if your audience doesn't care, they will stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji is bored in every scenario. Even in high tension situations where the mood of the scene calls for him to actually care about what's going on, he doesn't. And this is detrimental to the experience of the viewer. We're conflicted. What are we supposed to feel in situations where the scene is telling us we should be worried, anxious, mad etc. but our main character is looking into the distance with eyes half open, spacing out thinking about fuck all? This is what bad writing looks like. It's simply unbearable to watch if you've not turned off your brain.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one scene in the 4th episode that cemented to me the notion that this show, similar to Ayanokouji, just doesn't care at all. Our main character and a girl we had previously seen him personally interact with *zero* times had asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she could let down her crush without them feeling as bad. The problem of this scene is blatantly apparent to anyone who made it to this episode. These two characters have built no prior relationship that merits her making this request of Ayanokouji. To our knowledge, they barely know each other. It was constructed solely to meet the demands of the plot, with no regard to upholding any standards of storytelling. It was kind of insulting to watch; I could picture the guys making this anime on their lunch break having a laugh going, \"How unambiguously dumb can we make this show, and still get people eating out of the palm of our hands?\"\\n\\n\r\nIt was at that moment that I truly realized this anime has gone nowhere and that it will never go anywhere. There is no passion anywhere to be found here. No feeling. No excitement. A grade schooler could tell just how little original thought and care went into the making of this story, its world, or characters. It's just another poor ripoff of something that is already dreadful. I could make this review much longer, criticizing everything in excruciating detail, but similarly to Ayanokouji, I just can't be bothered.",

            "content": "Some shows are so bad they make me angry enough to rant about them, but so far only this show has reached new levels of irrelevance that I experienced genuine ennui for the first time in my life. It's pretentious, boring drivel that makes a teen girl's SasuNaru songfic look like Gilgamesh in comparison.\r\nI keep seeing people claim that the best part of Classroom of the Elite is it's interesting premise for some reason. But, honestly, what groundbreaking concept are they exploring? High school students have to get good grades in school and not blow all their money on video games and dresses? Shocking. Classroomof the Elite presents this scenario like it's The Hunger Games for rich teens except that they still have rich families as a safety net to fall back on even if they are expelled. Nothing is at stake for them, not starvation or basic hygiene because the school offers free necessities and meals. Apparently not even expulsion, because test points can be bought and sold. The buying and selling of test points could've also been an idea for an interesting concept, students being forced to choose between buying food and clothing or spending a hefty amount of money in order to stay in school, if it weren't for the fact that Light Novel Guy and Main Girl have to be the Best At Everything and be the only ones with points to spend. So there goes that interesting idea too. \\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk about the characters for a second. I swore that if the protagonist made one single facial expression in three entire episodes I'd give the entire series a chance. Spoiler alert: he didn't. Light Novel Guy here is just 2kool4skool to actually react or even emote to situations around him. Adding a nihilistic viewpoint to an otherwise-generic Light Novel Guy is an interesting concept, if not for the fact that he's supposed to be seen as a nice guy and not a complete jerk. The first scene immediately laid out the problem with the way the writers treat his character; he wouldn't volunteer to give an old lady his seat, not for any moral reason, but just because he \"couldn't be bothered (tm)\". I've seen a few critics compare him to a robot, and it's not far off. To give you an example of the stellar dialogue, this is an actual line the main character says from episode three: \"I have no objection to this party, and I am taking part.\" We're supposed to believe human beings talk like this.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of human beings with dialogue so two dimensional it makes spam bots look like Shakespeare, here comes Light Novel Guy's gaggle of girls. We have not-Yukino Yukinoshita, our main girl, and not-Yui Yuigahama, our bubbly side chick. Comparing the characters to SNAFU is too easy, but low hanging fruit is the sweetest of fruit. The writers seem to agree with me, as both the characters can be boiled down to the tsundere and (spoiler alert) yandere archetypes. Since this is a light novel adaptation with a pseudo-intellectual main guy, I'm assuming at least two more girls on the promo poster fall into his harem as well. Boring is a pheromone in this anime, and no girl is immune. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's okay! Not-Yukino Yukinoshita isn't just here for a forced romantic subplot, she's also really deep! She wants to be the best because she has a brother complex and the only cure is for our Light Novel Guy to save her from being slapped around by her onii-sama because not only is he super smart, he used to play piano so he's super good at dodging kicks! \\n\\n\r\nNot-Yui Yuigahama is the straw that broke the camel's back and the reason why my score for this show went from a 4/10 and swan-dived into a 1/10. In the final minutes, she pulls back the curtain and reveals the writers for incompetent idiots who not only have no idea how women think, what emotions are, what rape culture is, or how fingerprinting works. It feels like they weren't confident the audience wouldn't like their milk toast main couple and tried to make the secondary love interest completely horrendous instead of giving personality to the characters who needed it most. It feels like the writing of a twelve-year-old stretching their edgy wings. And I feel so god damned bored.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one good scene in this series. It's the debate between the two girls and their conflicting moral philosophies. One believes the weak should be culled in order to advance, the other believes the weak should be helped in order to strengthen the group. Both yield the same result. This debate is still boring, but at least the show stretched it's Psych 101 muscles for twenty seconds. Of course, it's irrelevant because Main Girl only changes her mind once Light Novel Guy mansplains the other girl's philosophy to her again just a scene later because watching women change their entire worldviews after a man condescendingly rants at them is the only way Jason, the 17 year old otaku from Milwaukee, can finish. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the only decently animated shot in the entire series is a close up of a boob being squeezed. In fact, the entire series is void of basic animation when breasts aren't the main focus. In one instance they literally took a still image of a character and wiggled it around in photoshop to give it the appearance of animation instead of actually animating it! Not only is this show uninspired, boring, and borderline-misogynistic, it's straight up lazy. The character designs are hideous at worst and mediocre at best. The sound is for all intents and purposes non-existent, with a few acoustic background songs that sound like studio Lerche let the asshole in the park who's always with his guitar plunk out a melody in a recording booth. It's just bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fun to hate bad anime. Heck, if all the SAO videos are any indication is downright profitable. But there's nothing enjoyably bad about this show. It's about as fun as late-night paperwork. It's as fun as a root canal without the drugs to alleviate the consistent drilling pain. Anime as a whole may not be a mistake, but this show sure as hell is. 1/10.",

            "content": "After being put off by many reviewers, it's clear that this anime is a hit or miss depending on how you view it. I've never written a review before, however, I'm attempting to in order to justify one of the most intriguing series I've watched to date.\r\nThe series' story revolves around Ayanokoji, who is placed in the worst class in the school due to his poor entrance exam grades. While many people trash the story for being too \"slow\" or \"mundane\", I feel like the story itself shouldn't be the main focus of the anime but it instead should be seen as something that supportswhat I will be discussing next.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story of the school isn't the main focus of this anime, what is? The answer to this is the characters. While many early reviewers see the characters as boring and unattractive, they are only considering what the anime has directly given to them in a blunt way. Nothing about the characters' personality and/or motives are shown directly at first. This should have been obvious by how at the end of the first episode, the viewer realizes they know absolutely nothing about any of the characters' pasts or motives, including the MC.\\n\\n\r\nYoukoso is interesting because the viewer is led to wonder what each character's reasons for doing things are. Of course everyone is boring in this high school, you know why? It's because over half the characters wear masks to hide their true personalities. Actions and clues lead the viewer on a fascinating journey as pieces are put together in a way so that learning more and more about the main character and his classmates has a ton of impact. As more and more is revealed to the story letting the viewer understand the characters, the series becomes more fascinating and understandable, which creates the point that this series cannot be judged prematurely.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I won't go too much into the art and music, I can say that I really like both and think they pair well with the anime, being fitted in at right times. Youkoso's construction is slow, but boy is it one hell of a ride once you get into it.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize this review, if you are able to think for yourself and lead yourself to wonder what each characters' true personality, then you will most likely enjoy this anime.",

The concepts of the series were good at the first episode, they fell apart in episode 2 and so on, there's barely an introduction and the characters are dreadful.\r\nThe art is the best this show has (And it is still bad). the character design is generic like your typical school anime, and no one stands out from the others. You getyour typical \"yandere\" girl followed by your typical shounen protagonist, then your typical tsundere \"female dog\" then your typical bad guys and that's about it. It's nothing from the other world, but it is certaintly better than most anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is just horrible, disappointing. The protagonist is cold and has somthing hidden, well, not that that's new. But him not having a real personality is the problem, it has been used for the last 2 years and and it's just of the same, can't they do something else for a protagonist with no personality? This is too much. The female protagonist is a tsundere with no development, we don't know anything from her as well as the whole cast. At least a bit from the past wouldn't be so bad, to have an actual plot at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story makes no sense, they are dragging the whole mystery thing with the case for at least 3 episodes, is that really necessary? I get it, with 2 episodes its ok, you get the mystery in the first episode and the second its solved, but no, they are slow as a crap river. That aside, they have the clues right there yet they don't use them, again, the creator of this is trying way to hard to do something that's not worth it by this time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2",

            "content": "The best way to describe this show to someone who watches a decent amount of anime is \"baka and test that takes itself seriously\".  \r\nAs it turns out, baka and test does not work when it takes itself seriously.\r\nFor starters, the basic setting, while it seems interesting at first, makes no sense on anything but a surface level.  For some shows, (slice of life and comedy) this is okay, as deep reflection on the setting is not an essential part of the experience.  However, in a show that prides itself on its deep philosophical aspects, the fundamental flaws in the setting makeengagement impossible.\\n\r\nThe core plot of the first episode is simply that the students go to a prestigious school, where everything is provided for them, to be bought with points allotted at the beginning of each month.  The loser class that the story follows spends their points frivolously, and is shocked when they discover that the amount of points they have is lowered by their bad behavior.  Their teacher mocks them for not figuring this out, mentioning that she had said that their point allotments were based on merit in the beginning.  The show brings to attention how obvious this was, to the point where I did not even realize that it wasn't supposed to be while watching.  Yet, for some reason, nobody even considered it.\\n\r\nThis starts the show's trend of lazy writing with selective idiocy on the parts of the characters, where despite being students at the nation's premier prep school, regularly fail to understand basic concepts, rather than coming up with a reasonable reason for the characters to fail and create conflict. \\n\r\nFurthermore, along with the forced conflict, the stakes riding on this conflict are equally nonsensical, with the big reveal that any character who fails a test will be permanently expelled.  This is treated like the end of the world, and due to the structure of the series, from the viewer's perspective expulsion of a character would be equivalent to death, being their complete removal from the story.  However, to the characters, if they were already failing with no hope of recovery, expulsion would be an actively good thing, so the only shocking part about this consequence is that anyone in danger of being expelled wouldn't have dropped out or transferred already.  \\n\r\nThe story then proceeds to use this faulty setting as a premise to try and explore deep and philosophical questions such as \"does equality truly exist\".  However, this question's meaning is almost completely lost, because when the premise is this divorced from realism, we know that the plot will magically contort itself to drive home whatever moral the author feels like forcing on us.  Characters will act absurdly, impossibly unlikely coincidences will occur, and certain key aspects of society and human behavior will be overlooked, just so that the main character, and by extension the author, can be proven right in his morals.\\n\r\nFiction is an incredibly powerful tool for investigating philosophy, and a well crafted story can do very well as an example of a particular branch of philosophy.  However, rather than doing this, classroom of the elite simply makes bold statements like \"equality does not truly exist\" and proceeds to simply showcase supposed examples of \"inequality\" while ignoring all factors that would contest its viewpoints.",

            "content": "I'll get this right out there, this is without a doubt my most disliked show of the season and I believe it to be an objectively bad show. Here's why.\r\nBefore I start ragging on it, I'll say I don't mind either of the main characters too much (that said, I'll still tear them apart). Main characters referring to Ayanokouji, and Horikita. My problem lies with the pretentious attitude of the show, the frankly laughable story, and the down right cringy characters and character interactions. Due to the main characters being a carbon copy of the more famous Hachiman / Yukinoshita  (which certainly were notthe first couple of characters like themselves) and the awkward introductions with famous quotes, I get the feeling the show is trying do a few things. Be relatable to students, to be profound enough to spark critical thinking, and then the actual story itself is trying to be grandiose and dramatic to force a sense of excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSchool settings are popular because everyone has been, or is a student. Everyone can relate to being in school. This anime has done nothing wrong with trying to use a school setting to be relatable. The problem is the pathetic drama, and the narcissistic attempt at philosophy. This show is far too melodramatic. It's trying to cram too many settings into one anime. I can't take anything the characters do or say seriously. The school setting itself isn't an issue. Nor are the unoriginal, less interesting (than others of their kind) main characters. The issue is the drama. It's trying to hard to force drama and some great big power struggle, which would never, ever happen in any kind of high school. It's that kid in the 8th grade trying to act like an adult. It's pretending to be serious, mature and edgy. The only settings you MIGHT seeing something even remotely close to this is in some American Ivy League college. Not in some Japanese private school. Sure you might get some pretty hard core bullying or rich kids throwing money around, but you'll never see some billion dollar completely self sustainable campus. That is because there is no return. If you're going to try and force this kinda conflict down our throats, at least have it be a college / university. This kinda thing doesn't fly in a modern day setting. No way in hell is any country, or business entity going to blow literal billions of american dollars on HIGH SCHOOL. Not to mention a high school with a bunch of luxuries for pretentious teenagers. Things like malls, pools, luxury cruise ships, fucking islands. If you're going to try and be relatable through something like a school, keep the setting realistic. Otherwise you get that contrast of putting a Picasso next to fucking Jimmy who's failed to get a engineering degree and is now trying for an Art degree in modern painting. It's laughable,  and completely incompatible //Excuse the rhyme.\\n\\n\r\nThe next problem is the point system. There is literally zero risk involved in having zero points. The school gives out everything you need to survive for free at a no cost. Obviously it's not as nice as the higher priced things, but it's by no means inhumane or even of \"bad\" quality. The threats and repercussions of having zero points, and going against school rules seem to be non-existant. Everything that is a hard no in the school's rulebook get's brushed off by some bullshit teen logic or some all power Student Council. The only incentive to have higher points is for vanity and to ascend to 'A' class, which itself seems to have little incentive other than bragging rights and the aforementioned vanity.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the philosophy is down right pathetic and narcissistic. The first episodes opens up with the everlasting \"Are humans truly equal\" and then breaks into a poorly thought out monologue that the 14 year old high school kid posted on r/im14andthisisdeep. Each episode opens with some profound quote and then proceeds to have an episode completely unrelated to that quote. Every attempt this show makes at being profound, philosophical and mature breaks down to some poorly though out drama between 'D' class and their oppressors which has practically no relation to the quote at the beginning of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a travesty. And while I don't dislike them, this complaint encompasses each and every character in the show, including the main characters. All these characters, from class 'A' to class 'D' all fit some boring archetype or stereotypical image. They are completely flat in both dimension and character. They're boring to say the least. From having 6'10 pure muscle bald monks who act like Yakuza, to 5'3 big boobed redheaded airheads that are secretly evil back to 6'10 black men who only speak broken english. The characters are laughable. Everyone praising Ayanokouji as the second coming of Hachiman is wrong. The only relation they have is their intelligence. Ayanokouji is nothing more than your average self insert protagonist. Sure he's more enjoyable than your average lucky pervert harem protag, but he isn't any more complex or better written. Horikita on the otherhand is just a poor attempt at Yukinoshita. Her 'cold attitude' is actually a facade to cover up her incompetence regarding human relations, and her own emotions. Comparing Yukinoshita and 8man is like comparing a Porsche to a beetle. Yea they're both cars, but the difference is jaw dropping.\\n\\n\r\nThis story's pathetic attempt at stimulating intellect, refined philosophy, and exciting drama is down right insulting. This show started bad, got worse and ended horribly. It's a failure through and through.",

The story is mostly told\\n\r\n  through his Point of View and most of the important characters talk a \\n\r\n  lot about him in the story\\n\\n\r\n- he is a self insert main character, that utilizes machiavelistic tactics to get what he \\n\r\n  wants. Other than that he has a lot of elements of a Gary Stue. He is good at \\n\r\n  martial arts and always seems to be ahead of things, which reduces the tension in \\n\r\n  the story by quite the large margin.\\n\\n\r\n- Kushidas charaacter also has issues cause there is no explanation to the way she \\n\r\n  acts.\\n\\n\r\n- Horikita starts of strong, but becomes more unlikable as the season goes on. Also \\n\r\n  her motivation makes her look weak.\\n\\n\r\n- On the other hand Sakura feels like a generic character that you can find in every \\n\r\n  harem anime too.\\n\\n\r\n- antagonist characters like Katsuragi or Ryuuen are cliched to the point of being \\n\r\n   laughable, with no deeper motivation at all\\n\\n\r\n- Characters like Kouenji completly miss the point of what a comedic character is \\n\r\n   supposed to look like in a more serious setting.\\n\\n\r\n- Sudou is a generic troublemaker that mainly serves as a plot device to get the story \\n\r\n  going, however there is barly any explanation of who he got through the entrance \\n\r\n  exams or what a character like him does in an \"elite\" school.\\n\\n\r\n- other than those most of the side characters barly get any screentime and are not \\n\r\n  worth mentioning, the group dynamic of the characters is ok, yet predictable in a \\n\r\n  lot of ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 3/5\\n\\n\r\n- Songs for the Opening and Ending are quite catchy. Yet the visuals for both are \\n\r\n  heavily lackluster.\\n\\n\r\n- For the Opening we have mostly style over substance. A lot of random philosophic \\n\r\n  quotes paired with characters standing around in a well shot scene.\\n\\n\r\n- The Ending on the other hand is just lazy consisting of two images were one is an \\n\r\n  empty Classroom\\n\\n\r\n- The rest of the soundtrack is mostly forgettable, yet it still is in some scenes \\n\r\n  overbearing. The only scene were that worked for me was on Episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\n- uncreative character designs\\n\\n\r\n- female characters have too much fanservice, while male characters look mostly \\n\r\n  generic or overdesigned\\n\\n\r\n- There a lot of different backrounds and most of them are pretty solid. The lightning\\n\r\n   effects are mostly good too and the animation is fluent.\\n\\n\r\n- Some scenes and have specially colored lightning effects and they put a lot of effort \\n\r\n  into making the eyes of the characters stand out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/5\\n\\n\r\nOk now to sum up all the things that I said up and give a last insight. First this show is NOT like Oregairu, yet it TRIES to be like it. However in doing that it completly misunderstands the core elements of it. You can see this the most in the main character of Ayanokoji. He is more of a Tatsuya Shiba from The Irregular at Magic High School than a Hikkigaya Hachiman. The difference is here that Ayanokoji feels like someone that is above the entire cast so far. On the other hand Hikkigaya stood out through his alternitive view points, which made him different from the rest of the cast.\\n\r\nAlso through the entire show all the characaters felt more like they would come from a show like Asterisk War rather than Oregairu.\\n\r\nIn terms of storytelling I like the way the setting is meant to be a \"survival of the fittest\" type. Yet the comedy and the huge amount of fanservice ruin the serious nature of it. In the end I think Classroom of the Elite is a pseudo-intellectual bait show for people that do not understand the basics of storytelling or characterization. It can be a good time if you can identify yourself with the power fantasy which is the shows MC. If you don't you will have a hard time liking the show and I would not recommend it. In the end Classroom of the Elite is my disappointment of the season, \\n\r\nthat, after a solid start, got worse with each passing weak. \\n\\n",

            "content": "What if the most elite students in society were placed in one incredible intense school, pitted against each other to become the most elite student of them all? If this question even moderately intrigues you, then turn around because the Classroom of the Elite does not have any meaningful answer to it, in fact, it has nothing worthwhile to say at all.\r\nThis show is a head-shaking enigma, it proposes intriguing questions but never answers them, it feigns depth, and it pretends like the twists can't be predicted from miles away! At best you'll get some fleeting fun by watching \"elite\" high schoolers running around andsolving trivial issues, at worst your time will be wasted and your intelligence will be insulted. It excels at nothing and falls flat in more than a couple areas.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was a moderately interesting opener. Students who were considered the best of the best collected into one school, they were given full responsibility for a great deal of money awarded to them once a month. At the end of the first month, to the surprise of no one but the idiotic cast, the money was not replenished. Perhaps the show was trying to establish a theme of materialism, but if this was the truth then they failed to follow through with it. I wasn't sure if it was good when I first watched it, but I had hope that with more development it could become something special. The episodes flew by and my hopes were left unanswered. I suppose I\u2019ll have to delve into it eventually so I\u2019ll do it now, the story is simple and I didn\u2019t like any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe school is separated into 4 classes, A, B, C, and D; the best students being in class A, then the worst in D. The underdog class D was the one the story followed, and in the class was the narrator/protagonist Ayanokouji; a mild-mannered guy (with a mysterious past!!) who served as a relatable joke dispenser in the early episodes, then he was shuffled into the corner so the real focus could take center stage, the ladies. Whenever the other members of D class were developed it felt like the story's original conceit was growing less and less plausible; for a school that is meant to be strictly for the most elite students, it's full of a lot of idiots. Most of the issues Class D had were caused by the stupid mistakes of its students. Whenever a conflict was contrived to add tension it would simultaneously showcase the idiocy of the class and increase plot holes. Plot holes are really the least of this show's problems, it's sad I feel this way but my standards have been lowered due to the shitshow that was Summer 2017. Beyond the plot holes, most of the \"twists\" that occur in this show seemed unearned and the rest of them were unbelievably predictable. \\n\\n\r\nYou can make the argument that the characters were given traits; beyond that was nothing, all of them were one-dimensional. There are no characters in Classroom of the Elite I will ever think about after I finish the review. None of them resonated with me in the slightest, but that isn't enough to insult a person. Most of them are a single trait, stupid, shy, wise, bubbly, bland, but there were some who got characterized as sicko-perverts that were reminiscent of the appalling supporting cast of Hajimete no Gal (you really shouldn't want to be compared to a show like that but if that comparison excites you then, by all means, enjoy both shows). Anyways, there are some villains, they are your typical stoic and condescending types and they're in the classes above D. They're rarely on screen and only exist to add someone to root against and occasionally contrive tension from.\\n\\n\r\nIt was almost as if the writer intended to cross through every trope they possibly could on their way to the finale, and oh what a finale it was. \\n\r\nIt wasn't until episode 7 that I really understood the magnitude of this show's flaws; it was the obligatory fanservice episode. I don't have a problem with fanservice, this show is loaded with it and it was rarely intrusive until this one moment. The infamous episode starred some of the male supporting characters in the titular class D. They try to plant cameras in the girl's bathroom to spy on them and it is played off in a disconcerting and perverted way, but I can only assume they thought it would be funny and relatable high school humor? Who actually thought this would be a good idea for a tv show? (Based on the MAL score a frightening amount of people.)\\n\r\nThe supporting characters that led the infamous episode 7 were never funny and only succeeded in creeping me out, it was only made worse by the fact that they were followed throughout the episode and their gross conversations were being overlaid with fanservice shots at the pool. After those infamous 20 minutes, I could not watch the show without feeling cynical towards this disaster. Maybe I'm biased because I hated that episode so much, but I think my arguments still have value. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like I've said enough about the plot and characters so I'll briefly mention the sound and visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great! The song is awesome, character portraits fly in and out, quotes in random languages zip past the screen, it really was a joy to watch in the early episodes. However, as the episodes counted past I began to realize that the depth that the visuals alluded to would never be explored in the show. It's just another one of the show's gimmicks meant to draw in an audience and fool them into thinking the events transpiring onscreen are more interesting than they actually are.\\n\r\nMusic is also used throughout the show to make scenes feel weightier than they really are. For example; organs and a volley of stringed instruments can be heard over entirely random scenes that follow villains. The music sounds great, but it really loses power as it's used over and over to very weak effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is totally passable, nothing unique but not bad either. Characters look fairly simple, no outstanding designs, nothing to set them apart from one another, I struggled to remember their names. The student uniforms are generic and express nothing. Nothing about the school stands out visually beyond having a shopping mall within it. \\n\r\nLastly, a message to you, Classroom of the Elite, showing a random and loosely related quote every now and then does not make you profound, it just makes you pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.8/10\\n\r\n(Story 1/10) (Art 5/10) (Sound 6/10) (Character 0/10) (Enjoyment 2/10) \\n\\n\r\nClassroom of the Elite is a trope-laden failure that lacks any substance. It never makes an effort to tell a memorable story or create original characters, it\u2019s a corporate product that purely exists to sell Blu-rays and merchandise with its cast of cardboard cutout waifus.",

            "content": "let me start by saying I am caught up to the anime and this is also my first review.\r\ntruly I have seen a lot of mixed opinions on this anime, mainly concerning the characters(however I will get to that later).\r\nI will try to keep it spoiler free however just take my adivice and give atleast episodes 1-5 a watch....\r\nTrust me.\r\nAnywho,\r\nI'll begin with Art(9):\r\nThe art in Youkoso Jitsuryoku is great it does an especially great job on the colors it uses to portray its school setting and especially the way it decides to draw eyes. However, this is not really where in my opinion the showstands out.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7):\\n\r\nI have nothing to say but meh, to be honest, it is nothing more than decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10):\\n\r\nThe show begins in an odd way each character fulfills all tropes of the genre at first glance and purposefully does not suit the mood of the show overall, a darker vibe is always present in Youkoso Jitsuryoku and all characters are not what they seem to be. innocent characters have deeply rooted split personalities and the quiet type always seemingly has a more heart warming emotional side and to top it all of the main character seems to be the fakest and least genuine person in the whole series, however, we do not see his past rather we experience everything he does but with his pragmatic and philosophical twist on things.they are all genuinely interesting characters whose true personalities only unravel with time,\\n\\n\r\nStory(8):\\n\r\nAs of this time, i do not know how long Youkoso Jitsuryoku will be, however,\\n\r\nSo far it is strangely philosophical for an anime of its genre every episode starts off with a proverb maxim or a strange quote which seemingly makes no sense until you find out more about the characters, all of which are odd in their own right.not only by design but also due to the fact that they do not fit the rules this prestigious school has set out for them. Class D is meant to be broken toys or defects (and in reality, they are in terms of personality) however the mc purposefully tries to act a fool and the silent type is really someone who screwed up the entrance exam and is nothing short of a nerd in all honesty.\\n\r\nThe story so far has focussed on how the economics of the school works.\\n\r\nSaying that you are only given money to live based on \"merit\" and if u slack off u effectively have to eat raw veg and can't enjoy your life(As you have no money).Additionally, if u get below 50% of your classes grade you are expelled and this must be prevented at all costs as one of the main characters plans on getting into class A and can not do this without the whole of the class getting behind her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9):\\n\r\nThis animes diverse and twisted characters keep you on the edge of your seat through and through. additionally, the faint uneasiness that follows only adds to the comedy the side characters add to the story.\\n\r\nThis is truly a rollercoaster of well...\\n\r\nf3\u00a3k knows its just a mix of dark and quirky which has so much potential and gives a truly fresh take on the comedy/romance/school/drama genre.\\n",

A plot may seem to be as attractive as possible, a character may appear to be interesting for not following a common stereotype, but if they are not developed correctly, or at least, they are not well used in the universe that the same serie propose, then can\u2019t be said that they are good. This is the case.\r\nTwo things to keep in mind before continue reading:\r\n1. Minor spoilers ahead.\r\n2. This is an ANIME ONLY review.\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e, also known as \"Classroom ofthe Elite\", this name already summarizes us what the series is about: a prestigious school where only attends \"the best of the best\", students are separated by categories and where a point system is managed according to the test results, which are necessary to literally survive on this island/school. Of course the best class usually has most of the points, while the worst, that is, the D class (where the series focuses) have few or none, so the aim of these students is to improve on their exams for get more points and survive, even think ambitiously and try to get down to the other classes. If we ignore the fact that no one in the D class except the protagonist group was so smart to not see the obvious working of this system that promotes competitiveness and instead they all believed that they would receive 10.000 points at the end of the month just for their pretty faces (\u00bfis not it supposed to be a school of elites?), we have a plot that, on paper, sounds very good, and can give rise to a story with an interesting development.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other positive aspects, the animation is very good, has enough fluidity and is very colorful, the character design is generic but very well done (especially the design of the girls). The soundtrack is meh, not bad but it is very forgettable and were few times where highlighted, however, the serie has a good handling of audiovisual quality and a decent sound direction most of the time that knows how to make the few scenes where the sound is important (scenes of intrigue or \"revelations\") are able to impress and trap the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's up to this point where the only thing that I can speak well of the serie ends...\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow \u00bfwhat is the problem with this show, having an proposal with so much potential? Just the fact that they don't take advantage of that potential, and instead, the series focuses only on exposure: they show you the MC reflecting and understanding more how the system and the school works and acting when required, but not the reason of his acts, they show you several background characters moving as if they had some evil plan (\u00a1with background funeral music included!), but in the end little or nothing happens, they show you how their protagonists pretend to make their class rise range, but they are so rough that they don't even bother to relate to their classmates to carry out their class, which they show you as mere extras or victims for the protagonists to shine more. This is not a story of \"how the D class improves and rises in rank\", the protagonists go on their own march and the rest of the class cares little or nothing matters, and when the show tries to give them characterization or at least something of space on screen in the moments where they are important, it doesn't even do it well (Sudo, Ichinose, Sakura, the sensei, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect is that many of the arcs feel disconnected, contribute little or nothing, are unnecessary and in some cases is not explained how things were given (eg, the survival test), arcs that were only introduced to force the plot and the drama. With all this the central thread is lost, it's not known to what point the series will arrive or that pretends to show you in reality, everything ends up being boring and disinterested.\\n\\n\r\nThe serie pretends to be a serious and dark story, with issues of discrimination and arrogance on the part of high-ranking classes, people moving in the shadows and the D class being victimized by being the lowest link, but again, the series resorts to the exposure of this arrogance and this \"dark atmosphere\" (the upper classes bullying Sudo, Ryuuen punishments to the members of his \"gang\", the almost rape scene, the president machining things, the girl with the stick with the bald guy talking incoherently so that they seem to plan something \"interesting\", etc.), all in an exaggerated way and nothing subtle, to the point where the series ends up being immature, for not knowing how to handle such issues with the seriousness that is meritorious and instead uses them to pretend to be intellectual and interesting, or in the worst case, to \"shocking\" the viewer and thus disguise the poor writing and development of the serie and its characters, even shows you situations cliches and fanservice that not even the case.\\n\\n\r\nI have always said that it's not bad to have cliches and fanservice as long as you make use of them in a way that are acceptable to see, this is not the case \u00a1because even the fanservice is explicit! other series show you subtle scenes, fleeting or according to the situation: falls, wind raising skirts, rays of light coming out of nowhere, etc. Here they put the tits in the whole screen without more, without conceal, without having more nothing on the scene, not even people talking, and with no other goal but to do you fap with that. This creates a contrast to what the series shows, and instead of being serious and interesting, ends up being ridiculous. Basically the serie pretends to be something that it is not, it resorts to exposure to hide its failure of plot development and shows you exaggerated and unnecessarily explicit situations in an attempt to prove maturity and ends up being the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nPretentious, that's the word that describes the show. I know that this term is often used as a \"generic argument that people usually use to denigrate a job they do not like\" as some say out there, regardless of if it really applies or if those who use it know what really means, but I would not use it if in this particular case it doesn't apply, and does apply. With all that I mentioned before, the series insists that the same must be taken completely seriously, despite the great failures in development, despite their cliche characters and exaggerated situations to the point of ridicule, all this creates a great contrast to the heavy atmosphere. If I try to take it seriously, I can't, because the atmosphere is very forced and doesn't go according to everything that happens on the screen: arcs that contribute little or nothing, cliches in the middle of a plot that tries to be dark, irrelevant characters doing nonsense here and there and \"serious\" situations so anticlimactic and explicit that end up being simply stupid, so the seriousness that the show intends is not transmitted. And if I don't try to take it seriously, I can't either, because the plot tries to convince you that EVERYTHING that goes on screen including the most insignificant nonsense and the most exaggerated situation possible, is serious and dark, situations that obviously you can not take as such, and even try to put comedy, which is so dry, forced and simple that ends up being shameful and cringy. On more than one occasion I ended up banging myself on the keyboard of the embarrassment for such pathetic attempts to \"be comic.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother negative aspect is that the series does not know the term \"subtlety\": every time a situation occurs, they show it in the most crude, explicit and anticlimatic possible way:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Starting with the same plot. Being an elite school that seeks to form highly skilled people, a fairly realistic goal \u00bfis the competitive environment so exaggerated so necessary that even people are talking about \"destroying the other classes\"? \u00bfis necessary the discrimination? \u00bfare necessary the \"evil plans\" only to expel a single student? \u00bfis necessary a Btooom! style Survival Test in a high school with relatively normal students? Situations that have little or no place in the genres that the series handles are literally forcing the plot to generate dramatic situations that ultimately are nothing, because the development of the arcs is so random that they do not transmit what they want to show.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Horikita's traumatic past and the fact that she feels such inferiority to her brother that she literally changes character to script conveniences. Just as they show the brother as an almighty whose only presence is terrifying, and a sort of evil final boss who went so far as to almost hurt his sister to \"show her that she can never reach him.\" It is not necessary to exaggerate the situation to the extent that it is so unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The Kushida's revelation, who at one point changes from a loving and friendly girl to a soulless bitch, and the way she showed it was so cringy: screaming, flailing and threatening the MC with saying that he raped her if he reveal it, \u00bfare you serious? If you are going to show a dark side, at least do it maturely, otherwise, it's like something edgy and stupid.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The constant fights with the other classes, which they show as a kind of mafia that punishes its members when they don't fulfill their duties and always go for the most violent and problematic option possible, as if they were real criminals \u00bfWould not it be enough to show the friction between classes without wanting to make the whole situation happen as a kind of war between yakuzas?\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The Sakura's trauma with the potential stalkers, exaggerated to the point that they show a man like a sick and obsessive who almost raped her, which was not necessary to show his problem (just make it clear that she was being harassed and make the pertinent complaint was enough) and shows how the serie handles a serious subject in a very immature way, because of course, all men are disgusting that the first thing we do when we see the sexy photos of a girl is harass her to try to rape her... Also the fact that she is an excessively shy girl who shows her provocative photos both on the internet and in the middle of a serious trial to increase her confidence with herself, but then she implies that she \"doesn't like to show a lot of skin\" and it bothers her that they look at it in a \"lustful way\" \u00bfis not this a bit contradictory?\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the other aspect that ends up completely burying this series: the characters. I would like to remind you of what I said at the beginning: that something looks good on paper or looks different at first glance doesn't imply that it will be good. That the characters, mainly the protagonist, do not seem to be the common ones in this type of stories doesn't make them automatically good, in fact in this case, they are all lousy (some more than others). All are flat characters and completely inhuman but with a kind of \"plot twist\" to make them look more interesting and complex, complexity that doesn't really exist:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Ayanokouji, our protagonist, at first he looks like someone bored, but in reality he is someone analytical, who only observes what happens around him and he draws conclusions about it, plus he does not want to highlight. In this sense it is very similar to Hachiman, which is why many consider him a good character, and in fact sounds like a good approach \u00a1SURPRISE! it turns out that the guy is super smart but he gets mediocre ratings apparently on purpose, is an expert in hand-to-hand combat and just for being him, he is surrounded by how many girls who \"notice how special he is\" \u00bfwhy? The most silly excuse: he was a laboratory rat created to be perfect, and not people, show a flashback of his past is NOT characterization or character development if they do not show how he develops his way of being and think from this fact , which they never did, they simply said \"MC is perfect because like that he was created\", that's all. Based on the above the main problem arises with this character: he doesn't really have a background to make his actions coherent, and then you realize that it is not that he is boring, he simply has no personality, but even so the series doesn't waste opportunity to make him shine, since everything to him goes well, everyone talks about him, everything important involves him and seems to be the only character who thinks and acts rationally, basically a perfect example of a self insert character and a Gary Stu. He is with the same face always, immutable to everything that happens even his own actions \u00bfHow can I believe that the protagonist is living a tense situation (when the president confronts him, for example) if he doesn't express it? Besides, because he doesn't have personality or characterization, you don't know what really drives him to act, you can not take his actions seriously because what motivates him to act is basically non-existent. He only acts because the plot says so. He doesn't move the plot: the plot moves him. Even though he is not a bad character at all, his inexpressiveness makes it somewhat unpredictable (even though you know that Almighty MC-kun will always be there to save the day), which plays to his advantage, however that is not enough for make up for all the bad. And understand this for a good time: That a protagonist doesn't be your typical dense and rough MC does NOT automatically make him a good character, much less \"the best MC of the season\".\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Horikita is the typical elitist bitch who believes herself superior to the rest, despises the whole world because \"making friends is unnecessary\" and is all the time with her arms crossed to show superiority over \"scum\". Currently she is the one that really wants to raise the class despite treating their classmates as trash. \u00bfWhy? again, \u00a1SURPRISE! she also possesses a typical traumatic past (which is never explained), an apparent inferiority complex toward her brother, the student council president, and a lamentable desire to show him that she may be at his level, all in a pathetic attempt to make her see her not so rude and that you feel empathy for her. Then, the rude and super serious elitist who tries to do everything for herself (although she knows she should collaborate with others, which she never does) becomes a submissive to which the MC has to rescue, and a kind of tsundere badly made to justify his mood changes at the convenience of the script. She is the inconsistency made character... and speaking of conveniences of the script: it is funny how she does not trust anyone to believe that they all have a double face, but she fully trusts Ayanokouji who obviously hides many things (and even threatened her by gossip) just because \"he saved her\" when all he did was to be in the place indicated \"by casuality\" (that is, when the plot ordered him). Curiously she was the only one to have something vaguely close to a development (yes, THE ONLY ONE) as we saw how little by little she began to trust and appreciate her classmates more (although she is still rough). Apparently several of these scenes must have been from another character, and I saw a lot of people whining about that, but in fact this change was partly a success, mainly because the other character in question (Karuizawa) was never introduced correctly \u00bfwould not be something strange give too much space suddenly to a character we do not even know? Instead they gave more space to a previously established character, so it was not a bad decision at all. As a side note: that Senjougahara-style compass scene was very pathetic, and we don't talk about the tickle scene, a bad attempt to make it look more moe. I don't' mention the bathroom scene in Chapter 11 because it clearly was important to the plot \u00bfright?... \u00bf\u00a1right!?\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Kushida is the typical cheerful girl, with more breasts than brains who wants to be friends with everyone, but in such a sickly way that a lot of people, including me, find her annoying to see, but \u00a1SURPRISE! it turns out that the girl actually hid a kind of second, darker and manipulative personality, all in a very pathetic attempt to give complexity to the character and to \"shock\" the audience that perhaps did not expect that. \u00bfBut do you know what's the worst? That second personality was never explained, never showed the background and also had absolutely no impact on everything that happened in the rest of the show, so \u00bfwhat was it all for? A cheap way to make a character look interesting and keep people to the expectation. They literally sold smoke.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfNow you see why I said that such complexity does not exist? All characters are just cliches already seen with a plot twist that tries to fill the void of a real characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are not worth talking about. Sudo is the typical rude and troublesome boy, Ichinose is another less annoying Kushida, Sakura the typical excessively shy girl and complexed by his past and/or actions, Hirata the popular, kind and attentive guy (SURPRISE! He also seems to have a \"dark\" personality), the president the typical evil boss \"because yes\" who is even more elitist than his sister, Ryuuen the gang member, Ibuki the Rem\u2014 I mean, the submissive dependent without personality, Arisu the mysterious loli THAT DID NOTHING, etc. \u00bfDo you see how all can be described in a single sentence? The worst thing is that no one was given some space even to know them and that they come to import, in fact, in their respective arcs they were treated more as victims or plot devices than as characters \u00bfand do you pretend I take all your plot seriously with that cast of characters?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogues and the interaction between the characters are almost as bad as themselves. To name one of many examples: Chapter 4 was particularly stupid, another \"friendly girl\" of another class receives a love letter, but since she doesn't know what love is, she makes the only \"logical\" choice she has: Asks MC, with which she hasn't crossed more than 10 words before, that he pretends to be his boyfriend to reject the girl who sent her the letter... \u00bfdo you realize how contradictory and senseless it all sounds? How many cliches in such a forced situation, literally a beautiful girl with big tits fell from the sky to the MC without personality of turn and asked him to be her boyfriend \"because yes\" so that in the end he gave a sermon to her and he remains as a mature guy... a complete situation of self-insertion that also adds little or nothing to the development of the series (like almost everything else up to that point). Then in chapter 5 we have the almighty MC advising a \"shy girl\" to be honest with herself and only with these simple words that anyone could say is enough to make her fall in love, from this point this character (whose excessive shyness is FREAKING ANNOYING, \"Best Girl\" my balls) only dedicated to fanservice by trying romantic approaches with the MC... Ah, and let's not forget in Chapter 11 when the MC tells Ibuki that he trusts her and immediately she falls in love with these \"Pretty words\" like a whole Rem\u2014 submissive dependent \u00a1Of course he is not a self-insert! Similar situations happened throughout the series, which are summarized in boring dialogues and sometimes so edgys and out of place that give pity, and relationships so forced that feel false, the characters are not related naturally, but because the plot says.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSeriously \u00bfWhy do you praise series like this and score them so high? At this point more than one will think that I am a bitter, but if you look at my list you may notice that I am someone of simple and irreverent tastes, and doesn't prevent me to enjoy series like this or any other series that even I may consider bad, but in this particular case, when the flaws are so conspicuous, the plot pretends to be taken so seriously by putting such ridiculous and stupid situations that it is impossible to do so, development is disastrous and the characters are so horrible and poorly characterized, even with low demands (because it would be idiotic to expect a \"Mushishi\" or a \"Rakugo\" from series like these, right? The correct thing for these genres is to lower the requirement to have something at least enjoyable) the same mediocrity of the series prevents you from enjoying it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis BY FAR IS NOT AOTY. And no, it's not that \"the show started good and became bad in its second part\", the series already started bad and became worse with the passing of the chapters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will end with a phrase that summarizes this anime: that something looks good on paper or looks different at first glance, doesn't imply that it will be good.\\n",

            "content": "Basically, if anyone has seen Oregairu then you will probably see the parallels. in fact, as someone who has seen Oregairu, and liked it, I see more than parallels - I see a ripoff. Except it isn't a good ripoff - by making the protagonist hyper-competent he can't Hachiman (pretend not to care and play scapegoat at the same time) his way through the story, and that takes a lot away from the narrative. In fact, the protagonist Ayanokouji reminds me most of Kirito - a soul-less, personality-deprived screen for an anxious otaku to project themselves onto. the two main girls - Horikita and Kushida,play the roles of Yukino and Yui from Oregairu, respectively, and fail to varying degrees, but I cannot elaborate on why because that would be a spoiler (who cares though?). \\n\\n\r\nAnother show this reminds me of is Hyouka, where they also have detective work in school. except that there, it is done in a very classically Sherlockian fashion (with references to the works of Conan Doyle and other great detective authors) and it looks insane. here, it's just plain bullshit because they gloss over all the details that actually make a detective subplot fun and go straight to the artificial drama that this show is awfully fond of. \\n\\n\r\nAnother similar show to this one is this season's Kakegurui - both are set in an elite school, both have a cast of obnoxious and unnecessarily-dicky characters, both have red uniforms and both have fan service. except Kakegurui is a cock-tease with a gambling twist and it flaunts this shamelessly at every chance it gets, while this show aspires to being intelligent in the same way that the BBC version of Sherlock does. and it doesn't work. because telling the audience that the story is smart doesn't make it so - as an author, you have to show it. \\n\\n\r\nthis show's usage of pretentious quotes reminds of Call of Duty 4, except that they're a little less out-of-place here, but, of course, the series fails to make full use of the opinions of great historical thinkers.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has been to a boarding school I find the premise of this show just plain retarded. shutting people off from the outside world for THREE YEARS is a terrible idea - they will begin to view their artificial world as the real world, and you don't want that. what you would get in that case would be \"elite\" assholes who would know nothing about how the world really works, and hence be completely inept once they graduate. no meritorious university would want to touch these people with a 3 metre pole. and not giving them the rulebook? why? to create some contrived hoops for characters to jump through to increase the runtime? I must say I'm not hopeful.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen 4 episodes so far and I don't like how bored I am of it, but I have recently found that I am more entertained by bad anime than I am by good anime, so I fully intend to finish this one. who knows, maybe this \"elite\" classroom can surprise me.",

            "content": "\u201cAre human beings truly equal?\u201d\r\nUsing a pretentious question as an opener is common in Light Novel adaptations. It's a fast way to both grab the attention of the inexperienced viewer and to introduce the general intentions of the show. However, questioning the equality of the entire human race is a comical idea. The question itself only functions as a rhetorical question and even then, you gain nothing from the inevitable \u201cno\u201d as an answer. It is a question that serves no purpose, a problem that is reflected throughout the show\u2019s entire runtime. Unfortunately, the problems don\u2019t end there. Welcome to the Classroom of the Eliteis not just a show that suffers from purposelessness but also from a poorly constructed setting and plot, a less than stellar presentation and from being bound to generic LN formulas.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nWhile I might already have voiced my opinion on the initial quote, I have to give credit where it\u2019s due. Unlike many other LN adaptations that also start off with some vapid quote, Elite Classroom chose one that actively represents one of the key parts of its own setting: Assigning students monetary worth through points based on merit, and dividing the classes by said merit. This is where the first glaring issues pop up. Now, leaving the whole classes can only advance as a unit thing (which is stupid) aside, the point system is inherently flawed. Reason for that is the sheer universal usage of said points, they can basically be used to buy anything you need: Games, gold teeth, a deluxe meal, you name it. There are close to no boundaries, it goes as far as being able to not only buy old tests from upperclassmen (which are exactly the same as the ones you\u2019ll have), but even test score points. This creates several problems: tests you can buy from upperclassmen have several times the worth of the price, as they guarantee a significant growth in your own monthly points which paired with buying test points makes it impossible to drop out of school because of said test scores - a threat that just in the beginning was announced with much fanfare. Apart from promoting to a higher class, the points seem like they barely matter. Premium meals may cost more and you won\u2019t be able to live a king\u2019s life, sure, but it seems like whether or not you have many points doesn\u2019t make much of a difference. You can still visit the school leisure pool, and I\u2019m sure there are other free activities on campus, too. The sheer absence of tutoring upperclassmen, people selling used products on student markets or similar events and the like make it feel as if the setting and its rules weren\u2019t thought through and make the whole school seem lifeless. There are also some rules which seem to have been added in hindsight because the plot demands it. If you have someone\u2019s device number (Phone number? Seemed like it was some kind of machine all students get?), you can search their location via GPS. Because nobody could possibly have a problem with not just the school but every student that knows your whateveritis number being able to learn of your whereabouts whenever they feel like it. Also there are security cameras. But some buildings have none. Because plot reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe school itself is also poorly realized. It is funded by the Japanese government in order to nurture the future elites of the nation. Scratch that, they aren\u2019t just funding the school, they are blowing about half of their nation\u2019s wealth at the school: A gigantic mall plus employees, a luxus ship cruise, a fucking island. They somehow have the money for all of that (and more) and still make positive returns, which seems nigh impossible considering who these supposed \u201celite students\u201d are. If you forgot that the school in this show is supposedly the top school in all of Japan, I don\u2019t blame you. It mostly feels like just an average school academically apart from the utter morons that are Class D. Now, I get that they are supposed to be the lowest class, but please. This is the single top school in all of Japan and there are people failing tests although they know exactly what questions will be in the test? Some of them are on the top school in Japan to play sports? Attempted rape, frequent violence between students, heck Class C is a group of organized delinquents. Don\u2019t even get me started on that 20-something year old black man that can only speak the most basic and broken english. It\u2019s like the setting itself is treated like an afterthought just 2 episodes in. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that\u2019s treated like an afterthought is creating an opportunity to get invested in the show. The main reason for that being the characters we could possibly get invested in that, sadly, all without exception are no more than the mere prescription of a \u201cfictional character\u201d. They are neither relatable nor likable. In a story like this you\u2019d want well-developed, human and likable characters with well-constructed motivations so you can root for them, but the show instead presents you with an empty shell of a human being as a main character and another multitude of characters that consists - without exception - of character tropes that you\u2019ve already seen more times than you can count, but with a \u201ctwist\u201d added to them. These twist are also treated like an afterthought for the rest of the show, seemingly randomly reappearing as if the author forgot they even exist. It feels like they are just a superficial way to create a feeling of depth and complexity when it isn\u2019t actually present, they are played like cliffhangers and then never expanded upon and it just grows even more frustrating every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji as the main character makes any possible investment in the show incredibly difficult. While he was commonly compared to Hachiman from Oregairu, that comparison is like comparing a highly modern army jet to a pedestrian. Ayanokouji at his very core is just another boring self-insert protagonist, albeit not as annoying as the irritatingly popular whiny harem protagonists. Not only is he incredibly smart, skilled in martial arts and literally another \u201clab rat\u201d, his absolute skill earns him the respect and affection of every major character in the show. Be it the hottest girls in his class, the student council president or even teachers. Everyone wants a piece of the Ayanokouji. While first presented as a snarky, judgemental cynic, he quickly devolves into just another LN wish fulfillment protagonist with nearly unlimited powers. Powers so incredible they can bend our very perception of reality and reason (because it totally makes sense that you can constantly monitor the whereabouts of any students whose number you have, especially if that solution is presented the first time AFTER you\u2019ve already used it. Nice Deus Ex Machina, Aya).\\n\\n\r\nAs is tradition, the reasons for the female characters\u2019 affection towards him is the result of several arrays of coincidences.\\n\\n\r\nCase 1: Ayanokouji is just casually taking a walk in the evening when suddenly he sees Horikita and her brother beating her. Being the distant and self-serving dude he is, Ayanokouji quickly rushes in to save her, displaying his high proficiency in both martial arts and witty one-liner responses in the process. Over the course of the series, Horikita gradually grows to like Ayanokouji, or rather gets increasingly \u201cjealous\u201d of other girls spending time with him or being treated well by him. While the conflict between Horikita and her brother is underlyingly present throughout early parts of the show, it quickly gets neglected and serves only as momentary shock instead of as a part of a meaningful narritive.\\n\\n\r\nCase 2: Kushida forgets her phone and Aya is fast enough to see the elevator Kushida took descending, although it should be ascending. He follows her and of course just when he arrives, Kushida first unleashes her \u201cother personality\u201d. Kushida stays around Ayanokouji because she doesn\u2019t trust him to keep this secret, although there is no reason for him to tell anyone and he has nothing to gain from it. Kushida then grows to like him over the course of their less than healthy relationship, but her \u201csecond personality\u201d, how it came to be and why its existence is important is never explained. This is a trend.\\n\\n\r\nCase 3: Not only is there an entirely random fan of Sakura in the shop she visits to have her camera repaired, he also is a crazy, delusional stalker. When he sees Sakura alone in the mall, he follows her. Sakura, being the highly intelligent elite school student she is, quickly runs into the darkest alley possible and the dude tries to rape her. Ayanokouji again saves the day using Sakura's GPS location which is somehow possible because he has Sakura\u2019s whateveritis number, a concept which only gets introduced in hindsight. Sakura, having been saved from rape of all the things that could possibly happen in a tightly secured elite school, falls in love with her savior. Not only is rape used for its shock value, but also to create a feeling of affection. It\u2019s horribly executed and terribly cheap and distasteful.\\n\\n\r\nHaving characters you can get invested in and root for is detrimental to the story that Elite Classroom is trying to tell. In this fierce competition for class points, we have to grow to like the students in the class we are supposed to root for. For there to be any stakes in this story,  the goal to reach class A needs to be supported by a strong cast of characters and for expulsion to feel like a real threat, we need to first be invested enough in the characters to not want them to face expulsion. Expulsion, unlike quickly disproven by the point system\u2019s flaws, must be strictly carried out for it to feel like the potential and everpresent danger that it is supposed to be. Elite Classroom accomplishes neither of both and thus turns from a potential engaging experience into a boring slog that just keeps dragging on forever. This, however, is not the only shortcoming of EC\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first half of EC can be summarized as \u201cmessy school shenanigans with Ayanokouji\u201d, this does not apply to the second half. What it is, however, is the figurative aftermath of shit hitting the fan. The shit is all over the place. We go from a plot twist at the end of episode 6 instantly to a pool fanservice episode and a mission to peek on girls in the changing room, then jump on a luxus cruise to a survival island. On that island we get to see thrilling mysteries like whodunnit - panty thief edition. Great. Ayanokouji\u2019s backstory, him being an ex-lab rat and all, sometimes gets thrown into the mix in the form of flashbacks, instead of, you know, actually developing that even remotely interesting storyline that could provide a commentary of Nietzsche\u2019s idea of the \u00dcbermensch. We get students horsing around on a survival island that they could just leave any time they feel like instead. Honestly, at times it feels like the original author hasn\u2019t even read a [insert name of any of the episode titles authors\u2019] 101. I\u2019m by no means an expert on philosophy but so many opportunities to provide a quality product are wasted on instead focusing on generic and pointless LN filler.\\n\\n\r\nThis contrast of the supposed smart story and characters and the generic LN formulas it is presented in is also reflected in the series overall presentation. It is hard to take a supposedly serious and smart story seriously if almost all of the main female characters have breasts as large as soccer balls and they are repeatedly the focus of the camera. If you act like you can present a mature take on authoritarian education, society and social mobility, why bother with an episode of losers trying to record girls changing with hidden cameras and act as if that\u2019s funny to anyone smart enough to grasp the former concepts? The episode titles at times get so tryhard they use the quote \u201cAbandon all hope, ye who enter here\u201d for the introductory episode of the island arc, a place that you can leave whenever and where the worst result you could get is not gaining extra points. If anything, the quote seems to address the viewer, because anyone who genuinely believed the series could overcome the hurdle that is forgetting the previous fanservice episode should by now also have lost hope for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\n I will admit that I am by no means the target audience of this show. Elite Classroom is just another rendition of the generic high school LN adaptations that have some spacey plot later on in the novels which you will obviously not see in the anime. If you, unlike me, are not yet fed up with these fast-food-LN adaptations and think adding a certain \u201csmart and serious\u201d spin to said formula is an interesting take on the genre, EC will by all means satisfy you. To me however, watching this show was more of a chore than anything. I find these archetypical LN stories to be both boring and bland, and EC is no different, but with an additional stamp of \u201cfailed attempt\u201d on top.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the Classroom of the Elite is a failure. The weak, badly written plot forces generic LN formulas into its narrative which makes the serious \u201csmart\u201d tone of the show seem pretentious. The setting is poorly constructed and its rules are so full of holes they contradict the story\u2019s goal and make investment into the show nigh impossible. The characters are walking tropes and for the most part unbelievably unlikable. While there were some few good attempts at foreshadowing and some okay dialogue (although most of it seems unnatural and forced), they aren\u2019t even close to enough to make watching this show worth your time and as such I cannot recommend watching this show unless you are a High School Light Novel enthusiast.",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Youkoso and while care has been taken to minimize story spoilers there may be spoilers in character analysis   \r\nIn Society are humans really treated equally or are they treated according to the standards in society \r\nBased off a well-known light novel series of the same name Youkoso gives us the opportunity to ask one of the fundamental questions that most teenagers would ask as they enter High school. In society are all human beings treated equally and does this by introducing us to a prestigious high school that has an impressive recordof providing excellent students for society. The first episode itself made a pretty good impression on me and looking back at it im glad that I decided to stick with it to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in near future Japan the anime is centered on Koudo Ikusei senior high school a well-known and prestigious high school that was created by the government to help nurture and develop the next generation into skilled adults that will benefit the country. Having both state of the art facilities and freedom unknown to high school students the school can be said to be a paradise but this is far from the truth.  But while having the best of facilities at their disposal the pressure that the school puts on its students that it sees as its lifeblood is intense and far more than what one would expect in a normal school. For the students that are lucky enough to get admitted into this prestigious school they must work twice as hard as their grades while also defining them also affect the amount of points that they get each month. In this school, full of elite student\u2019s competition, subtle plans and mind games are rife where every mistake can cost you points or worst cause the whole class to be punished. In this environment where classes see each other as mortal enemies only those with conviction, creativity and adaptability can hope to survive and prosper. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Youkoso follows the life of Kiyotaka Ayanokouji a high school freshman that upon the start of the school year finds himself assigned to the schools Class D the lowest class of the school\u2019s class system and widely regarded as the worst class and seen as a dumping ground where the school sends people that it has believed that it cannot control but cannot expel without good reason. Here he is joined by an intense and quiet girl named Suzune Horikita an ice queen that aspires to join the prestigious class A and Kikyou Kushida a popular and cheerful girl that\u2019s widely seen as the class idol. Together these three and the class must do what they can to survive in the intrigue\u2019s that take place between the classes.  \\n\\n\r\nKiyotaka \\n\\n\r\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji voiced by new voice actor Shouya Chiba is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school freshman that in the beginning of the series was assigned to Class D Kiyotaka from initial appearances was a person that was quiet, laid back and indifferent and is someone that seems to be prefer to remain in the background and not draw attention to himself.  Despite his moody and rather indifferent nature Kiyotaka is shown to be someone that can be responsible and kind and is shown to care a great deal about his friends and allies. Though not someone that has a sense of justice in him Kiyotaka is someone that hates seeing people that he knows being out in danger and would try to help them when that happens. While seemingly laid back and indifferent towards others it is noted that Kiyotaka when he becomes serious and motivated can come up with some really interesting and smart ideas that make use of his good perception skills and showcase one of his more prominent traits which is his cunning. Despite his averse to getting involved in troublesome situations Kiyotaka is shown to be very good at dealing with and managing various difficult situations which is an interesting trait about him that hints at his true personality. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Kiyotaka and the members of his class deal with one crisis after another it becomes clear that beneath his normal self Kiyotaka also has a personality that he hides and conceals from the others including his friends. In this personality which is perhaps his true one Kiyotaka\u2019s personality is drastically different from the one that he normally exhibits. In this personality Kiyotaka is shown to be a calculating and manipulative person and also a smart one that is not above using people for his own ends. In this personality Kiyotaka\u2019s strong intelligence and observational skills that he had to keep hidden in his default personality is now much more visible and more readily used when Kiyotaka gets serious. As a character, I felt that Kiyotaka was an interesting character whose dual nature in the form of his two different personalities are what actually define him. The contrast between the two different personalities I felt were well done and while some of the traits of the two do pass between the two personalities from time to time like his fast thinking nature it\u2019s when we see Kiyotaka in his true personality that his character truly shines. While Kiyotaka may have villainous tendencies due to his manipulative personality it\u2019s important to note that this is a result of having an in-depth knowledge and understanding of how the real world actually works. Overall the character of Kiyotaka I felt was a well-designed one that showed that careful observation and rational decisions along with a little manipulation can ensure that what they all hold dear can be protected. I felt that Shouya Chiba actually did an excellent job in his first main roles for me. \\n\\n\r\nSuzune \\n\\n\r\nSuzune Horikita voiced by new seiyuu Akari Kito is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A 16-year-old high school freshman and a member of class D Suzune is a quiet, well-mannered but distant person at the start of the series.  In the beginning Suzune exhibited the classic ice queen type personality that\u2019s commonly seen in animes. In addition to exhibiting the quiet and unapproachable nature that\u2019s the key point of the ice queen persona Suzune in the beginning was also a thorny person that preferred to act using her own judgement than rely on others showing that she was also someone that did not trust others easily. In the beginning Suzune also had a rather curious view on friendship in that she did not see a need for it in the beginning. As a result of her ice queen like personality Suzune in the beginning was seen by many within the class as something akin to an oddball and not widely trusted by her classmates. Indeed, at this point in time she was also the same as well as she regarded friendship and bonds with something akin to disdain. As the series goes on though thanks largely to the efforts of Kiyotaka and Kikyou Suzune\u2019s personality gradually starts to change as the class begins to suffer from assaults from other classes. Though reluctant at first Suzune gradually becomes friendlier to others but still keeps a certain distance from others. Though still dismissive about friendships Suzune begins to understand that friendship and unity within the class will be important if they were to endure within the school and starts to care more about her classmates advising and helping them when needed until she is satisfied that they are safe.  In this we can see that Suzune\u2019s starting ice queen personality gradually starts to be thawed out as she begins warming to several of her classmates and trusting them the most prominent of them being Kiyotaka.\\n\\n\r\n As Suzune\u2019s ice queen personality thaws her true personality eventually is gradually revealed to us. While still quiet and preferring to stay logical Suzune is shown to be a very determined person that also has great conviction and is not the type of person that will back down from arguments especially when engaged in arguments with others. Suzune is also shown to have very good decision making and analytic skills that when combined with her excellent perception skills make her formidable in defending the class in meetings. Suzune\u2019s most prominent trait without a doubt is her truthful and direct nature in that she is someone that hates being dishonest and unlike Kiyotaka can be relied upon to state the cold hard facts of something quite readily. Despite being a very determined and strong person from initial appearances beneath that mask it can be said that Suzune is actually the opposite in that she\u2019s lonely and vulnerable and wants to rely on someone that she can trust. Within the series this acts as the main focus for the relationship that Suzune has with Kiyotaka which is also one of the main parts of the shows story. Though their relationship started off rather poorly over the course of the series their relationship gradually improved and Kiyotaka become one of the few people that Suzune trusted. As a character, I felt that Suzune was a well-designed character that showed some excellent character development as the series went on and in the process becoming one of my favourite characters. The gradual change from an ice queen to someone that stood as one of the best defenders of Class D I thought was a change that was well designed. I felt that her seiyuu Akari Kito really did an excellent job portraying the character of Suzune in one of her first main roles. \\n\\n\r\nKikyou \\n\\n\r\nKikyou Kushida played by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of High School Fleet and Urara Meirochou fame is one of the main characters of the series and is a classmate of Suzune and Kiyotaka. A 16-year-old girl and a high school freshman Kikyou is a kind, positive and well-mannered girl that\u2019s kind to everyone that she meets and is widely regarded by many to be the class idol within the class. A considerate and understanding person Kikyou has a very direct personality and seems to be someone that values friendship and bonds quite highly as she cares a great deal about each one of her friends deeply. However, while she appears to be a simple-minded girl that\u2019s not well versed in manipulation beneath his mask of hers is a different personality that Kikyou hides from the others. Underneath the angle like personality that she presents to outsiders Kikyou surprisingly has another personality that is radically different to her surface one. \\n\\n\r\nIn this Kikyou\u2019s personality though still direct is very rude and is not afraid of voicing her true feelings about other people directly. She\u2019s also shown to be quite manipulative and quite capable of using blackmail and lies to force people to obey her. Despite this radical change in personality it\u2019s interesting to note that this side of her isn\u2019t exactly evil by nature but rather seems to be a protective measure that was created to protect her from harm. Perhaps more so than in her default personality Kikyou seems to be in great fear of being isolated and being lonely.  The character of Kikyou Kushida I felt was an interesting character that while supportive of the main characters and to the class emphasized one of the main themes of this anime quite well. The theme being that everyone wears a mask in society. The contrast in her personality I felt was interesting as was her relationship with Kiyotaka. I felt that her seiyuu Yurika Kubo did an excellent job in portraying her.  \\n\\n\r\nHonami \\n\\n\r\nHonami Ichinose played by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Asterisk Wars and In a world God only knows fame is one of the main support characters and is one of Kiyotaka and Suzune\u2019s main allies in the series. A 16-year-old girl and high school freshman Honami differs from the two in that she\u2019s actually a member of one of the classes that actually form the school class B in particular. Despite being from another class though Honami bears none of the malice and hatred that other students in the school have towards class D and instead treats them equally and with respect. A cheerful, positive and honest person Honami can be said to be Class B\u2019s version of Kikyou as their personalities are very similar to each other. Kind, caring Honami is someone that seems to wear her heart on her sleeve being kind and caring towards everyone that she meets regardless of whether they belong to her class or to others. Her kind and caring personality ensures that within her own class to which she acts as leader that there are no fights between classmates and that everyone treats each other with respect thus also ensuring that they won\u2019t start fights with other classes. Though a rule bound person by nature Honami is also shown to be flexible with rules and will happily bend them if it means that she can help someone in need. Though kind and caring in normal mode she\u2019s shown to be stern and unforgiving to people that threaten her fellow students and openly despises people that do so.  Honami I felt was an interesting character in that unlike the rest of the cast she did not seem to have a mask and her base personality appears to be genuine. Her attempts to help the members of class D with their plans I felt was a good indication of cooperation that can take place between classes. Nao Touyama I felt did an excellent job in her portrayal of Honami. \\n\\n\r\nAiri\\n\\n\r\nAiri Sakura voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Digimon Adventure Tri and Aoki Hagane No Arpeggio Ars Nova Cadenza fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a classmate of Kiyotaka. A 16-year-old high school freshman Airi is a kind, quiet and timid girl that in the beginning of the series preferred to remain in the background and avoid getting involved in other people\u2019s affairs. Though kind and well-mannered in the beginning of the series Airi wrestled with the distinct problem of having low self-esteem which made her jittery and prone to becoming nervous when people talk to her which manifested in her attempts to defend her personal space rather determinedly. As the series goes on it becomes clear that Airi like many other characters on the show actually has another side to her that\u2019s just as unexpected as the others in that she was a model of some renown within her world. This mask of hers which is similar to Kikyou\u2019s I felt was interesting as it grew out of her desire to avoid being lonely while at the same time being able to help those that may be in similar states to her. After a particular drastic event in the series Airi\u2019s personality gradually starts to change becoming more open with herself while also trying to be more confidant in herself and more importantly trying to get to know people that helped her. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character I felt that Airi was an interesting one in that her struggle for equality was on a more personal level than other characters and was based on Airi\u2019s innate personality traits notably her quiet and timid nature. The decision to use a model as an alternate side to her personality I felt was a good move as models in addition to showcasing products can also serve to help other people by their modelling as well. I felt that Mao Ichimichi did an excellent job in portraying the character of Airi.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV (Animation &Arts/Music and Voice)\\n\r\nIn terms of art I felt that the design of the school and its attendant facilities was done pretty well and indeed the school did give the feel of being similar to a small town or outlet rather than a high school. The uniform designs for the school I felt were also well designed and looked pretty smart as well. Character design I felt was also pretty good with each character being unique and well designed.  In terms of animation I felt that animation was clear and beautifully detailed. In terms of music I felt that the series had a pretty good opening and ending themes with the ending being particularly strong. Voice acting for the series I felt was superb with Kiyotaka\u2019s voice actor Shouya Chiba and Suzune\u2019s seiyuu Akari Kito deserving particular praise for their portrayal of their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Youkoso was an interesting anime that had as its main strengths an interesting premise, story, characters and the underlying themes of society that it tries to address. The main premise of this show is of course the prestigious high school that the main characters attend in the story. The school while seemingly perfect both in terms of facilities and reputation is only a facade for within it hides a very strict school system where a student\u2019s performance in their studies and exams determine their worth to both the school and to society. To reinforce this system the anime makes use of an interesting system that serve to underline the central purpose of this school. The system is an interesting concept in itself in that it acts both as a central resource for the everyday needs of the students but also an objective for the students for failure to do well in the school will see the number of points that they gain every month lessen.  The idea to make this system a combination of not just a currency that can be used but also an indication of how much worth the school see\u2019s in both the class and the students within was an interesting move and tied in well with the school\u2019s unique culture. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the series main themes is that of equality which is best shown in not just the division of students into classes but also in the number of masks that characters must adapt as part of their personalities to exist in society. When combined with the personalities of characters that appear to be kind and unassuming on the surface the masks aspect works well to add more depth to the characters. This aspect of the anime itself I felt was pretty interesting. While the struggles between the classes served to highlight the differences in status between the classes with lower letter ones being superior to the higher letter ones and best seen in the disdain that class A and C members have for class D. Whats interesting is that the this isn\u2019t repeated in all areas as Honami and Class B shown in their interactions with Class D showing that in the end it\u2019s the question of perception. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series also plays a part in dealing with the theme of equality in that it pits the members of class D widely regarded by the school as outcasts against a school who is determined to make things difficult for them. This struggle against great odds by a class of misfits that make use of a variety of tactics to even the field to give them a better chance of victory I felt only serves to make this anime that much interesting. Watching Kiyotaka and Suzune work together to counter the plans of the other classes and the school sure was fun to watch. Overall Youkoso was an interesting anime that had not just an interesting premise and a great story but also great characters that it used to tackle a number of interesting themes that are really relevant in society and in terms of final score I think it definitely deserves a 10 in my books. The only lament that I felt about this anime was that it was only a half season so we aren\u2019t able to see more of what Kiyotaka\u2019s true personality is like. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not claiming to be a veteran when it comes to watching anime, but I've seen enough where viewing shows with a typical high school setting just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Of course a lot of the shows in this genre come with a twist or two, and Classroom of the Elite is no exception. However just because an anime uses the classic school life formula doesn't mean that it will be successful. While it's true that some shows are able to effectively pull off the school life setting, lesser anime, like Classroom of the Elite, fail right from the get go.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode one dives right into explaining the setting and sets up the general story of the anime. Viewers learn that the school in which the characters are attending is a special academy where students are divided into four classes based off of skill and other criteria that is never really discussed (you'll soon learn that the lack of a proper explanation for things is a reoccurring theme with this anime). Unsurprisingly, the two protagonists, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji and Suzune Horikita, are put in class D, the lowest ranking class. The story is supposed to be about their rise from the bottom to the top of the academy's hierarchy, but there's one major problem; They make relatively no progress toward achieving this goal throughout the course of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into more detail on this, let me explain an unique plot element that the author introduced for the anime: a point system. These points are given to students and represent multiple things, including currency and class ranking. The students lose points for bad grades, behavior, etcetera and earn them by achieving various things, many of which are unexplained. Points are allocated after each month, and one of the first twists in the anime is that class D failed to earn any points after their first month at school (pfft. What losers), thus throwing them into a state of turmoil. Now this system could have been used in so many ways that would have easily benefited the plot of the anime. However the distribution of these points is so convoluted and rarely touched upon that in the latter portion of the anime I felt like their importance completely vanished. Characters would just go up to a chart and say things like \"Oh look, our class has X points and the others have Y points. Cool.\" and then move on. The few exceptions are when Ayanokouji actually uses the points in an inventive manner to do things like purchase old test answers and boost the grade of a classmate's exam. Unfortunately, the point system wasn't nearly as explored as it should have been, and it failed to reach its full potential.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I said that the goal in this anime (at least from what I could discern) was for the core cast to strive to become the best in the school? While its true that class D (with the exception of  Ayanokouji at first) desperately want to rise to the top, we rarely see anything significant done by them in order to achieve this goal. At one point Horikita gave a commanding speech in which she warned the other classes to look out for class D. From my perspective, this was just an empty threat. In fact, more often then not, the anime showcases the members of class D struggling to simply earn any points at all much less hoping to compete against their rivals. The anime constantly presented us with many \"tough\" scenarios that were supposed to leave viewers impressed with the protagonists for finding creative solutions to them. The problem is that many of these situations were too lackluster for me to even care about them in the first place. These mediocre events ranged from trying to have everyone in the class pass an exam without failing miserably to finding a panty thief. There are literally no stakes, and this was deleterious to the anime's success.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, I did sort of like Ayanokouji and Horikita.  Ayanokouji's casual and disinterested attitude was sort of refreshing, and his along with Horikita's social ineptitude was interesting, especially when they were forced to interact with other characters. Now the primary issue that I had was that both of them have a similar personality. They're both social outcasts who have a hard time fitting in with the rest of the class. Granted, they each posses differing views on things like friendship and whatnot, but it sometimes got really boring hearing both of them talk to each other in their monotone voices all the time. Also, they each hardly interacted with the other characters (Horikita more than Ayanokouji) unless they were forced to, which left the rest of the cast terribly underdeveloped. To compensate for this, the producers would give the other characters (most notably Kikyou Kushida) random quirks in order to make them seem more interesting. This ultimately failed because I didn't really care for the characters too much in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the budget went into eyes and fanservice. The characters' eyes always seem to shine bright with vibrant splotches of color. While high in detail, the focus on irises makes everything else seem lazily designed in comparison. The only exception to this is when a character is used for fanservice appeal. During these sacred moments, the characters' bodies suddenly gain a ton of depth, shading, curves, and enlarged breasts (unless they're male, in which case they become overly muscular instead). Hallelujah for these ecchi scenes, am I right!? Seriously though, if the animation quality was consistently like the short and almost always unnecessary fanservice scenes, then I would have been really impressed with the show's visuals. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I didn't despise Classroom of the Elite or anything. I was just disappointed by the show's laid back attitude. Everything felt anticlimactic or unnecessary and it seemed like the creators were too afraid to take any risks and instead chose the safe and easy path. And in doing so, Classroom of the Elite became yet another mediocre anime that will certainly be forgotten by most as time goes by.",

            "content": "This is the 1st time for me to write a review for an airing anime....... So I'll try and keep it fresh.\r\nI mean, it's a light novel adaptation. It'll be interesting, right? The concept built for students who aim high in a prestigious school. It's about to get bumpy as it doesn't go as well as expected.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is really interesting. As a reader of the LN, I say that it's a combination of Oregairu and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. But to be clear, wouldn't you find it entertaining as it really gives of a good vibe just from the 1st episode? A system which determines thefund and rankings depending on students' behavior. A large amount of points(cash) every month, students plotting to set things up.\\n\r\nTrying to reach something against people who you really want to help but yet to know how... Of course there will be something problematic for the main characters as story progresses. The high looks down on the low, plays with them and sells them out.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the eyes but for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji the main characters. His eyes kinda looks empty to me.. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Visuals:\\n\r\nWell, it looks nice to me. Especially the shading.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music/Voice Acting:\\n\r\nWhy wouldn't the audio quality be at its best shape?\\n\r\nLiking the bgm. The OP is composed by ZAQ, it's so good and I like how she sings! The ED's main part is what shines brightest for its song.\\n\r\nWell, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji's monotone voice acting isn't really a problem to me...... The voice acting's good as for the others.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIs this Hachiman Hikigaya and Yukino Yukinoshita?\\n\r\nKiyotaka Ayanokouji seems mundane but he's interesting when it comes to intellectuals and people's action course.\\n\r\nThere's still no actual development yet and there's no one I really dislike.. So let's just say I like them. They all have pasts that we yet to explore. It's quite obvious.\\n\r\nI just want things to be resolve so everyone will be happy. Every single quote they give off at the end of an episode is how it portraits character's upcoming setting.\\n\r\nThe fact that Kiyotaka Ayanokouji knows \"how to\" piano and calligraphy like me, I'm just gonna continue and watch how he does...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nShort and clear. Interesting, high-class art, why would you hate music? Reused characters' personalities; don't mind. I like where this is going. Why I really am interested in this was because of its setup. Who you are and where you'll take action at. It's an interesting setup to me. I like the main characters' will to surpass what they couldn't do before.",

            "content": "When you think of the word \u2018school\u2019, the first words that come to mind might be textbooks, lecture, exams, and careers. Schools are designed to prepare for students for their future after all. However, that\u2019s not entirely the case for Koudo Ikusei Senior High School, a school that tests their students beyond the academic level. Youkoso Jitsuroku Shinjou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e (also known as \u201cClassroom of the Elite\u201d) is an anime that explores how survival in the outside world depends much more than just your academic skills.\r\nFrom my early impressions, this anime stood out from some light novel adaptations as it deconstructs the educationalsystem. This especially earns my attention as Japan already has a tough educational system so deconstructing that idea felt like a unique idea. In essence, this anime explores how the fictional Koudo Ikusei Senior High School takes initiative at preparing its students to survive in the real world. Granted by the government, the school has a budget system and students are supplied with points (100,000 every month). These points essentially translates to money as students are advised to use them wisely. The catch is that classes will receive points only based on their performance. Get the idea now? It basically exposes the idea of responsibility for these young teens as they realize what they\u2019re in for.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode introduces some of the main cast including main male protagonist Kiyotaka Ayankoji. It won\u2019t take long to realize that he has a rather dry outlook on life and often try to avoid being noticed. My impression of Kiyotaka reminds me of the main male protagonist from Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru as both him and Hachiman has similar personalities. His isolated personality doesn\u2019t make him stand out as a character on the surface but it gets really interesting when you listen to his thoughts about others. It\u2019s further evidenced by his poor social skills as he has difficulty making friends with others. As such, Kiyotaka\u2019s role in this anime feels different than from the usual light novel stereotype. As the episode progresses, I feel like some people can relate to Kiyotaka as well. Then, there\u2019s Suzune Horikita, the unfriendly cold beauty that gets involved with Kiyotaka from the same class. Similarly, she has a personality that also appears to be unsociable with others although she purposely tries to avoid making friends. In her mind, friends aren\u2019t necessary and holds her back. On the other hand, there are also very social people in their class like Kikyou Kushida. She\u2019s like the antithesis of both Kiyotaka and Horikita. Unlike them, Kushida is very good at communicating with others and has a friendly personality. Yet behind her bubbly appearance also lies a girl that masks her true image. Either way, it\u2019s shown that the main characters in this series all have the same objectives and that\u2019s to survive at their prestigious school.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cast of characters, Class D\u2019s students are easily the most prominent compared to the others as most of the series revolves around them. It\u2019s ironic since Class D is often looked down upon because of their grades and performance. Nonetheless, we get to see how they adapt with the school\u2019s points system. Some characters like Kiyotaka and Horikita manages their resources well while others carelessly uses it to satisfy their own desires. Not to mention, Class D seems to always get involved in some sort of drama from the very beginning. These include the plot involving Airi Sakura, an inspiring photographer and a stalker. Ken Sudou (one of the 3 Fools of Class D) even gets into a complicated drama that almost had him expelled from the school. The anime showcases these drama as any of these events can be relatable and happen in real life. Later in the show, the school even tests their students with an actual survival test that really brings the reality of what it means to survive. To be honest, I think all these concepts brings the potential of this anime to light. It highlights what some of the main characters are capable of and how they influence others. Unfortunately, this anime is presented as a distilled adaptation so don\u2019t expect a complete series. In other words, it leaves some important territories unexplored such as Kiyotaka\u2019s mysterious past, Kushida\u2019s darker personality, and among others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my interest of the main characters, the others in this series rarely stand out particularly those from Class B, C, and even A. The only ones that caught my attention occasionally are Mio Ibuki and Kakeru Ryuuen (Class C), Honami Ichinose (Class B), and Kouhei Katsuragi (Class A). Student council leader Manabu Horikita initially had my interest due to her relationship with Suzune. However, the anime doesn\u2019t really capitalize on exploring their relationship. Most of Class A seems to stand out only by status as none of their key members gets important focus such as their leader, Alice Sakayanagi.  There\u2019s also not much focus on the school faculty except for Class D\u2019s homeroom teacher Sae Chabashira. In essence, viewers coming into this anime will likely remember this anime\u2019s characters mainly from Class D than any of the others. Background stories are vaguely delivered that holds characterization back as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a premise, expect this anime to really dive into drama often. If you\u2019re not a fan of such genre, then it will likely make your heads turn. By drama, this anime explores social problems such as isolation, fear of anxiety, identity issues, and fear of rejection. Even the simple concept of trust is tested in later episodes. Not to mention, this anime seems to have hidden dark intentions from its character cast. In addition, do expect lighthearted comedy to pop up from here and there. Unfortunately, this show doesn\u2019t escape from light novel pitfalls such as panty jokes, swimsuit fan service, and generic misunderstandings. As I mentioned before though, the humor of this anime can get distracting at times although it doesn\u2019t hold the show back in general. Oh and don\u2019t expect any actual romance like some gimmicky shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Lerche, I must admit that the visual quality stood out compared to some of its other works. The characters look vibrant, colorful, and smooth with their appearances. This is especially true for Horikita as her character design matches those of a class beauty and Kiyotata\u2019s stoic personality also matches perfectly with his face on most scenarios. Character expressions and body language is indeed important in this anime as it discreetly shows how characters behave. Luckily, the anime pulls that off. The setting also looks appealing as it looks visually impressive as an upper class community. However, the anime still relies on some fan service from the old book. Kushida and Honami are the guiltiest of these examples as the camera seems to focus on them suggestively at times. Oh and before you forget\u2026swimsuits.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it can be overlooked on occasions, character voice mannerism is an important part of the show especially with the main cast. Kiyotaka is perhaps the most noticeable as we observe his thoughts and words. The way he talks often lacks emotions but noticeable for the way he speaks. Similarly, Horikita\u2019s cold personality is easily reflected by her tough voice and attitude. However, there are some character voices that I found annoying to the ears in particular with Kushida and occasionally the nicer guys in this anime. The theme songs has a J-pop style tune that while doesn\u2019t stand out too much is stylish enough to carry themselves. OST of this show balances between its eerie and lighthearted tone depending on the circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this anime can be a hit or miss for people. Some will enjoy it with the ideas it has to offer while others will discard it from their memories. However, I think this anime does do well to deconstruct the school system. Too often these days, our society relies on education to determine an individual\u2019s social status. This show demonstrates that it\u2019s not always about academic skills that matter in the real world. That being said, I think the story and main characters are what attracted me to this show. However, I can\u2019t say that some of the other characters are noticeable for their roles. The story itself is also incomplete so it will feel like an advertisement of the light novel. However, I\u2019d still give this show a try for this anime\u2019s style and way of portraying its society. The fact that some characters can be such assholes and exploring social issues will wake up our minds to reality. \\n",

I will resume some things why i consider this anime deserves more than a 4 note:\r\n- No absurd or overused ecchi\r\n- No oniii-sama baka chan retard and no-sense romance.\r\n- The MC is at least far more original than 8 of 10 of Mc around the scene. Tired of the typical virgin/otaku who blushes like a kid when seeing girls ?\r\n- Has an average/good plot.\r\nWhat's good on the show : Characters 9/10 and story 9/10.\r\nThough some characters are kinda cliche (not gonna name which ones), the important thing is thatmost of them play a role when the time comes, some of them do not show their real personality (won't spoil this) or their true intentions at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself its simple, an elite school divided in 4 classes, each one with a range of points based on their behavior and test scores It also has some interesting plot twists and there is not really a clear objective of what's will be the road of the story, specially on the MC who doesn't seem to care for scoring/getting friends, girls money, helping others or anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has different objectives: some want to get in class A, some other just want friends, some others just wanna kill time in school. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its 8.5 but i rounded it to 9 because i think this show deserves a higher general score. I consider it to be slighty underrated.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I've finished watching it.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score would be 8.5 because there were 2 episode fullfilled of fanservice and just a random story in both of them, which i consider something bad considering the whole season is just 12 episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "With no prior knowledge of the series, I only picked this anime up because I was seeing fairly glowing reviews and an impressively high score on this site. Unfortunately, I'm in the undesirable position of being one of the bearers of bad news: This show is dreadful.\r\nClassroom of the elite starts off fairly weak, presenting some vapid quotes like, \"Are humans really equal?\" and an opening sequence that displays a general lack of care. It only took me a few minutes to realize what I was watching was yet another light novel adaptation (if you're not familiar with light novels, the fact that this showis an adaptation of one is not a good thing). The premise is almost entirely unoriginal, but I've always thought that it's not so much about originality of concept, but rather how one uses the ideas and inspiration they take from other stories to craft something unique or memorable of their own. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that there is nothing of quality to speak of in this show. Not even remotely. The story is derived from countless battle school anime where kids in a given school fight for ranking and prestige. In this case, they prove their worth through academic standings. To \"spice things up\" the kids have to live on campus and receive an allotted amount of funds each month that fluctuates depending on their performance. The class we follow starts out at the bottom rung of the hierarchy, class D, and we are to see their journey to class A. The execution of this concept is poorly handled, though, in part due to a simple lack of imagination and a pacing structure that would give Charlotte a run for its money. At this rate, I have my doubts the kids'll make it to C, as the show has quickly devolved into a sort of \"adventures with Ayanokouji-kun and friends...\" \\n\\n\r\nYes, everything about this is hacky, even down to the details of the kids having to live on campus, but again this wasn't even the upsetting part. The unfortunate truth is anyone looking for any sort of unique or inspired take on the already super saturated \"highschool battle school\" subgenre is going to be severely let down here.\\n\\n\r\nAll that's left worth talking about is our characters... I was hoping they could save this sinking ship but I'll just come out and say it: They are all walking tropes. No attention to detail or complexity. no substance, no layers, just barebones cliche here folks... You've got the hot-headed jock, apathetic student, the overly friendly chick, the perfect girl, the mysterious loli, the uninterested main character. They all fit into little frameworks to a T. As I was watching I couldn't help but think, \"Are these guys serious?\" I'm failing to think of a show as egregious in its display of its cast (if you could call it that), showing us, in earnest, how completely void of personality each and every one of them are. I was frankly embarrassed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's talk about this terrible main character for a second. If one ever needed to know what not to do when creating a main character for a story, they'd need look no further than this. You may be inclined to believe he is a breathe of fresh air from the \"whiny, spineless\" main characters that we so often get from these adaptations. But it's just another variation of the same garbage, really. First off, to pull off the \"uninterested main character\" archetype to any degree of success, you have to be at least a competent writer (see oregairu). It's extremely difficult. The reason is because when you have a main character who doesn't give a damn about anything and has no goals whatsoever (or at least doesn't present them for the audience to know), you run the risk of the audience saying things like, \"Why should I even care?\" That's the one thing you don't want. Ever. Because if your audience doesn't care, they will stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji is bored in every scenario. Even in high tension situations where the mood of the scene calls for him to actually care about what's going on, he doesn't. And this is detrimental to the experience of the viewer. We're conflicted. What are we supposed to feel in situations where the scene is telling us we should be worried, anxious, mad etc. but our main character is looking into the distance with eyes half open, spacing out thinking about fuck all? This is what bad writing looks like. It's simply unbearable to watch if you've not turned off your brain.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one scene in the 4th episode that cemented to me the notion that this show, similar to Ayanokouji, just doesn't care at all. Our main character and a girl we had previously seen him personally interact with *zero* times had asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she could let down her crush without them feeling as bad. The problem of this scene is blatantly apparent to anyone who made it to this episode. These two characters have built no prior relationship that merits her making this request of Ayanokouji. To our knowledge, they barely know each other. It was constructed solely to meet the demands of the plot, with no regard to upholding any standards of storytelling. It was kind of insulting to watch; I could picture the guys making this anime on their lunch break having a laugh going, \"How unambiguously dumb can we make this show, and still get people eating out of the palm of our hands?\"\\n\\n\r\nIt was at that moment that I truly realized this anime has gone nowhere and that it will never go anywhere. There is no passion anywhere to be found here. No feeling. No excitement. A grade schooler could tell just how little original thought and care went into the making of this story, its world, or characters. It's just another poor ripoff of something that is already dreadful. I could make this review much longer, criticizing everything in excruciating detail, but similarly to Ayanokouji, I just can't be bothered.",

It's pretentious, boring drivel that makes a teen girl's SasuNaru songfic look like Gilgamesh in comparison.\r\nI keep seeing people claim that the best part of Classroom of the Elite is it's interesting premise for some reason. But, honestly, what groundbreaking concept are they exploring? High school students have to get good grades in school and not blow all their money on video games and dresses? Shocking. Classroomof the Elite presents this scenario like it's The Hunger Games for rich teens except that they still have rich families as a safety net to fall back on even if they are expelled. Nothing is at stake for them, not starvation or basic hygiene because the school offers free necessities and meals. Apparently not even expulsion, because test points can be bought and sold. The buying and selling of test points could've also been an idea for an interesting concept, students being forced to choose between buying food and clothing or spending a hefty amount of money in order to stay in school, if it weren't for the fact that Light Novel Guy and Main Girl have to be the Best At Everything and be the only ones with points to spend. So there goes that interesting idea too. \\n\\n\r\nBut let's talk about the characters for a second. I swore that if the protagonist made one single facial expression in three entire episodes I'd give the entire series a chance. Spoiler alert: he didn't. Light Novel Guy here is just 2kool4skool to actually react or even emote to situations around him. Adding a nihilistic viewpoint to an otherwise-generic Light Novel Guy is an interesting concept, if not for the fact that he's supposed to be seen as a nice guy and not a complete jerk. The first scene immediately laid out the problem with the way the writers treat his character; he wouldn't volunteer to give an old lady his seat, not for any moral reason, but just because he \"couldn't be bothered (tm)\". I've seen a few critics compare him to a robot, and it's not far off. To give you an example of the stellar dialogue, this is an actual line the main character says from episode three: \"I have no objection to this party, and I am taking part.\" We're supposed to believe human beings talk like this.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of human beings with dialogue so two dimensional it makes spam bots look like Shakespeare, here comes Light Novel Guy's gaggle of girls. We have not-Yukino Yukinoshita, our main girl, and not-Yui Yuigahama, our bubbly side chick. Comparing the characters to SNAFU is too easy, but low hanging fruit is the sweetest of fruit. The writers seem to agree with me, as both the characters can be boiled down to the tsundere and (spoiler alert) yandere archetypes. Since this is a light novel adaptation with a pseudo-intellectual main guy, I'm assuming at least two more girls on the promo poster fall into his harem as well. Boring is a pheromone in this anime, and no girl is immune. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's okay! Not-Yukino Yukinoshita isn't just here for a forced romantic subplot, she's also really deep! She wants to be the best because she has a brother complex and the only cure is for our Light Novel Guy to save her from being slapped around by her onii-sama because not only is he super smart, he used to play piano so he's super good at dodging kicks! \\n\\n\r\nNot-Yui Yuigahama is the straw that broke the camel's back and the reason why my score for this show went from a 4/10 and swan-dived into a 1/10. In the final minutes, she pulls back the curtain and reveals the writers for incompetent idiots who not only have no idea how women think, what emotions are, what rape culture is, or how fingerprinting works. It feels like they weren't confident the audience wouldn't like their milk toast main couple and tried to make the secondary love interest completely horrendous instead of giving personality to the characters who needed it most. It feels like the writing of a twelve-year-old stretching their edgy wings. And I feel so god damned bored.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one good scene in this series. It's the debate between the two girls and their conflicting moral philosophies. One believes the weak should be culled in order to advance, the other believes the weak should be helped in order to strengthen the group. Both yield the same result. This debate is still boring, but at least the show stretched it's Psych 101 muscles for twenty seconds. Of course, it's irrelevant because Main Girl only changes her mind once Light Novel Guy mansplains the other girl's philosophy to her again just a scene later because watching women change their entire worldviews after a man condescendingly rants at them is the only way Jason, the 17 year old otaku from Milwaukee, can finish. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that the only decently animated shot in the entire series is a close up of a boob being squeezed. In fact, the entire series is void of basic animation when breasts aren't the main focus. In one instance they literally took a still image of a character and wiggled it around in photoshop to give it the appearance of animation instead of actually animating it! Not only is this show uninspired, boring, and borderline-misogynistic, it's straight up lazy. The character designs are hideous at worst and mediocre at best. The sound is for all intents and purposes non-existent, with a few acoustic background songs that sound like studio Lerche let the asshole in the park who's always with his guitar plunk out a melody in a recording booth. It's just bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fun to hate bad anime. Heck, if all the SAO videos are any indication is downright profitable. But there's nothing enjoyably bad about this show. It's about as fun as late-night paperwork. It's as fun as a root canal without the drugs to alleviate the consistent drilling pain. Anime as a whole may not be a mistake, but this show sure as hell is. 1/10.",

            "content": "After being put off by many reviewers, it's clear that this anime is a hit or miss depending on how you view it. I've never written a review before, however, I'm attempting to in order to justify one of the most intriguing series I've watched to date.\r\nThe series' story revolves around Ayanokoji, who is placed in the worst class in the school due to his poor entrance exam grades. While many people trash the story for being too \"slow\" or \"mundane\", I feel like the story itself shouldn't be the main focus of the anime but it instead should be seen as something that supportswhat I will be discussing next.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story of the school isn't the main focus of this anime, what is? The answer to this is the characters. While many early reviewers see the characters as boring and unattractive, they are only considering what the anime has directly given to them in a blunt way. Nothing about the characters' personality and/or motives are shown directly at first. This should have been obvious by how at the end of the first episode, the viewer realizes they know absolutely nothing about any of the characters' pasts or motives, including the MC.\\n\\n\r\nYoukoso is interesting because the viewer is led to wonder what each character's reasons for doing things are. Of course everyone is boring in this high school, you know why? It's because over half the characters wear masks to hide their true personalities. Actions and clues lead the viewer on a fascinating journey as pieces are put together in a way so that learning more and more about the main character and his classmates has a ton of impact. As more and more is revealed to the story letting the viewer understand the characters, the series becomes more fascinating and understandable, which creates the point that this series cannot be judged prematurely.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I won't go too much into the art and music, I can say that I really like both and think they pair well with the anime, being fitted in at right times. Youkoso's construction is slow, but boy is it one hell of a ride once you get into it.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize this review, if you are able to think for yourself and lead yourself to wonder what each characters' true personality, then you will most likely enjoy this anime.",

The concepts of the series were good at the first episode, they fell apart in episode 2 and so on, there's barely an introduction and the characters are dreadful.\r\nThe art is the best this show has (And it is still bad). the character design is generic like your typical school anime, and no one stands out from the others. You getyour typical \"yandere\" girl followed by your typical shounen protagonist, then your typical tsundere \"female dog\" then your typical bad guys and that's about it. It's nothing from the other world, but it is certaintly better than most anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is just horrible, disappointing. The protagonist is cold and has somthing hidden, well, not that that's new. But him not having a real personality is the problem, it has been used for the last 2 years and and it's just of the same, can't they do something else for a protagonist with no personality? This is too much. The female protagonist is a tsundere with no development, we don't know anything from her as well as the whole cast. At least a bit from the past wouldn't be so bad, to have an actual plot at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story makes no sense, they are dragging the whole mystery thing with the case for at least 3 episodes, is that really necessary? I get it, with 2 episodes its ok, you get the mystery in the first episode and the second its solved, but no, they are slow as a crap river. That aside, they have the clues right there yet they don't use them, again, the creator of this is trying way to hard to do something that's not worth it by this time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2",

            "content": "The best way to describe this show to someone who watches a decent amount of anime is \"baka and test that takes itself seriously\".  \r\nAs it turns out, baka and test does not work when it takes itself seriously.\r\nFor starters, the basic setting, while it seems interesting at first, makes no sense on anything but a surface level.  For some shows, (slice of life and comedy) this is okay, as deep reflection on the setting is not an essential part of the experience.  However, in a show that prides itself on its deep philosophical aspects, the fundamental flaws in the setting makeengagement impossible.\\n\r\nThe core plot of the first episode is simply that the students go to a prestigious school, where everything is provided for them, to be bought with points allotted at the beginning of each month.  The loser class that the story follows spends their points frivolously, and is shocked when they discover that the amount of points they have is lowered by their bad behavior.  Their teacher mocks them for not figuring this out, mentioning that she had said that their point allotments were based on merit in the beginning.  The show brings to attention how obvious this was, to the point where I did not even realize that it wasn't supposed to be while watching.  Yet, for some reason, nobody even considered it.\\n\r\nThis starts the show's trend of lazy writing with selective idiocy on the parts of the characters, where despite being students at the nation's premier prep school, regularly fail to understand basic concepts, rather than coming up with a reasonable reason for the characters to fail and create conflict. \\n\r\nFurthermore, along with the forced conflict, the stakes riding on this conflict are equally nonsensical, with the big reveal that any character who fails a test will be permanently expelled.  This is treated like the end of the world, and due to the structure of the series, from the viewer's perspective expulsion of a character would be equivalent to death, being their complete removal from the story.  However, to the characters, if they were already failing with no hope of recovery, expulsion would be an actively good thing, so the only shocking part about this consequence is that anyone in danger of being expelled wouldn't have dropped out or transferred already.  \\n\r\nThe story then proceeds to use this faulty setting as a premise to try and explore deep and philosophical questions such as \"does equality truly exist\".  However, this question's meaning is almost completely lost, because when the premise is this divorced from realism, we know that the plot will magically contort itself to drive home whatever moral the author feels like forcing on us.  Characters will act absurdly, impossibly unlikely coincidences will occur, and certain key aspects of society and human behavior will be overlooked, just so that the main character, and by extension the author, can be proven right in his morals.\\n\r\nFiction is an incredibly powerful tool for investigating philosophy, and a well crafted story can do very well as an example of a particular branch of philosophy.  However, rather than doing this, classroom of the elite simply makes bold statements like \"equality does not truly exist\" and proceeds to simply showcase supposed examples of \"inequality\" while ignoring all factors that would contest its viewpoints.",

            "content": "I'll get this right out there, this is without a doubt my most disliked show of the season and I believe it to be an objectively bad show. Here's why.\r\nBefore I start ragging on it, I'll say I don't mind either of the main characters too much (that said, I'll still tear them apart). Main characters referring to Ayanokouji, and Horikita. My problem lies with the pretentious attitude of the show, the frankly laughable story, and the down right cringy characters and character interactions. Due to the main characters being a carbon copy of the more famous Hachiman / Yukinoshita  (which certainly were notthe first couple of characters like themselves) and the awkward introductions with famous quotes, I get the feeling the show is trying do a few things. Be relatable to students, to be profound enough to spark critical thinking, and then the actual story itself is trying to be grandiose and dramatic to force a sense of excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSchool settings are popular because everyone has been, or is a student. Everyone can relate to being in school. This anime has done nothing wrong with trying to use a school setting to be relatable. The problem is the pathetic drama, and the narcissistic attempt at philosophy. This show is far too melodramatic. It's trying to cram too many settings into one anime. I can't take anything the characters do or say seriously. The school setting itself isn't an issue. Nor are the unoriginal, less interesting (than others of their kind) main characters. The issue is the drama. It's trying to hard to force drama and some great big power struggle, which would never, ever happen in any kind of high school. It's that kid in the 8th grade trying to act like an adult. It's pretending to be serious, mature and edgy. The only settings you MIGHT seeing something even remotely close to this is in some American Ivy League college. Not in some Japanese private school. Sure you might get some pretty hard core bullying or rich kids throwing money around, but you'll never see some billion dollar completely self sustainable campus. That is because there is no return. If you're going to try and force this kinda conflict down our throats, at least have it be a college / university. This kinda thing doesn't fly in a modern day setting. No way in hell is any country, or business entity going to blow literal billions of american dollars on HIGH SCHOOL. Not to mention a high school with a bunch of luxuries for pretentious teenagers. Things like malls, pools, luxury cruise ships, fucking islands. If you're going to try and be relatable through something like a school, keep the setting realistic. Otherwise you get that contrast of putting a Picasso next to fucking Jimmy who's failed to get a engineering degree and is now trying for an Art degree in modern painting. It's laughable,  and completely incompatible //Excuse the rhyme.\\n\\n\r\nThe next problem is the point system. There is literally zero risk involved in having zero points. The school gives out everything you need to survive for free at a no cost. Obviously it's not as nice as the higher priced things, but it's by no means inhumane or even of \"bad\" quality. The threats and repercussions of having zero points, and going against school rules seem to be non-existant. Everything that is a hard no in the school's rulebook get's brushed off by some bullshit teen logic or some all power Student Council. The only incentive to have higher points is for vanity and to ascend to 'A' class, which itself seems to have little incentive other than bragging rights and the aforementioned vanity.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the philosophy is down right pathetic and narcissistic. The first episodes opens up with the everlasting \"Are humans truly equal\" and then breaks into a poorly thought out monologue that the 14 year old high school kid posted on r/im14andthisisdeep. Each episode opens with some profound quote and then proceeds to have an episode completely unrelated to that quote. Every attempt this show makes at being profound, philosophical and mature breaks down to some poorly though out drama between 'D' class and their oppressors which has practically no relation to the quote at the beginning of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a travesty. And while I don't dislike them, this complaint encompasses each and every character in the show, including the main characters. All these characters, from class 'A' to class 'D' all fit some boring archetype or stereotypical image. They are completely flat in both dimension and character. They're boring to say the least. From having 6'10 pure muscle bald monks who act like Yakuza, to 5'3 big boobed redheaded airheads that are secretly evil back to 6'10 black men who only speak broken english. The characters are laughable. Everyone praising Ayanokouji as the second coming of Hachiman is wrong. The only relation they have is their intelligence. Ayanokouji is nothing more than your average self insert protagonist. Sure he's more enjoyable than your average lucky pervert harem protag, but he isn't any more complex or better written. Horikita on the otherhand is just a poor attempt at Yukinoshita. Her 'cold attitude' is actually a facade to cover up her incompetence regarding human relations, and her own emotions. Comparing Yukinoshita and 8man is like comparing a Porsche to a beetle. Yea they're both cars, but the difference is jaw dropping.\\n\\n\r\nThis story's pathetic attempt at stimulating intellect, refined philosophy, and exciting drama is down right insulting. This show started bad, got worse and ended horribly. It's a failure through and through.",

Also \\n\r\n  her motivation makes her look weak.\\n\\n\r\n- On the other hand Sakura feels like a generic character that you can find in every \\n\r\n  harem anime too.\\n\\n\r\n- antagonist characters like Katsuragi or Ryuuen are cliched to the point of being \\n\r\n   laughable, with no deeper motivation at all\\n\\n\r\n- Characters like Kouenji completly miss the point of what a comedic character is \\n\r\n   supposed to look like in a more serious setting.\\n\\n\r\n- Sudou is a generic troublemaker that mainly serves as a plot device to get the story \\n\r\n  going, however there is barly any explanation of who he got through the entrance \\n\r\n  exams or what a character like him does in an \"elite\" school.\\n\\n\r\n- other than those most of the side characters barly get any screentime and are not \\n\r\n  worth mentioning, the group dynamic of the characters is ok, yet predictable in a \\n\r\n  lot of ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 3/5\\n\\n\r\n- Songs for the Opening and Ending are quite catchy. Yet the visuals for both are \\n\r\n  heavily lackluster.\\n\\n\r\n- For the Opening we have mostly style over substance. A lot of random philosophic \\n\r\n  quotes paired with characters standing around in a well shot scene.\\n\\n\r\n- The Ending on the other hand is just lazy consisting of two images were one is an \\n\r\n  empty Classroom\\n\\n\r\n- The rest of the soundtrack is mostly forgettable, yet it still is in some scenes \\n\r\n  overbearing. The only scene were that worked for me was on Episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\n- uncreative character designs\\n\\n\r\n- female characters have too much fanservice, while male characters look mostly \\n\r\n  generic or overdesigned\\n\\n\r\n- There a lot of different backrounds and most of them are pretty solid. The lightning\\n\r\n   effects are mostly good too and the animation is fluent.\\n\\n\r\n- Some scenes and have specially colored lightning effects and they put a lot of effort \\n\r\n  into making the eyes of the characters stand out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/5\\n\\n\r\nOk now to sum up all the things that I said up and give a last insight. First this show is NOT like Oregairu, yet it TRIES to be like it. However in doing that it completly misunderstands the core elements of it. You can see this the most in the main character of Ayanokoji. He is more of a Tatsuya Shiba from The Irregular at Magic High School than a Hikkigaya Hachiman. The difference is here that Ayanokoji feels like someone that is above the entire cast so far. On the other hand Hikkigaya stood out through his alternitive view points, which made him different from the rest of the cast.\\n\r\nAlso through the entire show all the characaters felt more like they would come from a show like Asterisk War rather than Oregairu.\\n\r\nIn terms of storytelling I like the way the setting is meant to be a \"survival of the fittest\" type. Yet the comedy and the huge amount of fanservice ruin the serious nature of it. In the end I think Classroom of the Elite is a pseudo-intellectual bait show for people that do not understand the basics of storytelling or characterization. It can be a good time if you can identify yourself with the power fantasy which is the shows MC. If you don't you will have a hard time liking the show and I would not recommend it. In the end Classroom of the Elite is my disappointment of the season, \\n\r\nthat, after a solid start, got worse with each passing weak. \\n\\n",

            "content": "What if the most elite students in society were placed in one incredible intense school, pitted against each other to become the most elite student of them all? If this question even moderately intrigues you, then turn around because the Classroom of the Elite does not have any meaningful answer to it, in fact, it has nothing worthwhile to say at all.\r\nThis show is a head-shaking enigma, it proposes intriguing questions but never answers them, it feigns depth, and it pretends like the twists can't be predicted from miles away! At best you'll get some fleeting fun by watching \"elite\" high schoolers running around andsolving trivial issues, at worst your time will be wasted and your intelligence will be insulted. It excels at nothing and falls flat in more than a couple areas.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was a moderately interesting opener. Students who were considered the best of the best collected into one school, they were given full responsibility for a great deal of money awarded to them once a month. At the end of the first month, to the surprise of no one but the idiotic cast, the money was not replenished. Perhaps the show was trying to establish a theme of materialism, but if this was the truth then they failed to follow through with it. I wasn't sure if it was good when I first watched it, but I had hope that with more development it could become something special. The episodes flew by and my hopes were left unanswered. I suppose I\u2019ll have to delve into it eventually so I\u2019ll do it now, the story is simple and I didn\u2019t like any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe school is separated into 4 classes, A, B, C, and D; the best students being in class A, then the worst in D. The underdog class D was the one the story followed, and in the class was the narrator/protagonist Ayanokouji; a mild-mannered guy (with a mysterious past!!) who served as a relatable joke dispenser in the early episodes, then he was shuffled into the corner so the real focus could take center stage, the ladies. Whenever the other members of D class were developed it felt like the story's original conceit was growing less and less plausible; for a school that is meant to be strictly for the most elite students, it's full of a lot of idiots. Most of the issues Class D had were caused by the stupid mistakes of its students. Whenever a conflict was contrived to add tension it would simultaneously showcase the idiocy of the class and increase plot holes. Plot holes are really the least of this show's problems, it's sad I feel this way but my standards have been lowered due to the shitshow that was Summer 2017. Beyond the plot holes, most of the \"twists\" that occur in this show seemed unearned and the rest of them were unbelievably predictable. \\n\\n\r\nYou can make the argument that the characters were given traits; beyond that was nothing, all of them were one-dimensional. There are no characters in Classroom of the Elite I will ever think about after I finish the review. None of them resonated with me in the slightest, but that isn't enough to insult a person. Most of them are a single trait, stupid, shy, wise, bubbly, bland, but there were some who got characterized as sicko-perverts that were reminiscent of the appalling supporting cast of Hajimete no Gal (you really shouldn't want to be compared to a show like that but if that comparison excites you then, by all means, enjoy both shows). Anyways, there are some villains, they are your typical stoic and condescending types and they're in the classes above D. They're rarely on screen and only exist to add someone to root against and occasionally contrive tension from.\\n\\n\r\nIt was almost as if the writer intended to cross through every trope they possibly could on their way to the finale, and oh what a finale it was. \\n\r\nIt wasn't until episode 7 that I really understood the magnitude of this show's flaws; it was the obligatory fanservice episode. I don't have a problem with fanservice, this show is loaded with it and it was rarely intrusive until this one moment. The infamous episode starred some of the male supporting characters in the titular class D. They try to plant cameras in the girl's bathroom to spy on them and it is played off in a disconcerting and perverted way, but I can only assume they thought it would be funny and relatable high school humor? Who actually thought this would be a good idea for a tv show? (Based on the MAL score a frightening amount of people.)\\n\r\nThe supporting characters that led the infamous episode 7 were never funny and only succeeded in creeping me out, it was only made worse by the fact that they were followed throughout the episode and their gross conversations were being overlaid with fanservice shots at the pool. After those infamous 20 minutes, I could not watch the show without feeling cynical towards this disaster. Maybe I'm biased because I hated that episode so much, but I think my arguments still have value. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like I've said enough about the plot and characters so I'll briefly mention the sound and visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great! The song is awesome, character portraits fly in and out, quotes in random languages zip past the screen, it really was a joy to watch in the early episodes. However, as the episodes counted past I began to realize that the depth that the visuals alluded to would never be explored in the show. It's just another one of the show's gimmicks meant to draw in an audience and fool them into thinking the events transpiring onscreen are more interesting than they actually are.\\n\r\nMusic is also used throughout the show to make scenes feel weightier than they really are. For example; organs and a volley of stringed instruments can be heard over entirely random scenes that follow villains. The music sounds great, but it really loses power as it's used over and over to very weak effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is totally passable, nothing unique but not bad either. Characters look fairly simple, no outstanding designs, nothing to set them apart from one another, I struggled to remember their names. The student uniforms are generic and express nothing. Nothing about the school stands out visually beyond having a shopping mall within it. \\n\r\nLastly, a message to you, Classroom of the Elite, showing a random and loosely related quote every now and then does not make you profound, it just makes you pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\nFinal Score 2.8/10\\n\r\n(Story 1/10) (Art 5/10) (Sound 6/10) (Character 0/10) (Enjoyment 2/10) \\n\\n\r\nClassroom of the Elite is a trope-laden failure that lacks any substance. It never makes an effort to tell a memorable story or create original characters, it\u2019s a corporate product that purely exists to sell Blu-rays and merchandise with its cast of cardboard cutout waifus.",

The odd thing is the school looks like a cheap school that have deliquents,gang,stupid kid and bad bitch that clearly isnt SMART but idk why they can enter such a great school like that, even some of them failed at their first test.\\n\\n\r\nIm interested on this anime because of its psychological genre and im expecting a deep meaning story,some mystery and a LOGICAL story.\\n\r\nIt feels like sometimes the anime is trying too hard to make the characters looks cool,slick,smart people that can solve everything, i dont want to spoil the beans for you but this anime is on different league with other school themed psychological anime like angel beats,little buster or even charlotte. I cant even call this anime psychological at all and dont deserve a 7.9 score at all, the only things that good with this anime is its art especially many of the  girls have a big boobs and thats the only good thing you got from this crap.\\n",

            "content": "let me start by saying I am caught up to the anime and this is also my first review.\r\ntruly I have seen a lot of mixed opinions on this anime, mainly concerning the characters(however I will get to that later).\r\nI will try to keep it spoiler free however just take my adivice and give atleast episodes 1-5 a watch....\r\nTrust me.\r\nAnywho,\r\nI'll begin with Art(9):\r\nThe art in Youkoso Jitsuryoku is great it does an especially great job on the colors it uses to portray its school setting and especially the way it decides to draw eyes. However, this is not really where in my opinion the showstands out.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7):\\n\r\nI have nothing to say but meh, to be honest, it is nothing more than decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10):\\n\r\nThe show begins in an odd way each character fulfills all tropes of the genre at first glance and purposefully does not suit the mood of the show overall, a darker vibe is always present in Youkoso Jitsuryoku and all characters are not what they seem to be. innocent characters have deeply rooted split personalities and the quiet type always seemingly has a more heart warming emotional side and to top it all of the main character seems to be the fakest and least genuine person in the whole series, however, we do not see his past rather we experience everything he does but with his pragmatic and philosophical twist on things.they are all genuinely interesting characters whose true personalities only unravel with time,\\n\\n\r\nStory(8):\\n\r\nAs of this time, i do not know how long Youkoso Jitsuryoku will be, however,\\n\r\nSo far it is strangely philosophical for an anime of its genre every episode starts off with a proverb maxim or a strange quote which seemingly makes no sense until you find out more about the characters, all of which are odd in their own right.not only by design but also due to the fact that they do not fit the rules this prestigious school has set out for them. Class D is meant to be broken toys or defects (and in reality, they are in terms of personality) however the mc purposefully tries to act a fool and the silent type is really someone who screwed up the entrance exam and is nothing short of a nerd in all honesty.\\n\r\nThe story so far has focussed on how the economics of the school works.\\n\r\nSaying that you are only given money to live based on \"merit\" and if u slack off u effectively have to eat raw veg and can't enjoy your life(As you have no money).Additionally, if u get below 50% of your classes grade you are expelled and this must be prevented at all costs as one of the main characters plans on getting into class A and can not do this without the whole of the class getting behind her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9):\\n\r\nThis animes diverse and twisted characters keep you on the edge of your seat through and through. additionally, the faint uneasiness that follows only adds to the comedy the side characters add to the story.\\n\r\nThis is truly a rollercoaster of well...\\n\r\nf3\u00a3k knows its just a mix of dark and quirky which has so much potential and gives a truly fresh take on the comedy/romance/school/drama genre.\\n",

            "content": "People tend to think that because an idea seems uncommon on paper, it is already good.\r\nNo, it is not. A plot may seem to be as attractive as possible, a character may appear to be interesting for not following a common stereotype, but if they are not developed correctly, or at least, they are not well used in the universe that the same serie propose, then can\u2019t be said that they are good. This is the case.\r\nTwo things to keep in mind before continue reading:\r\n1. Minor spoilers ahead.\r\n2. This is an ANIME ONLY review.\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e, also known as \"Classroom ofthe Elite\", this name already summarizes us what the series is about: a prestigious school where only attends \"the best of the best\", students are separated by categories and where a point system is managed according to the test results, which are necessary to literally survive on this island/school. Of course the best class usually has most of the points, while the worst, that is, the D class (where the series focuses) have few or none, so the aim of these students is to improve on their exams for get more points and survive, even think ambitiously and try to get down to the other classes. If we ignore the fact that no one in the D class except the protagonist group was so smart to not see the obvious working of this system that promotes competitiveness and instead they all believed that they would receive 10.000 points at the end of the month just for their pretty faces (\u00bfis not it supposed to be a school of elites?), we have a plot that, on paper, sounds very good, and can give rise to a story with an interesting development.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other positive aspects, the animation is very good, has enough fluidity and is very colorful, the character design is generic but very well done (especially the design of the girls). The soundtrack is meh, not bad but it is very forgettable and were few times where highlighted, however, the serie has a good handling of audiovisual quality and a decent sound direction most of the time that knows how to make the few scenes where the sound is important (scenes of intrigue or \"revelations\") are able to impress and trap the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's up to this point where the only thing that I can speak well of the serie ends...\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow \u00bfwhat is the problem with this show, having an proposal with so much potential? Just the fact that they don't take advantage of that potential, and instead, the series focuses only on exposure: they show you the MC reflecting and understanding more how the system and the school works and acting when required, but not the reason of his acts, they show you several background characters moving as if they had some evil plan (\u00a1with background funeral music included!), but in the end little or nothing happens, they show you how their protagonists pretend to make their class rise range, but they are so rough that they don't even bother to relate to their classmates to carry out their class, which they show you as mere extras or victims for the protagonists to shine more. This is not a story of \"how the D class improves and rises in rank\", the protagonists go on their own march and the rest of the class cares little or nothing matters, and when the show tries to give them characterization or at least something of space on screen in the moments where they are important, it doesn't even do it well (Sudo, Ichinose, Sakura, the sensei, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect is that many of the arcs feel disconnected, contribute little or nothing, are unnecessary and in some cases is not explained how things were given (eg, the survival test), arcs that were only introduced to force the plot and the drama. With all this the central thread is lost, it's not known to what point the series will arrive or that pretends to show you in reality, everything ends up being boring and disinterested.\\n\\n\r\nThe serie pretends to be a serious and dark story, with issues of discrimination and arrogance on the part of high-ranking classes, people moving in the shadows and the D class being victimized by being the lowest link, but again, the series resorts to the exposure of this arrogance and this \"dark atmosphere\" (the upper classes bullying Sudo, Ryuuen punishments to the members of his \"gang\", the almost rape scene, the president machining things, the girl with the stick with the bald guy talking incoherently so that they seem to plan something \"interesting\", etc.), all in an exaggerated way and nothing subtle, to the point where the series ends up being immature, for not knowing how to handle such issues with the seriousness that is meritorious and instead uses them to pretend to be intellectual and interesting, or in the worst case, to \"shocking\" the viewer and thus disguise the poor writing and development of the serie and its characters, even shows you situations cliches and fanservice that not even the case.\\n\\n\r\nI have always said that it's not bad to have cliches and fanservice as long as you make use of them in a way that are acceptable to see, this is not the case \u00a1because even the fanservice is explicit! other series show you subtle scenes, fleeting or according to the situation: falls, wind raising skirts, rays of light coming out of nowhere, etc. Here they put the tits in the whole screen without more, without conceal, without having more nothing on the scene, not even people talking, and with no other goal but to do you fap with that. This creates a contrast to what the series shows, and instead of being serious and interesting, ends up being ridiculous. Basically the serie pretends to be something that it is not, it resorts to exposure to hide its failure of plot development and shows you exaggerated and unnecessarily explicit situations in an attempt to prove maturity and ends up being the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nPretentious, that's the word that describes the show. I know that this term is often used as a \"generic argument that people usually use to denigrate a job they do not like\" as some say out there, regardless of if it really applies or if those who use it know what really means, but I would not use it if in this particular case it doesn't apply, and does apply. With all that I mentioned before, the series insists that the same must be taken completely seriously, despite the great failures in development, despite their cliche characters and exaggerated situations to the point of ridicule, all this creates a great contrast to the heavy atmosphere. If I try to take it seriously, I can't, because the atmosphere is very forced and doesn't go according to everything that happens on the screen: arcs that contribute little or nothing, cliches in the middle of a plot that tries to be dark, irrelevant characters doing nonsense here and there and \"serious\" situations so anticlimactic and explicit that end up being simply stupid, so the seriousness that the show intends is not transmitted. And if I don't try to take it seriously, I can't either, because the plot tries to convince you that EVERYTHING that goes on screen including the most insignificant nonsense and the most exaggerated situation possible, is serious and dark, situations that obviously you can not take as such, and even try to put comedy, which is so dry, forced and simple that ends up being shameful and cringy. On more than one occasion I ended up banging myself on the keyboard of the embarrassment for such pathetic attempts to \"be comic.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother negative aspect is that the series does not know the term \"subtlety\": every time a situation occurs, they show it in the most crude, explicit and anticlimatic possible way:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Starting with the same plot. Being an elite school that seeks to form highly skilled people, a fairly realistic goal \u00bfis the competitive environment so exaggerated so necessary that even people are talking about \"destroying the other classes\"? \u00bfis necessary the discrimination? \u00bfare necessary the \"evil plans\" only to expel a single student? \u00bfis necessary a Btooom! style Survival Test in a high school with relatively normal students? Situations that have little or no place in the genres that the series handles are literally forcing the plot to generate dramatic situations that ultimately are nothing, because the development of the arcs is so random that they do not transmit what they want to show.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Horikita's traumatic past and the fact that she feels such inferiority to her brother that she literally changes character to script conveniences. Just as they show the brother as an almighty whose only presence is terrifying, and a sort of evil final boss who went so far as to almost hurt his sister to \"show her that she can never reach him.\" It is not necessary to exaggerate the situation to the extent that it is so unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The Kushida's revelation, who at one point changes from a loving and friendly girl to a soulless bitch, and the way she showed it was so cringy: screaming, flailing and threatening the MC with saying that he raped her if he reveal it, \u00bfare you serious? If you are going to show a dark side, at least do it maturely, otherwise, it's like something edgy and stupid.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The constant fights with the other classes, which they show as a kind of mafia that punishes its members when they don't fulfill their duties and always go for the most violent and problematic option possible, as if they were real criminals \u00bfWould not it be enough to show the friction between classes without wanting to make the whole situation happen as a kind of war between yakuzas?\\n\\n\r\n\u2014The Sakura's trauma with the potential stalkers, exaggerated to the point that they show a man like a sick and obsessive who almost raped her, which was not necessary to show his problem (just make it clear that she was being harassed and make the pertinent complaint was enough) and shows how the serie handles a serious subject in a very immature way, because of course, all men are disgusting that the first thing we do when we see the sexy photos of a girl is harass her to try to rape her... Also the fact that she is an excessively shy girl who shows her provocative photos both on the internet and in the middle of a serious trial to increase her confidence with herself, but then she implies that she \"doesn't like to show a lot of skin\" and it bothers her that they look at it in a \"lustful way\" \u00bfis not this a bit contradictory?\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the other aspect that ends up completely burying this series: the characters. I would like to remind you of what I said at the beginning: that something looks good on paper or looks different at first glance doesn't imply that it will be good. That the characters, mainly the protagonist, do not seem to be the common ones in this type of stories doesn't make them automatically good, in fact in this case, they are all lousy (some more than others). All are flat characters and completely inhuman but with a kind of \"plot twist\" to make them look more interesting and complex, complexity that doesn't really exist:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Ayanokouji, our protagonist, at first he looks like someone bored, but in reality he is someone analytical, who only observes what happens around him and he draws conclusions about it, plus he does not want to highlight. In this sense it is very similar to Hachiman, which is why many consider him a good character, and in fact sounds like a good approach \u00a1SURPRISE! it turns out that the guy is super smart but he gets mediocre ratings apparently on purpose, is an expert in hand-to-hand combat and just for being him, he is surrounded by how many girls who \"notice how special he is\" \u00bfwhy? The most silly excuse: he was a laboratory rat created to be perfect, and not people, show a flashback of his past is NOT characterization or character development if they do not show how he develops his way of being and think from this fact , which they never did, they simply said \"MC is perfect because like that he was created\", that's all. Based on the above the main problem arises with this character: he doesn't really have a background to make his actions coherent, and then you realize that it is not that he is boring, he simply has no personality, but even so the series doesn't waste opportunity to make him shine, since everything to him goes well, everyone talks about him, everything important involves him and seems to be the only character who thinks and acts rationally, basically a perfect example of a self insert character and a Gary Stu. He is with the same face always, immutable to everything that happens even his own actions \u00bfHow can I believe that the protagonist is living a tense situation (when the president confronts him, for example) if he doesn't express it? Besides, because he doesn't have personality or characterization, you don't know what really drives him to act, you can not take his actions seriously because what motivates him to act is basically non-existent. He only acts because the plot says so. He doesn't move the plot: the plot moves him. Even though he is not a bad character at all, his inexpressiveness makes it somewhat unpredictable (even though you know that Almighty MC-kun will always be there to save the day), which plays to his advantage, however that is not enough for make up for all the bad. And understand this for a good time: That a protagonist doesn't be your typical dense and rough MC does NOT automatically make him a good character, much less \"the best MC of the season\".\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Horikita is the typical elitist bitch who believes herself superior to the rest, despises the whole world because \"making friends is unnecessary\" and is all the time with her arms crossed to show superiority over \"scum\". Currently she is the one that really wants to raise the class despite treating their classmates as trash. \u00bfWhy? again, \u00a1SURPRISE! she also possesses a typical traumatic past (which is never explained), an apparent inferiority complex toward her brother, the student council president, and a lamentable desire to show him that she may be at his level, all in a pathetic attempt to make her see her not so rude and that you feel empathy for her. Then, the rude and super serious elitist who tries to do everything for herself (although she knows she should collaborate with others, which she never does) becomes a submissive to which the MC has to rescue, and a kind of tsundere badly made to justify his mood changes at the convenience of the script. She is the inconsistency made character... and speaking of conveniences of the script: it is funny how she does not trust anyone to believe that they all have a double face, but she fully trusts Ayanokouji who obviously hides many things (and even threatened her by gossip) just because \"he saved her\" when all he did was to be in the place indicated \"by casuality\" (that is, when the plot ordered him). Curiously she was the only one to have something vaguely close to a development (yes, THE ONLY ONE) as we saw how little by little she began to trust and appreciate her classmates more (although she is still rough). Apparently several of these scenes must have been from another character, and I saw a lot of people whining about that, but in fact this change was partly a success, mainly because the other character in question (Karuizawa) was never introduced correctly \u00bfwould not be something strange give too much space suddenly to a character we do not even know? Instead they gave more space to a previously established character, so it was not a bad decision at all. As a side note: that Senjougahara-style compass scene was very pathetic, and we don't talk about the tickle scene, a bad attempt to make it look more moe. I don't' mention the bathroom scene in Chapter 11 because it clearly was important to the plot \u00bfright?... \u00bf\u00a1right!?\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Kushida is the typical cheerful girl, with more breasts than brains who wants to be friends with everyone, but in such a sickly way that a lot of people, including me, find her annoying to see, but \u00a1SURPRISE! it turns out that the girl actually hid a kind of second, darker and manipulative personality, all in a very pathetic attempt to give complexity to the character and to \"shock\" the audience that perhaps did not expect that. \u00bfBut do you know what's the worst? That second personality was never explained, never showed the background and also had absolutely no impact on everything that happened in the rest of the show, so \u00bfwhat was it all for? A cheap way to make a character look interesting and keep people to the expectation. They literally sold smoke.\\n\\n\r\n\u00bfNow you see why I said that such complexity does not exist? All characters are just cliches already seen with a plot twist that tries to fill the void of a real characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are not worth talking about. Sudo is the typical rude and troublesome boy, Ichinose is another less annoying Kushida, Sakura the typical excessively shy girl and complexed by his past and/or actions, Hirata the popular, kind and attentive guy (SURPRISE! He also seems to have a \"dark\" personality), the president the typical evil boss \"because yes\" who is even more elitist than his sister, Ryuuen the gang member, Ibuki the Rem\u2014 I mean, the submissive dependent without personality, Arisu the mysterious loli THAT DID NOTHING, etc. \u00bfDo you see how all can be described in a single sentence? The worst thing is that no one was given some space even to know them and that they come to import, in fact, in their respective arcs they were treated more as victims or plot devices than as characters \u00bfand do you pretend I take all your plot seriously with that cast of characters?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogues and the interaction between the characters are almost as bad as themselves. To name one of many examples: Chapter 4 was particularly stupid, another \"friendly girl\" of another class receives a love letter, but since she doesn't know what love is, she makes the only \"logical\" choice she has: Asks MC, with which she hasn't crossed more than 10 words before, that he pretends to be his boyfriend to reject the girl who sent her the letter... \u00bfdo you realize how contradictory and senseless it all sounds? How many cliches in such a forced situation, literally a beautiful girl with big tits fell from the sky to the MC without personality of turn and asked him to be her boyfriend \"because yes\" so that in the end he gave a sermon to her and he remains as a mature guy... a complete situation of self-insertion that also adds little or nothing to the development of the series (like almost everything else up to that point). Then in chapter 5 we have the almighty MC advising a \"shy girl\" to be honest with herself and only with these simple words that anyone could say is enough to make her fall in love, from this point this character (whose excessive shyness is FREAKING ANNOYING, \"Best Girl\" my balls) only dedicated to fanservice by trying romantic approaches with the MC... Ah, and let's not forget in Chapter 11 when the MC tells Ibuki that he trusts her and immediately she falls in love with these \"Pretty words\" like a whole Rem\u2014 submissive dependent \u00a1Of course he is not a self-insert! Similar situations happened throughout the series, which are summarized in boring dialogues and sometimes so edgys and out of place that give pity, and relationships so forced that feel false, the characters are not related naturally, but because the plot says.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSeriously \u00bfWhy do you praise series like this and score them so high? At this point more than one will think that I am a bitter, but if you look at my list you may notice that I am someone of simple and irreverent tastes, and doesn't prevent me to enjoy series like this or any other series that even I may consider bad, but in this particular case, when the flaws are so conspicuous, the plot pretends to be taken so seriously by putting such ridiculous and stupid situations that it is impossible to do so, development is disastrous and the characters are so horrible and poorly characterized, even with low demands (because it would be idiotic to expect a \"Mushishi\" or a \"Rakugo\" from series like these, right? The correct thing for these genres is to lower the requirement to have something at least enjoyable) the same mediocrity of the series prevents you from enjoying it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis BY FAR IS NOT AOTY. And no, it's not that \"the show started good and became bad in its second part\", the series already started bad and became worse with the passing of the chapters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will end with a phrase that summarizes this anime: that something looks good on paper or looks different at first glance, doesn't imply that it will be good.\\n",

            "content": "Basically, if anyone has seen Oregairu then you will probably see the parallels. in fact, as someone who has seen Oregairu, and liked it, I see more than parallels - I see a ripoff. Except it isn't a good ripoff - by making the protagonist hyper-competent he can't Hachiman (pretend not to care and play scapegoat at the same time) his way through the story, and that takes a lot away from the narrative. In fact, the protagonist Ayanokouji reminds me most of Kirito - a soul-less, personality-deprived screen for an anxious otaku to project themselves onto. the two main girls - Horikita and Kushida,play the roles of Yukino and Yui from Oregairu, respectively, and fail to varying degrees, but I cannot elaborate on why because that would be a spoiler (who cares though?). \\n\\n\r\nAnother show this reminds me of is Hyouka, where they also have detective work in school. except that there, it is done in a very classically Sherlockian fashion (with references to the works of Conan Doyle and other great detective authors) and it looks insane. here, it's just plain bullshit because they gloss over all the details that actually make a detective subplot fun and go straight to the artificial drama that this show is awfully fond of. \\n\\n\r\nAnother similar show to this one is this season's Kakegurui - both are set in an elite school, both have a cast of obnoxious and unnecessarily-dicky characters, both have red uniforms and both have fan service. except Kakegurui is a cock-tease with a gambling twist and it flaunts this shamelessly at every chance it gets, while this show aspires to being intelligent in the same way that the BBC version of Sherlock does. and it doesn't work. because telling the audience that the story is smart doesn't make it so - as an author, you have to show it. \\n\\n\r\nthis show's usage of pretentious quotes reminds of Call of Duty 4, except that they're a little less out-of-place here, but, of course, the series fails to make full use of the opinions of great historical thinkers.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has been to a boarding school I find the premise of this show just plain retarded. shutting people off from the outside world for THREE YEARS is a terrible idea - they will begin to view their artificial world as the real world, and you don't want that. what you would get in that case would be \"elite\" assholes who would know nothing about how the world really works, and hence be completely inept once they graduate. no meritorious university would want to touch these people with a 3 metre pole. and not giving them the rulebook? why? to create some contrived hoops for characters to jump through to increase the runtime? I must say I'm not hopeful.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen 4 episodes so far and I don't like how bored I am of it, but I have recently found that I am more entertained by bad anime than I am by good anime, so I fully intend to finish this one. who knows, maybe this \"elite\" classroom can surprise me.",

This show takes pleasure in cheerfully stunning its audience by strongly commencing with an interesting setup that only gets diluted as the show proceeds yet still manages to land strong with its ending! The story is nothing unique since it revolves around students trying to top their class by making more points. What works in this standard setting is the play along of strong, interesting characters which help elevate the plot to an enjoyable watch. The pointsystem introduced into the story felt oddly fresh, working in the show\u2019s favour since it brought about essential character development. This leads me to the last arc, which was both a blessing and a curse! The pacing issues became more evident here which hurt the show\u2019s momentum. (Personally, I felt like the story started losing steam once they got out of school). And now this anime has some backlash due to that 1 fanservice episode, I don\u2019t mind it much since I understand it\u2019s importance. But I would have rather opted for this episode to be allotted on story instead because it could have helped wash away the few plot holes that exists! However, the way how this arc wrapped up was more than satisfactory, making it my fav arc of the season!\\n\\n\r\nWhat truly sets this anime apart is its characters and the point system really helped establish their different personalities. Furthermore, we get mini arcs for various people that help shed light on them without taking away the spotlight from our main characters. (Solid Writing!) I liked how each class was represented with respect to individuality, from the bullish domain of class C leader to the dual leader contest among class A, etc. This really helped establish the students of other classes as real people rather than some background characters, which also meant they presented a real threat to our MC as well. If I were Ayanokouji, I would seriously watch out for Sakayanagi because she played her cards very well this season! (I feel like she will be a hard roadblock to climb for Ayano since she might be on to him) And some character arcs do not conclude, most probably left for another season. Horikita is the main girl of the show who\u2019s an interesting person, coming across as a mere tsundere at 1st glance but turns out to be just more than that. Her surprise relationship with the student council and interesting setup of falling from grace (metaphorically) to class D has her uptight and fixated on a single goal. Yet it\u2019s this ironclad sight of hers that alienates her from the rest, making her unpopular and unapproachable in class. But enters a boy and her life changes! Slowly, but surely, Ayanokouji breaks down her defences and his efforts aren\u2019t wasted because his constant efforts makes Horikita more likable, eventually ending up on good terms with her classmates. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now to Ayano who\u2019s easily the most unique MC of 2017 and by far the best aspect of this show, I mean the air is filled with intrigue as you slowly peel off the layers from this guy! It was a pleasure to take this journey with him despite the show trying to present him as an uninteresting character. Behind his deadpan look and those cold, lifeless eyes reclines a manipulative and calculative mind which misses nothing! His attention to details will catch you by surprise and his attitude to problem-solving makes us spellbind to him since it provides a stimulating mechanic to the already evoking plot. I mean look at how well he was able to tame the once smart and proud Horikita towards the end! Ayano is viewed and presented in the anime as a troubled individual with a shady past. His early life is just as mysterious as his present (Only shown a few short scenes of where he grew up) but once you understand how he was raised, you get to know Ayanokouji better. (And the teacher knowing all this was astounding) You recognize with his way of thinking, his view of all other people beside himself, his obsession with winning by trumping over everyone, his choice of avoiding all spotlights in order to pull every string by controlling everyone, all of this starts to make sense once you glimpse at his past. Yet you don\u2019t fully realize this until the very end when the curtain is lifted to reveal the final act! This is because the story itself presented him in a manner of making me think the best for him despite the anime dropping hints of otherwise! We were being misled into thinking he wants to connect with his new classmates and cares about what they think of him. But that was all an act! Which is why the twist at the end really hammers you with reality by opening your eyes to the truth. The truth being, he prefers to remain in shadows, he prefers the role of a puppeteer, they all are playing his game! After all he did build a strong class by uniting everyone behind a capable leader which gives him the safety of time and space to micromanage everyone! He is devoid of any other emotion aside from winning, whatever else we felt never really existed or at least they never came from his side. Top marks to the writer for perfectly giving us viewers a full realized character!  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style for characters were good and distinguishable. (For me Ayano\u2019s look reminded me of Karma from \u201cAssassination Classroom\u201d) I liked how you could tell at 1st glance which characters would be popular and which a troublemaker. The animation was nicely portrayed delivering on the Action and Drama well. The best thing were the eyes of the characters, they had a certain incandescent glow to them which always managed to get my attention. The OP is deceptively cheerful while ED is more on the calm side. The soundtrack is particularly good during the upbeat moments of the story. Voice Acting was good on both grounds, though the Subs were a tad bit better than the Dubs.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I had a blast with this anime! It\u2019s nowhere Perfect but it far exceeded my expectations and that counts as a win! While pacing was a little off and some parts of the story were predictable but the sheer writing brilliance in the character arc of Ayano brings a whole new level of uncertainty to the plot which only increases the audience excitement. The show leaves on a high note, doesn\u2019t give everything away but grand enough to make us desire for more so let\u2019s hope for S2. Because I am very thrilled to see how Ayano is going to reply to the following, \u201cIcarus did no heed Daedalus\u2019 Warning\u201d",

            "content": "Is it dread; is it disappointment? No, it's even worse. It\u2019s welcome to the classroom of the elite\u2019s opening line: \u201cIf I may, I\u2019d like to pose this question: Are human beings truly equal?\u201d In a single moment, the writer has already shown that he is a talentless hack and has exemplified in a neat sentence why this show is awful. He began with this line thinking that it would make him look intelligent, but all it did was make him look edgy and stupid. Starting a story out with an obvious, rhetorical question shows that youwant to show off how cool and smart you are touching on \u201cdeeper\u201d theme like you ever even knew what that meant. And the way the show precedes every episode with a title card displaying a quote of a famous philosopher makes me want to take the author with me to the grave from how disappointing it is to see the names of people whose intelligence not just dwarfs, but annihilates the \u201cintelligence\u201d of this clueless writer of this light novel on his piece of shit that he cobbled together. Another thing this awful opening line tells me is that the author is not discrete at all - not one bit -, and he has to constantly shove everything down the audiences\u2019 throats because not only is he not good enough to show instead of telling, he has to make sure that they don\u2019t miss of spoonful of shit going down their throat.  The final thing this line tells me is that this show will take itself to seriously and be even worse for it because the writer probably can\u2019t write well enough to make serious scenes that are both well crafted, smart, and engaging.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet\u2019s talk about how this man knows nothing about writing characters.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that if you took a picture of the cast of My youth romantic comedy SNAFU and pit it against this shlock, you\u2019d see the blatant \u201cinfluences\u201d (borderline theft) that come from that other, better show. He thought that he was fit enough to also write a smart, cool show. Little did he know that not knowing what makes a story work when trying to incorporate elements of it (or the whole thing) into your own show, doesn\u2019t turn out very well. While the main cast of My youth romantic comedy SNAFU has some level of depth to them. Like Hachiman, the main character of the show, being both lazy, when it comes to what he wants to do in life, straight-forward, cutting to the chase when most people would fluff things up, and a loner, not working well with others and preferring to do things his own way and not really meshing well in groups. This show has none of that. All the characters can be boiled down to one thing. The main guy is \u201cmysterious\u201d; The main girl is \u201cuptight\u201d/\u201cstraight-forward\u201d; the secondary girl is \u201ccutesy\u201d/\u201dfriendly\u201d. The author seems to look over the fact that people are more complex than this. How many times do you find someone that when you get to know them really, that all they have for personality is one trait and one trait only. None. When every character only has one-character trait, they become boring and predictable because they only react one way to everything, they resemble a computer more than a human, and they\u2019re not layered enough to be relatable and engaging to watch. Even the main character, who we follow around the whole time and are in his head constantly, has nothing more too him than a guy who doesn\u2019t talk much whose \u201cmysterious\u201d. The author tries to write him as badass, intuitive, and analytical, but he\u2019s none of those things. Even if there are a few scenes of him being kind of aggressive, he\u2019s too passive most of the time for it to matter. He\u2019s not intuitive because what the author passes off as smart is average or below average ideas. I\u2019ll leave the last point for later. Another thing that gets on my nerves is how serious the tone tries to be.  Every character takes things way and I mean wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too seriously. They\u2019re all in high school, they act stupid, and they\u2019re all boring and edgy as fuck and the author expects that I take this seriously and be engaged? Hell no. They act so serious and so gangster to the point where it\u2019s not only fake but childishly fake. They might as well all be playing pretend. Actually. If they were all playing pretend, I\u2019d be more engaged. At least then I\u2019d know the characters weren\u2019t taking this seriously which would lift off some of the disappointment. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters may act like rocks, but the crap that leaves their mouths\u2026 It\u2019s all a big mesh of boring blah. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. Most of the show is boring, pseudo-intellectual dialogue that makes my brain go blank from all the stupid. Dumping piles and piles of information with no interesting visuals, scenes, facial expressions, body language, or anything of the sorts. Just really, really bad dialogue that is supposed to be deep, philosophical, and important. Too bad he can\u2019t write anything resembling that if his life depended on it. About how I was talking about how the main character was \u201canalytical\u201d earlier, well I feel that it\u2019s only fitting here. When we are treated to dialogue by our lord and savior, the great Ayame, our main character, it is\u2026 awful. Our author decided that stating the obvious passed for analytical. I don\u2019t even think he understands what it means to analyze something because all that happens is the audience sees something and our main character states exactly what just happened because we're all mentally deficient\u2026 Whoops, I spelled the author wrong. The other thing our main character does beside stating the obvious is spouting vague crap about friendship, equality, innocence, life, and other topics as if they were valuable words of advice. HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA. Yeah right, try again next time when you can actually write worth a damn.\\n\\n\r\n\tA little interjection here. I want to say how most to none of the logic adds up in the show when you think about it for more than a second. He doesn\u2019t know how to write and he also has no grasp on the concept of logic.\\n\\n\r\n\tI think it would only be fitting to close with the structure. The one that this show lacks. Scenes in this show just don\u2019t mesh together. Not once scene. For instance, in the beginning of the show, there\u2019s a bus scene, and it\u2019s completely pointless. The scene is already stupid on its own, but it serves no purpose other than to show the authors point about people not being equal, I guess? I don\u2019t know, but this goes for a lot of what happens in the show. It\u2019s usually pointless and not only that but boring. Scenes are just hobbled together like nothing and were expected to just go along with it? Another thing is the pacing of this show. It\u2019s horribly slow. Scenes go on for way too long. They get their point across, like in the first scene, but then they overstay their welcome. Once the audience gets the point, there\u2019s no more reason to keep on going. Does he want the ideas to stir? Does he think after he gets his point across he can try and instill some emotion in the audience? I don\u2019t know, but I think people are smart enough to get the point once it\u2019s presented, yet I don\u2019t think you're good enough to instill any other emotion than contempt, disappointment, boredom, and unintentional laughter. \\n\\n\r\n\tSo that concludes my taking a dump on this offensive, wasteful piece of media that should be burned in the flames of hell as to never come back. If you want to watch this, at least ditch it for My youth romantic comedy SNAFU. I may have problems with it, but it's still a trillion times better than whatever this writer shat out of his miniscule mind. So have an awful day and welcome to the classroom of the brain-dead. \\n",

            "content": "Now, its no secret that the Japanese people love their high school anime. This can be easily seen in the fact that every season, more than 40% of the shows are related to high schools. This is also a fact that school has been one of the most cliched genres. However its also true that every once in a while, we do receive shows that have something out of the ordinary and can be described as interesting and fortunately enough for us, this show too falls in the later category. \r\nThe Classroom of Elites is an anime produced by studio Lerche and is based offthe light novel of the same name. At first this show had the vibe of orgairu , with a loner  protagonist and an antisocial female lead , However  ,as the story progresses ,one will realize that the show is skillfully hiding its true colors and is  rather  dark and has many hidden  themes and unique characters which makes it different that most other shows. Also the show skillfully completely shatters the idea of the normal education system seen in many other high school shows, and shows a completely new system where rather than grades, you need other skills to survive and also how you need to play dirty with others to reach to the top. It is actually a  representation of the true face of today's society .\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, The characters here are actually the key element of the show and most of them have more than one dimension . Many characters seem to have a different personality than what they show to everyone. The protagonist on the surface might seem like a average guy with average grades and he doesn't stand out much. But watching the show will make you realize that there is a lot more to him than meets the eyes. He is extremely strong, both academically and physically and has an unexplained dark past but he tries to hide all of his skills in order to not stand out and lead a peaceful life. Horikita, The female lead has a more linear personality, She doesn't have friends and nor is interested in having one .She is also determined to get promote to class A , tho she has realized that it would be impossible without aynokoji's help .The side characters also have very diverse personalities and no two people have same personality. Like kushida ,who tho seems to be friendly and kind ,actually has a very dark and sadistic personality which not many are aware of. The characters here represent the dual faced nature of the society and how people misguide other for their benifits. For example ayanokyoji's character clearly represents the type of people who use others as tools and manipulate them. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is also more of a unique take on the genre and the system of schools and it also covers many dark themes , like discrimination and inequality in the society and also things like social hierarchy which is not many anime, especially ones like this cover . The different characters also represent different types of people and personalities in the society .The pace of progression of the story is somewhat irregular as the things were going very smoothly during the first half, tho during the second half , the show seemed to have slowed down a bit with little interesting or major events . The order of the events and pace of character development and also character relationships had been altered and were really different from the source material. The Music of the show is great. The op is really well done and it creates a hype for the episode and the ed is nice and slow paced which smoothly ends the entire episode. The animation is also pretty fine and the art style is great (especially those eyes).\\n\\n\r\nThe D class is full of characters with great potential but were still thrown in garbage due to their defectiveness. Almost everyone has a certain element of defect which holds them from getting a better class. They are shown to have a normal face on the cover, but deep inside many of them have a twisted personality which they don't want anyone to find out, Ayanokyoji for instance, perhaps has the most twisted personality as he views people as tools and is ready to sacrifice anything for his gain, and is good at manipulating others. People like Hirata and Kushida also have a dark personality which is rarely seen and is not known by anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major plus points is the treatment of the characters. The show actually treats the characters well and they also have certain level of sensibility in them, which is sadly not seen in most other shows. On many occasions we can see people actually putting their brains to analyse the situations and not just go with the flow ,And this actually stops various moments from becoming cliches . best example is when ayanokoji was asked to pretend to be ichinose's boyfriend. Tho one major problem is that there are there are too many characters and most focus is given to only a few ones and others are not given enough time, so all this prevents many of them to get the screen time they deserve. But there are various ones who easily caught my eye , without even having been shown more than once or twice. Also the show still has various plot holes and mysteries  and there is a lot of potential for a season 2, however we can't really be sure about such things. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, This show is not for everyone. There are many like me who would enjoy it but also this new concept is not suited for everyone. To me this show feels fresh and is seems different from most of the other high school anime. The characters are truly remarkable and the story is good enough to keep the viewers interested. All characters are memorable and interesting, especially the protagonist. The show also covers various themes about the society and shows the dual faced nature of the people. And for everyone who are not bothered by the feel of this anime, All of these things combined together makes for a great 12 episode watch, and makes you crave for even more.",

            "content": "I think that this anime isn't very newbie friendly. The story is pretty confusing, there is no the usual \"OP character\" or main stream background like magic,etc.\r\nStory. I think they really miss this one. Usually the Story revolve around the MC, but they only scratch it. They tease about each MC backstory but give a full story about it. I hope they wait for enough material from the LN to make it a 25 episode/2 season. It's like watching the first SAO and end it at Aincrad Arc.\r\nArt. Tomose Shunsaku, if you play some VN or eromanga you might know this person. I got tosay the art is very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound. There is really nothing worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Each of the MC have pretty interesting history, and some...twist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. You should probably watch it in one go. The story is pretty slow and there is no interesting episode. Most of them relied of next episode explanation about what the hell happen in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it should be a good anime but they rushed it and just destroyed potentially a very good anime. If you're haven't watch it, I recommended to hold it and wait the 2nd season.",

            "content": "Ah, another LN adaptation with a name so long it's practically a story in and of itself? What could possibly go wrong?! \r\nNow, YJSSK isn't exactly... bad? (I suppose). It's definitely not the worst basic LN adaptation I've seen, but that's not exactly a merit considering the standards. It suffers from pretty much the same issues any of these LNs suffer: it's set in high school. Now, I know that the target demographic are the teenagers, and this cheesy stuff is written for young boys & girls, but it always feels just... wrong, especially in terms of dialogue. How old is our MC? 14-15? Andthe very first time he speaks, he says \"Is this world equal?\". I mean... \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, another issue that shows of the similar nature share is that there is no story. There is no 'ultimate goal'. Now, that would be fine if it was SoL (that way I would have just skipped it), but it's not. It wants to have a narrative. It wants to have a narrative so bad it can't help but keep beating viewers over the head with pointless exposition, 'mysteries', and attempts at some profound, epic storytelling that just goes nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the basic set-up, it doesn't have anything unique to offer (well, to be fair, even the set-up has been done before). It just feels like you're watching a bunch of pretentious kids live their daily lives in uninspiring fashion. \\n\\n\r\nThe drags of the story just keep on coming, as it tries to branch itself out far too much to the point that it all just loses meaning. What's MC's goal? Help MG get to class A? Look, if you're going to make it that bare bone, just don't have the ultimate goal in the first place. What's the MG's goal? To get into Class A. Why? 'Cause she's insecure, I suppose. There's no coherent narrative to glue all the things that are happening together, so it just feels like a bunch of events strung together in a somewhat chronological order. \\n\\n\r\nWhile pace isn't absolutely atrocious, it is far too slow for the type of a show it wants to be. It wants to be a flimsy comedy. It wants to be a mystery. It wants to be a romance. Thing is, ALL of those genres thrive on thrills. Comedy requires constant movement. Mystery demands constant thrill of discovery that leads to more questions. Romance needs constant banter. Yet, this show has none of that. Comedy is rare, and it relies on your basic anime formula. Mysteries are thin and are left hanging for no reason (ex. 1 'mystery' is introduced in the 3rd episode, and it is referenced maybe 3-4 times until ep. 8. By that I mean that MC just reminds us it's there, but it moves nowhere; that's absolute garbage way to do it). \\n\\n\r\nSuspense is lost, light mood is as rare as days when I don't hate people, romance is absolutely nowhere to be found (well, if we exclude like 2-3 cheap moments that ONLY viewers can witness and understand), absolutely nothing of importance happens. And then we get to ep. 7 and 8. Pointless fanservice episode followed by half an episode of fanservice and half an episode of something random that has NO tie in to whatever narrative they were going for. Going to the island to survive? Wtf? Where did this come from?! \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters... eh, I suppose it's not as bad as the story. Although no character has an actual, normal motive for doing anything (well, aside from 1 guy who wants to play basketball but can't 'cuz he's dumb; and the general motive of 'we gotta study cuz points). In the end, we're left with a bunch of holier-than-thou teens that keep shoving ideologies onto one another, and we're just asked to side with whatever character we see as 'right'. \\n\\n\r\nMC is your basic edgy-teen that's as big of a hypocrite as you can find. He keeps saying \"I just want to remain passive and pass these years\", yet he keeps meddling into everyone's business like there's no tomorrow. Yeah, sure, he has that 'cool' factor about him (again, mysteries that go nowhere and are barely mentioned), but cool isn't = good character. \\n\\n\r\nMG is just a girl with bro-complex. There you go; that's her 'thing'. Every character in this anime just has a 'thing'. MC is 'cool'. MG is 'insecure'. 2nd MG is... eh, that's kind of a spoiler. That basketball guy is loud. These aren't characters, just basic templates. At least, save for MC, most other characters stick to their template. Until... 'plot'... demands otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, I guess the anime is passable. It's average, at best. I felt bored during some episodes, but for the most part it managed to keep me interested somewhat, which is why I managed to finish 8 episodes, and will most-likely finish the entire show. Can the last 4 episodes change my view of the show? Probably not. Without even seeing them, I can already imagine it'll play out similarly to the show's previous... arcs? Some classmate gets in trouble, MC swooshes in to save the day, everyone's like 'whoa, pay attention to MC, he's really, REALLY mysterious'. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that episodes 6-7-8 all feel like completely different shows. Absolutely NOTHING connects ep. 6 to 7 or 8. It's as if they just skipped an entire volume of LN and left the viewers to connect the dots themselves. Sure, whatever. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite follows in the footsteps of anime like My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and Assassination Classroom that offer a more jaded perspective on high school life. For this anime, school life for the students runs on a merit-based system where students earn points to cover everyday living expenses based on their grades and behavior on the campus. The main character of focus in this series is Kiyotaka Ayanokouji, a seemingly ordinary student who is part of the first year D class where the school's inferior students are placed.\r\nClassroom of the Elite's jaded approach on high school life is that equality's a shamand it's showing the students that life is completely unfair. The school system within the series is deliberately set up to weed out students oblivious to the manipulative and deceitful nature of many of the staff and students, valuing only those with the intelligence and abilities to see through them. Much of the anime's focus is on Class D overcoming the school's adversity to improve their academic performance and behavior, as the points they earn for their livelihood is dependent on everyone working together cohesively as a class. An interesting element to relevant characters introduced within Class D is that each student has some sort of personal flaw that led to them being entered within said class, such as Horikita's inability to trust others and Kushida's genki gal personality being a facade. There is gradual growth from some of these characters to overcome their personal flaws, though not to a sufficient degree due to the anime having an inconclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnother entertaining element to the series are the games of strategy that the classes have against one another. Classroom of the Elite runs on a few episodes arcs where the members of Class D often have to plan and sort out how to overcome a specific crisis facing their class. Each arc devotes enough time to explore how the characters are thinking through developments and the plans they have in mind to either avert the situation, swing events in their favor, or allow more to be revealed about the circumstances of the current situation. For the most part, the series did a great job dropping hints, and offering concise logic and motive with the actions performed by the characters within each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThese solid story elements aside, Classroom of the Elite does have its fair share of hiccups. The series does usually get derailed by some fan pandering that detracts from its more cerebral focus, in particular an episode ran in the middle of its run that is mostly an excuse to feature fan service from showing the characters in bathing suits for a pool episode. Kiyotaka's very character is also a bit of a double-edged sword. While shown to have hidden intellectual talents that he's obviously hiding from the class and hints dropped of having an ulterior motive for being at the school, the series doesn't dabble too much into his character's backstory and never really has a chance to develop due to the anime's inconclusive ending, an obvious dilemma due to its light novel source material still being ongoing as of this review. The very premise of the series could also prove to be a barrier for some viewers, as many characters in the series can be quite unlikeable at many points to go along with the anime's more cynical perspective of high school life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall in spite of its mixed reception, I actually found Classroom of the Elite to be rather solid in the execution of its premise exploring the struggles of Class D and showing some solid psychological focus on some of the characters thoughts and machinations. While having its flaws, its premise is still unique enough where I'd at least recommend checking it out at least once.",

This anime has a story plot that is almost the same as the anime Oregairu and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, arguably a merger between the anime Oregairu and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu.\r\nStoryline\r\nTalk about a school that plays with the mentality of its students by not pinning the binding rules and letting its students be free. They were given 100,000 yen per month and slowly began to waste money. In the classroom they are left free to talk and do other things like playing games or reading comics regardless of teacher. Students lose the senseof the rules and become more free. It may sound like this is a school paradise, but who would have thought? It turns out that the money given by the school is the valuation or price of the students. The more useful they are, the higher their prices, and vice versa. The offense will be considered useless and zero. The value of zero means zero, then their monthly money will also be given as much as zero yen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe main character in this anime is Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. A boy who likes to be alone, quiet, and also not sociable. Ayanokouji is inserted into class D, where the school discredits the \"lowly\" student. Because of a reason, Ayanokouji deliberately lowered his value, resulting in him entering class D. The nature of Ayanokouji after meeting with Horikita Suzune and Kushida Kikyou, who also included other main characters in this anime as well as all his classmates. This made the situation of Ayanokouji begin to change, and began clever friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nCan not be denied, I just know this one studio. Because I think it's still a new studio but the art is already pretty, even the most prominent is the eye. Animation is also above the average let alone the shadingnya.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nFor Openingnya depending on your taste, if I think it's just ordinary. But, if Endingnya I like to sound mellow - melow so. Opening entitled \"Caste Room\" performed by ZAQ and Ending titled \"Beautiful Soldier\" by Minami.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nStreet Story: 10 / 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 910 / 10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nsound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPlot an interesting, Clear, and Qualified story. One thing to keep in mind from this anime, this anime story is full of tricks. maybe you guys who watch it will get annoyed.",

            "content": "Going into classroom of the elite, it's easy to be fooled; you see a loner protagonist who isn't popular in school and you're already mentally preparing yourself for the alien vampire transfer student with ridiculous knockers and the fallen meteor that gives our protagonist superpowers, but that's not how it goes.\r\nWhat you get in the end is a surprisingly cerebral drama based around sociopaths and delinquents being basically thrown into a freak show and our protagonist having to work his way out, if I had to draw a parallel to another well known franchise I'd say this anime is The Fruit of Grisaia but much,much smarter and with an actual coherent plot rather than just the mc getting to know 1 girl per episode for little payoff.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people didn't give this anime a fair shake and reading some of these 3 and 5 reviews it's obvious why, they fell into the trap of expecting a brainlet titty harem anime but what they got at the end was something that only an older viewer who has watched a lot of stuff can usually appreciate. I guarantee that if this anime was 12 episodes of the girls getting caught changing and accidentally flashing pantsus all the 3s would be 7s and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is an anime review rather than a meta review of MAL itself so I'll say this, this anime's art is absolutely beautiful, the sound is just fine, the story is compelling and really makes you wonder 'how will they get out of this mess?' just as any good drama should and all of the characters are done absolutely brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is S tier at what it set out to be, all that remains is whether you're the right viewer for it. If you just want dumbed down titty flashes or nonstop action then obviously you won't enjoy this, this isn't some isekai fantasy or super power shounen, it's just a brilliant intriguing drama about a fucked up highschool with fucked up people.\\n\\n\r\nOnly reason I would ever hesitate to recommend this is because I've heard lots of murmurs that season 2 won't be happening, and at 12 episodes this will definitely leave you wanting more.\\n\r\nThat being said I haven't seen any evidence of this so go ahead and watch this, you won't (shouldn't) regret it.\\n\\n\r\n~Jgod sama",

            "content": "No Spoilers, TLDR at the end of each section\r\nStory (4/10)\r\nClassroom of the Elite follows students of Class D, also known as the misfits and inferior student, as they struggle in the school and try to become Class A. Specifically, it follow the seemingly uninterested protagonist Ayanokouji Kiyotaka. The premise is amazing and I was expecting a serious, drama filled, version of Baka to Test. Instead, at episode seven the series completely changes. The first six episodes take place in a school setting with school problems. Even in the case of Sakura Airi\u2019s problem, although it's not directly school related, the way the school functions andis set up plays an important part in how the issue is dealt with.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode seven is when there is a clear tone shift, from serious school drama you get lighthearted fanservice. While it was not what fans signed up for, it okay to have one filler episode, even if it is a twelve episode series. The problem with the pool episode was that the fanservice it accomplished would be provided in the following episodes. The students go to a cruise, and then an island, and the cruise presents time for bathing suit shenanigans. The pool episode was a waste of precious time that this series need. From episode eight onwards, the series focuses on one arc of the characters on the cruise and island. Some may argue that the five episodes used for this important arc were too few, but I would say that if they had paced themselves better the problem would be less severe. For the first part of this arc, you have the characters wandering around, doing nothing much in particular, at least nothing important to the plot. When the series finally seems to be aware of the fact that is is ending, it rushes through the second part, leaving it a jumbled mess. It becomes plainly incoherent. The last episode manages to wrap things up rather well considering the mess it followed. While it was by no means excellent, the last episode closed plot holes and baited viewers to a season two. My main issue with the episode was that it had too little time to accomplish everything it was after, rushing took away possible enjoyability of the story, and that it assumed that the viewers were dumb. Points that were made clear to the viewer just by watching the show were hammered into us like it was a revelation. It is hard to say exactly how without spoilers, but I\u2019ll give you my best comparison. It acted as if it revealed the who committed the murder in a mystery while it actually was saying Light is actually Kira. It treats information we already know as a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Premise was great, after episode six the story changed and it got worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was amazing. Hands down, I got to give credit where it is due. The characters were incredibly easy to distinguish from one another. While the female character have mostly the same face structure, their eyes and expressions differ greatly. The males had more variety of facial structure as well as similar amounts of differences in their eyes and expressions. There were interesting design choices made for some characters, such as Sudou Ken, which allowed an escape from the usual character designs. The antagonistic characters would win my design award, they were completely different from each other and I wasn\u2019t able to off the top of my head call out ten other characters that look like them. \\n\\n\r\nNot only was the character design good, but the actual animation of characters and their motions. Ex. Kushida\u2019s face. Enough said. The eyes in this series were incredibly expressive, sometimes just a look could tell you exactly what a character was thinking. The only character that this didn\u2019t seem to apply to was Ayanokouji, which was done on purpose. Even with characters such as him, the series was able to convey his personality through the way he walked and stood. Overall, the series did a good job on its characters. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, a series isn\u2019t only made up of character art. The overall environment in the series well well drawn and visually appealing. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; I loved the art, characters unique, backgrounds nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the anime was really nice, it completed the scenes without distracting. Relied a lot on simple sounding piano music. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors in the series were quite good, all of them got into their characters perfectly. I would give my props to Ayanokouji and Kushida. Ayanokouji\u2019s voice actor nailed the flat tone bored voice without making it boring to us. The lines that were executed sarcastically were also done with great timing and inflection. Kushida\u2019s voice actor did a good transition between two different voices.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; great music, great voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, like their appearances, were quite unique. The basis of each character made you want to learn more about them, or let you identify them immediately. At the beginning of the series you see the foundation for the slow build  in character development. You want to figure out what is behind Ayanokouji\u2019s boredom as well as why he\u2019s so strangely op, you want to know what is up with Horikita and her brother, about why Kushida acts the way she does, even the minor characters are so interesting that you want to learn about them. Unfortunately, like the story, any hope for good character development goes away at episode seven. Some characters at later episodes receive pushed developments that are so fake the character would be better off without them. Ayanokouji as well, the series tries to do a big reveal, but it really falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Characters were promising, but development went to shit along with the story \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe series started off really strong, and I was really enjoying it for half the season. The second half of the season was much weaker, and in terms of quality it suffered. Despite that, I kept watching the show. Some enjoyment was still there, but significantly less.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Beginning was really enjoyable, second half not really, but I still kept watching it so points for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nI came to this show with high expectations, I thought that it would be my favorite of this season. While the show started off great, the decline in story, character development, and enjoyment from episode seven on really affected my perspective. The decline in in story and character might be due to difficulty dealing with the arc, which is why I had wished they hadn\u2019t put in a filler episode. If there was a season 2, I would watch it, but I would also hope they would learn from their mistakes of season one and I would have lower expectations.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Great potential, failed execution\\n\\n\r\nMean Score: 7\\n",

            "content": "Never wrote a review before and english is not my first language so hope you guys understand if I do some Orthographical errors, anyways... This show is amazing so far. (will try to evade spoilers the best I can)\r\nLets start by what most anime fans thought when they watched the trailer, they thought it would be a Oregairu like anime and until the final moments of the first episode it really looked like it, but them like a explosion the anime starts to show itself, this anime its nothing like others, I cant even say if its cliche when everything nowadays are cliche, because ofhow umpredictable it is (only predictable thing so far was about a certain ''nice character'' but even that turned out way more than I expected), this anime teases like no other making you want to see next episode, with is a good thing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that remained like oregairu in this anime is the cast of main characters, horikita and ayanokoji really looked like Hikigaya and yukino and thats is a good thing (anyone who watched oregairu will understand, if you didnt go watch right now!), they are really interesting characters, they are really smart and manipulate people (generally for good) in an interesting way, but what makes it even better is how mysterious a lot of characters are principally the main character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a good main character this anime is for you (and mysterious at the same time), he is one of the biggest reasons you will want to watch this anime, just to know a simple question: Who is this guy? even thou there are a lot of mysteries in this anime, the one about the main character is the one you will look foward the most. One other thing about him is that he is expressionless (but not like nagato from haruhi and others like that, cause you can understand those characters feelings), you legit cant really know his emotions about anything in the anime, I am not even sure if he likes anyone in his class yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really good too but I cant really tell to where it will go (another good thing in my book), the only thing I can say for sure is that this isnt a normal school and there is competition between classes, cause like characters, the school is another mysterious element in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI am afraid thats is the maximun I can tell without spoiling this anime, I watched a lot of animes and every year there is a anime that will stay in your mind every time you remember that year, You Jitsu is PROBALLY one of then. I will only be able to say for sure if this anime is amazing when it ends, if you watch anime you guys all know how many light novel adaptations are really good but doesnt really end its story in the end and never gets a second season or simple start really good and then turn bad in the end (hello SAO), but with everything I said  and how it is going so far this anime is no less than a 9 and is a must watch of the season, actually of the year!\\n\\n\r\nPS: This anime's characters design are gorgeous.\\n\\n\\n",

Principally Ayanokouji, that for me, is one of the most non-clich\u00e9 characters of almost all of the animes, he is totally different from any otherMain Character (principally the Shounen's main characters), and that ending man, that ending was perfect!\\n\r\nAbout the other characters, they are great characters, the development of Horikita is great; And all of the characters of this show have a great personality.\\n\r\nArt and Animation. (7/10)\\n\r\nArt. (7/10)\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is a good art, but nothing more, just a good art...\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10)\\n\r\nLerche is a good studio, and their animations are good too, and Youkoso Jitsuryoku just got the same.\\n\r\nStory. (7/10)\\n\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku has a good story, with great characters and good elements, but nothing more.\\n\r\nEnjoyment. (10/10)\\n\r\nOhh, my enjoyment with this! I enjoyed this a lot, all things of this show, but I think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical, so, this part of the review is not critical, at least for me.\\n\r\nOverall. (9/10)\\n\r\nOne of other reason of why the anime don't take a ten, it is the ecchi fanservice, but it wasn't to much, just one thing that I would like to say, that is an error of the anime too.\\n\r\nSo, yeah, this show is great and I recommend to everyone that is reading this review!",

            "content": "How do you define someone whom is considered \"elite?\" Do you see a renowned individual known for their accomplishments? Someone who is definitively above average? I don't. Those whom claim themselves to be \"elite,\" are to me those who are lacking in character. To feel you are \"better\" than those around you, is not only in essence egotistical, but also evidence that you cannot identify your own shortcomings. \r\nThis anime functions along the same line of thought. Whilst we witness our cast attending Koudo Ikusei Senior High School it's clear that they are not the most likable or respectable group of people. Many in theclass tout their over-inflated sense of ego; and believe themselves to be \"elite.\"  \\n\\n\r\nGiven what I've written thus far, it makes little sense for me to rate this series an 8 out of 10. Well, let me get into the reasons why I enjoy this show even given this eccentric cast; and why I decided I wanted to review it in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nI highly appreciate our duet; the main character Ayanokouji and the main heroine Horikita. They strongly resemble Hikigaya, Hachiman and Yukinoshita, Yukino from Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru who were both characters that I adored. The reason I appreciate having these two as our leads is because they are fairly normal, and on some level respectable as people. They have very clear shortcomings, and still aren't upstanding models of human interaction; yet none the less they are a breath of fresh air in comparison to the rest of the school in which they reside. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing these two lead characters whom are fairly normal; and seem to have interesting elements behind their character and their reasons for developing into such people, is why I enjoy this show. It's interesting to see how these two behave given their situation and how they respond to the others in class; who are, well, not quite what one would consider normal. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that these two characters are very stoic and seemingly relaxed; it makes for an enjoyable show as they manage their way through an otherwise chaotic environment. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other elements of the show; such as a school point system which determines student \"worth,\" a ranking system for the classes that determines the allocation of these points, and more; but for me these aren't the focuses (though perhaps they are meant to be). For me the focus is actually the presented leads and less so the story around them; the story is simply a means of engaging these characters to understand them better. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, if it's not been made clear already I enjoy the leads of this show; and I enjoy watching the chaotic nature of the show unfold whilst watching these two handle it. The art is beautiful, the music isn't anything substantial but it's none the less enjoyable. I need not sing praises for the show; but I definitely think it's worth watching. If you have any interest in stoic main characters with realism heavy commentary like H-man, an unfolding environment of oddity, and a stereotypical yet at the same time noncomformative representation of \"elite,\" then give Classroom of the Elite a chance; you never know what you'll find. ~",

            "content": "When it comes to Light Novels adaptations, we, as anime watchers, haven't been blessed with the most original adaptations and this anime truly is a great example of that. However, just like with Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, I do believe that even if this anime is unoriginal, it's got something going for it.\r\nIn my opinion one of the biggest downfalls of this anime so far has been its inability to stay relevant to the question posed at the start, being \"are human beings truly equal?\" The anime constantly tries to bring the theme of inequality back, whether it be directly or indirectly, but it neverdoes so in a way that does not seem forced. Therefore the \"villains\" and the \"power constructs\" all seem laid out and awkward. It follows the standard principle of being in power means you're a bad person, who discriminates against those who aren't as powerful as you. That is, with a few exceptions. And while this isn't necessarily untrue, it would have been nice to have a clearer background on why this multi-layered community exists in a high school, because the show does a poor job at explaining character motives outside of the main heroine's.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, for a show that leads its viewers in with a deep question about inequality it does a very poor job at having that remain the focus of the story, and instead focuses too much on (in my eyes) unimportant high school shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's not all bad. Because even if the concept itself isn't exactly original, the writers did an excellent job by using the setting to make what would usually seem like boring and unimportant events seem important and therefore makes us feel intrigued. That said, when we analyse the events so far separately from the whole situation that these characters find themselves in, they seem very bland and uninspired. Like you'd see them in a bad filler episode of a high school slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I would like to say that I am very fond of the main character even if he is depthless much like any character so far. This depthlessness can partially be blamed on the fact that we've only had four episodes of content, and the anime itself is progressing at a slow/medium pace. That, as well as the interactions between the main character and the main heroine have lead me to believe that there truly is potential for this anime, it just has to follow the right track and has to somehow make the main cast members not seem uninspired when they do finally give them development. Either that, or they're not going to develop them at all, which would be interesting in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as art is concerned, I have no complaints at all. The art style itself is beautiful, especially the colouring on the eyes. While I would have preferred a bit of a darker artstyle for a show that is supposedly themed around \"inequality,\" I can't really complain about the quality of the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show itself is nothing we haven't seen before and it probably won't be in the future either. But even then, it has still kept me engaged during the time I was watching it and it is highly entertaining as long as you don't read into it too much.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore I give it a 6.5/10 so far, rounded up to a 7.",

            "content": "Great promising psychological show with a devolving story and an odd final chapter.\r\nStory & Writing: 7/10\r\nCharacters: 8/10\r\nAnimation: 4.5/5\r\nSound: 3.5/5\r\nAvg: 7.7/10\r\nClassroom of the Elite seems to want to be psychologically and philosophically profound, starting with one of the first sequences. You see moral dilemmas played out by these aspiring high schoolers, and it sets the tone that you're not watching typical heroic, predictable main characters.\r\nThis show is easy and enjoyable to watch. It covers a few arcs and the pacing is always solid. Unfortunately it's not meant to be 12 episodes. By the time you finish it, it feels like most deep character arcs were onlyglanced at, and you only understand a few motivations. Moreover, this is a serious show that manages to avoid Moe and goofiness but falls into a terrible pseudo-ecchi trap with unnecessarily ginormous breasts, odd swimsuit scenes, and an episode 100% dedicated to perversion.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is an extremely fascinating enigma, with glimmers of the conflicted MCs that we love, who play in the gray and balance manipulation and good intentions. The supporting characters are extremely engaging as well and one of the best parts of the show. The English voice acting is absolutely excellent and consistent. I didn't really notice music necessarily but I dig the OP a lot. It's one of my favorites and it sets the mood perfectly each time. The art is exquisite. They don't have to do much but each scene has beautiful detail and never falters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue is that the story loses steam. You can tell that they had ratings problems. This gripping developing story turns into an odd final 1/3 where a confusing test is supposed to push the students to psychological limits and quandaries, but you just end up missing their school interactions. If you can put up with inconsistent story direction, this is a brilliantly enjoyable and serious, adult, clever anime that I wish got more credit and was given a better chance to succeed by its creators.",

            "content": "Right from the get-go you could already see where this anime was leading. From the quotes that appear each episode to the overall vibe of the anime you could tell it was a melodrama school life anime.\r\nThe show had a decent start, showing off to the audience the main premise of the anime and what it will revolve around. The point system was.....unique, I'll give it that but I can't bring myself to say that its a good one. The reason being, yes it was something that caught my attention, but not long enough for me to last the entire series. \r\nAside from the maincast, all the other characters were pretty generic, and on top of that the story didn't really have that good of an execution. The concept in itself was, as I said, unique and I did want to find out how they manage to pull off getting more points than class A. But despite all that there were some instances where the execution was basically putting too much seasoning on a plain strip of ham. By that I mean they tended to overdo and overcomplicate an otherwise generic plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe highpoint of this anime was the reasoning of the main character and finding out how he'd deal with the different situations, but since I've watched Oregairu (and loved it) it was like watching Hikigaya Hachiman and his group with different hairstyles (but even their hairstyles look similar).\\n\\n\r\nThere was also a lot of character exposition but not much development. The only well developed characters of the series were the main cast, the rest seem pretty two dimensional. There are some characters that stand out, but thats because its what the anime intended (intentionally giving them flashy or unique features) but sadly they weren't developed too much. I mean the by the end of the anime I felt as if i had been watching a prologue due to the lack of content in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite all this I couldn't bring myself to hate the anime, in fact I even found it quite good. Once you get past the cheesy melodrama things they added, you'd see that there are a lot more layers to this anime than what was first given. As you get further into the anime you'll finally get to see the interesting mind games that would make your head really spin. Even the characters started to deviate from the Oregairu cast and became their own unique personas. On top of that, the entire thing was well animated and had good art and music. \\n\\n\r\nSadly this does happen in the latter part of the anime, so people tend to burn out by then. Or if they do watch, its out of obligation and they don't tend to enjoy it as much.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this show is an acquired taste. I mean if you'd look at the review section, they either scored really high or really low, but how you enjoy the anime is entirely up to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you like Oregairu, or any school life melo drama I have a feeling that you'd appreciate at least one thing in the show haha. If you are new to this genre feel free to give it a try.",

A manga has also been published, but the extent of its popularity has been limited.\r\nThe story, without giving too much away, is about a teenager named Ayanokoji Kiyotaka who starts attending the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, a prestigious school with high tuition and standards. Ayanokoji learns, along with his classmates in the D class, that the school has an interesting hierarchysystem, decided entirely by class points.\\n\\n\r\nNow to ratings.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could sum up this anime in one word it would be: Disappointing\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, it had so much potential. The characters COULD have been great, the art COULD have been great, the pacing and storyline COULD have been great. But it wasn't. It was downright disappointing. You may be wondering why I gave the anime a 5 overall, and my answer to that is \"Ayanokoji\". Ayanokoji is the reason I started watching this anime and the reason I could finish it. More on that later because I like to keep you in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 6, because the concept as a whole is fascinating and very attractive. Unfortunately, the pacing of this show is what made it as mediocre as it was. I absolutely hated the fact that there were only 12 episodes, a lot of content to get through, a filler, and episodes that were completely irrelevant to the story as a whole. The layout of the anime episodes went like this. \\n\r\nEpisode 1-2: Interesting but kind of slow\\n\r\nEpisode 3-4: Pretty good\\n\r\nEpisode 5-6: Boring, pretty irrelevant other than to introduce characters and motives\\n\r\nEpisode 7: Filler\\n\r\nEpisode 8-12: Rushed Battle Royale-esque arc with twists and turns but mainly boring af\\n\r\nYeah. The pacing was crap. Also, the cliffhanger at the end of every episode was downright frustrating, although I understand the reason for that.\\n\r\nOther than that, the story itself has great impact and is fairly unique and compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely disappointing in my opinion. Compared to the fresh and crisp art style of the light novel, the animation and character designs were nothing special. (I'm not an expert at art so I don't know the official words but what I'm trying to say is that the light novel was good and the anime not so good)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent. The voice actors didn't stick out much but they weren't bad. Many people liked the opening and ending, but neither of them stuck out to me, not that I was expecting much out of an anime like this...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Oh man. Okay. I disliked all the characters except Ayanokoji. The characters were such tropes. Some of them were too shallow. Others were too blind to notice anything about Ayanokoji. Some of them make no sense, and character development is shabby. \\n\r\nLet's start with Horikita. Horikita is the tsundere trope in this anime. Hot and cold black haired girl with a brother complex(?). Not very interesting in the anime, although I found her more bearable in the light novel. She is ignorant to Ayanokoji's real desires, as most of the other characters are.\\n\r\nNext up is Kushida. She was too shallow and self-centered for me to find any interest in her.\\n\r\nThen, Sakura. Quiet and meek with a scandalous secret. Spoiler alert, she likes Ayanokoji. She's more bearable than many other characters but is still pretty infuriating.\\n\r\nChabashira-Sensei was a good character. Seems to know more than she lets on, and I find that pretty nice, even though she acts way too stuck up all the time. She's power hungry and I don't understand what her motives are.\\n\r\nOther minor characters were also not very interesting to me.\\n\r\nAyanokoji, a seemingly bland character with a monotone expression and voice, is the most interesting character. Cunning, thoughtful, and reserved, he is easily the most well-planned and developed character. There are some differences between the light novel and anime, though. While the light novel makes Ayanokoji more like a straight-man and a normal high-school student, the anime portrays him as anti-social and distant. I like both sides of his character, although I think the anime portrays him more realistically. Overall, he is the only thing that makes this anime worth watching, and deserves a 6 for character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a 5 for me. Classroom of the Elite tried too hard, to be completely honest. The title of the episodes was some deep quote, and they tried to create a ridiculous connection to the quote and the episode. Ideology and overdramatized theories were thrown around randomly throughout the whole anime. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Meh. Ayanokoji is a good character, sound and art are nothing special, the plot is interesting although not developed well, and you'll find it strangely addicting.\\n\\n\r\nI hope there will be a second season, so it doesn't leave me hanging off the edge of a cliff like this. I really want to love this anime because the light novel is fantastic, but unfortunately, it fell a little short of everyone's expectations.",

            "content": "I don't even particularly mind the random quotes without even a tangential relevance to the story. A bit of ostentatiousness, even the clueless sort, is acceptable in my book. However, as the show distinctly sets itself up to be judged by its intellectual merits, and I enjoy picking apart such cases, I'm not going to hold back in pointing out any failures behind that.\r\nIndeed, you don't need to go any farther than the premise to realize that this show isn't going to be nearly as smart as the writer imagined. It is easily apparent that the inspiration comes from the various stories that build ona premise that is crafted from the start to create particularly strong motivations for the characters and set them up against each other. This way a writer can set themselves up to create very engaging conflicts even without having to extensively elaborate the personal motivations of each character, or the setting at large.\\n\\n\r\nThis type of a premise is, of course, a shortcut. It regularly leads to some big drawbacks in other areas of a story, namely that such a premise is usually severely lacking in believability, because of the drastic measures that need to be taken to set up that level of conflict with such little elaboration. This sacrifice can pay off well if you manage to capitalize on the strength gained through it, and even accept the lack of common sense as a part of the story's character.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the possibility of trying to make use of this strength while at the same time mitigating the drawbacks of the sacrifice isn't totally off the table either. That seems to be where this story's writer is coming from, apparently with a hope to bring some subtletely to where it is usually so lacking. I'm not against the idea, but the execution is not up to par in any manner.\\n\\n\r\nThrough introducing an apparent subtlety to the story, very little was gained and much more was lost in return. Through toning down the extreme elements typical to such a premise, the initial impact usually meant to catch the attention of the audience was simply absent. In return, there was practically no gain in believability, as the extra effort put in by the writer to established the setting simply failed in actually explaining the egregious elements still present. If anything, these weak attempts only served to draw attention to these weaknesses, rather than the usual route of distracting the audience so as to allow suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nGoing further, this same failure at the very basis of the show continuously presented itself in the form of an unengaging storyline and characters utterly lacking in defining characteristics and motivation. Indeed, the whole premise of the premise was so watered down as to have the exact opposite result of what is usually sought through this measure. Because the premise itself lacked the necessary force to create conflict, the lack of effort put into fleshing out the casts' backgrounds became even more apparent and there was none of the typical strong motivations left.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the whole story seems to be the result of the writer's failure to commit to the path they had chosen, even if that ultimately might have been what saved the show from total mediocrity. Despite the fact that the constant efforts to make the characters look intelligent only served to highlight the writer's own failure to think things through, all of this was presented so meekly as to make the thought process easy to follow and make the audience feel good about figuring it out without much handholding. Indeed, the few cases where the show was truly unpredictable was where it was at its weakest, cheaply forcing complete failure of consideration on the most, supposedly, intelligent parts of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the technical aspects of the shows presentation were rather good, so as to leave me with no real reason to complain even as I didn't find any of it particularly dazzling. Where the story was at its strongest, the visuals and audio succeeded in backing it up.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate the show. I wasn't even particular disappointed, because it was so obviously weak from the beginning, giving me no reason to get my hopes up. There was enough effort put into the show that even as its lack of bravery held it back, it rarely fell at the most obvious and easily avoided hurdles, making it a relatively enjoyable watch all the way through, while still giving me no reason to recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "Story: It can be compared to Baka and Test in the sense where lower ranked classes are competing to gain access into the higher ranked classes. However Classroom of the Elite takes a little more of the serious route. These children are fighting to go up the ranks so they can either attend a prestigious college or work for a high ranked company or government position. \r\nAdd in the usage of points and the process of gaining and losing points needed to survive in the school and it adds for an intriguing story. The development for the main characters and some of the side characterswas really well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: Very smooth and really beautiful.  Honestly it's Lerche's best work in my opinion. The faces especially the eyes were really awesome to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: The BGM was fantastic. A lot of piano work and a little bit of guitar as well. Add in one of the best if not THE best opening of the Summer season along with a really good ending song and you have 10/10 in the music and sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and VA's: I loved how most of the characters had secrets and some even had some dark side to them. While the characters showed certain characteristics at times, no one character fit a certain mold. IE a tsundere, deredere etc. Ayanokoji and Horikita were two of the coolest characters I've seen in 2017 not just in summer but the whole year.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was one of the few anime where if I was not able to watch it right away my day would be ruined. Seriously this anime was that enjoyable. Each week failed to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I do not want to use any spoilers for my overall view of this anime so the only thing I can give you is to not go into this anime thinking it's going to be another Serious High School Harem anime. It's much more then that. With a lot of kick-ass moments and a few sweet moments thrown in Classroom of the Elite is easily one of the best anime of 2017.",

            "content": "This is my first time ever reviewing anything so excuse my writing, I just felt the urge to share my feelings of disappointment towards this anime.\r\nI really liked the premise when it premiered, I thought the characters were interesting at first, the animation was decent, it immediately became my favorite among the shows of this season, I was really hyped about it, but with time the hype faded away and I became less interested every new episode.\r\nMy biggest problem with it is it's tone, it tried to be dark and edgy but it didn't fit the high school setting at all and it really buggedme, it was so over dramatic about ridiculous scenarios that could be considered a small problem in real life but in the series they treated it like some sort of tragedy or a life or death situation, if these scenarios were in JoJo's I would be laughing my ass off, but instead they took them seriously in this, which in return I couldn't. \\n\r\n\"Someone got in a fight and now the case is taken to the court, if we don't do something he might get a death sentence\". That's an exaggeration but that's how the tone set it out to be, it's like whoever made this forgot that it's set in a high school and the characters were only 16 year old students.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what's up these episode titles, can it get any more pretentious than that? Inserting famous quotes doesn't make the show clever, just stuck-up\\n\\n\r\nAlso another problem is the characters, they suck, the MC speak in a robotic tone all the time and show no emotion whatsoever, I guess that's what he's supposed to be because I guess he used to be a lab rat or something but they didn't explore that side of him much so it's still hard to understand him or his motivation.\\n\r\nThe main girls are also bad, one is supposed to be tsundere, which I don't mind if it was done right, but in this case, it wasn't, the other is a bubbly cheerful girl but it turns out that it's all an act and she's actually a bitch, but that was just for one episode, it was suddenly thrown in there just for the sake being shocking and edgy, only the characters in the background acted like students but they were out of the main focus of the story\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a very (meh) anime, it did nothing new and the premise of mysteries in high school is just a rip-off of much better anime like SNAFU and Hyouka, the characters traits are also a rip-off of the mentioned shows, it did keep me coming back until the end though without seeming like a chore to finish which means it may have done something right I'll give it props for that, but in the end it wasn't worth it. If it was more lighthearted maybe I would have liked it, but I guess I'll just stick with Hyouka and SNAFU",

            "content": "A lot of people would think that this is more closely related to Oregairu and to Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, but them m****** were forgetting that this is more of a darker version of Baka to Test, yes the setting is an elite school, yes it does involve a group of students whom were in a lowest part of the totem pole, ok so it does have some action, and yes someone has to delete the part \" Comedy\" in MAL's info, cu'z there isn't any comedy here , and even if there is, nobody is laughing. Ecchi would have been better since we did saw somepanty flashes around here, but just barely, so:\\n\\n\r\nStory, fair 6. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot maybe a darker version of Baka to Test, but as someone from the forum said that this was poorly executed, he/she is absolutely right, cu'z it was poorly executed since there were situations or things that serves as plot holes and oxymoronic scenarios, also the plot doesn't have a clear direction, instead the plot was relying on certain arcs that involves certain characters and that's just about it........\\n\\n\r\nArt, decent 4. \\n\\n\r\nThere may have been the quintessential red head, long hair, yankee, big boob bimbo,  school uniforms , zettai ryoki and a blond, but making some of the characters like Ryuuen, Kouenji, Katsuragi, Sudo and Albert who look too old to even be in high school was one of the poor executions of this anime, but never the less it was still ok, thought I hate that they kook like a bunch of repeat students whom would never graduate from high school. Nevertheless even with some fanservices around here the way the was executed wasn't in a malicious way, rather it was more like that the situation calls for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound, dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nOk so wtf? here's why, Ayanokouji sounded like that he hasn't slept for a very long time, man, wake me up when we get there, like Ryuuen, Kouenji, Katsuragi, Sudo and Albert sounded like a bunch of grown men who shouldn't even be in high school, Suzune sounded too old to be a teenager, Kikuyo, sounded like a retard, and Sayaka, doesn't speak much that she basically annoying that one would feel  like shouting at her to speak up, the closing theme sucks, but the silver lining was the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI did said that this anime was more like a darker version of Baka to Test, and it is, cu'z the character here were simply the opposite of the characters from Baka to Test, like:\\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji Kiyotaka- Is basically a reverse alternate of Yoshi Akisa who is sooo stupid and dumb, he is smart,cold and calculating. His character being this guy who has the smarts and intellectual aptitude who only cares for himself surly is an oxymoron, cu'z he does one thing that seemly violates his own selfish rationale, as if he doesn't know how to be an asshole.....\\n\\n\r\nSuzune Horikata- can be considered as reveres Shimada Minami, who is just an average student who like Yoshi, here she is this ambitious student who wants to get to class A so that she can have his brother's respect, whom is the president of the school's student council , just like Ayanokouji , she is this tsundere who sees highly of herself that friends were just useless and yet she talks to him, but, the again , she somehow is trying to be this manipulative bitch who is trying to make Class D good as her means to an end, but in the end she needs Ayanokouji to do it for her.\\n\\n\r\nKushida Kikyou- she is the Himeji here, except that she is pretentious good girl who actually has a darker side, but due to the poor execution of this anime her dark side wasn't put to good used.\\n\\n\r\nSudo Ken, obviously he is the Yuuji here, who is an asshole yankee, who is very athletic but lacking in the academic department, here, he is more like an associate to Ayanokouji but not very close, in fact it's good that he is regulated to be a support.\\n\\n\r\nIchinose Honami- here, she is an alternate Kiyoko, who isn't a psycho, but more like the big boob friendly girl who was more of the quintessential influential girl.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Ari- who give as fuck about her, she is just eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Class A, B, C and D - since the execution was poor they're just merely fillers for the rest of the anime who either serves as parts for certain arcs and that's that, since this was just all about Ayanokouji and Horikata.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt maybe a chaotic execution but then again , seeing the adventure of Ayanokouji and Horikata was well worth it, but that's about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Poor 3. \\n\\n\r\nCu'z it has a little bit of everything that this anime doesn't have it's own identity I mean the title is a mismatch, the character's personality were an oxymoron, and the execution was bad, the anime itself was a parody of Baka to test that was made into a darker version. So, whatever your opinion is. I just have nothing much to say.\\n\\n\r\nPres Trump OUT \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is based on an elite school that has 100% rate of their students getting a job, funded by Japanese government. Very interesting setting. This anime is one of those types that have \"Brainy people and rivalry\" like in Death note.\r\n*This content may have spoilers*\r\nI'm sorry if there are some grammatical errors. I'm not American.\r\nI chose this anime because I liked the artwork of this anime.\r\nYes, the artwork is stunning, and it is MUCH better than anime such as \"Dra*** Ba** Z\".\r\nI really like the artwork, and this is the anime that I was searching for. The eyes' color are a bit weird, butit is fine with me. It is still good.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get into the serious one - Story.\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is divided in two - yeah, it would be extremely odd for you guys to see 12-episoded anime with two stories -. One of two is main story. I'm highly interested in the main story, which I have a lot to discover throughout the progress, such as Ayanokouji's past. His act and little flashbacks throughout the story makes me extremely curious about his past. (Though it seems like it needs about 2~3 more seasons to cover the whole story). I would LOVE this anime it was formed with only main story. This anime has side story too, the another of two stories. Currently, until episode 11, there were 2 - yes, 2. It's a lot, right? In a 12 episode anime. This is not even year-long anime like Boruto or Naruto. - I really hated these two side stories, considering that I wasted 40 minutes on literally nothing to learn in main story, which I was interested in, and everyone was interested in. \\n\r\nThe side stories' stories are really dumb. Yeah. Dumb. The studio of this anime has made a terrible decision of making side stories. Two stories are not even connected - They are separate side stories. - They're about setting up cameras in girls' locker room, and panty (pantsu) getting stolen. I really hated them, to be honest. If they didn't air side stories and aired the main story instead, they might've had more people rating this anime higher and recommending to other people.\\n\\n\r\nOh, forgot to tell you guys - This anime includes ecchi contents (not THAT ecchi, but still), such as showing girls' underwears, focusing the oppais (boobs - saitama's shirt ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ), etc.\\n\r\nThis anime can also be considered harem anime to be honest. If it WAS, it would've been much better. Trust me. If this anime had romance aspect, it would've had higher rates and more fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, opening and ending sounded very good to me. I think they fit to the mood of this anime, and it is much better than openings and endings of \"Assass***tion Cl***room\" (Yeah, obviously.). I personally liked it, but it was not excellent enough for me to listen to it like what I do to great anime op's and ed's.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of this anime is complete excellency to me. Some students have something hidden if you go deeper to the story. Even though the mc's character doesn't change that much, the girl mc's (Horikita) character change is interesting to watch, how she gets closer to the mc (Ayanokouji).\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment, was outstanding. I wanted to watch one more episodes over one another, not like the anime that I watched recently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime is good ~ fine. Though I like the artwork, I think it could've been MUCH better if the studio had more thoughts about this anime and removed some stories.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I will summarize this up.\\n\\n\r\nThis show should not have made \"Pantsu thief\" and \"Camera in girl's lockers\" and should've put more real stories in there. It's half a season, 12 episodes total, so studio cannot afford to make side-story like Boruto does. I really think that if the main story was substituted by those two side story episodes, it would've been such a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I think there is a little possibility for this anime to continue to season 2, since they literally \"failed\" the entire anime by putting 2 side stories.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is one of the good anime, and I hope it has 2nd season, but It's sad that they messed it up.\\n\\n\r\nTo make class D to be class A, it would take almost 25 ~ 30 episodes to finish the story, so this decreases the possibility for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSad.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Are human beings truly equal?\"\r\nUsing a pretentious question as an opener in an anime can be really drawing. Classroom of the Elite has successfully done that. However, does the story really answer this question? To some, the answer to this question could be already known. The story talks about a unique school that is established and is funded by the government to educate students with good minds so they can help develop the country.\r\nKoudo Ikusei Senior High School is a leading prestigious school with state-of-the-art facilities where nearly 100% of students go on to university or find employment. In this school, all the students whofirst enter the school gain 100 thousand points to buy anything they desire in the school. The school has cinemas, malls, markets, and nearly everything you need from the basic stuff to entertainment. Every student gets some certain amount of points monthly so he can live. Now, you will be surprised to know that in this school all the students have the freedom to do anything they want including sleeping in class. However, how is that going to effect on their life in this school? \\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji Kiyotaka is a student of D-class, which is where the school dumps its \"inferior\" students in order to ridicule them. For a certain reason, Kiyotaka was careless on his entrance examination, and was put in D-class. After meeting Horikita Suzune and Kushida Kikyou, two other students in his class, Kiyotaka's situation begins to change.\\n\\n\r\nThe variety of the characters in this anime is truly amazing. Classroom of the Elite has successfully made the characters interesting as well as different in a unique way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation in this anime are really good. I enjoyed watching it \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Classroom of the Elite delivers a not bad piece of art to the audience. What I liked most about it is the characters and the unique personality each character has. Despite having it a couple of plots twist, the story is a not bad experience. It delivers good ideas on how to live in a society and how you can work with other people to succeed in life.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

            "content": "If I had stopped at episode 6, I would have given this anime a 9 or 10. It has such an alluring premise, the art is pretty spectacular, and it has some insanely smart and psychological concepts going on, despite feeling a bit forced at times. Though I didn't like the strange choice to add a harem feel with awkward fanservice to a story that could have stood well enough on its own, I still liked it.\r\nThen I hit episode 7, and it just bombed from there. I mean, 7 is basically a horrific waste of space where the fanservice pumps up for no reason(I don't dislike fanservice, but it felt so contrived and stupid here, where they were taking it so seriously) and the comedy is like cardboard. Seriously, I didn't even break a smile. It was so dumb and overdone. \\n\\n\r\nI thought it would go back to good from there, but the following episodes (though laden with cool concepts) went further into weird fanservice zones and gender roles/cliches that made me grind my teeth. It stopped being psychologically sound and started to just poke at social issues without giving a true perspective or realistic account of them. It was just a vehicle to show how \"smart\" the main character is and how he can manipulate everyone, without actually giving him or anyone else a true personality. ALSO, twice in this anime they mentioned grabbing fingerprints off of clothing items. That's SO hard to do, especially in a HIGH SCHOOL (however ritzy and weird). It made the scenes feel ridiculous. Also, it was pretty easy to guess how things were going in the second half, and tidbits you couldn't guess still didn't feel all that surprising or intriguing, just a repeat of the first half of the season in a different situation. There was absolutely no character growth, and barely any character reveal.\\n\\n\r\nI only finished the last two episodes because I wanted to see if anything changed. They only got a tiny bit better, but the \"big reveal\" actually made me more upset than anything else. By the end, the intelligence of the main character just felt forced and disingenuous. I gave it a 7 because I enjoyed the first bit so much, and I know a lot of my anger comes from the ruined potential that it had. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: I'm changing the score to a 5, because after all this time it just got worse and worse in my head. lol Distance doesn't always make the heart grow fonder.",

            "content": "Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is...an interesting one. It poses an interesting question at the start of the anime: \u201cAre human beings truly equal?\u201d. The question sort of nabbed my attention, and started to lay down thoughts in my head of what was supposed to follow up in the coming episodes. The idea is interesting, having a school where test results and class behaviors are affecting a point system. And the more points, the higher your ranking are. \r\nHowever, I feel like the anime doesn't take the story to it's full potential. It doesn't reach all the way. Trying to be psychological animeis very difficult when you constantly get scenes of fan service. Which brings me over to the characters. There's a few characters that are interesting, most of them are very stereotypical and just plain boring. And when you get hints that a person isn't who he/she says it is, the story just doesn't follow up enough. The background information on characters are just not there, except for maybe 2 main characters, and I still feel like they didn't get enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for characters and environment is nothing special really. I could have wished for more unique characters, instead you could probably find similar characters everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime's OP and ending gets some credit, especially the latter, for being some what unique, and not what you usually hear. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all: it's an anime that tries too hard aiming for psychological, and gets lost on the way. But if you wouldn't mind the fan service, give it a try and see if you like it.",

            "content": "First and foremost, I would like to say that this anime, Classroom Of The Elite, is by far, one of the best anime I have ever seen and also, this will be the first anime I am writing a review on.\r\nStory - 10:\r\nOkay, if you have or have not read the synopsis, I'll just summarize it. A school system simply based on meritocracy, where students are given these so-called 'points' according to their merit. The school divides and categorize students into 4 classes. Class A, the highest ranking class amongst the 4 classes.  Class B, the second highest ranking class, and so on. Now,our main male protagonist, Ayanakouji Kiyotaka has just transferred to this school and is placed in Class D, which is the lowest class you can get into due to him scoring exactly 50 out of 100 on all of the entrance exams. Classroom Of The Elite gives off a strong and vibrant vibe where when you start watching it, you cannot contain yourself to stop watching it. Well at least, that's how I felt. As the story progresses, the anime starts to elaborate itself more and more, giving the audience a better understanding of the situation and circumstances of the students. Now, I will say that this anime has a lot of cliches but I will only be mentioning one, and that would be the main character being cold, cruel, and overpowered but seems very quiet and carefree on the outside. Overall, the story was much better than I expected it to be, and though it had some flaws, it can be easily overlooked, which is why I gave it a full score.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8:\\n\r\nThe art itself is actually kinda common but they do go above and beyond on some occasions. Overall, the art is actually pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9:\\n\r\nNow, this is one of the factors that I enjoyed most about this anime. The opening, \"Caste Room (\u30ab\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0)\" by ZAQ, and ending, \"Beautiful Soldier\" by Minami, to me, is by far mediocre at best. But what really intrigues me, is the background music. They managed to execute and integrate the music perfectly within specific scenes, especially the suspenseful piano, which only plays at moments where the main character shows his superiority by being super overpowered, and I have to admit, it is by far one of the best theme music I have ever heard. Overall, it is great, but because there was only one that I truly enjoyed, it didn't hit the perfect mark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10: (Spoiler Alert)\\n\r\nRight, now let me just say that this anime, did an outstanding job at displaying each characters' personality, aspect, and characteristics. Not to mention that the character development was also at a steady pace, it wasn't rushed but it wasn't sluggish either making it very smooth and enjoyable for the audience. Okay, now let start. Ayanakouji, as I mentioned previously, is pretty badass. The reason for this is because he went through a period during his childhood, in which he was put in this \"White Room\", where he was taught martial arts, and academics. After going through this, he developed a mindset (which is shown in episode 12 of the anime) in which he thinks that all humans are simple \"tools\" to be used when Horikita was speaking to him. The author managed to kept his identity a secret, and only displaying it at certain times, which makes us viewer want to continue and keep watching until we know who he truly is. Character(s) development wise, other characters want and thinks that they managed to progress and develop some kind of relationship with our main male protagonist here, but little do they know that he has been manipulating and using them all this time to his advantage. Overall, the character(s) personality was kinda cliche, but unique at the same time due to how the author executed it, and I would say that in the character department, this anime deserves a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10:\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very enjoyable and memorable because of everything it has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10:\\n\r\nIn one sentence, I will say that this anime was and is truly worthwhile.",

(At least they get to learn the value of a dollar).

I understand that high school was horrible for some students... To be honest, I didn't think it would go as far as this anime... I've always wondered if the students can earn the points in the school by working as well? Plus, the anime needs to focus more on the other characters and their respective classes and the point system. (TO SUMMARIZE THIS: Good anime, but it needs more explanation!)",

WHY?\r\nBecause it just defies everything I know about myself (*\uff9f\uff9b\uff9f*)\r\nIt managed to make me like and fall in love in everything that I thought I dislike.\r\nBe it the character, the attitude of the character and the story itself ._.\r\nThis is a unique anime, shown from a unique angle that I encourage everyone to watch. Iwould have given its story a 9 but ended up giving it a 7 because:\\n\r\n- The anime somewhat makes me feel like i'm playing some sim game. It has many stories (or chapters or stages) but glossed over quickly. 12 ep is too short!!\\n\r\n- The characters are interesting and have potential to be further developed, but they aren't. (Probably due to the nature of how this anime is written.)\\n\r\n- There are too MANY unanswered questions left behind.

You know, everytime we're the one looking at the anime from a 3rd party POV like we know everything that's gonna happen.

How's that? ><\\n\\n\r\nPS: This is just my personal and humble feelings on this anime. I hope I didnt spoil anything (gave minimal detail about it already) and sorry for ranting so much ><",

Classroom Of the Elite is the latest in a long line of anime that have a school setting that try to be distinct with its premise and setting, but only end up being as derivative as the ones that came before. COE spin is that students are sent to a special prestigious fully backed by the government academy that only the most best and elite of students can enter. But the best students of what? Athletics? Education? Prestige? I don\u2019t know and theshow doesn\u2019t bother to get into the specifics with that, as it wants to mesmerize you with it\u2019s seemingly student paradise. Students are to remain in the campus, and are given points that are akin to money that refills every month allowing them to do basically anything they want without parental notice. What was an interesting premise as is with the beginning of titles similar to this starts to rocket down as i doesn\u2019t know how to tap into the full potential of the premise and limp around to the very end with a dull cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story at least that is what i think it was trying to be, is an assortment of three arcs  each one boiling down to being a test with only one of them being an actual test.  Each Arc plays out the same way with the group being presented with a problem that continues to escalate until the final moment when Kiyotaka is able to swoop in and resolve the problem which is then explained by him on how he was able to do it. Rinse and Repeat. What makes it more damning is that there is nothing cohesive that binds the story together, i mean one of the arc is so far removed that it\u2019s on another island they add nothing other than more characters the show has to juggle around but doing nothing with them. \\n\\n\r\nThis lead me to the characters. They\u2019re all flat and 1 to 2-dimensional at best. Our protagonist Kiyo is basically a response to many school protagonist that tend to be overtly emotional and average in everything, but instead of changing for the better we end of with a stoic gary-stu. He\u2019s a person that tries to be average when in reality he\u2019s this super smart, athletic, machiavellian character who can impress the ladies without even trying. Yet he\u2019s a character that is able to do all this but doesn\u2019t have any motivation to do them other than that he does them, and even at the end when his \u201ctrue\u201d motivation is revealed it\u2019s as meaningless as having none at all. Even his backstory is a vapid as the rest of him that creates this vagueness that allows to viewer to easily self-insert into an empty husk. Just to add more he is also a part of class D the lowest class with the failing students even though this is suppose to be a grand prestigious school. Why is he hear? Because if there is one thing people like more than being self-inserts, they also like being the underdog. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the class are Horikita a student who is smarter than the others in her class and was only placed in the in their because??? I don\u2019t think they bothered explaining why. Nonetheless she\u2019s there and is the main heroine of the story who works along Kiyo in all the arcs but mainly there as a plot device for our main character to do something. Next is Kushida who is the friendliest of the characters until the show reveals her \u201cdark\u201d side trying to make her a more complex character than she actually is. Because in truth she is like a paper rectangle with two different colors on each side, they may both be different but they are still a flat rectangle with little depth. The rest of the class is an afterthought with their characters being info dumped by the main characters or just plastered on the screen with walls of text instead of putting effort into them, they are all one note. The other classes are just skimmed across except class C that the show plays out to be the antagonist that\u2019s full of thugs that are out to beat class D but just come out to be one note as well.\\n\\n\r\nProduction values for the show are good as is with many modern anime. The character designs are generic but still are able to make them appealing. One thing that did stand out from them however where their eyes that are very vibrant even during the dark as if they were nocturnal animals, they also have this purple hue to them that gives their eyes to different colors. Other than this there\u2019s not much else. The background is a contemporary japanese setting until they go to the jungle but even then really doesn\u2019t serve anything other than a different venue. The voice acting was decent but i wasn\u2019t anything new from what i\u2019ve heard in other anime. The soundtrack for the most part is forgettable except for one part when there was electronic music playing, and i couldn\u2019t take the scene seriously.\\n\\n\r\nI dare hate to use this word as it has become a buzzword at this point when discussing shows, but this show in particular is just pretentious. Just from the beginning of the title screen when it shows a quote from a famous philosopher that is supposed to make us think on how it will relate to the show only in the end to just be a speck that\u2019s never revisited. Characters also quote and use references as if it was trying to make a philosophical point  only to mean nothing in the end. This is why i don\u2019t like using quotes because you should use your own words to convey what you mean not anyone else. I only used quotes for this review because at least mine has more bearing than anything the show tried to present. This show is so up it\u2019s own ass and not aware of it that any time it tries to be serious it comes off as ridiculous and when it tries to be ridiculous it ends up being dull.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing to take from this show than know this. Back in middle school my English teacher would give us quotes on famous people and we would have 5 min to write what it means with our own words. So just do that gather all the quotes from the show and make your own meaning because at least you might actually get something mindful out of it.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nClassroom of the Elite is a curious one. I was so engrossed with its plot and characters early on. However at some point in the middle it started to feel really trite. \r\nStory: 3.5/10\r\nFirst and foremost the concept of the show is really good in my opinion. Students are placed into 4 different classes based of some tests at the beginning of the show. For there and onwards, they must work as a class to earn points. If your class earns enough points, you will dethrone the class above yours (D, C, B, and A). For this plot device towork, there needs to be a certain level of \u201cseriousness\u201d present. I thought that the first half of the show pulled this off really well. Yes there was the comedy elements thrown in but it was pretty secondary. However, around the time that the first fanservice episode showed up (the pool episode), something was starting to form that would really degrade the show for me...\\n\\n\r\nThe show started to drift away from what I thought was great about it. I think it was a combination of the show throwing all the classes together for a final conflict and also the characters starting to get a little stale. The first bit of the show only really focuses on Class D and C. There are other characters that show up in some minor roles but they don't play a huge role in the first conflict. The show really shines here because as the underdogs (Class D) you want to cheer them on and have them take down Goliath (Class C). This is also the part of the show where you really get to know the main players in Class D. The second half of the season strays away from this and it just ends up feeling like a real mess. The last arc had moments that took too long to resolve while also feeling rushed at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the last arc as well as the two episode lead-up to that arc (essentially the second half of the show) paled in comparison to the first half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show looks really fucking good. First off, the art. The character models, clothing, and coloring are some next level stuff. You can tell a lot about each character based on their character model features. The coloring (especially the eyes) are done really well and in unique ways. The backgrounds also look very well done. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty good. The scenes with lots of motion are pretty detailed and smooth. The rest is pretty good. Some stiffness in some of the dialogue scenes but for an airing anime it did more than good enough. \\n\\n\r\nMy only real grip with the art direction of the show is this; what's with all the large breasts? Now look I'm not complaining about seeing some nice female figures but when every main female lead is rocking at least a D cup and the scenes (and opening) are extenuating this area of their body, it starts to get in the way of the show (especially since the show is, for the most part, a serious story). The fact that I had to bring this up shows that it was an inhibitor on my overall experience. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's so bizarre. This show has both some of the best songs I've heard in recent anime as well as some really generic ones. The opening and a number of other tracks are goosebump worthy. There are however a couple of really generic and almost cringy sounding song selections. They played mostly during very obvious fanservice scenes which is a real shame. \\n\\n\r\nThe miscellaneous sound design was very, very good. The battle sounds as well as just the small things you might not noticed seemed to have had a lot of care put into them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are absolutely crafted really well. I enjoyed pretty much all of the main cast. A fair number of people seem to have a real issue with Ayanokouji's personality (the monotone, OP MC trope) but honestly I cannot get enough of him. His scenes with Horikita and Kikyou was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed the show so much. The way they interacted with each other as well as the character development they received was really well done. However...how the characters were utilized was almost abysmal in the second half of the show. It was such a waste to see these interesting characters just sort of wasted in the fanservice and final arc episodes. There were also other characters such as Honami that I really wished we could have learned more about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show had the potential to be really fucking awesome. Due to the fall off of interesting content, the miss-use of interesting characters, and general pacing issues in the final half, the show is unfortunately relegated to just \u201cgood\u201d. This season seems to have this recurring issue seeing how I have similar thoughts with Knights & Magic. The show is worth watching, just don't expect a lot from its ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

I suppose we got tired of quotes here on the Internet. So you can skip this review, because nothing useful usually follows the quotation.\r\nAnd you  hate reverse psychology being applied on you. \r\nAnd you dislike shallow characters in anime as well as template scenarios.\r\nAnd you probably right.\r\nNot this time. While the anime is full of uninteresting characters that find themselves in mundane situations and  interact in absolutely predictable ways, you might enjoy the rare opportunity of beingsurprised in the end. And I don't mean that in the end the hero pulls a rabbit from a hat, as the usual smarter-than-you boy would do. That is given. No, in the end you will reassess the hero and his whole motivation.\\n\\n\r\n If you enjoy when plot makes you retract your train of thought and rethink the deeds of a hero from the beginning, watch this anime. But be warned, there is only one interesting character in the anime and probably none at all. \\n",

            "content": "I wasn't initially planning to write a review for this anime, but I read through some of the more negative reviews and found that there seemed to be a lot of people that missed the point, and that i just generally disagreed with.  I'll review this by explaining each piece of the review step by step starting with Art and Sound. I rated the art and sound both at 10. The show is very aesthetically pleasing to watch, and both the voice acting and the sound effects haveup to episode 10 been very satisfying and non standing-out in any sort of negative way. On top of that, I find that the choice of background music adds to the thrilling aspect of not knowing what is going to happen next on the show. I don't think much more needs to be said to know that the show looks good.\\n\\n\r\n            Next i'd like to address the characters which I rated at an 8. There were two major reasons that these characters have not been rated at a 10. The first reason, is that while they do not explicitly look like any other anime character necessarily, several of the characters including both of the Main female characters (Kushida Kikyo and Horikita Suzune) bear an incredible resemblance to characters commonly seen elsewhere. Thus physically, the show subscribes a tad too much to the stereotype of the cold beauty, the voluptuous airhead, and the muscular punk. These sorts of generic outlines for characters would normally deserve a lower rating, but the show handles it well enough that the characters still feel unique and interesting. The Second reason for receiving a sub-10 score on characters, is the sloppy writing of minor characters. Without spoiling anything, there are certain characters that are akin to bodyguards for example that are about 40 chromosomes short of being a normal human, or that just seem to be apparently illiterate, yet in the higher classes. Another example of this, is the stereotypical female character that is a total outright jerk to people, but they help her anyway, even though the person is not associated with them, and treats them like crap. Despite all of this, i still have the shows characters a rating of 8 as I feel that the unique motivations and rhetoric of the characters makes them incredibly interesting.\\n\\n\r\n               Lastly, I will address the Story and Enjoyment which both received a rank of 9 from me. There is one sole reason that the story does not deserve a full 10 for the originality and extremely interesting arcs within the show. That reason is actually because of the basis of the class system that is present within the show. Regardless of whether the A-D ranking class system is analogous for the classicist society that anime often portrays, this type of metaphor has been done several times before. The most prevalent two examples I can think of are \"Baka and Test\", and \"The Irregular at Magic High School\". Specifically this system matches almost exactly with the system designed in \"Baka and Test\", however \"Baka and Test\" takes a far less detailed and less serious approach to the entire system, while Classroom of the Elite is very much so a serious show.\\n\r\n           All of that aside, the story is incredibly enjoyable, and the events that take place to show the struggle for maintaining or shifting the status quo based on class, are very original and highly entertaining. Some might call the outcomes or methods mundane, but I find them to be quite the opposite. I'd argue that \"Classroom of the Elite\" is actually a thriller anime, as I find myself frequently biting my nails and sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen to the characters. Despite my great enjoyment of this show, I rated enjoyment just short of a 10 because I have found myself able to predict some of the smaller decisions in each of the given conflicts, however I have yet to have the complete mystery solved as to what will happen next throughout the first 10 episodes of this show.\\n\r\n               I hope this review is helpful and appropriate as this is my first time submitting such a large review on this site.",

I was intrigued by the synposis and the characters looked similar to Oregairu so I thought I would give it a try. And I'm really thankful I did.\r\nStory: The story is really interesting actually. I'm not new to the concept of a systematic school where people deceive each other but this anime takes a different spin at things. The MC himself has secrets so you begin to wonder \"Who the heck is normal in this school?\" Because of that watching the show is really enjoyable. Everything isa mystery and nothing is really obvious so that element of the story makes it unique.\\n\r\nArt: I like the art. It has that futuristic feel to it and the art is crisp. The characters all have different eye colors so you can distinguish characters pretty easily from one another. \\n\r\nSound: I didn't like the OP at first but after getting through it a few times, it grew on me. It's pretty epic and the ED is really good as well. \\n\r\nCharacter: I really the main MC. He's really badass because he has a secret past and he's secret OP. I always enjoy MCs where they don't want to show their true selves and as the story progresses we find out why and their past. Horikita is an tsundere but not really. She's an interesting character, I think you know more about Horikita than any other character in the story thus far. \\n\r\nOverall I like Classroom of the Elite. It's enjoyable. It's well made and definitely something worth watching if you have nothing to watch. Watching this anime made me want to read the light novel so that goes to show that this anime does it right. 9/10.",

            "content": "From reading the summaries listed on websites, Classroom of the Elite may seem like a blend of multiple shows such as Oregairu and Baka no Test. However, in my opinion it is something very unique. For an anime based off a light novel, it has done a fairly good job of adapting most of the critical parts. As expected, there are some cut corners, as expected with any LN adapted anime. Nonetheless, the end product is still phenomenal and provides vast amount of enjoyment. \r\nStory and Character: 9 \r\nFor those who do not know, the story is based on an elite Tokyo high school inwhich classes are ranked in terms of ability. Students can either rise through the ranks or remain at bottom through the point system, which is calculated based on \"merits\" or actions that deserve praise. The main protagonist Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is someone very different from others. He says very little, a complete introvert, but helps others when needed. His character is entirely a mystery which provides a sense to continue watching. The deuteragonist is Horikita Suzune, a girl with a condescending personality and extremely sharp tongue.  Other supporting characters provide a good refreshment of the different facets of high school people experience. Some of the supporting characters begin to show growth and become a part of the show which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are juxtaposed in being complete opposites. One being lackadaisical while hiding his own true abilities and the other being condescending and in the sense arrogant. This story follows their journey in hopes of rising from the bottom ranks of Class D to the highly touted Class A. Their encounters between other classes provides good scenarios in which they experience conflict and make new allies. Whether in the classroom or out on the campus's mall, there is always something being said or happening to help progress the story. This is one of the very few anime that doesn't have any \"filler\" moments that just stalls the show. I highly recommend this show to those who want to experience something different than your typical slice of life show and something with a little bit more flair and excitement. \\n\\n\r\n*For those reading the light novel and watching this, it was surprisingly good in how they adapted it. IF you do read the book, expect some minor differences. I believe it has been translated up to volume 2. There are currently 6. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was done extremely well. The backgrounds were finished nicely and blend extremely well with the characters. The thing that stood out to me the most were the eyes of the characters. Something about each characters unique features boost the enjoyment of the show. Each character has a certain look that further defines them in their school life. There is some fan service in this anime but nothing out of the ordinary. Don't expect there be loads of it, just enough to get you to smile. From a LN perspective, they pretty much copied the art and made it look vibrant. The color scheme of the overall anime provides good contrast whether outside or inside. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nI'm not really a sound guy so I'll keep this quick. Nothing bad but nothing amazing. Solid nonetheless. The OP is good and ED is nice and simple. Transitions and other music fit well in during scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI think this is a really solid anime for those who want to watch something different with some sparks. The story is good and captivates viewers with good art and exciting plots. I don't want to give anyone my absolute promise that this show will finish amazing, but so far its done a good job. If you have the time or feel bored, you should definitely give this a try. \\n\\n\r\n*Any questions feel free to message me, I'll be happy to answer them. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Classroom of the Elite\"as far as I would go is the most thriller anime with dynamic events occurring,set in High School scenario which tries to elevates the value of education and Human beings by casting light on them as individuals who are unequal in potential in the eyes of the Education System but then also try there best to survive the competition.\r\nPersonally speaking, its my favourite anime of all time because never would I have thought that such an anime could come into existence which contains every detail of perfection in such a right amount,whether its the suspense music or the graphics or the characterdesign or the story itself.I mean the biggest proof is as soon as the anime came out, the Light Novels topped the charts for months and the sales were in millions.The anime itself topped the charts and every youtuber had to edit there choices for there top 5 anime of all time(LOL)..\\n\r\nThe Story focuses on our Male lead/main character Kiyotaka Ayanokoji who at first seems as a slacker who is bad in expressing his emotions since he always has his poker face on and keeps a distance from the rest of the class but as times pass by, he becomes a mysterious figure who knows the way to achieve success, especially the things he wants. He is shown as  Strong male lead with exceptional qualities but refuses to use them or act upon them for his own good.At first we considered him the one who is \"selfless\" since he goes out of his way to help people such as Sudo but especially girls such as Horikita,Kushida,Ichinose and Sakura. But this view of the audience comes to an end at the close of the Grand Finale when he mentions that he didn't consider any of the people his friends, whether it was Horikita or Kushida or Hirata and that to him they are \"tools\" whom he could use as he see's fit so as to climb the stairs to victory.\\n\r\nThe best thing I found was that the author applies his brains to the very best so as to give us such a perfect combination of strategies which the characters use for there survival in the Education System.\\n\r\nBut as an Adult and from Society's point of view, I would like to mention that this anime is much more than that it seems to be. It contains a strong message and tries to convey it to the rest of us that with the changing times what are the problems the new generation of children are facing or about to face in schools/Institutions which an adult might overlook. With the growing competition and sharpening of intellect comes a price which those who cannot keep up has to pay and one thing is for sure that it is not pleasant!!\\n\r\nIn the end I would like to mention that it is a \"Master Piece\" in which each of the characters uniqueness or rather \"Defects\"are brought into limelight so as to give them there distinct features which help in the further development of  the story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For me, Classroom of the Elite was kind of a \"sleeper-hit\" anime. I didn't really know what to expect going into it, the synopsis gave me a vague idea which got me interested enough to watch it. Even after watching the first few episodes I wasn't massively blown away, it seemed like it was trying to be something much bigger than it was capable of by introducing and setting up a system that could easily collapse in on itself if handled poorly. However, as I watched, I gradually began to realize the hidden genius behind the seemingly mundane and generic drama that stung the plottogether, much of which came together in the final episode. In fact, it redefined the way I looked at the rest of the show, something which I find to be incredibly rare in a 1-cour anime that clearly isn't a finished story. This season of Classroom of the Elite seemed to only be a prologue to a much deeper story that would follow, but did its job as an introduction with incredible attention to detail, foresight, and consideration. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, most of the genius behind this anime derives from the main character Kiyotaka Ayanokoji. He is, by all indications, completely apathetic. A blank slate without any emotions, hobbies, favorite things, or motivations. However, despite this, he helps his classmates with various problems by lending his keen intellect to solve their issues from behind the scenes, only to pass the credit for his actions on to others. While this has been done before (namely in OreGairu's protagonist Hikigaya Hachiman), Ayanokoji does indeed have motivations for his actions which are revealed in the very last episode, only being hinted at prior. This final revelation gives a reason to every single one of his actions and redefines his character, making you wish there was more to see afterwards following this reveal. This is one of the reasons why I call this first season of Classroom of the Elite a \"prologue\", because it's only after that that the viewer understands why Ayanokoji does what he does and gives his actions more weight. It's a slow burn that ultimately pays off by the end, because most of the plot revolves around how Ayanokoji helps his classmates through various situations alongside a follow classmate Suzune Horikita whom he grows close to, and the shift in the balance of power due to that. The anime builds upon the idea of hierarchy and everyone fighting tooth and nail to reach the top, and every plot point in this anime relates to this. It's very much a psychological battle as classes try to constantly one-up each other in order to climb to the top, making it incredibly gratifying to watch as plans are put into place and how they unfold. This is by far the best part about this anime; seeing the extent students go to to reach the top, and how our seemingly passive protagonist becomes involved while pulling the strings from the shadows.\\n\\n\r\nThe drawbacks of this anime come in the form of an underdeveloped supporting cast and lack of focus on the real plot. The supporting cast is interesting enough to watch but hardly any receive character development, and almost all rely on tired archetypes. There is also an overabundance of pointless fanservice that was in no way a necessary addition for a show of this kind, even going so far as to have an entire episode of fanservice were hardly anything of importance happens. While I found the plot engaging, there seemed to lack a general sense of direction in the events that occurred due to their spontaneous nature. None of it really related to the progression of the main story and by the end, not much had changed in terms of that which was set up in the beginning. Again, due to this I attribute the word \"prologue\" to this first cour of Classroom of the Elite which will hopefully be followed by another.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this anime with the expectation of finding a wholly unique and thought-provoking experience, because while Classroom of the Elite does have some genuinely brilliant moments of intellect and social interplay, it isn't an anime that will redefine genres or be regarded as a true masterpiece. The highest point of this show, for me, was the incredibly interesting protagonist and how he handles the situations that are thrown at him, while side-characters act as cardboard cutouts for him to snake around. There is incredible attention to small details which come together and make sense in the end and it is very gratifying to watch things be pieced together in such a fashion. Classroom of the Elite does tired tropes correctly but falls flat in the grand scheme of a story that is much larger than what could be supported by only 12 episodes, with a highly compelling protagonist and entertaining drama that could've been elevated by having more episodes to flesh out its characters, world, and shifting power dynamic.",

            "content": "As a little disclaimer, I haven't read the Light Novel as of writing this review, but I plan on getting around to it sometime soon, so this review will be based solely on the anime and the little that I've gathered about its deviations from the source material. Anyway, Classroom of the Elite. If you want to talk about a show with a lot of promise, Classroom of the Elite is one near the top of the list. It had so much going for it, a bad ass protagonist, an interesting setting, engaging motivations, a solid cast of girls to argue over who was bestgirl, etc... But it kind of lost me toward the end, unfortunately. I wasn't exactly sure why my attention was waning while I was watching, but it all became clearer as I kept thinking about it and I'll explain as we go on. I'm going to save talking about the characters until the Favorite Character section cause it's a nice section to do the discussion.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, I just want to express my love for the color palette of Classroom of the Elite, every color is so vivid and pops out to the viewer. The character's eyes are also something to be appreciated. It was a really cool approach to use tri-colored eyes for most characters, giving each one a somewhat exotic look, furthering the thought that they're in a school for the elite. Obviously, this was meant to kind of contrast the tone that they were trying to convey with the show, but more on that in a bit. In regards to the audio, nothing really stood out to me. Neither the opening or the ending were particularly good, none of the soundtrack made me notice it, and the SFX was just run of the mill. Maybe I wasn't paying the utmost attention to it all, but in that aspect, absolutely nothing stood out. Take that point as you will, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the point I mentioned earlier, the tone. I believe this was probably why I lost so much interest after the halfway mark or so (It was episode 7, actually). The first half or so was pretty dark tonally, which fit the bill that Classroom of the Elite was trying to push. I was behind that tone until the end, but then the mandatory pool episode happens. Basically, from there on out, the tone is so much more inconsistent. And in addition, the story kind of takes a weird turn from its focus on the school life. Suddenly, a school-based anime goes on a cruise to a desert island, which turns into a survival competition arc. While, the explanation that's given makes sense, it's still a bizarre turn for a story that's set in an, essentially, a campus prison. I'm not complaining about the island survival arc per se, I'm just saying that it kind of took me out of what the story was really about. Essentially, that arc was worth it to see Ayanokouji flex on the other classes in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Kiyotaka Ayanokouji\\n\\n\r\nAyanokouji is pretty much the only reason to watch Classroom of the Elite. Seeing him outwit every problem that arises and successfully dodge the credit, is something of a joy to behold, at least to me, since I'm a big fan of overpowered protagonists. I don't know, maybe I just like to see my protagonists do something instead of being all whiny and such. I can definitely appreciate a doormat-to-powerhouse kind of protagonist, but only if it's done with extreme diligence to not make the said protagonist annoying as hell. Ayanokouji is something unique in that regard. We barely see him doing anything for the majority of the show, as that's his game. He just flies under the radar and only acts when he absolutely has to. And when he does act, it's epic to witness his cold, apathetic cunning. Now, I do have to say he does wear a little thin in the island arc, where you're kinda just waiting for him to do something, which he doesn't until the very end. It was kind of frustrating to watch all of Class D's struggles and see him just kinda chilling, doing absolutely nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, no one else is really worth talking about, especially since I've heard how much certain characters were shafted out of the story just to make Horikita more important than she is in the Light Novel. In fact, I've heard so much that she's kind of just a side character in the Light Novel instead of the main girl. That frustrates me a little bit, because the two girls who basically got their characters cut are way better than Horikita anyway. There's more changed than just the 'main girl' aspect, but that's the major infraction of Classroom of the Elite from what I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just disappointing to see yet another adaptation fail to stay faithful to its source material, costing us potentially a good series. I really did like what Classroom of the Elite had to offer, but it just made too many errors with adapting its source material to be a great show to me. With my disappointment expressed, I still enjoyed watching Classroom of the Elite. Even if I ended up disappointed, the premise and Ayanokouji really elevated the viewing experience for me. Those factors alone cause me to say that it was worth the watch.",

What personally called me the most attention was the cold and distant presence of the main character (Kiyotaka) and his unparalleled genius, episode by episode shows us his intelligence and ability to manipulate all thosearound him without even noticing . As the story unfolds we will see how it does to superpose itself before the problems that are presented without much effort that we say.

However, as soon as the setting changed, it completely ruined the vibe of the show. The whole change of plot felt lazy as it lost the serious edge it had earlier, and became quite silly.\r\nI liked the visuals and sound.\r\nThe reason I rated it so high was due to the characters. The MC is a top character and I rate him as one of my favorites alongside Hikigaya Hachiman, but his character did not get to be used as well as it could of been.\r\nFinally, if theydidn't change the setting of the plot and maintained it to the high level it was at, the show would be without a doubt a top 10 school-based anime.

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite feels like a show you've seen many times before, but reveals itself to be something fresh.  Because of this, it is actually one of the hardest shows for me to assign a score to.  The show takes place in a boarding school where classes are pitted against each other for rankings and rewards.  The story features a protagonist that feels very similar to Hachiman from Oregairu crossed with L from Death Note (which was probably the main reason why I watched the show).  The rest of the cast feels very cliche trope-y with your classic harem stereotypes.So, the reason this is a challenging show to review is because most of the show feels decent, but ultimately somewhat forgettable.  But it winds up having potentially the best ending I've ever seen to any season of anything and completely 180's what you've watched up to that point.  It fundamentally sets up anime cliches for the whole series only to turn them on their head.  It left me wishing for a second season more than any other show I've ever seen.  I would say it is a 6.5-7/10 series with a 10/10 ending.  So, if you can see yourself sitting through a 12 episode series for a moment's payoff, this is likely a show for you.",

This is an anime about the MC using his wits to reach what's supposed to be the ultimate goal and something currently unachieved byall the people who've attended the school before, reaching Class A from Class D.\\n\r\nAnd if a minor spoiler ahead, the MC is a guy who'd rather hide his strength and let others take the credit than bask in the glory of his success.\\n\r\n    You won't be able to pry much into his past, but will get a gist of what it was and why he is, however, he is right now. \\n\r\n    IMO The beginning few episodes also don't pull much into the story, however. So don't be quick to judge it.\\n\r\n    And it looks like it's gonna be a harem sooner or later (which I personally like Since I like harem ).\\n\r\n    I'm rather looking forward to its second season. \\n\r\nPS.

It gets a bit silly at times in typical anime fashion, and the main character isn't really relatable because he has the personality of a piece of wood, but overall the show holds up pretty well. It's cool to see students survive in this fascist school where real money is on the table and there are a couple of mysteries that will keep you on your toes. Every character is different and they all have a hidden dark side that makes them more unique. Also, I love how the music stops sometimes to make certain moments funny. Definitely worth checking outsince it's one of the few good shows out there right now.",

The idea of each class over riding each other in the matter of academic achievements and other achievements is very interesting and how everything is managed with points and not real money. The art style is amazing and has smooth graphics during fighting scenes and most of the scenes in general. The voice acting is amazing and i though all the voices fit the characters wonderfully.I thoroughly loved this anime and cannot wait for season two to come out when ever it is named to.",

Well, not like Ayanokouji Kiyotaka's! \r\nIt all begins with the school entrance exams after which everyone gets separated in classes from A to D (or should I say from Super Smarties to Proclaimed Idiots). However, this year D class might be a liiiitle bit different. As you watch the episodes you'll see more and more from Ayanokouji's hidden inner side which is much more complex than what anyone, even Horikita, can ever imagine. Moreover, with the school's shady system of giving/extracting points it is only natural that there can be a lot of unexpected twists thanks to the competition againstthe other classes' \"masterminds\". The reason I liked this anime is that I enjoy all the plotting and the fact that with each episode you gain more and more desire to see how far can Ayankokouji get his class? How dangerous can he get? That's why I really hope there can be a season 2. I just gotta see Kiyotaka's total domination over each class and character. \\n\\n\r\nTo summary it all without much spoiling - prepare for a darker and insanely genius MC (with beautiful firelike eyes), a lot of scheming, a few OVA like moments and graphically well-made characters and scenery.  However, if you've read the manga first you probably won't like the anime as i hear there are a lot of important moments removed, plus more Horikita centered scenes.",

You start to notice some odd things about him throughout the show, though. I don't want to spoil, but he is great. The whole show I am wondering, What is he thinking? What is going on inside his head? Sometimes it shows a flashback of when he was a kid, but doesn't explain it at all. The other characters are good too, and I really relate to Suzune Horikita and her dislike of humanity. The other charactersdon't seem all that original to me, sadly. The ending really left me wanting more. It will be sooooo disappointing if there isn't a second season. There are still many, many things I want to find out. This show is awesome, but if there isn't another season, then watching the first season seems kind of like a waste of time. It leaves too much information out.",

Before that however, I would like to say that, in my personal opinion, this is the best anime I have seen out of Summer 2017, if not the entire year. It is a very interesting and unique take on the school genre. However, if you do not enjoy being kept in the dark about your story, and don't want to ask yourself questions, then I do not recommend this show for you.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI will notgo too in-depth into the story, but this anime is about students who are studying in an elite high-school, and who also face interesting scenarios during their time there. In other reviews, there have been many people comparing this anime to \"similar\" ones like \"Oregairu\", but I urge you not to go in expecting a story like that. I found this anime to be very unique, while also being thoroughly entertaining. It also kept me waiting eagerly to watch each new episode because of the mysterious nature of the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10 and 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is absolutely stunning- while still having a few interesting quirks here and there, like the characters' multicoloured eyes. Such good art deserves a high score. While I do not pay too much attention to sound in an anime, it plays an important role in the creation of atmosphere in an anime, which is executed very well here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe various different kinds of character in this anime make for an extremely interesting and entertaining viewing as we get to know them. There were also hidden backstories and mystery surrounding some of the characters, which kept me waiting for more and more episodes, and asking myself more and more questions, which greatly increased my enjoyment of this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Impression: 10/10 and 10/10\\n\r\nAs said before, this is one of the best anime I have ever watched, and I do not regret using up time to watch it. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy this kind of genre and plot. I have no complaints whatsoever about this anime, and I am looking forward to a much-anticipated 2nd Season.\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE: ~9.83 (Rounded up to 10.0)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers \r\nBaka & Test was a fun, comedy series that focused on students having battles and gaining points to rank up their class, Classroom of the Elite works in a similar manner, however it is more serious and darker compared to Baka & Test.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story mainly follows Ayanokouji Kiyotaka and Horikita Suzune, who are basically trying to get Class-D to become Class-A, but getting to this position isn't going to be easy.\r\nNow Baka & Test didn't really have much of a story other than something similar to this, hence why I made the comparison so quickly, but this mainly qualifies for thefirst half of Classroom of the Elite.\\n\r\nThe first half has the students trying to gain points so they can use them to buy essentials, but the amount of points they have also represents their level in the school, however the show quickly moves away from this story element and decides to become more of a mystery, psychological anime as Ayanokouji and Suzune try to solve certain things that could damage their classes position, how they solved these situations was pretty clever, but not brilliant.\\n\r\nThe second half suddenly makes the become it's own thing as the students of each class are sent to a desert island and have to survive there for a week, this is when the show becomes more about trust and co-operation, although I thought it was a little stupid how class-D slowly fell apart because the girls thought one of the guys stole someones panties, which made the whole thing seem a little ridiculous.\\n\r\nThough I will admit how Class-D ended up being the victors at the end of the whole desert island thing did surprise me and of course the final words that Ayanokouji says during the final scene did make me feel hyped for another season, that is if it ever happens.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere was a surprisingly nice mixture of characters in this show, although there were only a few that stood out for me.\\n\r\nAyanokouji is the male MC and he was actually a pretty cool character, despite having a similar personality to Houtarou from Hyouka, he did help people more and he was pretty badass whenever a fight came his way, but probably the best part is the big secret he has kept hidden from everyone, showing he is pretty much an anti-hero or even an anti-villain.\\n\r\nSuzune is the female MC and for a Tsundere character, she was actually pretty good, she likes to keep to herself and doesn't interact with people unless it's beneficial for her, but she does become more open by the end of the series and she does have a softer side hidden away, it's sadly being kept locked away because of her goal to be in Class-A. She's very perceptive too, being able to read people's personalities just by looking at them.\\n\r\nKushida is another female MC, she's the friendly kind of person often wanting to help anyone whenever they are in trouble, at first I thought she was just here for cute fanservice, until it showed her dark side which shows she is a lot more menacing than you think and made her character 10x more interesting, sadly though the show doesn't this side of her often.\\n\r\nSakura is another female character who has some involvement, she is the most shy and paranoid of the characters, yet she is also the most open at the same time, this is due to her taking sexy photos of herself and putting it on social media, but this doesn't make her a bad person, in fact she's very sweet and becomes more sweet once she starts becoming more open to the other characters.\\n\r\nTrue there are a lot more characters than this, but these were the ones who I pretty much gave a damn about, the other characters weren't forgettable though as they kept doing things that made them memorable, there just isn't a lot to talk about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOther than the characters having really well coloured and detailed eyes, there isn't much to talk about here that I have seen in countless other anime's, although there was another thing that caught my eye and it was the characters hair. For some reason the edge of their hair would be a lighter colour compared to the rest of it, so I don't know if this was a good or a bad thing.\\n\r\nAnother thing I realised is how similar some characters look to some of the characters from Baka & Test, Sudo looks like a mean version of Yuuji and Ayanokouji looks like a smart, unhappy version of Yoshii just with darker hair, so it was kinder funny how many similarities there were between this show and Baka & Test.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op was ok, it kinda reminded me of Baka & Test's opening which had a lot of colours, this anime had a more serious version really, although I was a little confused by the text being everywhere, I know it probably means something, but I don't really care too much about it to look into it.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say this is a serious version of Baka & Test, I really mean it, because a lot of the characters have plenty of psychological issues with their personalities and the best candidates are Kushida who is a menacing bitch if you piss her off, Sakura who has some really big paranoia problems, Suzane who just doesn't like being around people and Hirata who can become quite unstable when the situation deteriorates very badly. It just comes to show that even though this is a school for the most elite people, there can be dark secrets hidden within them, which is what makes the psychological part of this show very interesting especially Ayanokouji who has the biggest secret of all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a pretty entertaining show, it has some meh moments like the swimming pool episode and other parts, but it holds up pretty good against some of the other summer 2017 anime's, so if you're interested in seeing what a serious version of Baka & Test would look like then this is something worth checking out.",

            "content": "A show that started off quite strong, but ultimately collapsed due to bad pacing and minimal character development. \r\nThe premise of the story is a little generic; there are too many \"elite classroom\" shows out there, but what made this one semi-interesting is the usage of \"class points\" as currency. The system is not exactly clear, but in general each class collectively earns points by doing well on exams etc., and can lose points if they sleep in class, fail exams. etc. \"Class points\" can buy basically anything in the school, including entrance into a higher class, which everyone below Class A is striving for.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll soon discover our generic, average MC is not so average after all. He reminds me a lot of the MC in Mahouka, so if you enjoy that type of character, you'll probably find this one interesting as well. As the show reveals more and more about the nature of our MC and what he's hiding, you'll soon discover many of the other characters have their own secrets as well. All of this happens in about the first half of the story (~6 eps). \\n\\n\r\nThen the pacing began to slow down to an unbearable pace. The second half contained many fillers, or what at least felt like fillers. The show throws many questions into the story, but fails to answer any of them. Save for the MC, character development basically stops; we don't witness why these shady characters do the things they do, or what drove them to become this way. I will admit that the last episode was actually quite strong, and we get a deeper glimpse into the motivations behind the MC, but it came at the cost of learning nothing about the other characters for the latter half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show started off with an interesting enough premise and cast, but lost itself along the way. The conclusion was still quite good, however, so it's still worth watching if you really enjoy this genre.",

            "content": "Youkoso jitsuryoku Shinjou Shugi no Kyoshitsu e(Classroom of the Elite) is about this school that has no possible way of existing and let me tell you why. This school, Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School, completely isolated from the entire country and students are restricted from the outside to make them into better people.Its kinda like boot camp except it has other types of places and accommodations.Each student is give a lot -AND I MEAN A LOT- of money each month, and there are other places where they can spend it on the campus like a convenience store, a mall, restaurants, a movie theaters, karaoke bars,cruise ships that are worth couple hundreds of thousands of dollars, and their own island completely owned by them and much more. There are four classes: A,B,C,D who are ranked and get more money each month by rank. But after the first year, class D, who the show revolves around ,decide to slack off and spend all their money to the point where they don't get anymore money. Also, if anyone fails a quiz they will get expelled.So now they have to work hard to outrank the other classes \"Baka and Test style.And by \"they\" , I mean a handful of people in the whole class and that's it.The actual premise is the strong part of the show. It is very surreal about this concept of this school and how it works. You really are interested seeing if class D actually works their way up, but disappointingly, they don't really work their way up, they just rank up higher at the last moment. It's amazing what you realize after the final episode. Reflecting back, the whole show was SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWING down and then there are times where the show just skips in time. It's like instead of moving forward, the show just stood there , stumbled back a couple times and then did a really far jump at the last moment. Not in plot but in the progression of class D which is all that matters.And don't even get me started on the swimming pool episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was done by Lerche who if they are known for anything its(heh) not having above average animation. It's not bad,per say, but it is so average that there is nothing to remark on it. This show is full of talking heads anyway. What it lacks in that, it makes up with for its art. The character designs are pretty......generic, but pretty nonetheless. The background itself  is impressive for the amount of detail on the objects. For example, in the stores there are labels on all the items and in scenes where there are a lot of people present, there are different faces and completely colored people in back which shows just how much time they spent on the art direction. The character design can look a bit nonsensical. If you look close enough at the female characters, they seem to have transparent hair and looking at the others it seems that the new trend is to fade the color at the end of their to make it look like they dipped their hair ends in bleach or something, The show tries to also take the fancy pants route by titling each episode in different languages of quotes from other famous people that relates to the episode. That's a clever way of foreshadowing each episode but it doesn't really fit with the show because reading is not something the world of this show interacts with. There is a character who likes to read,so maybe if each quote was said by a character in the show who likes to read, it could tie together. Otherwise the show would do the worst thing:become pretentious...( which is a very bad thing to me).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is intense but bland. In other words its okay but compared to other intensive techno modern soundtrack, there are way better choices. The opening is done by ZAQ which is always a good thing because damn, she can sing!I like how the beginning of it she ranges the volume of her voice.Also, the guy who had the guitar did a good job.The ending is all right. I mean, what else should i say? And the dub which is a funimation one is okay. There are a lot of talent in the dub and some of the other performances are not the best. I don't blame it on the actors themselves just the characters they play. SPEAKING OF WHICH.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Note-This part is somewhat of a rant about the incompetence of characters in this show and of course there are spoilers. If you wish to avoid them, skip the sentences surrounded by {{brackets}}.\\n\r\nThe characters  in this show are some of the most disappointing ones i've seen in a good while. It may be just me but I really didn't like the route they went with the characters in the show. Lets start with people not in class D. The other characters in the show are told to the audience just how smart and egotisticalthey are to a point where you don't like them, and you are not supposed to like them. Yet, they slip up trying to deal with the smallest of things. Throughout the show, it felt like the other classes(besides class B) were out to do everything to screw up class D.But then they get ahead of themselves and of course there is an opportunity for class D to progress. And this progress is mainly because of 5, no . 3 , wait, 2 of the people in the class. Horikita and Ayanokouji. I'll get to Ayankouji later....Horikita is pretty much Yozora from  Haganai if she didn't want to make The Neighbors Club.She gets the most development than anyone in the show.At first, she is silent and soft-spoken. But she is actually cynical to a ridiculous degree. If someone tried to talk to her, she would get so angry out of the way.When she realizes that the class is in peril, she blames all the other students.When she actually tries to do something about it, she immediately acquits it.There are times where she cracks, but those sides of her really show how relatable she is.Then there is Kikyou who is the popular girl who wants to make friends with everyone but it's a more beneficial than mutual relationship.She is a character that actually has a twist but they don't really do anything with it.There were so many times where she could use the twist for great effect but they just cast her into the background in the second half. Then there are the other characters in class D that go to Assassination Classroom levels of introducing random people. The spotlight really feels like it was pulling out of a hat full of names when it comes to the people in this show. Yet, there are the people in the show the spotlight stares at for the longest while before falling asleep.This is the case with the bully person,Ken. He is straight up dead weight for Class D. He pretty much yells at everything. He doesn't like when other people try to help him despite the fact he is going to be expelled , yet [[he starts to act surprised when he is about to be expelled.And then there is this time where he gets threatened to be expelled because he got into a fight or something, but when he gets accused, his yelling doesn't really help and after all the mess that Class D went through in order to save Ken, he still acts annoying and impulsive. After that the show just blends him into the background till the end.]] Horikita's also has a brother who is the student council president and a huge douche, but they don't go anywhere with him and her dynamic. Then there is the teacher who is doing a good job of being sexy and a bad teacher kinda like Cameron Diaz accept her motives are not to get a boob job. I mean, it could be, but the show doesn't really tell.Then there is that egotistical *cough* cunt with the blonde hair that is for some reason on the front of the promo art when he doesn't do  anything accept look at himself in the mirror and walks around naked while the camera zooms in on him. Next thing you know, he just leaves.No pay off whatsoever. And last but not least, there is Ayanokoji, a character that doesn't just make me indignant, but also resentful. So much that I have to dedicate one whole paragraph about him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKiyotaka Ayanakoji is the main character and he is one of the worst main character I have seen in a long while.iAt first I didn't like him.At the end of the show though, I really really really hated him.He takes the whole cliche of a bland male character who knows everything at the most convenient times to the next level by having the same facial expression and voice tone in ANY situation. Either if it's him getting in a fight, being framed for sexual assault and even being threatened to be expelled. Of course a normal person would act like he has better things to do even though it is all the time.What exponentially made me hate him was the end of the seriesSPOILERS[[It turns out that throughout the whole trip of working up class D, he was just trying to win and doesn't really care about anyone else.]] I hate people like this.This just shows that he never grew as a person the whole time. It was like every situation he was in he solved before he got into them and that doesn't make him relatable at all. Maybe people like characters like that but if it is the MAIN character it just makes the character boring and you will just have to watch the other unlikable people who get more spotlight than the characters that are likable and that's when you know that you failed at writing a main character.Bring in an example: Saitama from One Punch Man is similar solving a situation quickly by killing everyone in one punch. It is different with him because he still has to face trying to be accepted by society which is his conflict. Ayanokoyji has none of that. There is no person that tests or tries to break his mind set and gets a reaction out of him. If there is a season 2,(lets face it there won't be) then it desperately needs to do something about this. Getting back to his mindset at the end of the show, It is very stupid.{{ He wants himself and no one else to succeed at the end but this whole thing of Class D working their way to the top was a GROUP effort, which means that him being selfish won't help because his entire class is responsible for getting good grades, so he should be helping everyone and becoming loyal instead of being self centered.I have literal paragraphs on this shitty person, but you have more better things to do so I going to go ahead and wrap this up by saying he is a shit character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot to put it like this, but this show is pretty much the Challenger explosion from a ground view.When it takes off it is promising but then the worst parts of the show engulf the entire show at the last moment sending pieces hurdling toward earth and in the end this show is just an exploded ass fuck of a mess.\\n\r\nThe story had potential but is uneven, the character writing is amateurish and incompetent,the art and OP are very strong but don't fully make up for the mess,and the show is just a little pretentious and it makes me angry because of all the other mistakes,I had a fun time watching the show, but this was just an ersatz feeling of accomplishment that did not pay off at all when the screen thanking me for watching the whole show came about. This show is just the definition of disappointment which is not the fault of the fanbase, just the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nThere are times like this where I watch a show and feel like I wasted over three hours of my life. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is the most brilliant show I've watched, with the two genius main characters delving into the psychology of the people around them, in order to have an understanding of the way their school works, and how to make it through school successfully. The side characters are pretty well developed, with their personalities being pretty distinct, and well understood.  The art is nice, although I found the multi-coloredeyes and hair slightly distracting. In terms of how well I enjoyed the anime, the plot was so fascinating I could hardly put it down, although I had to take breaks to think things over, to make sure I was following the complicated thought process of our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I would give this anime a rating of 10/10, being that I believe it is a masterpiece... but only intellectually.

            "content": "I believe Youkoso had potential to become a masterpiece.\r\nThe intriguing concept of classism, a school system where you need to rely on your classmates to survive and using psychological tactics and strategies to win at any cost. \r\nAs a psychologist in training, this, of course, delighted me.\r\nIt reminded me of Oregairu, going for a darker and sinister twist. After all, Ayanokouji reminded me of 8man gone bad. Same with Yukino (Suzune) and Yui (Kikiyou) mixed with Assassination Classroom vibe. There was a feeling that if the anime had taken the right direction, it could wind up a special and memorable piece of work.\r\nHowever, it feltshort midway and ultimately played itself with questionable development, unnecessary fan services and cliche anime trademarks. Before I know it, it simply became like any other generic anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b STRENGTH \u203b\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Strong lead characters. There are enough backstory and character personality to showcase each character would handle a situation in different ways.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Unique MC. Many of the anime community love characters like 8man. It was definitely a moment of glee when he doesn't fall short like a weak-minded or generic main character.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Concept of class. I thought the idea of 100,000 yen / month was captivating and alluring, offering the viewer some curiosity and wondering how this show will turn out.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Unpredictability. We want to know what happens next. We want to know how the plot development plays out and ultimately, what our cynical MC do to overcome all of that.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b WEAKNESS \u203b \\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Pointless pool episode. Cut that episode out, the entire season will still function fine on it's own. For an anime filled with great expectation from the audience, relying on petty fanservice and oppai shots alone is nothing more than shooting itself in the head.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Harem suggestion. As the episodes went on, there was an implication there that MC will have somewhat of a harem in which I find illogical and unable to comprehend why they feel the need to take this generic route when it had so much potential\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Beginning quotes. To be honest, 5 seconds of those has completely nothing to do with the episode itself. I felt like it was added there for some sort of emotional impact but in the end, became lackluster and insipid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWas this anime worth watching? I definitely think so.\\n\\n\r\nWould I rewatch? No but I do pray for a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this anime had the potential to become a unique and different type of masterpiece but shot itself short by needing to appeal to the viewers with cliche anime movements and irrelevant fan services.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, it's still a good anime overall, especially to people who have a liking to psychology, deception and a sense of cynicism.",

            "content": "Have you ever felt like punching a wall out of anger and frustration? If not, then at least tell me you once thought of committing such an act given some shitty set of circumstances. Life teaches us restraints for precisely such moments or it doesn\u2019t, and we lash out.\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e serves as a memento of sorts giving its viewership the opportunity to glance over at what may happen when either violence, or the repression of it, is consistently being applied to a roster of characters\u2026In a cutesy anime high-school setting of course.\r\nThe story is basked in an eerie undertone instantlyspurring  in you a sense of uneasiness: I, for one, was on edge the whole time while watching the show. If the expression \u201ccutting the tension with a knife\u201d holds any merit here, I would be well tempted to reverse the entry by saying: the tension in this series probably has the potency to manifest physical form and then proceed to stab you with a knife: It\u2019s fucked up. Maybe I\u2019m also a little fucked up for thinking such things\u2026 but less of me, and more on the show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fucked up\u2026the whole cast in this show is. Most of them are flat-out maniacal psychopaths; our MC being the king who reigns supreme. Put together, not even one of these monsters can be considered \u201cnormal\u201d. From a chick with multiple personalities, to a male lead who finds it his prerogative to just manipulated people for his own gains, we witness a whole slew of ego-centric hellions; willing to do anything for the achievement of their goals, to the detriment of those around them.\\n\\n\r\nI previously stated that the show was taking place in a high-school, but it\u2019s far from an ordinary one (shocker!). I say this because, unlike most high-schools, stringent in their enforcement of policies and rules, we have here an educational institution that completely lacks a code of law in how one is to handle themselves within its grounds. In a \u201cno holds barred\u201d approach, cheating, embezzling, discriminating, and straight-up beating people up, are all allowable means by which you can succeed in this school: the exception being not to get caught. The school\u2019s administration clearly had in mind a curriculum that banked on emulating what it defines as \u201cthe real world\u201d by sharpening its students\u2019 use of artifices, machinations, and ploys. They had an objective to raise the next generation by drenching them in corruption and greed. And I think they\u2019ve succeeded quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story\u2019s continuation is succeeded in its literature, either the manga [Spin-off] or novel [Main storyline], you\u2019re in for a ride if you plan on watching these 12 gems (aka episodes). They pack a lot of content, some bad, some below-average I guess. However, it isn\u2019t the actual content of the show you should put at the forefront. If my last three paragraphs were any indication, focus on the characters, and the general atmosphere Kyoushitsu emanates: that\u2019s where it shines. \\n\\n\r\nFocus on the characters because, honestly, some, not all of course, are very interesting. This is best exemplified by our Main: Ayanokouji Kiyotaka (Taka for short). He perfectly depicts the image of a \u201cmastermind\u201d both literally and figuratively. For fear of crossing the \u201cspoiler\u201d border just south of me however, I\u2019ll only elaborate on why Taka is such a bad ass in general terms. For one thing, he\u2019s one hell of a cool customer, for another, he\u2019s a walking, talking enigma. We\u2019re looking here at someone who clearly isn\u2019t giving us the whole story of who, or what he is. As Suzune [Female MC] puts it: \u201c[He\u2019s] always so cryptic [\u2026]\u201d. With limited information, on both his past, and in the way he sometimes executes his plans throughout the show, Taka is both misunderstood, for the most part, and a complete unknown; which enhances the intrigue as we observe such a reserved student secretly being the master craftsmen behind all of the story\u2019s concoctions. What I appreciated the most was his overall demeanor as well as his ability to take complete and utter control of every situation. For any unforeseen event, this lead comes prepared. When conflicts within the story arise, the solution to them can be found in his way of thinking. The nutso with a working plan\u2026that\u2019s Taka. For better or worse, the anime series does at least one thing right by drafting an MC who looks, and is, cool. He might be evil incarnate, but I\u2019m rooting for him.\\n\\n\r\nFocus on the atmosphere because, you get to appreciate countless interactions between characters, who are straight up lying to one another. It\u2019s great acting, because everyone puts on these airs of subtle hypocrisy, and most nail it deftly. In many situations, you often find yourself perplexed searching for whom the good gal/guy even is, if any at all. Hell, it gets tricky sometimes. As the worst of the worst sometimes give you the impression that deep down they show signs of compassion laced with empathy, only to pull a 180 and show you their deviousness once more; fickle doesn\u2019t begin to describe it. What\u2019s even more perplexing is the main characters\u2019 facial expressions. Two of them don\u2019t ever smile, not even once. And the third one, flips her switch on and off, on and off, on and...stop! The consistent solemness of the former two, coupled with the, at times exuberant, at times demonic, attitude given by the latter balances the show nicely and does nothing but ameliorate the general angst you feel the show bathes itself in.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a sucker for flicks with good MCs\u2019 in them. Suffice it to say, Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e nailed it on all three counts. When complemented by such an eerie atmosphere as well, the show definitely has a lot going for it. It sought the right combination of things so quality inevitably became its consequent.\\n",

            "content": "Omoshiroi!!! One of the most interesting animes I've seen this year. It does not only successfully manage to quickly create an interesting plot line, but it also keeps you guessing until the end.\r\nThis anime has two strong features: interesting setting, great characters. The school and the points system immediately got me sucked into the story, because it really seems like a good idea, focusing education not only on traditional learning and individual success, but forcing the whole class to act together, making students responsible for both their individual and joint decisions and behavior.\r\nAlso, many of the characters have either a deep dark secret or ahidden personality, so you never stop asking yourself who they are and how they got into this school or what special talent do they possess. Ayanokoujj is certainly one of the most intriguing characters I have encountered in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nArt, animation and music all seemed average to me, but it did not affect my enjoyment of the show. I must say though that animation quality really hit rock bottom right on the last episode, with distorted heads and facial expressions, even in the last scene.\\n\\n\r\nI for one really enjoyed this show. Some light novel readers said it deviated from the original story and did not make the best selection in terms of which arcs to exploit. I can imagine that being true (you do get some typical and uninspired clich\u00e9s like big boobs and bikinis), but it is still a very good anime. I only regret its brevity (alas, the ongoing curse of 12 episode seasons for really good shows) and the fact that I am not a LN reader.\\n",

There is a twist to the show though. The main character might talk awkwardly, but he is observant, thoughtful, highly apathetic/pessimistic, yet at the same time wants to make friends. The tsundere girl has an insecurity issue, which she makes up for by isolating herself from everyone else.Unlike a typical tsundere character who is usually just violent or a narcissist. The popular girl is a kind person who gets along with most of the class rather than being unkind to those below her. The lack of parents clich\u00e9 is explained for once, as they are isolated in a government-run program that makes them live away from family. The unique twists of your slice of life make it enjoyable to watch. characters are all the same type except the protagonist. ayanokouji, the character itself is a story. waiting for the 2nd season.\\n",

You have a\"bland\" but mysterious MC who at first appears like a background character.  \r\nIn the middle, because the series blew up trivial things in school over \"points\" and over dramatized them, I thought it was a bit silly. But then I started enjoying the psychological twist to each step, and eventually started to realize that the MC is much more complex than I initially thought. Though the other characters aren't that interesting, the MC really makes up forthe series because it's a unique perspective that we hardly see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere are very few series that I've seen for which I was left satisfied with the ending. This is one of them, surprisingly. Though the story is incomplete, and we're kind of left at a cliff hanger, it's a really appropriate ending that satisfies the viewer up to this point yet leaves the viewer craving for more in the next season.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, I really ended up enjoying this series. Again, though the other characters are kinda \"meh\", the MC really makes up for everything in my eyes. He's mysterious, manipulative, and analytical, but this adds to the psychological edge of this series.",

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite Review\r\nClassroom of the Elite indeed took me by surprise with a first episode that grasped my attention.   It takes place in a prestigious school where the good and the great are separated. Or in this case, the good and the bad. However, just as I feared, it started to fall off quite a bit. I\u2019ll keep this short and simple.\r\nCOTE started off quite strongly, with an intense atmosphere in the first couple of episodes. It supposedly grasped the attention of the viewers and it sure has grabbed mine. We see early the ambitions or goals of some of thepeople in Class D, which is to get to class A together. While some may strive to reach this goal, some others rather not care.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the problems that occurred in the series is the feeling of rushed pacing, although not quite. It\u2019s not terribly rushed, but I feel like they wanted to get things done faster than usual. But one of my main concerns lie within the inconsistent storyline, where things are just clustered and messed up.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning it was fine that the fact that the show was a narrative, but now I think that they tried just a little too hard to be a narrative focused show at this point. The \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cmeaningful\u201d seeming dialogue felt a bit weak and felt like it had little impact for me to care at all about it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my main problems with COTE lies within the lack of any sort of character growth throughout the series. I feel like they tried to focus the anime too hard on our 2 main characters Ayanokoji and Suzune. Even with all that focus on those 2 I still didn't feel any significant development between the 2 besides becoming friends or something. I have talked with some LN readers and was told the difference between the LN and anime regarding this, and was saddened cause the LN handled it better than the anime. I just wished the anime followed the LN\u2019s steps as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation stayed to be one of the best even with the lack of a good written story. I can see that they really put a lot of effort into animating this series and handled it with care. If only they did the same to the execution.\\n\\n\r\nStill regarding the characters, they like they had no significant role since most of the focus were on our main characters. Which is a shame because I would\u2019ve loved to see more and learn more about some certain characters. Something that I didn't appreciate was how some character reveals something, but after that, it becomes irrelevant to the story whatsoever. It felt like they just threw it to the side and we see either little or none of those reveals anymore.\\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about the fan service. Listen, I am someone who does not mind fan service whatsoever. I will admit, the fan service in this series is good. The girls make you wanna bust a nut and the art quality when it comes to the service is tremendous I will give them that. However, I feel like it\u2019s been used wrongly and just for the sake of fan service of course. I feel like they tried to somehow tie that into some sort of plot progression and I didn't like that.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the problems concerning Ayanokoji. Don\u2019t get me wrong I did enjoy his character and how he was initially written. I feel as though they didn't bring out his true potential as a Main Character. I felt like more could\u2019ve been done to give him a more fully developed type of character. It felt like he served little purpose in the series (with a few exceptions).\\n\\n\r\nThe initial goal of reaching class A started to fade while the second half of the series played. Honestly, it felt like I was watching 2 seasons of a show into one 12 episode anime. They start leaving things that were probably critical plot and left it behind, later one there\u2019s no real connection between the situations that were given to us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a disappointment. I did not hate the series however, but it had its moments and was still kinda entertaining. However, it still failed in executing a proper written story that had a nice concept at the beginning. The only things I can praise about regarding this series is the beautiful art and animation as well as the soundtrack. Even if this anime fell off later one, they still kept the same uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the show, well executed or not. It is indeed a shame however that it was only 12 episodes. If Classroom of The Elite had more time and episodes to develop the story as well as the characters with a good written narrative, I truly believed that this could\u2019ve been a fantastic anime. It is indeed very unfortunate. Almost Lerche.\\n\\n",

Many people hate the unrealistic setting questioning the origins of the funding or idiocy of setting. They point out how unrealistic the currency works and how the plot bends for its own convenience. The biggest point is the underdeveloped the characters and the typical wish-fulfillment main character that gets all the girls. Forme, the biggest problem is how loose the opening cynical quote actually relates to the story.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is beautiful. The opening itself is visually appealing and sounds upbeat and cheery. While the setting is very generic and ridiculous, I feel it goes well with the stereotypical characters. Many other reviews believe that the characters and poorly developed. I say this is a design choice. This show is trying to present a huge mind game between four major factions and how they try to one-up each other and no one knows who the other person is thinking. This is the key point: You don't know what they're thinking, they don't know what the others are thinking about. They are people trying to figure out how to manipulate the game and become the victor. With stereotypical characters, we are somewhat satisfied with \"underdeveloped characters\" as we can somewhat have an idea what some characters will do. My favorite is Ayanokouji, the main character that we know nothing about. He distances from others and never tells others about himself. He never has any soliloquies that reveal his own goals. Therefore, the viewers are connected to none and are forced to look through the lenses of the side characters. This is the point that this show is trying to sell.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not for everyone. If you hate stereotypes or love shows that make you think, then this is not for you. My advice when watching this show, go in without thinking anything. Do not question how things in the show work. Instead, focus on trying to decipher the main character. He might bore you, but that's his appeal. Hope you aren't too bothered by the wish-fulfillment.\\n\\n",

I don't intend to write a long review, I just came to say that with the way it is now, this show is mediocre at best. On the other hand, if it gets a second season or some other form of continuation I would gladly take out this review, but the show really just needed to get into the characters more. They created a lot of characters with multiple (sides) to them, but with the way it ended, we have no real reason as to WHY theyare this way. With more looks into their backstories and a real resolution, this show would likely be among some of my favorites.",

            "content": "What LA sees in Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is not of \"human equality\" though it plays a factor, more on the lines of \"humans have more than one side to themselves and you can never know what a person is truly like in society\".\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is touted as in extremely polarizing anime from Summer 2017, either being too up it's own philosophies of human society with blatant fanservice and a cliche storm disguising itself as smart or an anime that is actually intelligent and able to relay it's messages of human society well. LA is on thelatter however the detractors do have points to them as well.\\n\\n\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e's cast is quite large immediately with 4 classes consisting of 20+ students then there are the staff and teachers to deal with, at best Class D gets the majority of the focus but even then it's still limited to Kiyotaka Ayanokouji voiced by Shouya Chiba, Suzune Horikita voiced by Akari Kito and Kikyou Kushida voiced by Yurika Kubo, the rest of the Class D are either wheels for Ayanokouji and Suzune or they have a character arc along with them. Now Ayanokouji is by in large a rather complex yet emotionless character justifying his way to help people only by giving glory to someone else in order for him to be left alone but even then we can't really get a hold of him let alone his extremely vague past or what he is thinking. If there was anything LA would place on Ayanokouji would be the matter of him being the audience proxy to what this kind of classism hierarchy structure of a school society would do to someone where society is forcing him to act. Suzune is a more reactionary character to Ayanokouji and although her character development to opening up to people in order for her own goal of reaching Class A, she is still an interesting character to LA, LA doesn't know maybe it's LA's affinity to tsundere's. Kushida on the other hand well she was a surprise if anything but she like Ayanokouji are similar a brings up LA's statement of \"humans have more than one side to themselves\". Due to the large cast however the majority of characters that are not important to the plot or situation does get shafted ALOT though they too are reactionary characters to some of the plot twists at hand. Before LA does get into LA's favourite character in Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e LA would like to talk about the rivals of Class D, those being Kouhei Katsuragi voiced by Satoshi Hino and Arisu Sakayanagi voiced by Rina Hidaka of Class A who are the prim and proper yet tactically cunning rivals to Ayanokouji and Suzune to Kakeru Ryuuen voiced by Masaaki Mizunaka of Class C who is the laid back yet street-smarts backstabbing rival to EVERYONE in the school. LA doesn't want to go too deep into it, but LA suggests it reflects what people would do to get to the top as well as those with power to gather power to suppress the commoners and less intelligent. So LA's favourite character....you'd think it was Suzune but no! it was Honami Ichinose from Class B voiced by Nao Touyama.......yes shut up. \\n\\n\r\nLA will note that this anime does add in blatant amount of fanservice from chest to ass shots to it's almost uselessly annoying pool episode and all but as much as it's blatant it is it doesn't discourage the plot or characters in any way (besides THAT POOL EPISODE) and is just another element for Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e that doesn't deter THAT much from the plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e's philosophical ramblings, LA does think have relevance in this anime and sure HOW it was displayed is tacted on at times especially with the episodes titles being quotes from famous literature and sayings about human society but even with quotes characters say about the situation they are in mainly coming from Ayanokouji and Class D's teacher Sae Chabashira voiced by Rina Sato where Ayanokouji and by extension the entire Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e cast are weaving, bumping, streamlining and surviving in the little school society they have made for themselves whereas in say Sakurada Reset, them trying to \"sound\" philosophical comes out as not trying at all so that they can only \"sound smart and deep\" when in reality it's naval gazing as it's most boring bringing nothing to the table. Sure people might think the philosophies used in Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e are just for show but that's kinda what philosophy is about you either believe in it or not and in this case, whether you believe Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e  added in their philosophy correctly or not...it's completely up to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Lerche is actually great all things considered, from the flashy uniforms of the majority of the characters to some distinct character designs even from a large cast as big as this. The animation also has some striking \"No Game, No Life\" purple glare on effects LA did notice and was done well in nonetheless. The mood and atmosphere on the animation is also nicely conveyed through colors, shading and atmosphere and was also done to striking effect, from the grayed out blackness symbolizing dread and despair from the end of the first episode to the more tense moments giving us the more striking intense red. LA just loves this color palette Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e had. What can LA say, the animation was great and expected from Lerche in their extremely overboard high school animes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well there are some standouts and no Ayanokouji your obviously not one of them, what with Shouya Chiba's deadpan vocals all throughout the anime. Yes LA could easily give the best voice acting to Nao Touyama, but LA......actually like Akari Kito as Suzune more, if not because of here rare dere moments. What was a surprise was Yurika Kubo as Kushida as this is ANOTHER side of her vocals LA has NOT seen at all and it is glorious to say the least, LA just wished LA could hear it more and because of that LA absolutely commends Yurika Kubo for her role as Kushida.\\n\\n\r\nYoukoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is alot of things, from typical high school anime with a gimmick, philosophical and character studies on human society, fanservicey distracted plot or just simply a great anime or a terrible one. Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e for LA is not merely an anime about human society and their equality, it's also about how humans can't ever even if they tried truly know someone and it felt for LA to be perfectly manifested in Ayanokouji our main central narrative character and how he deals with things in his classism-like school society. Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is definitely not LA's favourite anime of Summer 2017 nor do LA thinks it's the \"MOST HOLY FUCK PHILOSOPHICAL ANIME EVAR\" far from it, it's more like a decent interesting kind of anime from LA's experience. But with how polarizing this anime has become LA thinks you should watch it and see for yourself what Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is, not out of necessity but intrigue.",

It is not a typical school, they have a unique system called as \"S-system\" where the students from this school are assessed and assigns them for what they are worth based on their performance evaluation, this school also has a ranking system, the more points the class have the higher ranking they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story shows the consequences that could happen based on what action of the students does or how they would respond in certain situations that could affect not only to the Individual self but also the whole class that he or she's in. We will see how the main characters will tackle this problems or take advantage of it in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this series is at least above average not that grand nor bad. characters have decent design the background is well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening is Decent, OST is average the sound effects is well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of interesting and mysterious characters in this series, sadly most of them don't have major roles in this arc that the anime covers this season.\\n\\n\r\nso lets straight ahead to main characters(I will not add Kushida here because i just felt that she doesn't have that much screen time in this arc that the first season of the anime covers)\\n\\n\r\n First is Ayanokouji its hard to describe him without spoiling the series so the best way to describe him  is that he is a mysterious and calm boy that would only do something if needed and he also doesn't want to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nHorikita, she is a character that is very hard working but she is unsociable so she always tries to do/solve all things by herself and her goal is to be an A class student. she has a generic character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slow paced anime, most people might already gave up watching it and i can't really blame them but there will be interesting episodes as long as you keep watching the series.\\n\r\nI also like the concept of the s-system and the ranking system of the school has, there are still mysteries in the system itself.\\n\\n\r\nsometimes there are events that are cringe but it is bearable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a good watch for me sometimes it feels dull and there are also times that its interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPS. People should stop comparing this anime to oregairu since they have different genre.\\n\r\nOregairu is romcom and not psychological.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie, I saw the cover, liked the art and decided to give this a chance. I regret my decisions. I can't trust LN's.\r\nStory: So basically, these students attend this highschool where you can get points by performing well. You can buy anything with these points, except for a good anime. There are 4 classes, A,B,C and D , where A is the top class and D is where all the degenerates are. So we have two characters(because nobody cares about the other side characters with better art and animation than the entirety of DBS) Horikita, this generic tsundere, who wants to beacknowledged by her brother, according to herself, by climbing up to A class, and Ayanoukoji, this cringy guy whose background and motivation is literally mentioned in 3 flashbacks and 2 conversations not even 2 minutes long combined. \\n\\n\r\nThere is really no \"plot\" progression, they spend 9-10 episodes doing nothing but playing around and looking for someone's panties. Sure, there are 12 episodes, but there is more plot in a 10 seconds long dubstep YouTube intro than these 12 episodes combined. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I like the art and animation. The environment, the buildings, the characters look nice. Even those you could consider background characters who are just there to fill the space look nice. Most of the budget was spent on their eyeballs though. Ayanokouji and Horikita literally have the same face expressions throughout the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Ayanokouji sounds like he doesn't want to live anymore, which is understandable, and the soundtrack is horrible. It doesn't provide anything. It's trying too hard to make things exciting, but it just doesn't work. It would've been better if they'd just put some elevator music in there. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh boy. Where do even start? Literally every character is better written than our generic tsundere and the depressed kung fu master. There isn't anything special about Horikita, as I mentioned earlier, she's your average generic tsundere who doesn't feel lonely being alone. Ayanokouji is supposed to be this smart and mysterious guy, but he's just bad. The only thing I find amazing about him is  how he let this other girl(who I will get to shortly) grab his hand and place it on her breast so she could blackmail him with fingerprints. I would also stand there and watch her grab my hand and tell me there is proof of him \"raping\" her, I mean. What could she possibly be planning to do with my hand? Our smart protagonist sure couldn't figure that out, huh. \\n\\n\r\nNow then, I said nobody cares about the other characters, and that is still true, because they are better than our protagonists, but since they aren't edgy or tsundere, nobody cares. Well, there is this girl here. Kushida. She is all happy on the outside but she's has a little secret, this silly goose. Her role in this godforsaken toilet is to make Ayanokouji look bad, and boy does she deliver. So basically when Ayanokouji found out about her secret, and she tried to blackmail him with rape, which there was no evidence of, so as I mentioned above, she takes his hand, and places it on her breast, and our \"smart protagonist is standing there admiring the budget spent on those eyeballs instead of doing something as she says \"well there is proof now\" \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think it's quite obvious at this point: There is a goal- a destination to reach, but they got lost and went to McDonald's instead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's bad. Only reason I didn't rate this 1 is because I like the art and animation.\\n",

It\u2019s watchable , enjoyable and you get easy attached to the story from the first episode  so in regard of that I gave it a 6 despite all the flaws. It\u2019s not a 9 or an 8 neither a 1 or a 3 but a 6.\r\nAnime is a form of entertainment that has monopolized the market in the last years rising in popularityespecially in the west countries. As any form of entertainment it needs the \u201cwatchable & appealing\u201d factor  for its audience. Classroom of the elite has both of them and as enjoyment goes on , it\u2019s that kind genre that makes you binge it in one go. But not all of us want just enjoyment there are people like me , you or others who want a bit of quality for the time spend on watching a certain show. Unfortunately  for the story quality and the characters in this anime I can\u2019t give it a white ball but a black one. Don\u2019t get me wrong despite all of its flaws some parts were done well and managed to provide the suspense and enjoyment factor which I will mention them further in my review.\\n\\n\r\nClassroom of the elite is that genre that tries too hard to be a complex show with a lot of plot twits and sophisticated characters but it turns just into a usual light novel  adaptation with the usual characters tropes and overused story setting. The first thing that draw my attention where the famous quotes before the start of each episode and to be honest I don\u2019t think they have any connection or contribution to the theme of each episode other than to be appealing to a certain level of interest from the viewer to search their meaning and expand their knowledge. The second thing is the discussion from episode 1 about who will concede the seat for an old lady , the problem can be solved easily because is one that doesn\u2019t require  much complexity it\u2019s about morality and manners. Instead of that we have some complex monologues from the Ayanokouji  and a ostentatious speech from Koenji  which makes you think why they make such a big deal out of nothing? Those same problems expand further in other episodes (the love confession philosophy , the pantsu stealing morality etc..) and in my opinion they  drag down the quality of the show .\\n\\n\r\nClassroom of the elite wastes a lot of time before the start of each arc  with the usual encore episodes and plot and because of that they almost forgot of using their concept (class points )halfway through the show. Was the beach episode necessary  other than to provide fanservice  and let the audience see how bouncy and  great the girls look in their  swimsuits ? That episode wasted 20 min for Suzune to notice that being alone is bad and having friends is better, they could have done that in 2 min and proceed with the next arc instead of dragging the story to fit 12 episodes. To clear things out the fanservice is always welcomed as long it fits the current plot and story but in this anime is  unnecessary. The saving grace is the last arc where they get back on track and managed to have an innovative use of the points for the plot . The problem in the last arc is how a group of 16 years old high school students manage to survive in the wilderness for 7 days and know each corner of that island (where to procure food , where to find the perfect spot for fishing). I am talking about Class D here who all of them are well experienced in this stuff although it\u2019s their first time on that island. I can\u2019t digest this stuff because  the premise was focusing on something else and didn\u2019t told us nothing about the characters great survival instincts. Although there was a dude who knew everything about camping , the only stuff he taught them  was how to make a campfire and were to find drinkable water but this is not a excuse for the poor writing displayed in Classroom of the Elite.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters manage to surprise you at the end of each episode with their personality plot twist but other than that they are just  complex walking  quotes. The problem doesn\u2019t lay in their choice of words but the lack of their characterization to sustain their knowledge and experience .This is not a character driven anime but the  focus is more on as a whole presenting the social interaction and problems of people working as a group/class but that doesn\u2019t mean we should have plain characters do we? Another problem with this show is the decisions and how stupid some characters act, let\u2019s take Koenji as an example and how he jumped from a tree to another at a impressive speed showing his athletic abilities which defy the human capability. Another example would be Sudou who I don\u2019t really understand it\u2019s purpose other than to be the withered tree from the forest getting in fights and causing unnecessary problems for class D. Other characters are just there for the anime to have a beautiful big boob girl-Ichinose, a white haired loli who for some reason uses a support to walk(I don\u2019t know why because the anime had other stuff to show other than fleshing out its characters), a big muscle dude who is imposing and finally the leader of class C who want\u2019s to crush everybody and be the best. The problem is that the anime doesn\u2019t show a damn thing why they want to do that so guess how you called them in this situation: PLOT DEVICES. Despite that we also have appealing characters which managed to maintain their mysterious aura and surprise at the right moment. I am talking about Ayanokouji , Kushida  and Suzune.\\n\\n\r\nThe entertainment factor despite all of those flaws is present , plus the suspense which makes you watch an episode after another. The show also manages to present some social problems from our nowadays society and use it to flesh out Sakura\u2019s  and Suzune\u2019s character . Classroom of the Elite is a good watch for those who want to have a good blast and don\u2019t care about  nitpicking each flaw but for those who put the quality first over enjoyment this anime doesn\u2019t suit your taste so go find something else to watch. \\n",

            "content": "I see alot of people hating on this anime and read their reasons and read people who loved is and their reasons. This anime is in my opinions one of the better anime that wasnt comedy based I've watched in a while.\r\nThe comedy/romance tags are in my opinion not true, so dont watch this if you come for that. It's more psychological/mystery\r\nStory 9:\r\nAlot of people hate on the story, its slow paced and makes no progress and no sense. I agree on the slow part, but that doesnt make it bad. You cant rush a mystery anime because you will skip over things and makethe tension go away. This is why I enjoy this being slow, as it builds up tension, and keeps you in the anime. (Most people came for a fast paced Rom-Com i suppose)\\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\r\nAs for the art i think its pretty decent and nice, but nothing to outstanding. It doesn't really rely on art like for example Kakegurui (I.m.o.) for the anime to become nice. Easy to watch, not hard on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nAs the sound isn't the most important factor, it still gives a good vibe. It doesn't contradict the anime so it's easy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9:\\n\r\nThis is next to story the part where people hate on: No developement, boring and no reason behind what they do how they do it. The anime is meant for you to look inside someones head, and not only the main character, also every other character who seems suspicious and in a position of power/interest. Only the shallow side characters are easy to predict (The jock for example). This is why it brings tension to the story and why it's slow paced. Because it takes time to explore a good character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall 10 & 9:\\n\r\nI really like it, it's next to kakegurui the only non Rom-Com anime i really liked this season so far. Kakegurui will end for sure but this may be a 25, even more episode anime, so I'll keep on and watch it further. It has all the time to develop and make good use of the characters they decided to put in. \\n\\n\r\nWith this said I can't wait for the show to fully reveal the characters true nature, their developement and the eventual story.",

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite... what can i say?\r\nWell, for once the story centers about Japan's mania of hierarchy that everything is power and everything is competition and if you have no prestige nor power you are nothing.\r\nAlso involves how those on higher ranking statues are allowed to \"bully the weak\".\r\nBut that is not new for japan since 90% of their \"competitive\" stories are like that with their hierarchy prejudice.\r\nRegardless this story rather than a harem rom-com is more of a drama.\r\nWe got Ayanokouji Kijotaka (which last name is familiar to me), an emotionless sociopath whose aim is to have a normal peaceful life and notgetting involve with anything or anyone but in the end he hides a deep dark secret.\\n\\n\r\nBut unlike others Mcs in other harem series, this one takes no bullshit from anyone... but mostly because he doesn't care about anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nHe just moves with the flow and decides what is convenient.\\n\\n\r\nCrossing his path since first day of school is the first heroine, Horikita Suzune; A Himedere archetype girl who is the little sister to the student council president and has some-of-a brother complex. She seeks the approval of her elder brother and will do anything to gain his favor. Bringing here to become a lonewolf and isolate herself given to how low she has fallen bringing shame to her family. So she aims to raise to the top to redeem herself.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing is the second heroine, Kushida Kikyo; a Japanese \"Good Girl\" who wants to be friends with everyone at school just to please herself and raise her ego. She is eager to please everyone and help them in all she can, while she preaches the ways of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is fun to watch and is not obnoxious plus also tries to teach the Japanese people about how their hierarchy ways are flawed in many areas. And also showing the rest of the world how hard they have to live to survive.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Classroom of the elite is an interesting school competitive drama that teaches that prejudice is bullshit and even the underdog can be great.",

            "content": "I have been watching Classroom of the Elite for a while now and...I kinda find it both enjoyable and somewhat disappointing at the same time. The review here is mainly written from my point of view as a reader who finished the original six volumes of the light novel, so my opinions would probably differ from some of the other reviewers.\r\nPlot: Classroom of the Elite centers around a \"power struggle\" between the four \r\nranked classes (A,B,C, and D) in a prestigious, bizarre high school. The overall performance of each class influences their corresponding students' \"point\" income (an in-school currency used for all types of transactions)and potentially enables the lower-ranked classes to replace the higher ones, thus changing their ranks...\\n\\n\r\nAs a regular anime, Classroom of the Elite is adequate for the mainstream audience. It has very good pacing, great art, and a plot that feels interesting and keeps you hooked. Some initially feel that the characters in the anime somewhat resembles the ones in SNAFU, but give it a few episodes and you would see the difference.  However, there are several aspects of the anime that greatly annoyed me when I was watching it, especially when I compared it to the original novel.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the tone of the anime feels somewhat out-of-place. For the most part it takes itself seriously, so serious that these mundane conflicts between classes actually mildly resemble gang rivalries. Yet on the other hand, it sometimes places too much emphasis on fanservices and/or employ tropes commonly seen in high school love comedy shows.  As far as the original novel is concerned, such tropes never appeared, and rather annoyingly made the relationship between the main characters seem much more intimate than they should be, which doesn't help the overarching atmosphere.  Another problem I've had with this adaptation is how it doesn't stay true to the original work. Hell, Suzune even got a scene that was originally another character's. I can only hope that the production team behind it foresaw the narrative consequences of that.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I would say give this anime a try. If you like it, then you would probably feel it's very good and continue watching it. If not, then just drop it and nothing of value is lost. I hope this review has been, at the very least, mildly informative to you.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nClassroom of the Elite has a rather generic story when written down, with its clear goal being to prove that an individual's own potential can pull themselves to a better position \u00e0 la Social Mobility. Despite my own reservations about the message of this anime, I found the execution of the story to be quite compelling, utilizing heavily upon show not tell storytelling which is refreshing since it allows for the viewer think along with what is happening on screen rather than being force fed the same material. \r\nNote: I originally was planning to rate this an 8, but episode 7 is a filler episodein that it does nothing for the plot nor does it show anything new to the characters except for one line of dialogue. If I ever plan on re-watching this anime, I would just skip episode 7 for enjoyment's sake. \\n\r\n(Story 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'll admit that I still do not remember the main character's name in Classroom of the Elite, and still call him A-kun, but I have caught myself staring into the eyes of multiple characters in the anime. The artwork is not very innovative in art styles like some other anime, but it is quite good enough for one to immerse themselves in the story without being distracted by poorly drawn figures or anything of the sort. \\n\r\n(Art 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI have a similar opinion on sound as with art, which is the same as saying that the opening and ending songs despite not being memorable enough to find yourself singing along to do a pretty good job of introducing and closing up the anime. Furthermore, the mood setting music does in fact set you into a certain mood, but it comes off as bland when you close your eyes and try to focus only on the sound itself and not the package of story and character that an anime is. (Sound 7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhen I first watched this anime, I thought that romantic comedy snafu came out with a parody on its characters. There are quite a few similarities between the characters in both anime, but the character development in Classroom of the Elite is somewhat lackluster. For example, Character A is shown as X, but look, they're suddenly Y now as well wow! This happens a little too often in this anime for me to like how they are going with character development, but somehow I am attached to these characters because I like ore gatsu. What a dilemma. (Character 5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have found this anime to be quite enjoyable, since it does things well enough for me to overlook its flaws and just enjoy watching the anime itself. I clearly have some deep set opinions on what could be changed, but the enjoyment level is not one of them. \\n\r\n(Enjoyment 9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite all of the harsh criticisms that I have doled out about this anime, I have strangely quite enjoyed it. I guess that I would say Classroom of the Elite is kind of like an unpolished pearl, with many of the aspects to make an enthralling anime, but coming off short on different areas. Overall though, I am already waiting for the release of the next episode. \\n\r\n(Overall 7/10)",

The writer takes the idea of \"Classroom of the Elite\" very seriously. They all act on their selfish gains.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what makes them really bad is how painfully cringe the dialogue is. The crap they say is things no one will ever say in real life. Not only that, they are generic. However the writer tries to make them more interesting by revealing their true nature bit by bit, but their true nature is exaggerated, and in the end, bland. It's like your typical villain who commits atrocities for the sake of evil. They are all 1-dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nThe only great thing I see many people enjoy from the characters is how the male lead is secretly a bad-ass (and I will admit, he is cool). But like what I said, I want a real reason to why he is trying to be so mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot concept got me intrigued, but the plot is meaningless if the characters can't drive it. And so the characters don't take this plot into any serious milestones. It is way too slow. My 15 year old bunny can go faster than the plot and it's dead. \\n\\n\r\nBut what I said previously on how all the characters act on their selfish gains: nothing is being done (or it's too slow) to help bring these characters together to make them work together. Yes they help each other pass tests, but their motives to help is based on how beneficial it is to them in the long run. This problem has been staring me in the eyes since episode 1, and so far, nothing is being done to fix it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful; there is a lot stunning scenery.\\n\\n\r\nOpening and ending were nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is a 6 because the characters are poorly written, which consequently is destructive towards the main plot. The plot is not going anywhere and I can already sense the bull crap explanations to why some of the character's act the way they do. \\n\\n\r\nBut try the anime for yourself, it has a fairly good rating, so a good amount of people are enjoying it, but sadly, I'm not one of them. I will most likely watch clips or the last few episodes because the foundation of the plot is nice.",

            "content": "TL;DR - The show tried a bit too hard to sound smart at times and suffers from moderate fan-service, but makes up for these shortcomings with an outstanding main character, subtle plot, and a certain degree of fun.\r\nNO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW\r\nStory:\r\nThe story does a good job of introducing ideas and using them in creative ways, and has a unique sort of charm when it comes to bending the viewers perception of the rules. Seemingly strict or finished developments can frequently only appear to be so, and I personally feel like plots are able to surprise the audience without the much hated \"well how wasI supposed to know that!?\" moments. Watching this anime and only understanding the story on a surface level is the trap that you're almost seemingly meant to fall into, which can leave an impression of plot holes and unanswered questions. If you watch with an open mind, and pay close attention to exactly what is happening, I think it turns into a much more rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I would have a few complaints. First and chiefest: fan-service. It has a time and place, comedic settings and gag shows wouldn't be the same without their infamous 'beach episode' rounding out the middle of a season. However, in Classroom of the Elite, the camera hovering over the oversized chest of a high school girl in revealing clothing is . . . uh . . .  sorry got distracted. That's it! It's really distracting, and takes away from the usually more subtle and serious tone of the show. Would be a minor complaint if I didn't have to begrudgingly admit that it happens far too frequently.\\n\\n\r\nSecond complaint for the story is the 'high horse' attitude it can sometimes take against the viewer. This one is not as big of a complaint, because the arrogance of it fits the theme quite well, and I think is an intentional slight on the audience to strengthen the impression that the people they are watching truly are ahead of the game. That being said, there is a fine line between 'sounding intelligent' and 'sounding like you're trying to sound intelligent.' The show has an occasional problem with misreading this line. By the end you'll find yourself wondering if everyone you've met is really as smart as you're meant to believe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nA bit difficult to talk about without spoiling, so I'll keep this section brief. The cast is not meant to be full of people you will enjoy. You'll find yourself getting confused who you're meant to root for. A big theme of this show is that nothing is as it appears on the surface, and you'd do well to keep that in mind when examining anyone, especially the people you think you have figured out. The real winner here though is the very well executed main character. Incredibly interesting and difficult to guess, his ability to drive plot even when there seemingly isn't any way to involve himself is well coordinated. I would sum up the entire cast with a question: what was coincidence, and what was the plan all along? However, with a 12 episode series highlighting everyone would be impossible when the cast stretches as large as this. My high regard for the characters is placed in good faith that future developments will allow them to truly shine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWith an interesting plot and diverse cast, Classroom of the Elite is a very entertaining watch. I give it a rating of 7 overall, and would feel confident in calling it a good anime. If the plot interests you, it shouldn't disappoint. However, if you're on the fence, or find fan-service to be experience ruining, maybe skip out on it for something that catches your eye a bit more. It can be pretentious at times, and awkward at others, it is an imperfect show that revels in the imperfect. An overall enjoyable time, but certainly not for everyone.",

            "content": "I half expected Classroom of the Elite to receive a failing grade, much like class D during their first quarter, however it managed to pull off a whopping 76%.\r\nThis anime has a wonderful premise -- a darker, more intelligent version of Baka & Test? Sign me up! For the 24 minutes, I was completely drawn in. The first question the audience is asked is \"Are humans really equal?\" And then a scene was shown to drive in the point: No. They are not. Said scene was a little overdone and not a great testament to the personalities of our main characters, but I let thatslide and continued watching. When the students entered utopia, I couldn't wait to see how things would all fall apart like I knew they eventually would. When the ball dropped at the end of the episode, my expectations were met, I skipped the ending theme and went straight to the second episode where our cast had to figure out how to solve their little predicament. \\n\r\nThey solved it all too easily. It was as if there were really no stakes in this story. And then came the downhill trek where I wondered if this was going to be just another anime where nothing went anywhere. Into range popped the dreaded pool episode where an exceedingly roundabout method was used to set up Class D announcing that they were going to overtake Class A. Unmenacing, completely unnecessary. I thought as the show began to dig its own grave. \\n\r\nI didn't give up hope, however, and by episode 9 my persistence was rewarded. The plot started moving. And the plot didn't stop.  It pushed, full throttle until episode 12 where I was actually left wanting more. I even stayed up way past my bedtime to check out the light novel (which doesn't have any English translations past volume 4 by the way). Classroom of the Elite had managed to save itself by getting to the point. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. The animation is smooth. The character designs are different and reflect their respective characters well. When I first started watching, I did have a problem. Ayanokoji, Horikita and Kushida all have the same eye color. Or, at least, that's how it appeared in the first couple of episodes. As the series goes on I believes this corrects itself, but I really did not enjoy that specific design choice. The girls suffer from the same headshape (as in most anime), but it was nice to see some major differences in some of the boys. Again, as in most anime, the hair is the main focus and I have to say it was animated well.\\n\r\nSince this is a school show, specifically about school and what the students do in the school, I must give some attention to the school uniform. It's nice, and something I would definitely wear. It has that \"private\" and \"selective\" look to it that most boarding schools have. It isn't too flashy, which I appreciate (looking at you Akashic Records Bastard Teacher Some-Such-Or-Whatever). \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is something that is so fun to sing along to, and suits the shows style very well. Performed by ZAQ, I never skipped a single opening sequence. It just opens up into the story too well. \\n\r\nI never listened to the ending all the way through. The instrumental is beautiful, indeed, and I love the intro before the melody starts. It also suits the show, but I just can't get being that melody, Minami. No hard feelings. \\n\r\nThe original soundtrack is standard. It's good, and doesn't take away from show immersion, but it's not excellent either. I couldn't happily listen to it playing on repeat without something going on in the show itself. It's not exactly identifiable either, as it could easily work with another show all the same. \\n\r\nAlso. Chiba Shoya, voice of Ayanokoji did such a marvelous performance. Like, I'm not even sure how to put into words how amazing his acting was. His character was hard to voice, indeed, and I found myself hanging onto every word Ayanokoji said. Why? Because of Chiba and his skilled use of inflection, or lack there of. Even when Chiba needed to sound bland and bored, he still had personality. Funny as that sounds. It wasn't a monotone and robotic performance at all, and even though Ayanokoji was portrayed as somewhat emotionless, the type of speaking Chiba used to create that effect was simply wonderful. So big props on that. \\n\\n\r\nDue to so much to say, I'll only be discussing the main 3 characters.\\n\r\nNo matter what anyone might say, Ayanokoji is hands down the best character in this entire series and overshadows everyone else. He does this while also being objectively the least interesting one of them. How is that possible? Don't we have another robot situation (Ald.noah Zero) on our hands?! Yes, and no. When Ayanokoji is first introduced, the audience believes that he's just a guy who wants to get by in life. He's not the best person, but he's not the worst. He wants friends like everyone else, but he sucks at social interaction. Then he learn early on that he's special. Probably even more special than any of the D Class characters. And don't we all want out MCs to be special? But, you see, even though the audience has access to Ayanokoji's inner monologue it's hard to say exactly what he's really thinking. The boy is a master at deflection on the inside and the outside. He's not a robot--he has a mask. \\n\r\nHorikita is the standard, run of the mill, antisocial, doesn't need anyone, haughty, intelligent, princess type tsundere. What this show does with this character type is present it as a flaw, instead of setting it up on a pedestal. I personally enjoy that choice very much. A beautiful loner isn't a personality type that should be striven for. Horikita has an area of her personality she needs to fix, and this basically sets up character development for her. \\n\r\nKushida is the girl who wants to be friends with everybody. Being honest, Kushida is me. Only she's not. I'm not friends with everybody. I wanna be like Kushida and succeed at this. Only, I don't. Like most of the characters, we come to find out she has a mask. But then it becomes confusing. Which is the mask and which is the real her? Or has she acted enough to become her mask? Kushida is the prime example of what this show is all about: layers. Whether they're there, being put up, unraveling, or needing to unravel. \\n\r\nThere's just one bug in my love of these characters. If this school is supposed to be for the ELITE, then why does most of Class D exist? There are some characters that fail their quizzes in the beginning. The grades these people get don't reflect elite students in the least bit. And their personalities are even further from that idea. So how did they even get into this school at all? I tried making an argument for them: 1. They didn't fail the entrance exam & the curriculum is more advanced than an average high school; 2. Apparently Class D is where the degenerates are place--those with extreme character flaws are placed.\\n\r\n1. All of these guys are smart enough to pass the entrance exam. Some barely, others with flying colors. And the only reason they'd be failing their first quarter is because this school ups its curriculum so much that an average high school student has no hopes of keeping up. Only, I am sure that many of these students would not have passed a regular high school entrance exam. What gives? This school even has a REPUTATION for 100% of its attendees going onto college or finding a well paying job RIGHT AWAY. I can't make excuse #1 for them.\\n\r\n2. Makes more sense since this is what the show hints at the whole time. I still can't wrap my head over the concept, though. Why would an elite school want to make a pet project out of a bunch of lazy teenagers? \\n\r\nA major problem, indeed, but my only major problem with the series. \\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed myself a lot with this anime. Even while I was worried that it would never redeem itself, it kept me entertained. I was curious to see what the character relationships would be like, you know like a regular school setting. I fell in love with the premise, so I was beyond excited to see that they were actually going to go back to it. I'm still eager to know more of the story. Might even read what exists of the light novel from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nSo here's the real question. Who would enjoy watching this series, and who would not? Well, for those of you that enjoy regular classroom anime or found yourself in a rut after watching Baka &Test, consider picking this one up. For those that want to experience true psychological anime, I'd suggest steering clear. You'll be sorely disappointed. This anime is for casual viewing, I'd say. Not a masterpiece (or even close to one), but it gets its job done as entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\\n\r\nStory ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 8\\n\r\nStarted out strong. Things got rocky, and I wondered if the show would have any meaning. By episode 9, the plot started continuing, leaving me wanted more by the end. \\n\r\nArt ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 7\\n\r\nNot much to say anyway. Good. Not bad. Uniform design is a plus.\\n\r\nSound ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 7\\n\r\nGood opening, okay ending, okay OST.\\n\r\nCharacter ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 7\\n\r\nAyanokoji is best boi. The characters have layers and I really enjoy it. \\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 9\\n\r\nPremises like this are my shiiieeetttt. So very excited to have the anime actually deliver.\\n\r\nOverall ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 7.6\\n\r\nStarted out great, the middle had me worried there for a second, but it pulled it off! The art and sound isn't distracting and makes for a pleasant viewing experience. The characters are intriguing and I want more best boi. I just want more in general tbh. Would recommend.",

            "content": "Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing School is a special campus run by the government to improve the country's outlook. Only a select number of students are permitted at the school which guarantees a 100% rate of employment. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji who had poor social skills and had little interest in anything, was one of those select few. On the first day of school, he finds their class is granted a generous allowance of points worth 100,000 Yen each month. However, no students from the school are allowed to leave the campus which has facilities serving everything they'd ever need. What's more, no one seems to be punishedwhenever they do anything that would usually be against school rules such as talking in class or missing classes. As such, many started a very care-free and luxurious lifestyle given the generous allowance they had.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a month later they discover the government wasn't really that generous much to their dismay. The school's \"S-System\" ranked classes based on their students performance as a whole but the exact conditions are unknown. It's hinted their over-negligence in class meant that no one is granted any points for the new month. Not only that, they were also ranked as class D because they were considered the worst kind of people in society. Now together they must get work together and gain the class points they need to get back up the ranks. Unfortunately, not all get along including the smart but outspoken lone girl Suzune Horikata who for her own reasons, wasn't just aiming to get out of class D, She wanted to reach class A too. Kikyou Kushida, a seemingly cheery friendly girl who wants to make friends with everyone, finds Suzune's the only one she can't befriend. As each discover their own shortcomings, Kiyotaka, Kikyou and Suzune find themselves working together to bring unity to the class as they are faced with various trials.\\n\\n\r\nThis show covers 4 of the 9 volume light novel series which is basically the first semester in the story's timeline. It starts off quite boring as you can guess from the synopsis but it's actually quite an interesting show. Just as you're getting into the flow of the story it likes to spring a surprise at you. There's a lot of rivalry going on that leads to some dirty scheming. After the first twist you kind of get everything is mostly just a facade and there's always something else dark happening behind each character but, it's still entertaining to watch and guess what class D ends up struggling with next. Or more specifically, Kiyotaka who takes a laid back stance on everything yet he's observative, considerate and sharp enough to pick-up on unspoken situations. He's a bit like Hotaro from Hyouka except more athletic.\\n\\n\r\nI like how they show you how many points each student has in the ending credits although I don't know if the points actually hint at who's helping the class the most. They also have a different character showing the app each time too. Aside from that, the art's not really that impressive to look at. OP theme song is pretty catchy. I think Kiyotaka's voice is overly monotonous... Kind of like listening to a boring lecture.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's one of those shows with potential but has a fair bit of intrusive fan service, ruining it with awkward camera angles pointing at the wrong places. It's also chosen to go with your \"ero-kawaii (cute face, sexy figure)\" female character designs as is the trend with most shows these days. Oh, and your obligatory episodes of girls in their swimwear, changing room scenes etc of course with new physics. Either way, it does end up breaking the initial good pacing of the story. The light novels might have been better off but I can't comment on them since I haven't read them..\\n\\n\r\nThe show will probably keep you watching wondering whether class D will ever make it to the top as one by one characters reveal a different secret side of themselves. You end up guessing who's up to what. It's good as it is but I think it could have been a lot better if they used the time spent on fan service to flesh out the story even more and cut out the instrusive camera angles that ruin the direction. Such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I still look forward to a season two to see how the story pans out without picking up the novels.",

I would of like to see where they could of gone with it but without the much focus on the merit more so about the character developments. the series tends to challenge the student not some much on the academic level but more so on the support of each other which makes it works\r\n   character:  i tend to like the MC for a lotof reason as plus i can see that a lot of us could relate tot he MC in some way for instance MC tend to keep to himself and doesn't care about the glory  and put other before himself although there is a suprise twist to his character my recomendation abouth the MC is to watch him closely listen his word carefully and see his expression the reason why i say this that is because the ending got me thinking about his character and notice some unforseen action and the thing his says seem a bit off.\\n\\n\r\n       suzune is another character i like to talk about as well from watching the series i can see that she is a strong will women with a very intellgent mind  however her backstory isnt quite known so it hard to see why she working so hard for to get to A class idk it might have to do something with her brother or the family legacy or to prove her self worth. suzune has a bit a of a unique personlity that you can either love or hate but she does everything for a reason just like the MC and yet they don't quite aline with each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\n  ART/SOUND they art work is simply stunning at times that for sure i can or you can really tell they put a lot of detial into the character eyes so that kind of a plus in my boook however the music is not very memorable to say the least however there OP is actually pretty good not amazing but good\\n\\n\\n\r\n  overall i really did enjoy the series cause it did get me thinking and i notice a few that most poeple may not have notice which is why i mention to watch thr MC more closly and you notice some interesting as well. i would recomend this to those who are interested in some form of puzzle solve fitting all the pieces together or the aory in itself well is very good \\n\r\ni like to also mention there not a whole lot of fanservice as one may there would be however there are some sexual suggestive theme that may only last a sec or 2 which is find i 'm glad they didn't do a whole lot here since it helps with the story and of course withthe except of sudo he can be can be crazy and out there when comes to girls and fight with guys. anyways i say give this show a try might like it i mean it is one of those hit or miss thing.\\n",

Not only him, other characters are almost near perfect all thanks to Lerche with the good animation and voice actors it became something worth gold. \\n\r\nThe plot and pacing is so good started letting us know how good of a genius someone can be, standing out and shinning bright that even the ones atop are scared and wanting to know more of you \\n\r\nThere is more to this even though we didn't get to see his full capabilities,its quite something \\n\r\nAnd close to becoming perfect \\n\r\nIt's adorable \\n\r\nRated 8.8/10",

Kushieda is this seemingly deredere character that is shown to have a dark side that is never explored. Sakura is the always nervous character with large boobs etc\r\nNone of the characters are characterized remotelywell. They're all either stock dere archetypes or overt assholes. The story ends with a reveal that is meant to be badass but comes off as lame and a prime example of what not to do in writing.

            "content": "Thoughts on Classroom of the Elite: It is crap.\r\nThe show is about a protagonist who is intentionally mediocre for some reason, and whose only personality trait is his willingness to not stand out... until his internal monologue at the end of the show reveals that that was all a lie, so we really never knew him at all. The other characters are a rude, snobbish, unlikeable girl, and an adorably cute girl with big boobs who is secretly a psychopath. Such great characters everyone!\r\nThe plot barely exists, but it follows the attempts of class 1-D (the \"defective class in an elite meritocratic school) as theyattempt to improve themselves to the point of becoming 1-A (the top-ranked class), and concludes with a survival test on a desert island.\\n\r\nAnyway, the show has a large number of faults which I just can't overlook:\\n\r\nDespite not being an ecchi show, the (underage) female characters are constantly objectified and shown either from ridiculous upskirt angles, or in some episodes the camera just focuses in on their boobs.\\n\r\nThe plot itself is quite dull for large portions, with stakes being minimal and the only way drama is added is through out of nowhere asspulls about characters secretly having psychopathic tendencies or weird secrets that never really play into the plot after their introductions. For example: what does the revelation that Sakura used to be a model do for the plot? Nothing apart from give us a reason for the creepy stalker (the backstory still wasn;t relevant to that). Heck, it makes even less sense given that she is shy and awkward about wearing a swimsuit in public in later episodes despite having no problem wearing practically nothing during modelling jobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also pretentiously talks about irrelevant philosophy all the time, bringing in the tale of Icarus and Daeadalus as a metaphor for the main character several times (despite that making no sense), and constantly asks whether equality exists in this world (and constantly coming to the answer of \"no\", so why does this same point keep being brought up again and again?)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, apart from the pretentious , repetitious philosophising, the pedophilic ecchi, awful characters, and shameless objectification, the soundtrack also lacks any memorable pieces, and sometimes even uses awful dubstep when it isn't needed. Still the animation is really nice... yeah that's the only good thing I can say about the show, I'm just going to quit writing this review now, the show is bad. Really bad. Really, really, really bad.",

            "content": "This is the type of anime that can you a headache and is not for beginners.\r\nI say that because this anime can be complicated to understand. Sometimes you have to rewind or rewatch but ofcourse that doesn't takethe enjoyment after understanding something. Its the kind of anime where you can learn something from.\r\nMy advice to anyone that is planning to watch it is be patient and look outside the box. Don't just judge everything around the main protagonist. Some protagonist are not made to be very like able specially in the first few episodes. Some people (Specially adults who grew up watching dragonball era) didn'tlike how boring the main protagonist is. But that is just one point. Some also said they didn't understand how the story goes but that is because this anime was made to make the characters look smart so the anime will definitely be hard to understand to make the audience stupid. \\n\\n\r\nNow story wise \"Some\" people will probably not like how it ends but some people will also like how the character's true self was revealed. This anime is really good at hiding things and making things complicated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime and why its going down as one of my all time favorites is how they portrayed the side characters. Not only because the side characters are realistic but also because their personality complimented the Main character's personality in the story( That's how I feel) and at the same time the Protagonists Ayanokoji and Horikita closing them off. Horikita in my opinion had a reasonable personality and development towards Ayanokoji too, that's why she is one of my favorite characters in the anime. Plot wise ,Ayanokoji and Student coucil president rivalries was really good, it maybe lacking in the anime but it was a good setup for the novel because there are lot more characters that Ayanokoji will be butting heads to before him. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize my review, Id say that this anime and everyone involved in making it was Genius. It can be really enjoyable and at the same time makes you feel like \"Ohhh so thats why\" as it progressed. I can compare and lump it together with No game No life since that Anime is also one of my all time favorites and It was also Genius and Ohhh worthy. But the difference is that Classroom of the elite was more thrilling(Because NGNL gives the protagonist always win vibes) while NGNL gives the excitingly fun kind of genius.",

I'm not going to go into too much detail, as I don't like reading long reviews myself. I strongly discourage everyone from going into this show thinking \"oh, just another high school anime trying to be cool\". This anime does have some unique aspects, after all.  \r\nThe story itself was rather fast-paced, with very little introduction to the characters. It was nevertheless a very fun ride with several breath-taking twists and turns, as leadcharacters Ayanokoji and Horikita attempt to drag their class from Class D (the lowest class, containing the problem students) to Class A, the most elite class of students. The challenges they must overcome are posed by both the school and the other classes. It is almost like a Battle Royale of classes, but without any killing. It is all about survival.\\n\\n\r\nThough I enjoyed the overall story, the lack of character background did bother me. We barely got a glimpse into Ayanokoji's mysterious past, Kushida's darker side, and Horikita's troubled relationship with her brother. I also could not relate to most of the characters - Horikita's sense of superiority over others, Ayanokoji's intentional bombing of exams despite his intelligence and cunning, and Kushida's extremely extroverted personality. These gaps could all be explored if there was to be a second season, as there were many questions that needed answering by the end of the show.",

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite does a couple things right and a couple things wrong. So lets break this up into two categories, Pros and Cons.\r\nPro's: \r\nAnimation style, if you have ever seen assassination classroom, this style may remind you of it. While it doesn't look extremely cartoon, it does a good job of being extremely saturated and having a deep color scheme. It does its job at standing out from similar anime in the genre with this unique animation choice.\r\nStorytelling: Some may complain about the Anime's lack of progression, but the character's are given plenty of depth throughout the 12 episodes. The show does agreat job of making the cast seem more than 2 dimensional. It effectively finished on the end of an arc (or seemed to, see the LN for details) and it managed to leave myself wanting more, but not feeling as if the ending was abrupt. It had a conclusion, not a finale. Given the LN haven't even seen them reach their goal, it would be hard to fit that into a 12/13 ep anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nMain Character is fairly generic when it comes to the stereotype he fits in. He is a MC with incomparable intelligence compared to others, seem's like he couldn't be taken down in a fight, and is overall just OP. You do get little teasers to why that is, but the anime does not go in depth as to why that is. The light novel seems to have covered his past in a recent volume, However, I have not reached that point yet.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not over: He does not find the one piece, he doesn't finish his fight with frieza, and he doesn't get his body back. The ending of this anime was not a Finale as it was a conclusion, for it to get a higher rating, it would have to have at least one more season, which, while possible, is unlikely. If there were to be a second season though, based on the length of the LN's, it would need at least 2 or 3 more seasons to thoroughly conclude, or a season of 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime that has pushed me to reading the Light Novel, I have considered it before but this one pushed me over the edge. While he is bland, I tend to really like the MC, as he keeps leaving the audience wanting to see how he responds to his situation. The anime ended with momentum. I will not post spoilers, but the final arc they cover ends with them actually moving twords their goal, which is something many new anime don't do in the first 12 episodes, the main character seems no closer to that goal than at the beginning, but in this anime, you see outright progression, and that continues in the light novels. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR its not too bad and the MC is OP so you mind as well give it the 12 ep's worth of time its asking for.",

It does have small bits of romance, but in a high school environment that is to be expected. It's different from a typical school genre anime, and focuses on some pretty deep stuff and how the real world of adulthood works. I highly recommend it. The art is top notch and characters are pretty interesting. I honestly can't really see how anyone could dismiss this anime and say it's bad. I guess the less experienceviewers may not appreciate it for it's complex plot. An anime that makes you really interested in knowing more about the MC is definitely a successful anime. :)\\n\\n\r\nSomething I thought up of:\\n\\n\r\nClass A: Class of Absolute\\n\r\nClass B: Class of Brilliance\\n\r\nClass C: Class of Corruption\\n\r\nClass D: Class of Defective\\n\\n\r\n:)",

It does put a little bit of it's own spin with the introduction of a point system for students that works as money outside of school, and a point system that is used to determine whether the Class as a whole is deemed better then the others. Unfortunately besides that, that's about all your going to get for exposition. For me i would of been more interested to learn more about who the school deems fit to be in specific classes.\r\n     Story 6. Despite the story having suchan interesting premise it doesn't delve nearly deep enough to be anything more then just Fair. I would say the biggest Flaw of this show is that it horribly paced. Almost all Plot lines that get introduced either last, way to long spilling over to the next episode or end abruptly for a conclusion in a later episode.\\n\r\nThe first couple episodes didn't go through this problem but it does happen way to much to after the first 3 of so.\\n\\n\r\n     Art 6. Despite The Characters being well drawn the Backgrounds are absolutely terrible. It's hard to concentrate on a scene when everything behind the characters is extremely blurry. Blurry to the point its hard to tell where they are especially in later episodes, where this seems to be much more prevalent. If this does happen to get to get a 2nd season I would hope they get a better team together to fix it.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound 9. I was able to watch the show in Japanese and The Studio did an excellent casting for all the characters.\\n\\n\r\n       Characters 9. The biggest draw of this show is the characters, Ayanokouji seems like just your typical Stoic Protag but he does it to an almost next level extreme, to the point of being completely emotionless despite the situations he's in. He isn't what some people would call Over-powered though the story does kinda push him into that corner. He's careful and Methodical, he can't come up with solutions to everything on the spot but he will use everything around him including people to get there.\\n\r\nHortika plays well off of Ayanokouji though her Brother-complex kind of hinders her development as a character. She has a bit of a Stoic personality as well though her Anxiety over trying to prove to herself to her brother makes her self-conscious. \\n\r\nKushida has probably the 2nd biggest question mark surrounding her regarding her past. She seems to be the overly-friendly character that can get along with everybody, and she is. But as with most Characters that have the name Kikyou she also harbors a darker side that she prefers to not show.\\n\r\nIf i could i would give the Characters a 10 but some of the Situations that happen due to the incompetence of the Side characters hurts.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters and the Voice acting drive this show. I know the Story seems kinda tacked on but it does help give the characters a reason for being. I can Defiantly see myself coming back to watch this again just for Ayanokouji and his Methodical Nature. I myself would be interested to see the advancement of each of these characters in 2nd season.",

You can buy anything with enough points. However inspite of this he actaully has very little to worry about. Winning is all that matters.\r\nArt: Very nice art style where the characters have blue tones to them making thing stand out to be more abstract then other anime art styles.\r\nSound: Nothing amazing or crazy here but it all fits well.\r\nCharacters:\r\nHe? who is He? the He im talking about is - Ayanokouji, Kiyotaka -On the outside his seems lazy and quiet. But throught the anime youll realize hes the cold calucalating type who has no attachments and he uses everyone and everything to his advantage, even the girl, who he knows likes him. He then throws all his success to Horikita. Combine Shikamaru, Itachi (Naruto), and Sesshoumaru (Inuyasha) personailties together and you get him. \\n\\n\r\nSuzune Horikita - This girl who sits next to Kiyotaka and also likes him. Shes the quiet type who rarily lets anything out. She also hates Kushida, Kikyou because she thinks shes fake. (which is true)\\n\\n\r\nKushida, Kikyou - A seemingly nice girl who wants to be friends with everyone. However shes actaully a crazy B who wants everyone to like her and when she cant get Suzune Horikita she goes batshit crazy and Kiyotaka experinces this first hand, and is \"force\" to keep her secret.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The way the lead male character out wits everyone keeps you guessing what hes gonna do next and how hes gonna do it. Theres some one sided romance with a certain two ladies but in reality hes using it to his advantage. Without him this anime would be nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Ths anime is a great anime that makes you think while keeping on your toes on what Ayanokouji is going to do next and how hes going to pull if off.",

            "content": "TLDR: This is one of the best anime's from 2017, so go and watch it. You won't regret it. After averaging up the categories I'm giving it a 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 Stars\r\nStory: The first Episode gives you a complete false sense of security and then rips it away right at the end.Without spoilers lets just say the school is not as it seems. The characters tackle interesting situations in a plethora of unique ways. I don't want to even go into detail since going into this show blind was such a treat. My only gripe is that some of the problems that the main characterdeals with feel like they're far below his god tier intelligence. His interesting past is being foreshadowed and I can't wait to see it in S2. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation in this Anime is really clean and detailed. The lighting is very refined and crisp. The use of high-lights and mid-tones is superb. The faces characters make are believable.The detail in the backgrounds is great too. It really pisses me off this anime didn't get nominated for best animation of the year. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting is great, the music fits the situations and sounds good. The sound effects are slightly above average. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this show are interesting. The main character is so great when something happens I can't help but wonder what he'll do next. My only gripe with him is that he's so much smarter than everyone else but lowers his grades and always holds back in general, as well as when he solves a problem he never want's the credit, so he lies and gives it to someone else. The side characters are also really good too, no bullshit tropes every one is their own person. Would go into more detail but don't want to spoil. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I binged the whole show in a day...What more must be said...? 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 Stars",

            "content": "I strongly recommend you guys to watch this anime\r\nFirstly, the plot of this anime is well organized even though the art is not unique but their characters are really interested especially Ayanokoji (main).  He's got some favorite quote like \"are humans born equal\"  or \"humans are just tool....\" which really got into me. \r\nSecondly, the way Ayanokoji manipulates everyone to act as his plan in which he doesn't have to show up is really smart and fun to watch, it's like it can give you goose-bumps as the story goes along. \r\n(From what I have seen many people to put this anime underrated,most of them think the plot got so many holes and the character development is bad or the quotes are pretentious etc,... But I have no problem with the plot or charaters as they are really satisfying (nearly perfect for me) . On the other hand, I think they just look at the anme with a negative point of view instead of enjoying the story itself as in my opinion, anime is the world of imagination which allows you to reach something unrealistic) \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, this anime might reflect the true society in which the strong overpowers the weak, the evidence is that suzune's brother forced her to leave the school as it is an ashame his sister is in class D. Suzune, in addition, is general a tsundere :))), which is actually not new to the anime world I suppose, but combining her with Ayanokoji would make a great duo.  About Kushida, I think she's a key character which creates  different creaction to the audiences as even Ayanokoji is confused of her true personality, which I think is another interesting thing of this anime XD.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I wanna say is I have seen my people got their complaints on this with these reasons: \"the title  classroom of elite is bad\" , \"how come the government is able to support this school, which is not logical even though this is top school \" or \"why are there students failing the tests though they've already got  the tests answers in advanced\" etc etc....    I'll give my answers for these reasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\n For the first reason \"the title classroom of elite is bad\", I think it's not bad at all because \"the classroom of elite\" means the class of superiors only, which has been considered right from the first episode that suzune wants to get to CLASS A, and that's also class B and C purposes and that means they all aim for the top class.\\n\\n\\n\r\n As for the second reason  \"how come the government is able to support this school, which is not logical even though this is top school \", lets talk a bit about something aside, if you have seen shokugeki no souma (food war), the elite ten system in this anime is really powerfull as they can have almost everything supported by the school (just hate me if I exaggerate it XD). people still accept and enjoy it, so what I am saying is why do you have to be so strict on this goverment support, if you still confuse about this, I'll give you proper answer that the goverment support this school this much has its own reason, which lies behind the S SYSTEM mystery. So just don't be so strict on this and enjoy the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe final reason \"why are there students failing the tests though they've already got  the tests answers in advanced\". Let me remind you guys of this that tests have only been identical recently so the students before the event were still able to drop out, another case might also happen as for Sudo he was so lazy that made him fail the exam --> so laziness can also make them drop out. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not all the reason why I rated 10 for this anime. \\n\r\nIf you think my review is helpful please mark it as helpful so we can get this anime  more proper rates.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry for my bad english and thank you for reading.",

Now, don't get me wrong -- it's an interesting concept which I haven't come across in anime before. A special school with all sorts of rules that the students have to decipher. I liked it at first; I appreciated what it was going for.\r\nBut, after seeing all the countless fanservice (awkward panty/boob shots, the 'panty thief' episode) it erodes any sort of intelligent potential this show could've had, whichis disappointing. This show might've been five-star potential if not for the fanservice, which feels awkward and out of place at some times. Honestly, I found myself quite bored after the first ten episodes (I watched the last two prior to writing this) and while we are shown potential moments for character development *cough* Kushida *cough* it all seems to be swept under the rug, once again in favour of this fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the show DOES have some good moments, good enough that I watched all the way to the end. The animation is good, the soundtrack fits well, the opening's pretty amazing and there are a wide variety of interesting characters. And in these twelve episodes, they were able to establish the basic roles of each 'class' (A, B, C and D) and the main characters of each. I don't feel as if I've wasted time with this anime -- in fact, I'll be watching Season 2 when it comes out -- but I do feel that this anime didn't quite hit the mark on being the 'intellectual' show it tries to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can overlook the fanservice, you might be able to find a spark of the intellectualism that the show makers try to implement. It's just a shame that the spark remains just that -- a spark.",

            "content": "\"Man is Condemned to be Free.\"  \r\nThis is one of the best quotes I've ever seen throughout 12 episodes, which have a lot of quotes especially in the OP. Sadly, there aren't many of those quotes relate to the story.  In spite of that, it's worth reading all of them.\r\n[Story]: 8\r\n From the first time I saw the title, I knew this anime would be fun to watch, and I wasn't wrong. It has potential to be a representative school life genre: the story of all students in the class (Reminds me of Assassination Classroom). The motive is quite unique with 3 participants:System (school), Student and Class fight against each other in a battle of wisdom, bravery, motivation and cunning.  If I had to mention a no-good thing about this series, it would be the pacing. There are some holes between each episode can make everyone wonder if they are watching a wrong one. Anyway, with the excellent story, we won't have to think about that seriously.     \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art]: 10\\n\r\nSurely, art is the one Lerche can be proud. No one can deny the fact that the art is one of the best parts in this series: Adorable girls, cool boys... all characters are made so well and fit with their characteristic. Especially, I really impressed the eyes and background, easily be on top 5 this season in my opinion.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character]: 8\\n\r\nJust few individual personalities were shown in class D, but it will be shown soon if we get the ss2, so I don't mind with this. You may see some characters are familiar like Suzune and Horikita (as Yui and Hachiman from Oregairu) but that's only first impress. It's hard to think what everyone actually thinking in this series, but that's one of the reasons make You-jitsu\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]; 9 \\n\r\nThe sound is really good. You may like the OP/ED of this series.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: 10\\n\r\nAlthough some people don't like this series, I recommend to watch this if you are a fan of School life, Psychological, and Romance as well, even it didn't show much. Can't wait to see each episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was one of the biggest waste of my time, I finished it simply because I had to see it to the end if anything good ever happens. \r\nSPOILER FREE SECTION\r\n- Many mysteries about both the school system and around the main protagonist are built up. Many questions were posed that would be interesting to find out and explored. Absolutely none of it was answered, after building up some mystery around it, it was never explored again for the entire series. Which makes you think? wtf is the point of this show then?\r\nWaste of time, no character development, nothing about the characters are known.\r\nSPOILERSECTION\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Weak first episode, we are introduced to the main cast of this story, nothing particularly good or bad, the main character is slightly cool, but that's about it, we pretty much don't see anything else about the characters. S system is introduced, (ep 1 or 2 i forgot), that's a good mystery point. You would think the story would somewhat revolve around finding out how the system works, since they built up some mystery around it. You would expect to find out why D class lost ALL their points, while other classes gained abnormal amounts of points. What actions triggered these extreme point allocations? These are interesting to find out, but YOU WILL NEVER FIND OUT. This is NEVER brought up again afterwards.\\n\\n\r\n- Second episode is eh, there was a single cool scene where main character became mysterious and had hidden abilities, and this should have been in the first episode so we gain some insight into what main character is like. Then again, some mysteries were built up as to why he hides his abilities, where he came from, and with the whole \"dont pry into my life\", and random flashbacks to him as a kid which almost tells NOTHING to the audience, THEY DO NOT TELL YOU WHAT HIS PAST OR HIS REASON FOR HIDING HIS TALENTS. not at all. Why is the main character smart, why does he seem to have a scary childhood, why does he have to hide it, why is he good at fighting. absolutely none of this is resolved, they do not tell you why, nor do they give you any further detail besides posing these questions.\\n\\n\r\n- How did Ichinose get that absurd amount of points within such a short time? Why is there such a ridiculous difference between class B and class D? Main protag himself asked this question, \"how did she get this many points\", but was it answered? NO. The only thing we know is that they earned alot of class points so probably thats why she has this many points. But the problem is, it is an absurd amount, what did class B do to gain this many points?\\n\\n\r\n- S-system again, never explored. It was kinda cool when they were like \"how much do you know about s system\" I thought there were special actions that a class has to do in order to gain points,  so maybe class A knew actions that triggers large gains in points and knew how to abuse it and do everything that would result in positive points. But no, never explored again, no answers given, are they just saying they got heaps of poitns because they were being good kids studying and got high test marks? wtf\\n\\n\r\n- There are few cool interesting scenes, they are good, but nothing impressive. And im talking about FEW moments out of the entire 12 episodes only. Most of every other moment is utterly useless (cough bikini episode), fan service is absolutely fine, but this is fanservice PLUS absolutely no purpose besides showing squishy boobs. The entire series still feels like an introduction/opening few scenes that sets out the world, and thats it, thats the entire series. This entire series should have been done in the first 2-4 episodes, with the rest exploring more psychologically challenging mysteries, or even just at least explain everything that the series posed questions about.\\n\\n\r\n- Character development is utterly SHIT. The worst two of the series is the two main girls, Kushida and Horitaka. Kushida has a hidden bitchy side, which is fine, thats interesting. But this doesnt get explored any further and there is no purpose or contribution to plot or any development at all. It is simply there to tell you Kushida is not just a bubbly girl, shes actually has a hidden bitch side. : ) yeh. such development.\\n\r\nNow Horitaka, she is literally all talk and have nothing to back it up. She tries to take action, but theyre kinda useless. She has this whole smart elite girl feeling that you think shes gonna come up with great strategies or something, but she doesnt, shes useless, main character does all the work, and then  people just think shes smart and amazing.\\n\r\nMain protag himself also has very little character development, only few cool and smart qualities about him, but then again, nothing was ever explored so there arent that many chances where he could display that.\\n\\n\r\nGood things\\n\r\n- art is good, overall I did not notice anything particularly sloppy, it has overall amazing animation.\\n\r\n- sound is decent",

            "content": "Before I start the review, I would like to say that these are one of those anime that objectively, wouldn't be an outstanding anime. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it \u2014 and I'll try to explain it along the way.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSchool, yadda yadda ya. Typical setting for an anime, you know the drill. The MC and the other characters end up in somewhat of an unfair disposition with all deranged classmates that seem to have a certain frenzied side to them, as you discover throughout this season. The school is special in some way, and students enact accordingly.\r\nIn this season, I was disappointed to seethat the MC's backstory wasn't developed to what I hoped was developed into, though I guess it could count as a form of a cliffhanger, as it was able to keep me at the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCute, it has that shounen quality to it, which I don't mind. The color palettes are maintained all the way, which is always pleasant. The shading of the hair I found quite interesting, as the \"light color\" for the shadow has been a technique that has been utilized by some artists, but it was my first time to witness such visuals in a major-scale anime like this. Personally, I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nHuh? What? Right, the sound! I didn't even take much notice to it. It was pretty mundane, to say the least. It fit what was going on in the anime, but it isn't those type of soundtracks I would search up and listen to. I wouldn't be able to tell if the composition was from that anime or not \u2014 it wasn't particularly unique. But it overall enhances the experience, which is all it should do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy subjectiveness HAS to give in for this part. The MC was pretty cool, and not in that typical edgy way that far too many protagonists are depicted. He actually didn't seem to give a single flying * about anything, which is, you know, nice. Normally in these type of anime, the main character gives into their \"inner\" thoughts that seemingly want them to get along with people normally. In this case, it wasn't that. So if you'd like continuity in that aspect, this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMedium-paced, which is typically the perfect pace for such anime. It had many apprehensive qualities to each of the characters which the audience could probably relate to with some degree, but this anime didn't exaggerate it too far. A bit of ecchi, which I don't like, but since it was such a small segment of the anime, I let it pass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, that's all I'll say. But dropping it if you don't take a liking to the first 2 episodes is understandable. \\n",

Each one of them have their own unique personality, so you may like one more than others or all of them at the same.\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward, i like to call this kind of anime as a Stairway to Heaven, where pretty much the protagonist (in this case, the female one) is put on the worst class of the elite school and tries tofight for climbing to the best possible class there is.\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting part of this is the evolution of this female character and how mysterious is the male protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that animes likes to do a lot is leave clues to answer and a lot of unfinished stories, but im not gonna enter on that territory because it might probably spoil you the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is great, the animation, the story, the characters, even the story, which is pretty basic compared to other ones.

Still, it's good enough to receive an 8/10.\r\nFirst, the story is great at the beginning but somewhat getting duller midway and then the paces catch up in the last episode. That's how I'll explain the pace of the story. They're going firmly at the first 3 episodes then the pacing getting slower and slower. That's the story for you. At least the last episode makes up for the shitty pace (just a bit)\r\nThe art is as expected of Lerche studio. Fluid body movementanimation and smooth looking character. This makes up for the shitty pace of the story. Personally, I love Lerche character design and body animation. The background art, on the other hand, is nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nThe character is good enough. Everyone has a personality different from each other and nothing fall of as bland here. The MC are the main focus though. But, you'll remember the side character personality as well. Even the one with a lack of screentime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this.

Weirdly enough, Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e actually 'have' a plot (I know, surprising).\r\nWell let's start with the story.\r\nIf I have to simply put it, it's good but it's not great, it's interesting but it doesn't try to pick your interest (or the opposite, it piqued your interest but it's not that interesting enough), basically it have potential, that's it. Maybe if this anime gets a second season to flesh out it's characters then it \"would've\" been great!!\r\nAyanokoji our main protagonist(?) is a talented guy with his most powerful talent of all is to 'hide' his talents from standing out and give him unwanted attentions. This anime is just about him forced to help people and his class with his genius plots and manipulative plans so he can be \"free\", free from the eyes of troublesome people, free to do whatever he want to achieve, free to live a not so normal school life, free to have a harem but doesn't give a damn about any of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is, he's in the lowest class of the school regulated hierarchy, and he is \"forced\" to help the class climb the ladder while being almost anonymous. This is done by putting someone else responsible for his ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine. Nothing extraordinary, but it's definitely not bad at all, in fact sometimes it does looks great.\\n\\n\r\nSounds is really good surprisingly!! The BGM really fits the tone of the psychological side of this anime, there's no time where the music played at weird situations. Almost perfect I must say.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters though, this anime is either didn't have the time for the characters or they just decided to give the mains all the screentime. The new characters introduced aren't fleshed out enough for you to care but somehow still important enough for the story for you to remember them. The only character you cares about is Ayanokoji (and the waifus) who carries the entire show from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable if you want to try a Slice of Life-Psychological anime, heavy plot and some drama. One thing you need to be prepared of is the fact that this is a Slice of Life, so it tells some pointless stuff everynow and then while having something brewing out in the background.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is pretty good, definitely not a masterpiece, but this anime does succeeds on making you think about stuff and the main highlights of the show is the protagonist himself, Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, one manipulative bastard trying to protect his freedom.",

            "content": "I'd like to state this first before I go any further- this show had so much potential, that it's actually disheartening. But, as anyone who has read any of my previous reviews would know, I rate based on enjoyment, and review from a \"wide-eyed\" anime aficionado perspective. So, first and foremost, I deliciously enjoyed the show. It\u2019s not that the show is without it\u2019s (apparent) faults, and that I have no gripes. But when the rest of the shows for the season are slice of life/romance, or intense-shounen action, a psychological thriller (albeit a mediocre one) isnothing short of refreshing. In fact, it\u2019s my favorite genre.\\n\\n\r\n**There will be minor spoilers here. So, if you haven't seen the show, I aim to keep them few in number, and light in plot.**\\n\\n\r\n       I'd also like to keep it brief, so you're not suffocated by 21st century, millennial, prose.\\n\\n\r\n       The plot, is already summarized so I'll spare you the complete reformation and introduce my disappointment in a bit. But, in essence, this is a moderately refreshing twist on the classic \u201ccult of personality\u201d that we call high school, in anime. Where you\u2019re given a series of characters with decently confusing names, and modest individuality, that are never explored. As well as a main character (that in one way, shape or form) protects his classmates from ne\u2019er do wells\u2026 Welcome to the Classroom of the Elites.\\n\\n\r\n     The characters, most of whose names I\u2019ve forgotten (no offense), are all quirky in some way or another giving them the ability to make a fair support cast. This can be seen in more than just the immediate characters (fellow classmates); the other classes themselves each possessed their own unique qualities that, for better or worse, gave them life. Our main character, however, is thrown in the lowest class in the rungs, Class D, forced to work him way to the top. This class is brimming with personality that, as I mentioned before, is completely wasted. \\n\\n\r\n     The main character\u2019s background (Ayanokouji-kun) is very loosely explained, and only shown in random flashbacks that appear to have no form of chronology. Which is kind of frustrating, seeing as how there are many talents he possesses that don\u2019t fit well with his apparent complacent nature. Other characters have severely interesting natures, and tendencies/philosophies that tend to appear and disappear as the plot demands it. But the shallow portion that is shown is enough to grasp what type of people they are, and what they can/will do in any given situation. In fact, it was enough to lead to a promising second season of character exploration (\u2026. At least it was, until the last episode came and mucked around, destroying my two favorite characters). I appreciate them avoiding an outright harem, but there can be no high school without some form of sexual tension\u2026 I guess?\\n\\n\r\n     Now, for the plot. Hmm\u2026 It was, at best, still in developmental stages and at worst\u2026 generic and disappointing. The episodes hop around a bit, plot-wise, and doesn\u2019t really settle on a solid arc until the latter half of the series. It\u2019s strong points, or in this case the \u201cmost interesting points\u201d are the unique elements this elite school possess: the point merit-based system, which can buy anything within the schools realm of possibility; classroom tension, due to competing for a mutual goal (to be the best); and a cunning cast. These strong points also happen to be the weakest/most underdeveloped plot related aspects. \\n\\n\r\n     I know I\u2019ve done nothing but critique, however, again, overall I found this show a delicious digest, with room to grow. Neglecting the last episode, and of course the low chances that this series ever gets a second season, I would recommend this show as a decent thriller. There\u2019s not too much depth (although there could have been), but it\u2019s an entertaining story to follow nonetheless. Just don\u2019t expect a resolute plot, and ignore the lack of (most) character development. I give it a 7/10. \\n",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nThe premise of the anime was very interesting, especially for a school anime. The point system is quite unique as a whole, from how one earns the points and how one can spend the points. The various arcs were also done fairly well. The way Suzune and Kiyotaka approach the various problems, which seemingly can only get worse, was very intriguing yet at the same time believable. Ultimately, they managed to solve the problem with the best possible outcome and it is very satisfying to see them turn the tables on the 'superior' people. Speaking of the elitist system in the school, it wasalso interesting to see the dynamics in each class, and how people from different classes interact with one another under this context, which was consistently applied from start to finish. Despite somewhat differing from the LN, the anime manages to pull off a pretty satisfying finale.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some significant issues as well. The pacing is a bit of a mess, especially in the second half of the season. This story is also highly complex and requires a lot of time to develop, which it didn't receive in this season. Even after completing it, there were still quite a handful of unanswered questions that I would've liked the anime to delve into. Hopefully this will be solved through a second season. Barring these issues, the story is pretty stellar.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe character designs are absolutely gorgeous. I love the detail they put into the eyes in particular with the various colour gradients. Furthermore, the school is also very nicely designed and conveys a sense of prestige and being a place for the elites of the society, with the huge campus and its many facilities which basically make it an entire town on its own. The animation is smooth as well. This anime is simply so satisfying to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nBoth intro and outro songs are nice to listen to. The intro song generates some hype and builds up to the episode. Meanwhile the outro song is more relaxing and calming, which is great after an episode of feeling hopeless as the main problem in an arc worsens, or when the problem is finally resolved and bringing the arc to a close. Each episode also begins with the sound of a bell tolling, as though class is starting in some school so prestigious that it has a bell tower, and it really fits well with the ominous story and its premise as a school for the elite. The BGM is also pretty atmospheric and nice to listen to in the different parts of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWith the system of elitism, it is easy to conclude that each character in Class D has some deep-seated flaw, and less so as we go up the caste system. But for most, they are seemingly normal people, like us. As the story progresses, we see the issues of more and more of the cast, while most others continue to conceal their flaws like we do in real life. This really fleshes out the various characters like real life people. The anime also explores the mysterious backstory of Kiyotaka though I would've liked to further delve into others' backstories as well. As a matter of fact, many of the supporting characters seem quite interesting yet they were not given an opportunity to develop further which was a crying shame.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy this anime, with many of the reasons being those I have stated above. Other reasons include neat details in the intro and outro, where they give a brief recap of some of the scenes of the previous episode so one can remember where the story left off last week, and the number of points each character and class has respectively. In the middle of the episode, there is a short break of a few seconds that gives some details of the school and how it works, which were interesting in presenting new pieces of trivia and helpful in recalling certain bits of information mentioned in previous episodes. The title of each episode is a philosophical statement that I find quite relatable to real life, which is something I really liked about this anime.",

            "content": "Classroom of the Elite. An anime that was done in a very different and appealing way that was loved by the masses who watched it. Though it had it's share of issues it's still one of the best anime you could watch this year.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story was a very unique and complex idea, something so complex that it couldn't be completed in 12 episodes (more on that). It had almost all the elements to rake in more viewers without fanservice (thank GOD for that). Now with the good stuff out of the way I'll move on to the next step here, the negatives. The storywas slow. Too slow is an understatement. I mean, if a good studio were to make this, all the story here would've taken just 6 episodes instead of 12. And that's a big deal. Nevertheless the story didn't disappoint and even though it was slow it was great to see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite rare to see such beautiful art which breaks barriers. Last year's was Kimi no na Wa and not famboying, but Classroom of the Elite took this year's crown. It's absolutely amazing. They knocked it out of the park with this one. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was not on the level you expected from watching the PV. Ayanokoji's VA was incredible and in my opinion was the best voiced introvert MC in anime. But if you look apart from him the list gets disappointing. Horikita was a joke, Kushida was okay-ish and Sakura was fine. No one else was that great. The OP/ED were ok too. The OP in particular was lame and forgettable and I found myself skipping it Everytime. Meanwhile the ED was the exact opposite. I found myself *downloading* it on my phone and enjoying it everyday and every time I watched an episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sheer amount of character in Ayanokoji is something quite commendable. It was brilliantly done. Apart from that the characters were above average but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAyanokoji: FINALLY. AN MC DONE RIGHT was my first reaction and thankfully I didn't regret saying it because till the end I saw him staying the same cool way he dealt with everything. His relatability puts relatable anime like Gamers! to shame. His voice, personality and everything in between were not just amazing but awardable. Not to mention the mystery he had which was teased throughout the anime, and I loved every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nHorikita: The only character who I hated and was a complete disgrace and disappointment was Horikita or dare I say it 'HoriSHITa'. If the studio specifically wanted me to hate her then it was excellently done. I LOATHED her. She did nothing to improve the situations and always remained the Queen she wanted to present herself as. And if there was ANYONE who dislikes Hime-deres it's me. And so, she almost spoiled a lot of the good parts with her poisonous personality which included sneering at people for no reason, acting as if she was a Queen when helping others and the like.\\n\\n\r\nSakura: Ah, what a refreshing personality she had. Although her part was very minor in the anime she nailed it. She was also very relatable which boosted her character by light years in contrast with Horishita. It was fun seeing a potential romance blossom between her and Ayanokoji (which was quite obvious) and from the time she came to the end of the anime, she didn't screw up any storyline thankfully.\\n\\n\r\nKushida: Hmm. Maybe the only other supporting character who got considerable screentime, Kushida was your everyday cheerful girl who wants to be friends with everyone, but she, much like Ayanokoji, had her dark secrets. This in turn was a good twist to the cheerful girl type seen in anime and which is why even she beat Horishita as a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved it. Every bit of it. Classroom of the Elite was something I really needed after watching a few disappointing anime before and it cheered me up and filled me in with suspense. It's mystery was something I looked forward to every week and the characters were absolutely lovely (trying to ignore a certain shit character here). Personally, I couldn't love this further. It was certainly my favourite anime of 2017 though I expect Shokugeki no Souma to overtake it soon as it also releases it's third season this October (Hype!).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6\\n\\n\r\nClassroom of the Elite is an anime that has a lot of good going for it. And compared to it's counterparts like Isekai Smartphone this is miles ahead. If you ask me to compare it to other Summer anime like Touken Ranbu, well can't say really. This and that were different and I haven't watched Touken Ranbu yet. But in the end, Classroom of the Elite is an excellent example of a good 2017 anime and an anime done right all the same. I'd definitely recommend it as the best 2017 anime one could watch. Though it looked like a Romance it had none of it and even though I'm a Romance Comedy fan and none were deeply focused on here, the other genres namely Mystery, Psychological, School satisfied me to no end. Loved it",

            "content": "Disclaimer: \r\n1/ This show is promotional material for the lite novel.\r\n2/ This show is more political commentary than typical anime.\r\nBecause it is from a lite novel, it suffers from all the typical lite novel tropes: OP loner protagonist, female harem, high school.\r\nNow then why is this show more commentary than anime tv series? Because if you watch this show for above the surface aspects such as engaging characters, gripping plot, fantastic visuals, this show will not be for you (reflected by how polarizing reviews are)\r\nFor this show, its minimalist characterization is its strength (teasing you at the possible twisted personalities these individuals hide).\r\n\"Why should Icare? I don't feel connected to any of these characters.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the characters that the show spend time characterizing are generic, deliberately so. In this high school world the show portray (An anarcho-capitalist, objectivist, wet dream) with class A-D with D being the worst class, it is intentionally implied that straight forward, generic, honest people do not succeed in this type of environment. \\n\\n\r\nWhat this show then do is try to get viewers to analyze this argument philosophically; with several overt attempts at doing so such as semi pretentious quotes usually in a foreign language for both the intro and quote of the episode serving as title of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn that sense, this show is much akin to Kakeguri but instead of over the top orgasmic hyperbolic interpretation, this show\u2019s strongest draw is mystery and portrayal of political philosophy such as objectivism (think Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrug), libertarianism, capitalism, political bipartisanship, etc. from the point of view of an apathetic elite protagonist, Ayanokouji, who is shown and implied to have overwhelming ability but cares not for the world, nihilistically so, around him with his foil being main girl Horikita and side girl Kushida.\\n\\n\r\nWith the shows unconventional take on the anime formula, as well as the polarizing nature of the subject as reflected by how polarizing reviews are, this show is definitely not for everyone. Some messages will definitely fly over people\u2019s heads. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore as a show, this is definitely paid promotion for the lite novel which serves as both the show\u2019s greatest strength and weakness. On one hand it is way too short to examine the subplots (that the show teases plenty of) as well as the theme. On the other hand, due to how short it is, they can justify leaving room for these subtleties for the inquisitive questioning mind. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, I think this show did its job promoting enough interest in the lite novel (and some of the underlying philosophies being examined) but it clearly will have very niche interest. If you enjoy contemplating what ifs, this show is for you. 7.5\\n",

            "content": "Before you pass off this series for being just another anime set in high school, hear me out first. This show doesn't just merely make use of the school setting as an easy way to build up its characters and story, its a deconstruction of it. A detailed analysis of how different people play different roles in a class, how the priorities of some are the trivial issues of others. \r\nFor me, what really hooked me onto this was the extremely well written school system, the way the school operates and the mechanics behind it. It's very interesting, unorthodox and arguably controversial in a senseas one might question the morality and virtues behind such a management. But all in all, it was just plain cool to me and I so desperately wanted to go to such a school after watching the first few episodes or so, even if it means I'll probably be overwhelmed and crumble under the stress lol. \\n\\n\r\nNext, we have a very excellent protagonist, Ayanokouji, who I found to be uninteresting and plain at first with the troupe of the loner and social outcast kind of character. But a few episodes in and its clear as water that he is not who he seems. The way he handles situations with that nonchalant expression and monotonous voice really sold the show to me and it was just refreshing to have such an unusual character troupe as the main character, especially when majority of his true intentions are kept hidden from the audience despite him having many monologues. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the catch is that there are only 12 episodes in this season and the story is far from complete with many questions left unanswered. But I do guarantee that the ending will not disappoint. This is a show stemming from the psychological genre and being a student myself, I can relate to many things and situations that arise there, sometimes cringing because its all too embarrassingly familiar. I really did enjoy the ride and hope you will too :>",

            "content": "Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is a show where the premise immediately stood out to me and interested me. The way the point system is set up at Koudo Ikusei Senior High School already had me theorizing at the beginning of the series the possibilities for where the story could branch off. I was more than satisfied with the end product that I got. In particular, I appreciated the psychological aspects of the show and the sense of depth that some of the characters have despite how they appear on the surface.\r\nSpeaking of characters, this anime has a lot of great ones especiallythe main protagonist Kiyotaka Ayanokouji who in my opinion was a big reason why I enjoyed this show as much as I did. His character archetype isn't so uncommon and has been done before but in this instance, it's a near perfect fit for the type of show Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e is. Even as you feel like you get a good grasp of his personality, throughout the show you'll be thrown curve balls that will make you reassess your thoughts on his character. I could go on like this for the other two main characters Suzune Horikita and Kikyou Kushida, or many of the support characters but I think it would be more fun for you to experience it yourself.\\n\r\nI thought the art was great and I loved the way gradation was used on the eyes of the characters. The animation is mostly standard except for parts where it noticeably perks up to bring attention to certain scenes. The soundtrack wasn't amazing but it did manage to standout and I appreciated what the distinctiveness of some of the tracks brought to the anime.\\n\r\nI looked forward each week to seeing the battle between the four classes and half an hour always felt like it passed by in a flash. The ending we got this season felt more like the end of an arc and less of the end of a series so hopefully one day we can get a new season. I think Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e was good enough to deserve it!",

Fighting scenes were prettyfluent and objects had good details. Very good art for 2017 and again this genre of anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\n- Personally I loved the Opening, it was catchy and enjoyable.\\n\r\nED on end of each episode matched the dark theme and fitted quiet nicely.\\n\r\nBackground music was neither good nor bad, average one.\\n\r\n9/10 because background music was just average, could be better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n- From start characters looked like nothing much, classic characters from anime highschool. Soon you will realize each characters is special and have its own background story and hidden sides. Main characters duo :\\n\r\nAyanokoji : Very badass genius, skilled in martial arts. Perfect protagonist which can make your jaw drop.\\n\r\nHorikita\\n\r\n- Smart, good looking girl. Always tries her best, she is also able sacrife herself for class. Likeable character and makes perfect duo with Ayanokoji.\\n\r\nSide characters\\n\r\n- As I said, they each have own background story and unique reasons why they do things the way they do.\\n\r\n10/10 Each character is hidden in mystery and has his own story. Main characters are perfect and matched the story good.",

For starter the school gave 100.000 points to students per month, well that's what the teacher said in thebeginning (I won't spoil the twist), 1 point is worth 1 Yen, so 100k points = 100k Yen.\\n\r\nAnd the ways to get point are all the student in the class must have good attitude and grade and they must achieve both.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episode goes you'll find that the interesting point of this anime is not from the school itself but from each character personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nJust like my other reviews, if I felt comfortable or the animation/art is stable and suited the theme I'll give a good rate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nMC personality more or less the same as Hachiman from Oregairu, don't care about anything around him but always ended up helping them.\\n\\n\r\nHorikita is the type of girl who shut herself from people around her, being a loner is a good thing for her but as the episode goes Horikita starts to open a litle her heart to people around her.\\n\\n\r\nKushida have 2 personalities; Good girl in from of people and Dark while she is alone, I thought Kushida will be part of the problem but it's not.\\n\r\nIt's as if revealing her both personalities and her threat towards Ayanakoji feel pointless. The most importantly thing is, this girl is far more annoying than that Yui (in Oregairu season 1).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nWell, some people may not agree with my score but this is what I feel what this anime is deserve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you like those characters personalities from Oregairu then this anime can be you as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not a rip-off of Oregairu in regard of story.",

The school system is run by points, and merits, and all your money is connected to said \"stats\". The strength of this show comes from its suspense, character variability, and frankly, the fact that you make many guesses, some which come true, and other which don't.\r\nLittle backstory is known about many of the characters, but their interactions are interestingas is the school which allows ANYTHING to be bought, bartered, or traded for the right price. \\n\\n\r\nThe show leaves its mysteries, and utilizes character drama and small tests to capture the audience. I wouldn't call it a great show, but its compelling enough to make you want to learn more about the school, student board, and characters antics.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is very likable in the way hes nearly a shadow, slipping through the cracks and manipulating those around him, and his story is still fairly unknown.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interesting in a fairly simple show with a few twists, a lot of mild suspense, odd charecters,and a fairly unique school setting, this isn't a bad show to pick up. I give it a 7 out of 10 for worth the watch, but dont expect to be blown away. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! \\n",

            "content": "Wow! That was one of the most amazing endings I\u2019ve ever seen. If I could describe the anime I would describe it as a more serious Baka to Test since class D is a class of defects, Ayanokoji is one of the most interesting MCs I\u2019ve seen in anime since his actions may be questionable, but they do result good for other in his class. There are other interesing character also like Ryen, Horikita and Kushida.The story is great since it\u2019s very interesting to see how class D faces through hardships. The score is also really good and the animation is also great. \r\nProblems Ihave is with episode 7 since it\u2019s a fanservicesy episode (the anime overall is fanservicesy, but it\u2019s not cringeworthy) it didn\u2019t need to happen you could have something else happen. Also there\u2019s a huge timeskip in this episode and a exposition dump. Also there are some characters that gets underdeveloped, but I can understant it and it\u2019ll probably have a second season.\\n\r\nI said at the beginning that this was the anime of the year. This is one of the best anime I\u2019ve seen from this year with one of the most impactful endings since Nice Boat. I\u2019ll talk spoilers after I give my grades on how I think the direction of season 2 will be, but also spoilers about the anime\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOkay spoilers: So Ayanokoji is a character that I hate to love since he\u2019s similiarr to Kira that he also cares about winning and sees others as tools to achieve his goal. He\u2019s a total sociopath and that reveal was amazing. So season will likely be more darker and Ayanokoji will be more like Kira in that we\u2019ll hear more of his darker thoughts. It might have a similiar direction to Death Note that we\u2019ll hear and see Ayanokojis twisted thoughts to get through hardships.",

            "content": "Classroom of the elite is a seemingly great show, it has solid, interesting and mysterious characters, a good setting and great art. But after a few episodes I have to say that this anime is really having a hard time deciding what it \"really\" wants to be, it started off as a slice of life school romance anime and quickly turned into a sort of survive the school-esk show (like food wars), not that that is a truly bad thing. \r\nLet's go over the anime step by step, first the story, we have our main character Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, a silent protaganist that barely shows emotion,as he is on his way to the new school of the elite - Koudo Ikusei Senior high school, a school only for the best of the best. In episode 1 an idea is established that basically society is not truly equal, and everyone has some sort of standing, would it be lower or higher than another person, and that the world is unfair. This is well presented with the school itself, despite it being the school for the best of the best, there are still classes representing your value based on which one you were put in, class A being the highest, class B, class C, and finally class D, where our main character resides. Upon first arriving at the school he meets a girl named Horikita Suzune, an ice queen of sorts that rarely shows alot of emotions and is also very cold and ignoring of everyone around her, as she finds things like friends to be meaningless and an obstacle to her true goal, to reach class A.\\n\r\nWe also have our second main female lead Kushida Kukiyo, a very cheerful girl who wants to be friends with everyone. Now when you see these characters probably one anime came to mind, that being My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU or Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru - in japanese. The characters are extremely similiar, and I'm not talking only about our main characters, but alot of the side characters aswell. But sadly if  you are searching for the next SNAFU, this isn't it, it is very different when compared to SNAFU. As SNAFU focuses on it's down to earth tone and relatable characters to drive it's plot, Classroom of the elite is alot more \"Anime\" if that makes sense, the characters are relatable to some extent, but going into the anime you start to realise just how distant they actually are. As for continuing the story, Ayanokoji, our main character, enrows in this school expecting a calm and peaceful school life, but is greeted with a very twisted school enviroment. It turns out that in Koudo Ikusei High School is far from a normal school, in this school every class earns points based on what ranking the class is in, students use these points to live in this new school enviroment, in this school these points are everything. This plotline of an elite school which has some seriously twisted rules and is extremely strict reminds me alot of the school in Food Wars, and it is in concept fairly similar. Overall the story itself revolves itself on our main characters thriving to survive and eventually reach class A, a simple plot, but what adds depth to the story are the mysterious characters and circumstances behind how the school truly works. So the story gets a 7 out of me, a decent enough story that is carried by it's characters rather than it standing on it's own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I will make this brief as I already talked a bit about our 3 main characters and only a bit about the side characters, overall they all have some sort of mystery surrounding them and are all in all pretty well fleshed out characters, although some of the less recurring characters can come off as very one note, but for now the characters are the main reason why I am watching this anime along with the mystery behind them and their pasts. So for that the anime gets a 9 in this department.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was made by studio Lerche, the studio responsible for the danganronpa anime and assassination classroom most notably, which explains why I felt like I had seen the animation and art somewhere, and also why I enjoy it so much. Overall if you have seen studio Lerche's work and you enjoyed it, you will enjoy this anime aswell. The art gets a 9 from me, very fluid and consistent and just overall very good to look at, especially the eyes of the characters, just from looking at their eyes you can sort of understand the personality of the character, which is something I find to be very impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets a pass from me, the opening and closing are nothing special and the music during the anime is pretty average aswell, sadly I will have to give it just a 6 in this department, as nothing much stood out to me, although I do enjoy the opening quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoy this anime, but at the same time it feels like this anime is abandoning it's main plotline and theme and is just sort of going with the flow, it hasn't really stuck itself to one idea and it can come off as sort of unsure in itself at times. Also another thing I just have to note is that this anime actually has a filler episode, and no I don't mean it's an uninteresting episode that barely advanced the plot, it was just a fanservice episode that basically did nothing in line with advancing the plot, you could just remove this episode and you will see no difference in the main story, from what I can tell, this anime will probably be atleast 25 episodes so I guess 1 episode being filler isn't that bad, just hope they don't do anymore, the random flash of fanservice really ruined the pacing and feel for this show for me for quite a long while, but I have gotten over it. I would say that besides those few gripes I do find myself really enjoying this anime, it is not the SNAFU 2 that I wanted, but it is still a very solid and unique series. It gets an 8 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime has it's ups and downs, but it is definitely one of the better shows from the summer season and you should check it out without a doubt. I might update this review, if I remember, after the anime ends, but as it is right now I can safely give this anime an 8/10.",

The problem is everything due to the setting the high school setting is not a convention anymore its basically a boring cliche with the main character in the side window to make a cool shot. The main character we don't really know anything about his perspective, his values what right or wrong nothing really ( hints does not mean anymore).  They are characters personalities that completely change being a \"twist\" but does nothing about it, just doing it for the sake of it.Again the art is decent, not bad, however, some of the sound design is god awful I forget what scene but it was truly terrible in this one scene.  The art style is basically pretty well done and animated well but the problem is the designs are so generic, it becomes unappealing.  Their design or look does not really reflect their personalities at all, its bland and one dimensional and the first episodes has one of the most terrible phrases about life etc... trying to be meta but completely failed.  Again I give this a 6.5/10 because it does have good comedic timing and decent directing, making some cool transitions.",

I know this anime is not for everyone but if your like me you'll like it. It takes on the mature take on the real society this is not your typical school anime that boy meets girl, then girl and the boys fall for each other. Nah this anime is different from the others its a black pearl in hundredsof white pearls. \\n\\n\r\n*Characters\\n\r\nSome say that the characters are generic but for me its different the generic characters help build up the story and also every school have those stereotypes even at real life school there are stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\n*Story\\n\r\nIts very interesting but this anime always have cliffhangers on every episode I recommend letting the series finish before watching it because this is an anime good for binge watching\\n\\n\r\n*Art\\n\r\nIts good the colors are vivid and its made by Lerche\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAt the moment this anime is one of the hidden gems it the school genre you don't often see this mature take on school anime \\n\\n",

The setting is interesting, however I agree with others, it is unrealistic and trivial. I mean rich kids in a school competing doesn't really seem like a lot of stakes, but the show manages to convince you it is somehow. Already lines are being drawn and it is clear multiple students are aiming for the top and going to use any means necessary. We have gotten to know mainly the Class D characters and most of the plot is their struggles, including being targeted by higher classes. The plot could be really interesting or turn out really lame but I've been enjoying the mystery as it isn't clear where it is going and I've enjoyed seeing the intellectual battles between students including entrapment so far! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 [spoilers]\\n\r\nA lot of the Class D students are incredibly stupid and lazy. I assume this was done to create early conflict. The kids came and thought they'd have it easy here, spent all their money in the first month, and goofed off in class, but then had a rude awakening and the teacher mocks them for it. I agree, these kids deserved it and it is weak writing. However, after the first couple episodes under the surface there are a lot of intriguing characters developing. It seems almost every character has secret motivations, including the teachers. Already we've seen two characters seemingly reversed, yanked out of comfortable stereotypes into dangerous hidden sides. Some, if not the majority, may be sociopaths. On the surface it may seem like the MC is your typical nice guy but I really don't think it'll go down that way. I suspect the show is planning a reversal where the people you liked turn out to be not so nice and vice versa. It has already happened once with the bubbly girl. This MC though...definitely not your run of the mill guy. For one he keeps pulling out remarkable skills and is very astute, helping others out, yet claims to not care about anything. You start to realize he knows a lot and can manipulate people at will including his supposed friends. Something weird is going on with him behind those dead eyes. He gives me the chills and Episodes 5 pretty much confirms he has his own dark agenda--whatever that is. We'll see! \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation is ok and serves its purpose. It doesn't seem particularly impressive though and often lacks attention to detail except in the key scenes. \\n\\n\r\nExcited to see where this one goes! I'm following it every week!",

            "content": "To start off, at the time of writing I have watched 6 of its episodes and I expect this series to end as at least one of my memorable ones. I'm going to break down my content.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe premise of the story is strong. It is one of those scenarios where the rules are very strong within the setting but also does not have serious implications should something go wrong. The starting few episodes tries to ease you in to the setting. However, it does feel like the pace for first few episodes is slow with small new things being revealed. The story really feelslike someone's perspective as they slowly learn about their new surrounding. Things are starting to change with recent episodes so i can only think good things are to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say here the art and sound are amazing at times but as a whole is really great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI really really liked the characters. There are some parallels to be drawn between oregairu characters here. The characters so far have more than one side to them. So far they have not been introduced much as its only 6 episodes so far but it does feel like they'll touch upon that in a manner that does not feel like forced exposition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI really am enjoying this. I would recommend this to everyone if the series at least holds this quality. HOWEVER, i would not recommend everyone to start watching right away and wait till more episodes are out for those people who need to see substantial progress in the story of an anime.\\n\\n",

This is something diffrent! In a good way!\r\nIts an extremly unique setting for a school life based anime, with an seemingly interessting story and plot. \r\nI particulary love the main character. Its so refreshing seeing a MC who isnt (yet) ecchi, overreacting, just plain stupid, hyperactive and still liked somehow by the school idol.I really got tired of that.\\n\\n\r\nIts more like the author watched a bunch of Slice of life school animes and wrote his MC in complete reverse. \\n\r\nHe is really relaxed, doesnt care about friends, appereance, girls, anything (yet) and HE LITERALLY DOESNT SHOW ANY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS(he doesnt blush for every fucking little thing), what makes him really cool and enjoyable, even tho he seems like a loser.\\n\r\nEdit: He is definitly not a Loser he is basicly like Tatsuya Shiba. \\n\\n\r\nThe heroin is kinda the same, but seemingly with ulterior motives. Always been alone, also making her outstanding and loveable.\\n\\n\r\nIts just so diffrent to what you are used to !\\n\\n\r\nThe story and summary plot twist made it look like an anime with a slight dark touch, where seemingly every classmate is punished for the mistake of one( assumption )\\n\r\nEdit: Not an assumption anymore\\n\\n\r\nI very much liked the introduction to the \"roles\" in class, very unique kind of element to use for that. \\n\r\nIts very promissing, and this far the only anime this season id recommend watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 \\n\r\nArt: 9 (personal prefference)\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (so far)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (because its so diffrent and interessting)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 which hopefully wont change soon.",

That being said it does manage to hold my attention pretty well and if you're not looking for something spectacular and just want something interesting to watch this show could be what you are looking for.\r\nStory-\r\nIt's a high school for the super elite, or so they say. In reality, I think it'd bemore accurate to say that it is a high school that produces the super elite. Unfortunately, this is one of those shows where the people making it weren't aware of their status as a fairly basic anime, and as a result, this show suffers from that pretension that often haunts anime. They try to be all philosophical at times but it doesn't really work. Not gonna spoil anything but the plot is definitely set up in a pretty interesting manner by the end of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound-\\n\r\nGonna be quick as there generally isn't much to say about these in mainstream commercial anime. Everything is, for the most part, well polished yet supremely regular. I will say that the music for me was a big plus. Manages to add to the tone quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- \\n\r\nThey are all tropes. Yes, I know, pretty much every anime character created recently is a trope I'm just letting you know that this show is the same. If you make the mistake of thinking \"wow that character is super interesting and unique\" it's probably just because you have yet to encounter that type of character. The MC, in particular, is a hardcore trope. I'm gonna tell you his dere type which may be considered a spoiler so skip ahead if you don't wanna know...... Ready? He's a kuudere. Yup another one, and get this they totally try to sell him as some pathetic loner guy at the start before he starts forming his harem and releasing his hidden OP anime protagonist powers. If you've never seen this trope before I'm shocked you've made it to this site. Oh and the front runner for best girl (she may not be best girl but is first girl if ya know what I mean (as in she is the first harem member)) i'll give you one guess at her dere type. Yup, tsundere. If you got that wrong please leave.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- \\n\r\nLike I said it's entertaining. If you are a vet who enjoys their tropes then you at the very least will be satisfied by the execution of those roles in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI would summarize but I did that in the tdlr at the start so...\\n",

No one else is of any note.\r\nI enjoy this show in the sense that I'm sick at home andhave already caught up on every show worth watching this season. This is the weakest show I don't intend to drop. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 5-6. It treads no new ground. It excels at nothing. It will be forgotten by next season. Watch it if you have seen everything else this season. Aside from the anime mentioned in the review, a good alternative this season would be Tsundere Children. It also treads no new ground, but it manages to capitalize on most of the anime rom-com tropes we're all used to.",

They are useful and participative in all animes, even though they are secondary. The only problem is that I do not see and even feel development within them, even though they are always there on the screen with you.\r\nThe soundtrack is very simpleand does not deserve more highlights.\\n\\n\r\nWhat also deserves praise are the traits. Very well done from start to finish. The fight scenes (which are few, obviously) are very well done and very lively. What gives even a certain desire to watch more fights within the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne problem that maybe I only had with anime are the eyes of the characters. I could also mention their hair but we can relieve it, since at the beginning it is already stated that students can comb their hair and have them as they want. However, I am a little afraid at times. They look like characters that came directly from an RPG and came to a straight stop at a school.\\n\\n\r\nI could give a higher note because the anime knew to arrest me and I really created a sympathy with some characters like Ayanokouji, Horikita, Sakura, Ayanokouji and even by the teacher Chabashira. A note about the character Ryuuen. What are those clothes? Your clothes look like they came straight from the poorest store in Las Vegas.\\n\\n\r\nBut I really expected more on certain bridges and inside me there was the feeling that the anime could yield more and unfortunately it was not taken advantage of as it should.

The characters are so boring, except for Kushida. Although what made her interesting wasn't utilized at all and wasn't shown anymore until the end after it was first introduced so, even she was boring for the most part.

            "content": "To keep this short I would say that this show has an interesting premise but is far to predictable for it's own good. In my opinion a psychological mystery show should have a few clues to get the viewer speculating, but should also try to keep a few cards up it's sleeve.\r\n The character motivations are obvious from the get go but it made me hopeful I was reading to much into the characters them selves and the story would take a surprising turn. ultimately it has potential for a second season but given how not much happens in the twelve episodes shownI just couldn't justify giving it more then a five.\\n\\n\r\n What I will say is that the music is fairly catch and the art is at least average. This is the ultimate middle of the road anime but  at the end of the day if this show has all the tags you like to see then go for it otherwise go find something else to enjoy.",
