            "content": "\"To be blunt, I just enjoy talking to you... so I want to talk with you more.\"\r\n\"If our opinions clash, let's talk it over.\" (Dialogue from episode 5)\r\n'Bakemonogatari', cleverly translated as 'Ghostory' or 'Monstory', is about five not-so-normal girls that Araragi Koyomi, a vampire himself, encounters and attempt to save from oddities possessing them.\r\nCHARACTER:\r\nThe main characters of 'Bakemonogatari' are among the most unique and complex I have yet to encounter.\r\nHeroine Senjougahara Hitagi is a tsundere like half of all modern heroines in anime, but she is also \u300c\u30c9S\u300d, a sadist to an extreme degree, which is more common for side characters and rare for heroines.Our protagonist, as expected, is rather on the masochist side who takes constant verbal abuse from Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the couple extraordinary, is that Senjougahara is often boke while Araragi is tsukkomi. Traditional Japanese stand-up comedy consists of a duo: One takes the \"boke\" role who says something stupid while the \"tsukommi\" role points out the flaws in boke's argument, often with a violent slap in the head.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that's right. Boke is masochist by nature and often not very intelligent, while tsukommi is sadist by nature and often more observant.\\n\r\nThe leading couple in this series, on the other hand, take turns with the roles. It is particularly interesting when the sadist and intelligent Senjougahara purposefully take on the boke role and overwhelms tsukkomi. Such as making insulting statements that sound flawed, but when Araragi tries to make a comeback, he realizes what she said was true. Or Senjougahara makes a blatantly flawed statement just to hurt Araragi, and his comeback fall into deaf ears. And of course, plenty of intentional boke or tease spoken with so much authority that Araragi just gives up and let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nThe unlikely toggling of comedy roles were delivered extremely well, and this back and forth interaction between the leading couple is a key part of this show's appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining four main characters are not as complex as the leading couple, but they all have their own unique issues that drive the story,each with distinct personalities that made them memorable.\\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters in this series, and total of only 5 side/peripheral characters (Meme, Shinobu, two sisters, and Senjougahara's father) in the whole series. The limited character headcount made thorough character development possible despite being an arc-based series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nSimply put, half the show is about the romantic relationship between the Senjougahara and Araragi.\\n\r\nThe other half is about a constant argument between two values: The rational vs the idealistic, with Araragi as Mr. Nice Guy seeking happy end for everyone. Solution of supernatural oddities as the topic of the argument.\\n\\n\r\nHachikuji, Kanbaru, and Hanekawa's arcs developed the relationship of leading couple while offering new topics to the story.\\n\r\nThe only flaw in the story in my opinion, is that Sengoku's arc was pretty much by itself, and contributed very little to the whole series other than loli and moe fan service.\\n\r\nEach arc is an incident focusing on a different girl, but all the arcs combine to show a whole picture of Araragi and Senjougahara closing their personal distances.\\n\\n\r\n\"Bakemonogatari\" is essentially a verbal performance with visual support. Story is driven by back and forth debate on various issues.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWith verbal performance playing such a big role in this show, voice acting is taken to a whole new level in this series.\\n\r\nEvery characters' voices fit perfectly, and not only that, distinct tones and nuance of speech establish unique impressions for every single character. The characters speak so fast in this series with lots of tongue twisters, but the seiyuu cast had done a wonderful job in keeping up. I don't think it's an exaggeration to describe voice acting in this series as epic.\\n\\n\r\nMusic score in 'Bakemonogatari' has a generally consistent ambient feel to it with a nice flow. Other than intense music for action scenes, they don't particularly set the mood or enhance drama as what I usually consider to be strong BGM for anime, but the usually upbeat sounds in the background set the quick pace for dialogue, and make conversations all the more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nOP song \"Staple Stable\" is one of the best anime opening theme song by a seiyuu, ever. Really memorable tune accompanied by great vocal and lyric by meg rock was simply amazing.\\n\r\nThe other four OPs sang by seiyuu of each arc heroines were nowhere as impressive as \"Staple Stable\", but offers refreshment value to the OPs, and fits each character perfectly.\\n\r\nED song's lyric made little sense at first, but its meaning was unveiled in a conversation between the leading couple in a certain episode, and it turned out to very suitable for the series. The two Senjougahara theme songs (OP1, ED) were masterpieces.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAnimation in 'Bakemonogatari' mainly serve as a visual aid to the verbal performance, and it proved to be very effective.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals for the anime got somewhat of an \"art house film\" treatment. There were many abstract and surreal scenes, unconventional cuts, and intriguing camera angles that made the viewing experience very pleasant. It's the perfected form of SHAFT's signature style.\\n\r\nCharacter designs were attractive, and main characters had visually shown a wide range of emotion that further portrays the character's state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have with the animation is the use of photographs/videos of real-life imagery. At the risk of sounding like a super-otaku, I would say 3D images do not belong in the world of 2D.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs a fansubber and having seen thousands of hours of fan/professionally translated works, I can tell you that at least 10% of the meaning is lost in translation, no matter how well translated. In conversation/narration driven series filled with wordplay and metaphors, at least 20% of the meaning, therefore enjoyability, will inevitably be lost to non-Japanese speakers.\\n\r\nStill, 'Bakemonogatari' is a true masterpiece with experimental production that actually worked. Attention was paid to the tiniest details, and a story well-told. Truly amazing direction by Shinbou Akiyuki left us with so many memorable scenes, and this will definitely be a series to be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nThe 8-month wait for the final three episodes were excruciating, but the ending was so satisfying that it almost made it worth the absurd wait. Given the commercial success 'Bakemonogatari' has achieved, I will be hoping for the remaining novels in the series to be animated. Possibly 'Kizumonogatari' OVA/film and 'Nisemonogatari' as a sequel season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be blunt, I just enjoyed listening to them... so I want to listen to them more.\\n",

            "content": "For every medium, there are few masterpieces that transcend the genre and become something special.  Since I consider anime, as a genre, to be just as legitimate an art form (despite the bad rep it often gets), I will also review Bakemonogatari as a work of art, and it is irrefutably one of the special few anime series that fully capitalize on the strengths of the anime medium.\r\nSTORY\r\nPeople have complained that the story is too episodic, too disjointed.  However, the virtue of Bakemonogatari's storyline is that it is so minimal.  In all senses, this anime is a character-based experimental, and an elaboratestoryline would actually detract from that experience.  There are plenty of anime out there that thrive on plot twists and progression that keep the viewer on their seats, but Bakemonogatari isn't one.  The episodic storyline is a brilliant framing device for character development and nothing more, which works out perfectly for this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nAs usual Studio SHAFT splurged on art.  This is definitely a series to be enjoyed in high-definition, preferably with the room lights turned off.  Anime, by definition, is a genre segregated from realism.  The beauty of anime as a medium is that every cut is animated, so that the blemishes, imperfections, and limitations of reality can be omitted in favor of stylized, beautified perfection.  Anime art style that attempts to be too realistic are bound to lose that edge and, naturally, pale in comparison to live-action works featuring comparable visuals.  Anime that go all in on stylizing can often seem distracting and too detached from reality.  With all of that in consideration, Bakemonogatari is one of the few shining masterpieces of the anime genre that hits the sweet spot.  Everything in this anime is crisp and beautiful, from the characters to the slightest scenery detail.  What would have seemed tacky when drawn are boldly stylized and symbolized, rather than allowed to compromise the atmosphere.  For example, people have complained about the cuts to photographs and abstract diagrams that pop up frequently.  But imagine if all of those were actually animated; it would have been clunky and distracting from the dialog.  For example, Senjougahara's mother isn't a character in this anime, therefore having an designed, animated character to her credit would distract from the very small and tight cast.  I don't know how much budget went into this production, but they sure splurged where it was needed (characters, scenery-porn sequences, pivotal action sequences) and were decisive in radically minimizing what would have been superfluous.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThere is quite a rave about Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari and Staple Stable, and they are indeed catchy and appropriate opening/ending.  Much more underrated are the mundane, ambient sound design of this anime.  Just as Bakemonogatari should ideally be viewed in high-quality settings, so it should be heard with at least \"nice\" audio.  Perhaps I had the fortune/misfortune of being an impeccable audiophile and watched the series with headphones that cost me half a fortune, but everyone should at least watch Bakemonogatari with real speakers or decent headphones.  This is a series that can only be fully appreciated when the viewer is immersed in it, and laptop speakers simply won't do.\\n\r\nHaving said all of that, the non-intrusive BGM and ambient sounds do a perfect job of accentuating the dialog/situation without, again, distracting from what is really important.  Perhaps the best example is in the TV finale, where the BGM swells and fades without the viewers really noticing because they are so perfectly integrated with the ebb and flow of verbal/situational push and pull between the two leads.\\n\r\nThe voice acting, without even the need to elaborate, are top-mark.  The seiyuu for Koyomi is appropriately serious, jocular, and reflective.  I especially enjoyed the sequences and inserts in which Koyomi is thinking selfish/perverted/silly thoughts.  Excellent sound designing makes it sound like Koyomi's voice is really ringing inside my head, adding to the effect and how identifiable his character is.  Voice acting for Senjougahara seemed a bit too fragile and breathy at first, but it was revealed to be not the fault of the seiyuu, but part of character development, but more on that will border on spoiling.  Let me just add that voice acting for both leads hit the sweet spot at least by the TV finale.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAll of the other elements, story, art, and sound, up to now were accompaniments to the brilliant characters of Bakemonogatari.  If those elements had their virtue in garnishing the backgrounds of this anime, the characters' virtue lie in their shocking assertiveness and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi - Of all anime leads I've seen, he is one of the few truly-believable leads that are likeable.  He is objectively decent-looking and decently dressed, not, as are many a blue-haired shounen characters, outrageously flamboyant.  He is not an outspoken paragon of bravery and power.  He is even a bit of a sociopath.  However, the subtle inner stability he shows makes him stronger than Goku or Lelouch in my opinion.  He isn't a social butterfly, but he would never seriously harm another person.  Though he is a bit of a pervert, just like the rest of us, the viewers can't picture him ever being disloyal to his romantic partner.  Koyomi's inner strength and stability are what keeps this series from becoming a typical harem anime, and such qualities of his character are what makes the viewer so strongly and ineffably identify with him.\\n\\n\r\nSenjougahara - First of all, her name is awesome, just phonetically.  I read that it means something like \"battlefield\" in Japanese, but it sounds so feminine and appropriate to her character.  With that aside, if Koyomi is the steady, dependable drummer keeping beat to the Bakemonogatari band, Senjougahara is the lead vocalist that captures and enthralls the viewer.  Anime is, more than anything, a visual art, so it is of course important that her every frame is perfected and beautified with adoration.  Not only is she one of the most flawlessly beautiful female characters in anime, the way she poses and moves is also idealized.  Imagine a girl who never does anything unsightly: never makes an unflattering face, is never without makeup (or always looks perfect without one), never goes to the bathroom, you get the idea, and that would be Senjougahara.  Again, the creators of Bakemonogatari really cashed in on this aspect of anime to create a visually flawless female lead.  Utter perfection, however, isn't always likeable, as none of us are perfect.  Senjougahara, therefore, needs some profound flaw in order to offset her physical perfection, and that's when her character development comes into play.  I won't say much more on that for fear of spoiling, but she exists not as a perfect, standalone being, but someone who absolutely depends on Koyomi to complete her.  That's why their interactions work, even though they should logically have zero reason to even know each other.  Senjougahara is the modern Yamato Nadeshiko, though the usage of that term to describe her may be controversial.  The numerous attempts to categorize her as a tsundere/kuudere/yandere/whaeverdere have all failed because her character is grounded not on a trope, but a real-life ideal of feminine beauty. She is the culmination, or rather, an amalgamation, of decades of anime heroines that captured the viewers, male and female alike.  Senjougahara and Koyomi have such subtle and inexplicable chemistry because they are both subtle, ultimately mysterious characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThis is the one category where I admit that the 10/10 is highly subjective.  Objectively, Bakemonogatari is a top-quality art form, and I firmly believe that high-profile artists, filmmakers, etc. would appreciate that Bakemonogatari is the epitome of modern anime counterculture (Suzumiya Haruhi being the mainstream crystallization of modern anime).  However, you have to be looking for the right thing to enjoy this anime.  If the anime you typically enjoy are Naruto, TTGL, etc. (not that they aren't fantastic either), Bakemonogatari is perhaps not for you.  This series is really for people who have watched a lot of anime, perhaps even an otaku, and were drawn to the more sophisticated, post-modern aspect of the genre as a whole.  It is, in a way, analogous to how Mozart is universally loved (for a good reason!), while composers like Hindemith appeal strongly to those who have developed a taste in classical music.  I personally pick this series as the number one anime of all time (along with NGE) because it had all I was looking for: deep, subtle characters, platonic romance, somewhat surreal atmosphere, idealization only possible in anime, wit, and that pinch of sociopathy shown in each character, as are present in every human being.  There isn't one thing about this anime that is the \"hook\" (though, if I had to pick one, I'd go with SENJOUGAHARA FASCINATION). Rather, every aspect of it plays its role perfectly to create a gestalt whole.  Oh, and by the way, if you're like me and are desperately looking for non-moe, non-loli (getting harder and harder to find) anime made in 21st century, welcome to Bakemonogatari. This series is for mature viewers looking for a subtle, yet decisively anime experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you think yourself the discriminating, intellectual beta-component of modern society (who also happens to watch anime), you will love this series.  It's a love or hate type of anime, in my opinion, and if you are the type of person this show caters to, you will come to thoroughly appreciate every aspect of the show, besides just Senjougahara.  If you're not, that doesn't mean you're not as cultured or some nonsense; just need to find your anime masterpiece, as I found Bakemonogatari.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW IS FOR ALL SEASONS, AS SUCH, IT CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nMonogatari takes place in a city populated by about 20 people, cardboard cutouts, and kanji characters, and follows the story of Koyomi Araragi as he meets girls who have supernatural oddity-related issues in their lives and tries to help them.\r\nI am not a fan of the Monogatari anime, but I will get into why later in this review.\r\nThe characters are all pretty much what you'd expect from a harem anime. There's the selfless main character, the Tsundere girlfriend, the shy Moe girl who turns out to actually be psycho and manipulative, the smart girl whowears glasses (for a brief time anyway), the little sister(s), the athletic girl, the lesbian, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of them are written with more nuance than what you'd expect, as in, they get backstories, but on a basic level, I don't feel like it's any deeper than the character backstories from any other anime. But they do have a bit more depth than what you'd expect from a harem show, meaning they are not in a round-the-clock quest for the main character's dick. I'm not a fan of the characters (except for Kaiki Deishuu and maybe Meme Oshino), and don't think they're anything noteworthy, but I do give the writer credit for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also the same as what you'd expect from an anime. Talking about motivations, delivering exposition, and bantering whenever there's nothing going on. The difference is that most the show is just that, talking, with nothing else going on. However, I don't have that much of a problem with that aspect and some of the dialogue is occasionally funny. Nevertheless, even then, the dialogue often tends to go in circles and isn't strong enough to carry the whole show in my opinion, but more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, however, a lot of the story arcs start out with potential, but then they end up focusing more on the dialogue rather than doing something interesting with the premise, and then end unmemorably. The biggest example of this is in Monogatari Second Season's Mayoi Jiangshi arc.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, despite the first scene of this show being a 15-20 second-long panty shot, there isn't actually all that much fanservice. However, when there is, it's rather unappealing.\\n\\n\r\nTwo running gags with Koyomi include going out and molesting Mayoi, who is 11, and planning on tricking his little sisters into being molested by him, and he suffers no real comeuppance for it. I'd say it's refreshing to have a subversion as a change of pace from the typical harem humor wherein the main character does something perverted by accident and gets beaten up for it, but I don't think child molestation or incest are funny.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to mention the rape snake from the Nadeko Snake arc, and two extended scenes from Nisemonogatari, wherein Shinobu, who is over 400 years old but is physically 8, bathes with Koyomi, as well as the infamous scene where he brushes his little sister's teeth and it looks like they're having oral. I have read an essay analyzing the fanservice in Nise, of all things, and apparently it's supposed to represent teenage sexuality. Okay, but that doesn't mean that I have to feel it's worth wearing  a monocle and a top hat while smoking a Cuban cigar, listening to Mozart and waxing philosophical about this aspect. Might as well apply that same logic to every ecchi harem out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with Monogatari, however, isn't inherent, since I've read some of the light novels and think they're okay, despite having these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks nice and clean (despite the obvious low budget resulting in all these still frames), however, it is also its biggest flaw (besides the fanservice).\\n\\n\r\nShaft has been using the same visuals for every Shinbo-directed show for several years (10-11 years as of the time of this review), but I feel that when making Monogatari, they rely on their visuals too much.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time, during the dialogue scenes in Monogatari, they keep cutting to Dadaist visuals, text screens, weird camera angles and extreme closeups, which wouldn't be a problem, except that they focus on them for so long and so often, that it detracts from the experience. They go too overboard with those and fail to build up a good momentum for the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't judge a show based on the animation, as long as I'm interested in the story and the characters, but this is one case where I have the opinion that it detracts from everything else. In this case, I feel like the animation department is too busy showing off what I already know that they can do while not advancing the story in a significant measure in each episode with little pay-off, and that aspect is what I actually care about in a show. I've already seen this exact same type of animation in multiple other Shaft shows previously, so it doesn't do anything for me anymore, I'm not going to give it extra points.\\n\\n\r\nImagine if someone made an adaptation of a book, and instead of adapting the events of the book in a visual format, the adaptation entirely consisted of watching some guy sitting there, reading the book out loud. That's what watching Monogatari feels like.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that the Monogatari light novels are okay despite their flaws, but that Shaft's direction makes the anime boring to watch, and that I would have likely enjoyed the show more if it was made by another studio, or if Shaft hadn't gone so overboard with the animation to the extent that it detracts from everything else. The only reason I continue to watch it is just because I'm waiting for the moment where it finally lives up to its potential.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari is a love-it-or-hate-it show, watch it if you want, maybe you'll like it, but if you end up not liking it, I recommend watching Monster or Mushishi as preferable alternatives.",

            "content": "\"Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?\" - Senjougahara Hitagi, Episode 6\r\nWell, you won't be sighing anywhere in this anime.\r\nBakemonogatari from the start can give the wrong impression to the viewer. They must be wondering, \"Why is this rated so high, if it all it is, is just random words popping up on the screen?\" However, it is a really good anime in its own weird way, and you're probably going to have to appreciate it that way as well.\r\nCharacter: Usually, I'd start my review with the main part (story), but I believe the most important part of Bakemonogatariis its character development. You have Koyomi Araragi, who interacts with 5 different girls throughout the story; the tsundere Senjougahara Hitagi, the cute and small Mayoi Hachikuji, the tomboy Kanbaru Suruga, the other cute loli Sengoku Nadeko, and the Queen of Fanservice Hanekawa Tsubasa. Oh yeah, I almost forgot Oshino Shinobu. Each interaction and arc is unique. From funny wordplay, to stapling someone in the mouth, the character development is what makes this series a really entertaining one. If Bakemonogatari didn't have a storyline at all (which it does), it would still be entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nStory: The first episode actually starts off with flashing scenes from Kizumonogatari, the prequel of Bakemonogatari. You have Koyomi Araragi, who was recently bit by a vampire. In the beginning of the story, he meets Senjougahara by catching her fall. Was that the right decision to make? Araragi himself says; \"Not ignoring her was the right decision... I think\" (Episode 1). She then tells him (in fact, forces him, by stapling the side of his mouth) to be quiet about her \"incurable disease\", but Koyomi insists on helping. He gets his friend who had helped him recover from the vampire attack; Oshino Meme. He specializes in supernatural problems to help not only her, but everyone else throughout the story. The series overall isn't a story-focused one. It's more focused on the character interactions. The interaction between Senjougahara and Araragi are always entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nSenjougahara: *to Araragi* \"I'm suprised you know such useless things. This is the first time since birth that I've admired you.\"\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voices sound really nice, and the voice cast has a lot of popular names. The dialogue plays an important role is this anime, and is done really well, especially with its jokes. The OPs are really catchy (notable mention to Senjougahara's \"Staple Stable\" and Nadeko's \"Ren'ai Circulation\") and the ED (supercell - Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari) is just great.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is somewhat similar to SHAFT's other work (as expected). It's almost like a mix of Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei and Arakawa Under the Bridge, but everything is crisp and clear nonetheless. Another element that plays a huge role in Bakemonogatari is the flashing text and small detail that happens almost too frequently each episode. I think it is done well, and sets a mood for the episode. You don't have to stop and read everything, but the flashing words do provide some info and foreshadowing.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bakemonogatari has a lot of entertainment value, and all the elements combined make it a really good supernatural-romance-comedy. Each arc is enjoyable, and has a good amount of fan service for those who enjoy it. The romance was also done very well, which leaves the view with a warm feeling at the end. It took some time to get used to the weird flashing words in the beginning, but once you get used to it, you'll be in for an entertaining ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10",

            "content": "**Monster Story**\r\nGatari is voicing form of Katari. Katari is a tale which by oral tradition, is passed down from generation to generation. Thereby, the words \"Bakemono\" means monster and \"monogatari\" means story. Thus, you get \"Bakemonogatari\" which is an anime that contains tales of monsters.\r\nAlright, enough of the trivia. Let's get down to business.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIt'd be very difficult to describe the story without letting out spoilers. With that in mind, I can only tell you that Bakemonogatari is a collection of monster tales that are revelant to life. The story depicts surrealism and \"supernatural phenomenons\" amongst people, which occur when the main character, Araragi, interactswith them. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, SHAFT saves the day! SHAFT is well known for their artistic techniques to portray abstract scenes. Their other works, such as Ef - A Fairy Tale of the Two, are very much similiar. Bakemonogatari utilizes many, unique camera angles that are relevant or not relevant to what is being said. Such scenes could be the sky, cars, the character's hair, etc. Additionally, multiple screens and walls of text pop up to give the viewer a sense of abstract understanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing. I don't really know anyone who dislikes the OP and Ending themes. To make Bakemonogatari interesting, director Akiyuki Shinbo, allowed only a few episodes to have certain OP/Endings and mix them so it won't get boring. Indeed, it's nothing like your standard anime where there is the same boring OP and Ending played over and over. The insert music is also very excellent.\\n\r\nOP: \\n\r\n#01: \"staple stable\" by Chiwa Saito (Eps. 2, 6)\\n\r\n#02: \"Kaerimichi (\u5e30\u308a\u9053)\" by Emiri Katou (Ep. 4)\\n\r\nEnd:\\n\r\n#01: \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari (\u541b\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u7269\u8a9e)\" by supercellxnagi\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for the 8 is because, I feel the characters aren't being introduced thoroughly. Of course, it's understandable that Bakemonogatari will only be 15 episodes - thus they have to \"pack and condense\" the character development (Tales) to fit the 15 episodes. Had Bakemonogatari been 24 episodes though, I think overall character growth would be KILLER. The romance between tsundere-Senjougahara and male lead-Araragi is pretty nice, however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nBeside the story and character development-in-15-episodes, Bakemonogatari deserves a good two thumbs up. Also, for a anime having a tsundere female, I'd say it REALLY stands out from Shakugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima. Albeit the many interesting anime coming in 2009, Bakemonogatari is certainly something else. It's unique because it stands out from your traditional anime.  It is as if Bakemonogatari is wearing a green shirt while the other anime series wear white.To put it bluntly, Bakemonogatari offers this sense of upmost perfect surrealism that is damn near addicting. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari (Monster Story) is definitely a MUST-SEE.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime seemed to have a lot of mysteries in it, but the biggest mystery it presented to me was why I took such a violent dislike to it even though it has been favorably discussed by intelligent viewers. I stopped watching it early on, out of simple irritation. To me it was marching straight down that wrong road we are warned against in the aphorism, \"Don't gild the lily.\" \r\nIt's episode number 2, and an interesting \"exposition\" conversation is taking place between the anime's Girl Number 1 and the hero. It presents a considerable subsidiary mystery--why is this girl acting in this unusual andunpleasant way? This viewer would have liked to watch the interchange closely to try to find that out.  But I couldn't! Or at least I couldn't do so with full real comprehension, because it was just here that the director intensified his already-established habit of complexifying everything on the screen beyond reason. \\n\\n\r\nThis scene is taking place in some kind of loft-like living space within an industrial building. Beams and pillars cross and recross the whole field of view of the \"camera\", which is set at a middle distance from the action. In addition, when the camera moves, it is often to new points of view that are also well-removed from the action--and every one of the resulting fields of view is also seriously obscured by more architectural elements. In this long scene there are times when the camera does get closer to the \"actors\", and there are even a few--very few--closeup shots of the players' faces, but when those shots arrive they are usually jump-cuts--a quick close-up of the face in question then away. The overall experience of dealing with this as a viewer is similar to trying to interact with someone you've never met before in a dark room where the only light constantly goes off and on at irregular intervals. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this ladles on lots of mystery. FINE. The director's primary job at the beginning of a show is to suck us into the story--that is, to make us at least begin to make the story imaginatively ours. One way to do that is to mystify us at the outset, but this can be overdone! When the basic premise of the show, given in the first episode, is already a very large mystery, do we really need in the next scene to be presented with constant subsidiary visual mysteries? The other usual way to \"suck us in\" is to make us at least begin to identify with the protagonist. That's pretty hard to achieve here, where, in their very first substantial conversation, both the protagonist and his antagonist have been distanced from us both by too much shooting of their conversation with long shots and by constant visual clutter that has nothing to do with the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut I bet lots of you liked it all. And my best guess as to why lots of you do, and I don't, is generational. Modern technology permits all lilies to be easily gilded, I bet few directors can resist doing so; so most of you have gotten used to this. I'm an old guy, and I can't.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this intriguing anime, please, and see what you think. It may be announcing the beginning of a new rococo age.\\n\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nYou don\u2019t have to be a member of the anime community for long to know that the Monogatari series is very, very highly praised. Inevitably, I gave into the hype and tried it out for myself. The result? Well\u2026 I walked away entertained, but FAR from impressed. Yes the characters are amusing, yes the dialogue is witty, and yes the visuals are beautiful, but make no mistake: Bakemonogatari is just a harem. It exists only for comedic gags and fanservice. The characters are shallow and have little to offer beyond their archetypes and their dialogue, not to mention that the \u201cplot\u201d is looseand unimpressive to say the least. I guess I have very mixed feelings about this anime; I\u2019m happy I watched it, but the people hailing it as a masterpiece need to check themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Koyomi Araragi, our harem lead, gets himself involved with all sorts of supernatural stuff, including vampires, spirits, myths, ghosts, and other apparitions. Being the overly selfless, and unreasonably nice harem lead that he is, Araragi meets a series of girls, each of which with their own problems. He finds a way to solve those problems, thus making essentially all of those girls fall in love with him until he has his very own harem.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you\u2019ve probably heard that sort of plot premise many times before, and that\u2019s because there is nothing unique about this show\u2019s plot what so ever. Even the supernatural thing has been done before. It\u2019s quite simply a show about a boy helping girls with their problems one by one, a-la every visual novel ever made (even though this show is not based on a VN). There really isn\u2019t much to say about it except one thing: Holy shit is there dialogue. Now, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; lots of my favorite anime are considered dialogue heavy, but Bakemongatari is essentially \u201cDialogue: The Animation\u201d. Granted, it's usually very witty and well-written dialogue, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't lose interest on more than one occasion. I really enjoyed the action scenes because of how incredibly animated they are, but they were few and far between to say the least. You can count them on one hand. In short, this plot is just a bare-minimum narrative framework for the show to conduct comedic gags and show tons of fanservice all the while attempting to incorporate every otaku fetish ever conceived. Needless to say, the plot is NOT the reason to watch this show\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe real selling point for Bakemonogatari is the characters: They are praised to no end for their likeability and depth. The former I can get on board with. The latter, however, I must wholeheartedly refute. The cast of characters is simply shallow, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s debatable (I\u2019ve been told they receive more depth in later seasons, but for now, they are shallow). Senjogahara, everybody\u2019s obligatory \u201cbest girl\u201d, may be amusing with her witty remarks and constant insults, we never get to know who she really is as a person. The romance between her and Araragi has its moments, but it comes across as unrealistic and misguided more often than not. Araragi claims to love Senjogahara but... does he? It doesn't seem like it at all. She constantly berates him, constantly puts him in uncomfortable situations, and is clearly mentally unstable. Senjogahara\u2019s love feels very unreciprocated, making it quite difficult to empathize with their relationship. Speaking of that love, the show also doesn\u2019t bother to flesh out why Senjogahara loves Araragi in the first place. As the anime itself manages to point out, it seems like she's just a mentally unstable, lonely girl who would fall in love with anyone who showed her the slightest bit of kindness a-la Yuno Gasai. That person just so happened to be Araragi, making the entire relationship based upon coincidence rather than legitimate connection on a psychological and/or spiritual level. The question is simply this: Is the show making fun of these tropes, or merely utilizing them? Who knows, but in the end, it doesn't really seem to matter since nothing profound is ever actually discusses and no commentary is ever made. For that reason, I just can't get into them as a couple; I don't like the confusing and round-a-bout way that it was handled. The other characters don't receive any remarkable depth either. They come and go at random intervals in between episodes; uncomfortably blurring the line between minor and major character. Our protagonist, Araragi is the prototypical overly generous and generic harem lead, with the exception of his tendency to create situations with unfathomably sexual undertones (even more so than an average harem). Don't get me wrong, the characters are witty and entertaining; they had me laughing multiple times, but there is an obvious problem with depth. They are funny, but shallow and archetypical.\\n\\n\r\nI would be doing the show a disservice if I didn\u2019t mention the beautiful animation, which was easily the best part of the entire anime. Bakemonogatari\u2019s beautiful, experimental art style and orgasmic uses of shot composition and lighting are the real reason you should watch this show. Any fan of animation owes it to themselves to bask in the glory of this genius art direction. There are a FEW shots that don\u2019t really work, but as a whole, stupendous animation. The music was good as a tone setter, but a tad underwhelming as a whole with the exception of a single track: The ED; AKA my new favorite anime ED of all time. My god is it increadible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bakemonogatari consists entirely of witty humor and fanservice in a beautifully animated and surreal setting. It has lovable characters and great dialogue, but it seriously lacks depth and originality in the departments of plot and characters. The plot isn\u2019t memorable at all, and if the characters are memorable, it\u2019s for their humor and boobs rather than their motivations and complexity. While I totally understand why fans of harems consider this to be the pinnacle of anime, it\u2019s quite clear that Bakemonogatari is not worthy of that title. I think the show is worth watching, but don\u2019t let the ridiculous hype surrounding the series ruin it for you. Remember: At its core, this is just a harem.",

            "content": "It is very rare to see such a successful marriage of a director\u2019s vision and an author\u2019s material. Bakemonogatari\u2019s existence is an anomaly especially in present day where adaptations are subpar when compared to the source. However, there has never been a more potent combination than Nisio Isin and Studio SHAFT\u2019s Akiyuki Shinbou. Shinbou\u2019s quirky, and imaginative art direction greatly compliments the fast paced dialogue and witticisms that Nisio is known for. The end result is a tour de force of both visuals and prose. Bakemonogatari is a meticulously crafted tale that never ceases to maintain the viewer\u2019s attention and titillate the imagination.\r\nStory- Bakemonogatari isa broken into individual arcs, each focusing a certain character dealing with a supernatural \u201cOddity.\u201d There is an overarching plot that is delicately threaded throughout each arc. Every character is related to one another either directly or indirectly. Throughout each arc, we learn more about each girl and their specific affliction. In other shows, this would mean long, drawn out expository dialogue that lacks personality and charisma. However, Bakemonogatari is unlike other anime. Every interaction is interesting due to how well the visuals compliment the dialogue. Although the dialogue seems to meander from time to time, the interactions between characters are always at the very least entertaining. And through these seemingly meaningless conversations, we learn more about their personalities, motivations and personal beliefs. It is all done in a very subtle way so it may take some close attention to catch some of the nuances of the characterization. Bakemonogatari does not try to baby the viewer; it tells you only what you need to know and lets your imagination fill in the gaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of writing remains consistent throughout each arc but the show takes a bit of a downward spiral during the Nadeko Snake arc. Not that it is a bad arc as much as it is underwhelming. Sengoku Nadeko is easily the most uninteresting female in the cast. She is timid, shy and cute. She does not have any stand out traits or eccentricities like the other members of the cast. It seems her sole purpose in this arc is to appease fetishists due to her being placed in many compromising positions. She wears school swimsuits and her affliction is the most sexual in nature. The conclusion to this arc also leaves much to be desired but it is only a minor dip in the overall quality of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Studio SHAFT has become synonymous with eccentric art and whacky animation, and Bakemonogatari really benefits from SHAFT adapting it. It is a true visual spectacle, using a mixture of different art styles to make conversations much more interesting. Most scenes are vibrant and full of color and unusual geometric shapes which breathe life into the show. It also uses an interesting blend of typography and simple black and white scenes that really support the tone of the conversations. You could argue that Bakemonogatari\u2019s success is due to the visuals. It truly is a feast for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Bakemonogatari features of one of the most intriguing cast of characters I have had the pleasure to watch. However, the crowning achievement of the show has to be Hitagi Senjougahara, the protagonist Araragi\u2019s girlfriend. She is cruel and cynical and never ceases to make Araragi her whipping boy. But that is all a part of her indelible charm. Past her ice cold exterior, lays a really gooey and lovable center. Her change is gradual but very apparent by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n The relationship dynamic between Araragi and Senjougahara is simply a joy to behold. It is free of all usual issues that plague romantic anime: awkward confessions, a melodramatic backstory and a general lack of believability. The development of their relationship is set at a slow but realistic pace. Think of it as a flower in bloom, when it blossoms you can truly appreciate it in all its beauty. Throughout the course of the series, Senjougahara\u2019s presence makes itself known even she is not on screen. Araragi\u2019s relationship has actively changes his character and influences what decisions he makes. Each encounter also builds upon their relationship and builds an unspoken bond of trust and affection.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of females also serves to facilitate the development of Araragi\u2019s relationship with Senjougahara. While each arc deals with a specific heroine, it very subtly also tackles aspects and issues within any romantic relationship such as: miscommunication, jealously, and infidelity. Every obstacle they face reinforces the strength of their bond.  \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are not only mere catalysts for the development of Araragi and Senjougahara, but they stand strong by themselves. The cast is comprised of the usual harem archetypes: the little sister, the class representative, the loli, and the energetic girl but they are given distinguishable traits that separate them from any other character. For example, take Kanbaru Suruga. Although she falls into the energetic girl archetype, she completely betrays our expectations of what that character should be like. She is not only athletic, but she freely embraces her sexuality by making jokes about it and making advances towards Araragi if only in jest. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a tour de force of visual storytelling. It represents the best of the medium as it completely defies all storytelling conventions of anime. It is wordy but never ceases to captivate the viewer with its beautiful imagery and wit. Bakemonogatari popularity and acclaim is well deserved as it will likely linger in your mind, whether you liked it or not, for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "Author's note: Please don't take this review too seriously. This is merely describing my own painful experience with this show. I'm not personally attacking Monogatari fans! Thank you.\r\nOverview:\r\nBakemonogatari is generally hailed as a masterpiece for being bold, innovative, challenging, and overall an unforgettably unique experience. While all of these things are certainly true, it is only a partial truth. Those above listed traits would all describe Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi, but Bakemonogatari is QUITE different from those series. Tatami's philosophy, comedy, and characters can transcend the language boundary. This is also true for Mushishi with its amazing visuals and atmosphere. Bakemonogatari though, is a seriesin which full mastery of the Japanese language is an absolute necessity. It feels that roughly 90% of Bakemonogatari's value and 100% of it's enjoyment is based on clever prose and wordplay that doesn't translate outside of Japanese. There is a reason this series will NEVER be dubbed. I feel that  Bakemonogatari lovers can be neatly divided into 2 categories: those fluent in Japanese and fucking liars!\\n\\n\r\nLanguage and translation:\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why novels have widespread appeal outside of their countries of origin and poetry typically doesn't? People aren't kidding when they say things get \"lost in translation\". Prose that is immensely intricate in its original form will often get butchered into something clunky and brutal. The English speaking world fell in love with Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through the translations of Constance Garnett, who is considered by some to have been a sub-par translator that eviscerated the original Russian. It didn't matter because the characters, themes, psychology, etc was able to shine through. Even if it kind of sounded crappy and had awkward sentences. The poetry of Alexander Pushkin though has never really found fanfare outside of Russia. While we can certainly appreciate his brilliant narrative poems like The Bronze Horseman and at least partially appreciate Evgeny Onegin, we non-Russian speakers can't seem to really understand his prose and just what makes it so \"good\" to Russian ears. Similarly, Bakemonogatari to a non-Japanese speaker like me has all the appeal of listening to Igbo or Yoruba poetry while nodding my head and pretending to understand because I want to be smart. \\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters\\n\\n\r\nA bland male character finds girls with supernatural problems and solves them. Lets be honest. You are NOT watching this for the plot. Would you watch a performance of Love's Labour's Lost for the plot? NO! You watch it for the prose! Or if you're being perfectly honest, you watch it because your girlfriend dragged you to the Shakespeare festival and you want to get laid. At least we all know Costard is awesome. Senjougahara is an obnoxious bitch. Yes, she is a self aware, meta character that plays around with classic tsundere tropes. I get it. She's still an obnoxious bitch. \"i'm like that magical dragon from that one anime. I can grant you any wish you want. I can wake you up naked or perhaps if you are a pervert you could give me an enema!\" In the original Japanese this was undoubtedly a biting, crude, but clever comment because the Kanji for \"enema\" resembles the Hirigana for another word in that sentence. In English, you are just left scratching your head. She mentions that adding another \"Ra\" to Araragi makes it rather lewd, but once again I can't understand. She got some interesting character development in episode 2, but mostly I'm just frustrated by the characters and left in a state of total non-comprehension...like I am with most aspects of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very unique and the animation is top notch here form Studio Shaft. The series experiments with wild camera angles and often looks stunning...when it isn't straining your eyes. It also has a real habit of flashing to black and displaying random text before flashing back. Personally I found it (flash) \"Tedious\" (flash) \"contrived\" and (flash) \"pretentious\". Of course that's just me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give Bakemonogatari a decent score based on its art and ambition. However, I am incapable of rendering a truly valid judgement because I don't speak Japanese. Imagine a native Telugu speaker with no knowledge of the German language. That person couldn't appropriately judge the poetry of Heinrich Heine. I find myself in the same position. I can't say this is a bad series. I can't say it's a good series. I don't feel I'm qualified to say much of anything in regards to its merit. I wrote this review for one simple purpose. Don't make the mistake that I did and go in expecting to love this series because its popular with the elite crowd. If you don't speak Japanese, avoid this one like the plague!",

            "content": "Finally giving in to the hype, I picked up Bakemonogatari, the most discussed anime of '09, on the very first day of this year. The show's appeal was lost on me during the first few episodes, but after a while the reasons for this anime's charm on so many became apparent. As to whether that charm worked on me as well, that's something I'm going to explain a bit more thoroughly further on.\r\nThe story of Bakemonogatari may at first seem confusing with the odd events of the show's beginning. Soon, however, the plot's structure comes clear enough as new characters (all female) are introduced, witheach of them having their own arc consisting of a few episodes at a time. Amidst the weirdness of Bakemonogatari's characters, artwork and animation, a simple storyline like that is a welcome asset. Of course, on the occasion you're not one to enjoy a storyline based on  a few episode-arcs, it'll be exactly the other way around for you.\\n\\n\r\nDespite each story arc concentrating on a new character each time, the story of our main couple, Araragi and Senjougahara, flows along nicely as well. The relationship between the two is somewhat the core of the entire show, with the story-arcs functioning either as a means to deepen their chemistry as they go about solving the encountered mysteries together, introduce new characters, or bring more depth to our main hero, Araragi. This I have no qualms of, for I quite like the way a clearly harem-esque series has the most prominent love interest set in stone instead of the guy tinkering on edge until the very end about who it is that he loves.\\n\\n\r\nBe not completely turned off yet, all you who despise everything which has the word \"harem\" attached to it, for even though I dubbed Monstory as \"a clearly harem-esque series\", this show isn't an average one in that category in the least. Yes, it's yet again a series where a single guy is surrounded by attractive females (sans the loli character), and yes, all of them are expressing more or less of an interest in him. But they're not brainlessly-unconditionally-helplessly or otherwise idiotically in love in him, nope. In fact some, if not most of them are having open and cheeky banters with him _AND_, unlike in most of your typical harems, the guy isn't actually an utter retard with no redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to what I believe is commonly praised as Bakemonogatari's greatest strength, which namely is the wonderfully wicked and excellent character chemistry. As I stated before the characters actually have more intricate interaction between them than your usual scenario of a bunch of chicks loving on an idiot with an attraction level somewhere around -9000. The verbal battles between Araragi and co. (and especially with Senjougahara) are indeed the shows most prominent and refreshing aspect.\\n\\n\r\nBut whereas \"a bunch of chicks loving on an idiot\" can be seen as one frustrating extreme of character interaction, at times I felt as though Bakemonogatari presented a polar opposite no less frustrating. All too often it seemed like the heavy dialogue was there just to accentuate the girls' excellency over Araragi as the poor fellow always appeared to get the short end of the stick in their interactions. A feature meant to be humorous for sure, and I do remember smiling at times, but I certainly wasn't as entertained as I guessed I should've been.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fracture burdening on the show's enjoyability is the usage of still-images with text which I suppose were there to support the story. I can't remember if there was a single episode where there wouldn't have been a series of stills flashing on the screen so fast it was impossible to read the sentences on them without stopping your media player to read them. You can guess if I myself cared much for doing so. A hint: I didn't. Surely I didn't miss anything of importance when I opted to roll my eyes in annoyance instead of stopping to read each time when a still featuring either a sentence or a meaningless word like \"red\" or \"black\" appeared on the screen, but it certainly didn't add to my viewing pleasure either.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it from me this time, really. Other factors you'd usually pay attention to while watching, like the music and art, fell into the vast category of \"alright\". The theme songs let alone the rest of the soundtrack left no impression on me whatsoever, and just like everybody else, I did notice the artstyle in this show was a bit funny at times. Surely nothing which folks familiar with Gankutsuou, Zetsubou-sensei, and SHAFT in general can't handle. Characterization, relationships, and intriguing story are the plusses, somewhat questionable humour and stupid stills the minuses. Sounds like yer cup of tea? Then drink up. It doesn't? Then go look for another one - but not before sampling this.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is your typical harem Anime that adds nothing less and nothing more to the medium of Anime. It is a show that has been done before and is still being done after it\u2019s release. It is a show that is praised often by the community for God knows why and for whatever reasons, but I honestly found it to be unoriginal and uninspired in everything it did and presented. Bakemonogatari is basically an Anime that is filled to the brim with ecchi and sexually stimulating scenes to increase it\u2019s sales to whoever buys it (you know them horny kids finna have a blast tothis boy), a boring plot which became predictable at around episode six, a stereotypical cast of characters that has been done so many times before, no explanations as to what the heck is happening in the damn show, and some of the stupidest visuals I have ever come across. This is what people are calling \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d now\u2026 noice\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so let us just get the easiest one out of the way real quick. The characters. The characters in this Anime are terrible, because they have all been done before, so many times too. Listen, you can do stereotypical characters right, you can turn a character that has been done a trillion times before into a three dimensional character just by executing them properly and developing them. Does Bakemonogatari do this? No. The characters in Bakemonogatari are basically unoriginal stereotypes with little to no character depth or development whatsoever, and they feel like cardboard cutouts of other done before characters. First off, you have your badass, emotionless, abusive tsundere lead girl. This girl likes to abuse the main character and threaten his life for the stupidest of reasons. After all is said and done, she suddenly confesses that she loves the main character because she felt lonely and he saved her because he has a big heart. This is the epitome of the unoriginal  tsundere character. Her character is so annoying, not only because I rarely like this type of character, but because she always keeps on saying Araragi\u2019s name all the time. Every. Damn. Sentence. It gets extremely annoying after a while, having to hear \u201cAraragi-kun\u201d being the ending statement after every sentence she speaks. Then you have your main character, no personality or depth, no nothing. Did I mention that he has two sisters? The Anime never develops any of them, they are just there so that Neroragi-kun can talk to a loli girl. They are not even one dimensional, just an excuse to advance the nonsensical plot forward. So this guy is basically a one dimensional pervert who\u2019s only traits are being a vampire and saving girls, all of which start flocking to him after he saves that tsundere girl whose name I can\u2019t pronounce (Didn\u2019t I tell you it becomes predictable?). Of course, his parents are never shown or known, we get glimpses about his relationship with his mom, but that\u2019s about it. Then you have your typical loli who appears for the sake of the plot, and does not appear for the rest of the Anime, until the plot needs her again that is. Her only purpose is to be a plot device. Same story with characters like Hanekawa and annoying tsundere girl, whom I like to call fan-service #1 and fan-service #2, because they only appear for plot convenience and fan-service. After some of the girls\u2019 backstories are revealed, the Anime does not bother giving the characters more growth or development. Rather, it presents their backstories and glosses over them like they were never there to begin with (loli girl, sport loving lesbian girl, snake girl). These characters appear out of nowhere with little to no explanation, or for the most lazy reasons ever, and get no development. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Bakemonogatari has bland, unoriginal characters and a bad, boring plot. It tries to shroud itself in some supernatural mystery, but the only mystery I found in this Anime was the question of whether or not I was going to be able to finish it without facepalming my face through a brick wall. \\n\\n\r\nNow let us talk about the visuals. Basically, this Anime is one of the weirdest looking Anime I have ever seen, if not the weirdest looking. It has weird faces, different camera angles on characters\u2019 faces, those very stupid head tilts the characters do with their stupid grins, the eye zoom ins, the realistic images, etc. It also likes to change the art style of the Anime for some odd reason, an example of this is placing real eyes on Araragi\u2019s face during a certain scene where his eyes were going to be harmed by a knife, which I found to be distracting from the scene rather than it being a cool visual. Some viewers may find this change cool, while others may find it unnecessarily stupid, I stand firmly with the latter. My guess for all of this is that they were trying to save money, all while trying to look \u201chip and cool\u201d for the kids. This would have actually been cool to see, if the Anime used it once every five or ten episodes. Rather, I saw this being used in almost every episode, so it became stale and boring. I also like how the Anime shamelessly reuses scenes seconds later after originally using them (An example of this would be in episode 9, Hanekawa does the same stupid grin and hand movement when she is talking to Araragi in the library). So you can tell this Anime has no heart or soul poured into it, it\u2019s cheap. \\n\\n\r\nThe intro card of the show has to be the most annoying, infuriating thing I have ever seen. No, I am not talking about the openings, those were mediocre at best and did not generate any emotion from me. The intro card that plays after the opening has been proven by scientists to not only give you seizures, but also give you Cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, brain damage, heart palpitations, Alzheimer\u2019s, blindness, baldness and multiple strokes. I was tilting my laptop to the side every time that intro card came on, my eyes were begging me to stop looking at the horror. You know you need to change your intro card when half of your viewers are dying because of it. By the time I arrived at episode 13, I had already gone blind from that intro, thank you Bakemonogatari!  \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the lame jokes. The jokes can be summed up as meta jokes that are there to be there. They are there just to break the fourth wall and nothing else. Tsundere girl mentioning the term tsundere is not funny, nor is it executed properly so that it can make me burst out laughing. The characters also like to mention Doraemon for some odd reason, which I found to be unfunny and pointless. I remember Lord Beerus making a meta joke about Anime during the first episodes of Dragon Ball Super, and it was funny and witty. Maybe the fact that I was a naive fifteen year old kid at the time made me laugh at that joke? Or maybe Bakemonogatari does not know how to do jokes? I don\u2019t know. You answer me, because Bakemonogatari is the type of show to have it\u2019s main characters make jokes about looking at a girl\u2019s body, even when the girl had been abused in some way and the scene is supposed to be serious. Top notch \u201cComedy\u201d right here. \\n\\n\r\nThe Anime also does not know how to execute it\u2019s arcs properly. You will have an action arc first, and then you will be interrupted by a romantic episode in the middle, as if nothing had happened and we are supposed to just forget about it. Personally I really disliked the fact that episode 12 was thrown right in the middle of Tsubasa's arc, which was supposed to be an important arc. It's not that I didn't like the episode or don't like Gahara (She\u2019s ok I guess) but it just felt wrong and for lack of a better word, annoying. It was so oddly placed and the fact that all of my attention had already been strongly towards Tsubasa's arc, having this happen right in the midst of it all kind of threw me off and as a result, I wasn't invested in it as much. I wasn't captivated, nor did I actually think there was anything particularly special about the episode, though it is a decent episode, it just felt like a random bit that was thrown in. While it was a pretty looking episode and a decent one, I just did not find myself caring as much as others in regards to the whole Gahara laying her heart on her sleeve part.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari also likes to copy other stories like The Monkey\u2019s Paw, a brilliant short story written by W.W. Jacobs. The fans will probably look at this and say \u201cAha Bakemongatari is referencing another story as always, brilliant reference!\u201d But it wasn\u2019t brilliant in any way. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the final part of why I dislike this Anime. Nothing in this Anime is explained, and if it is, then it is explained very poorly. The vampires\u2019 existence, why a vampire attacked Arararagi, why these mysterious Gods keep appearing and disappearing. Why does this happen? The Anime gives no answers whatsoever other than a brief explanation of what they are, but nothing else. I know that this has God knows how many more seasons, and maybe, just maybe, they get answered later on, but I don\u2019t think I can sit through more of this to be honest. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is based on a series of light novels by Nisio Isin, and is later produced by Shaft. It features different short stories all related to the main character, Araragi Koyomi. Bakemonogatari is now known for its superb art and animation, and the unique way the story was presented to us. Adding to that, Bakemonogatari surprised many due to its weekly ranking sales and how well it sold across Japan. This was clearly evident in the field of BD sales, where it made history, selling 29,000 units of Bakemonogatari Vol.1, beating out the previous record holder of Macross Frontier, which sold at 22,000 units. Italso took first place in DVD sales in Oct 26 - Nov 11, beating other titles such as Gintama, Haruhi and Eden of the East. Volume 3 of Bakemonogatari also sold a lot, getting 1st place again in terms of DVD and Blu Ray sales, the margin between 1st place and 2nd place (Detective Conan Movie) being around 5 million. Volume 4 will be delayed a little while and will be released in January 27th, hoping to take the title of 1st place again.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear at why Bakemonogatari sold so well over the time. Bakemono is a collection of short stories, all with their unique characteristics and aspects that makes a show great. It showcased different supernatural cases such as the Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail and Tsubasa Cat. Plotwise, Bakemono surely delivered and made it an entertaining show to watch. These different stories usually panned out in 3-4 episodes, where we see some character development and background story on some of the characters. Although each story shows a different heroine, one can still say that these stories are connected together, and this becomes evident in the later stages of the light novel, which has yet to be animated. The stories are engaging, and keeps the viewers interested with new materials to showcase each time. This allows endless opportunities for OVAs and even a second season due to its numerous heroines with each a unique background and even later chapters in the light novels which have yet to be shown in the animated version.\\n\\n\r\nAs already stated before, Bakemonogatari has its fair share of characters. Although 4 heroines is typical in a generic romantic comedy show, Bakemonogatari is somewhat different, as each heroine has their own story that can be deeply developed and shown more insight to in the future. The characters are well thought out, and what makes the show shine is their mindless rantings and they way they interact. Hitagi, being the central heroine of the show is aware of her \"tsundere\" status and is possessed by a crab who takes all of her weight. Then, we have a loli girl who gets her \"first touch\" taken away by Koyomi, and has entertaining fight sequences with Koyomi. Not only that, we have a smart and well mannered girl who you would consider as the clumsy one in all anime. However, she is anything but ordinary, and has a completely different persona which is because of a cat! These characters are a unique touch and strives to break out of the ordinary. Bakemonogatari offers us a distinct range of characters that are all unique in its own way, and tries to enhance the show even more with the interactions between the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is definitely a true highlight due to its plot and characters, but it doesn't stop there. Bakemono offers us a unique art style and animation that is just as good as its story and cast. From the moment it started, Bakemono offered us a visual treat unlike any other, and the use of lighting and colours truly brought the world of Bakemonogatari to life. The art is high quality, and the characters are drawn exceptionally well. the background is unique and uses different techniques that you don't see in a regular anime. The fight scenes are also choreographed really well, and the animation is smooth. I mean, what more is there to not like? I was absolutely blown away by Shaft's effort in the new art direction it gave us and it certainly created a visual masterpiece. It was consistent all throughout the entire season, and although some may say that the Nadeko arc was a bit rough on the edges, it didn't mind me at all. Overall, the art and animation of Bakemono was another highlight to the series, and is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari also offered us different new openings for each heroine. My favourite would probably be Nadeko's and Hachikugi's openings as they were upbeat, and the animation sequence it provided was spectacular. The musical score of Bakemono were great too, and each track was done well. The seiyuu's did a good job too, especially Chiwa Saito as the voice of Senjougahara Hitagi.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is by far one of the best animes I have ever seen. Combined with a great plot and entertaining characters, every minute was truly enjoyable. It didn't stop there, as it also presented a visually stunning work, filled with vibrant colours and the animation being generally smooth. The different openings were great, and were always a blast to listen to. Bakemonogatari is definitely something you should watch - and make sure to download it in the highest quality possible to truly enjoy this new anime by SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\nGrade\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A+\\n\\n\r\nStory: A+\\n\r\nCharacter: A+\\n\r\nArt: A+\\n\r\nAnimation: A+\\n\r\nSound: A+\\n\\n\r\nPros: A great story and overall entertaining to watch. The characters were all unique in their own way and the character interactions were nice. The art and animation was absolutely spectacular; a visual masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCons: You are not watching it right this second.\\n",

            "content": "'People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save anyone else'\r\n- Araragi Koyomi\r\nTo begin this review, I shall say that while there were always disagreements whether a certain show was good or not, no series was ever able to split the community like the Monogatari series does. And there will always be the ones saying that it is the best of the best in the anime world, and the ones that will see it as just a pretentious over-the top harem show. Now, before you cast of my review thinking that I'm just going to praise the show, I'll have to ask you tostay until the end, since I started this anime just so I could drop it because, I too, thought that it was just a philosophy for horny weebs. Let me show you what made me change my mind. I'll try my best to keep the review spoiler-free for all the people who haven't yet seen the show.\\n\\n\r\nLets begin with what I think is the reason Bakemonogatari excels more than most of the anime you'll run into: the characters. Now, if you ask any qwasy-elitist about the Bakemonogatari characters, he/she will probably tell you that the characters fall very well into the defined tropes of the anime: unassuming/confused lead protagonist, a female tsundere lead constantly insulting the MC, a bratty loli, a shy and innocent imouto trope, and so on. And on the surface, they are right. But as each of the  characters develop, they restrain themselves of these labels to the point that it almost reaches the deconstruction of the certain anime character tropes. And what Bakemonogatari does so good, is the connection it constantly makes by bonding the story with the characters, making them equally progress.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to further explain the characters, I will base myself on the actual story. Bakemonogatari follows a 18 years-old Araragi Koyomi, who is 1/10 vampire, as he encounters various number of girls. Each of them comes with their own unique story, and a complete arc primary focusing on one specific character. Each of the characters is followed by an apparition (supernatural being) AKA aberration (unusual, unwelcome entity). They are phenomenons of supernatural nature, in which a person is involved, both as a cause and a victim. To be precise, apparitions are the supernatural creations of ones own mind, possessing the host. The story mainly focuses Araragi, with a help of Oshino Meme, the balancer, attempting to help and save those who suffer from such spiritual illness. But then why did I choose that specific quote to begin my review if it now seems incorrect?\\n\r\nAnd so we come across with what makes Bakemonogatari one of the best shows of all time: it is a metaphorical battle with one's own inner self. Each of the apparitions is carefully presented as a specific animal or a monster symbolizing the ones problem. And it is no coincidence that it turns out that each of the monsters turned out to be projected by humans. Or rather, they all seem to resemble the problems of one's own personality, the parts they try to deny and hide from the others by burying them deep inside, and metaphorically constructing a false reality and projecting them into a harsh enemy: a soul-sucking demons, apparitions.  And so the only way to solve the problem is to confront them as what they truly are. the show smartly illustrates the struggle it takes to overcome your own inner pain. And no, that's not pretentious. You need to learn to separate the edginess from the actual depth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to explain that, lets move on to the various elements that make the series work, and how they interact. So, storytelling. Through each well-defined arc, we slowly dig deeper into the character, ripping apart the trope, and revealing what lies beneath. This compelling introspection of the characters is what drives the story. Even tho the show contains some nice well-combined comedy and few action sequences, it primarily revolves around dialogues. A well-packed, meaningful and thought-provoking dialogue, with various use. Whether it is used to serve some good laughs, develop the character or advance the plot, conversation is never there just to fill the 23-minutes of free space, which is expected from the Godlike-writer NisioisiN, who's wordplay transcends beyond just a simple rebuses.\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't just end there. The visual aspect in Bakemonogatari isn't just there for the aesthetic value. Director Tatsuya Oishi takes the whole media into his advantage, making surrealistic and abstractly symbolic visual storytelling. Using the first-person perspective through Araragi's narration, his world remains without the people he has no interest in, whether it'd be an empty street in the middle of the day, or an empty classroom. Every camera angle is focused primarily on what he is interesting in and what he wants us to see, or pay attention to. Otherwise, there is a fantastically fluent animation, incredible use of colors and a regular SHAFT's head tilt. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is there just to keep things alive. It never fails to bring a character motion to life and to project the certain emotion, whether it is making you be at the edge of your sit with eyes wide open as the mystery gets unraveled, or it is making your heart break apart from the sadness of the moment. Boosted with various number of melodies and instruments in soundtrack, the enjoyment is guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude:\\n\r\nPersonally, this show has in itself everything I ever wanted an anime to have. Philosophy, abstract symbolism, depth, fast pacing, interesting and well-written characters, emotional and slightly tearjerking elements, creativity and innovation, and a weird, but unique way of storytelling. All together, an anime that everyone should see, but not everyone will like. It is not a story that will destroy your brain with lots of mindfucks, nor is it one that will ask you questions and make you wonder about the answer. This is not a show that knows everything, but it knows what it knows. It will tell you everything it can and it has the knowledge to.\\n\r\nBut what you will do with it \\n\r\nis up to you.",

I prefer action and suspense and Bakemonogatari did not invoke any feeling in me.\r\nI simply clicked an episode and as soon as it started my mind would wander due to sheer boredom.\r\nThe story was very poor to me, I didn't know what was going on 99% of the time and there are a lot of pointless scenes (fanservice included, I guess). They repeatedly jumped around scenes and there was some skipping here and there... Not that I really cared.\r\nThe art was alright. It wasfine to look at, but wasn't great or \"different\" or anything. You could say the random shots of random things are creative, but they were nuances to me and weren't particularly thought-provoking. They were just random and just, well... There.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, I could bear. It wasn't inspiring and didn't enhance the scenes for me. Sometimes the sound didn't match with scenes. Very confusing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was poor. The characters seemed very one-dimensional. Plastic. I found myself asking the screen \"really...?\" as I watched this series.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely did not enjoy this. At all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give BAKEMONOGATARI a 4.\\n\\n\r\nIt came out to 3.4 on my calculator but I will give it some credit to trying.\\n\\n\r\nTrying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nTo be serious, if you want to watch something to get your heart hammering then\\n\r\nI do not recommend this series!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE, SORRY IF I WRITE SOMETHING WRONG\r\nSpoilers! (kinda)\r\n\u2727 Introduction/the story\r\nBakemonogatari, A story of a guy that casually meets different types of girls throughout the episodes. Coincidentally, all of those girls are possessed by a curse that resembles an animal.\r\n\u2727 The characters\r\nThe protagonist is a guy that wants to help every single girl he meets, even if he met her only 5 minutes ago, just like your typical self-insert protagonist. Like a male lead in every harem out there he is bland, boring, and doesn't know what to do with his life.\r\nThe story just introduces female characters that are all veryarchetypal, but they want to \"hide\" this fact through the pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Most of the time, their role is diminished to flirting with the protagonist, adding nothing to the typical formula.\\n\\n\r\nI might add that the \"jokes\" between the protagonist and the little girl, Mayoi, are very disgusting and uncomfortable. I'm not going to describe all of the girls because they are forgettable due to their lack of charisma and originality. You can describe them in one sentence, except for the protagonist's girlfriend, Senjougahara. She's kind of memorable thanks to her attitude towards the protagonist and because she has the most screen time out of all the females. But she is not an important character after all.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The script\\n\r\nUnless the dialogue is made with a bit of effort, it feels pretentious and unrealistic. It's not intellectual, it's not deep, it only tries to make you think that they are saying something smart, but if you analyze it properly, it makes no sense at all and most of the time it doesn't add anything to what's going on. This is just an attempt to \"not to be like the other harems with empty dialogue and bland characters\", but it ends up being almost the same at the end. Why? I'm going to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided in mini-arcs in which the protagonist meets and interacts with every cursed girl, conveniently, every girl ends up having a \"crush\" on the protagonist, so the show becomes a harem really fast, but there is no plot, there is no sense of progression, there is not a specific goal that would drive the plot. \\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Production values\\n\r\nThe art is amazing and very versatile, but most of the time it feels like an ornament more than an element that would complement the actual story. Sometimes the art has nothing to do with the story or the characters at all. This, plus the dialogue, which is not as smart as everyone says, are the most recognizable elements about this anime, and that's why it's loved so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are very good, they fit the characteres very well. The music is not that memorable and sometimes it feels repetitive, but it's apreciated how they made one opening for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi shots sometimes feel completely out of place, ruining the atmosphere, and the same goes for the jokes. One moment they are trying to sound smart (and failing miserably) and after two seconds the conversation changes its focus to panties or \"touches\". This all happens without a proper transition and I can't take what they are saying seriously because the fast change in tone overwhelmes me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Conclusion\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is try-hard slice of life harem that wasted all its potential to be meaningfully different by staying in its comfort zone and the show ended up being mediocre.",

            "content": "SHAFT's chaotic experiment is certainly a welcome break in creativity for the industry, and Bakemonogatari has all the right elements to make for a great anime: a promising premise, great character design and a shot of insanity. Yet here is a great example of how deliberate attention to detail can cause directors to miss the mark entirely, resulting in a bigger picture that revels blindly in its mediocrity.\r\nThere isn't much of a story. Episodic in nature, Bakemonogatari is driven by an almost Japanese-folklore perspective on loneliness and loss layered beneath the tone of this generation's rebellious youth. Sounds clever enough, but the not-so-subtle hentai subtextcheapens any semblance of artistic endeavor. Perhaps it was a failed experiment at integrating pop-culture critique within its chaotic fabric, but my guess would lean towards a pathetic attempt to draw a larger audience.\\n\\n\r\nBut, well, critics are really going crazy for the art, so I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised. Only to be let down. Hard. Like the unmethodical and distracted camera angles, the artistic choices were made with the most pompous cries for attention. The still-scenes flicker in an epilepsy-inducing fashion, while the gorgeously rendered characters and back drop were drowned in the quickness of the scene-changes and flashes of blank screen with (unreadable) text. Moments that are meant to be mulled over pass too quickly while the more exciting scenes seem to linger with pure apathy. It's almost as if director Akiyuki Shinbo's job stopped pre-cutting-room-floor, leaving the series a chaotic mess with miserable pacing and an unspectacular storyline.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about its fall from grace. Bakemonogatari may still be one of the best series the industry successfully produced in 2009. What SHAFT does well is create a highly entertaining series whose shiny surface can cover its internal flaws. The eclectic feel is enough to draw an audience, while the screenplay and writing remains surprisingly mature despite its rather unfocused story. And while certainly flawed, the artistic expression still garners appreciation for its bold step out of the ordinary. If you are a SHAFT fan, this title is unlikely to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "Story\r\nIn total the anime is divided into 5 arcs (separate and independent stories). In each arc, the main character meets new girls, and helps them to solve their problems with \"monsters\". Thus problems are solved in various ways, they never repeat and therefore the feeling of secondariness doesn't arise.\r\nAt the same time it is possible to see other storylines in the background: Koyomi's relations and Hitagi I consider that it's not a bad move to let the main plot run parallel with the love storyline. Though, I think that it would be possible to develop their relationship more clearly. All of this with great battlesunderway, but more on that later.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nIn most of the cases, animation in Bakemonogatari, serves as an addition to dialogues between the main characters, and that certainly benefits the very anime all the more.\\n\r\nThe picture in an anime is quite unusual - for it studio Shaft should be credited.  The majority of the backgrounds in the anime is rather abstract.  Although it is strange, such an abstraction goes very well with Bakemonogatari - probably because of the type of narration, which is chosen by its creators. The background doesn't distract from the subject line and all attention is engrossed by characters.  And it\u2019s with background that made in some striking colours. Not bad. Everything happening behind the characters is quite chaotic, but it starts to be pleasant to the third episode. \\n\r\nEven continuous flashing of various inscriptions and numbers doesn't prevent from watching this anime but only gives it charm. \\n\r\nCharacters are traced perfectly. And they look good against the background. It should be noted  that characters sometimes appear in strange poses and from some freakish point of view. It only admires the viewer. Dialogues are filled with additional inserts, because of it listening to the dialogue won't bore and there are no wish to turn away even for a second. There is everything that possible. Both bloody scenes and scenes with smart fanservice, and paranormal effects which bewitch the viewer. Fights also look very showily and colourfully. They are dynamic and realistic. Magnificent animation deserves an appreciation.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic plays very important role in the anime. Kosaki Satoru put a lot of effort into creating a huge number of \"small masterpieces\" which are wonderful and catchy. Special charm to culmination points of the anime is given by different variations on the main music themes. \\n\r\nEach opening (there are five of them) corresponds to each heroine\u2019s character.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters - one of the greatest strengths of this creation. All heroes of an anime turned out unique and special. Each character has characters which aren't similar at each other and, of course, each of them they correspond their own special habits and qualities. Founders collected almost all characters existing in an anime in this anime. Each hero is thought over ideally. The main characters should be loved : )\\n\r\nSeiyuus of characters are picked up ideally. They very precisely demonstrate characters as a hero, which forces you to fall in love with them even more. The actor's voice perfectly fits into the atmosphere of an anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMagnificent anime. I would tell anyone that it is a masterpiece. It's a magnificent animation, with a fascinating plot and dialogues filled with sense. I received a sea of pleasure from watching it. Bakemonogatari is an anime in an unusual format. I advise all fans the supernatural and the unusual to watch this anime. This anime really intrigues.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I'm sorry, if there are mistakes in the text. I'm not very good english ^^",

            "content": "Shaft is a studio well known for their weird experimental style, seemingly endless stream of anime in-jokes, and plentiful fan-service. Needless to say their work is an acquired taste and can be hit-or-miss. While this certainly applies to Bakemonogatari, it uses Shaft's signature style very well. Incredibly weird, and at times intentionally obtuse, yet undeniably intriguing and charming (albeit in its own weird way). This is easily one of the studio's best efforts.\r\nThe show follows high school student and former vampire (it's complicated), Koyomi Araragi, through a string of bizarre supernatural happenings. Each happening is centered around an individual (all girls, of course) whom somehowhas become involved in the supernatural, and stumble upon our protagonist, who by nature feels the need to aid them. The show is divided into five arcs, each intriguing and creative on their own right, which are loosely tied to each other into a well thought out whole.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might sound like the show is formulaic, but rest assured, the show's unhinged creativity always keeps things interesting. Every minute feels fresh and engaging, even when a single conversation takes majority of an episode... which happens quite often.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really quite astonishing just how entertaining it is to hearing the characters banter amongst each other. Araragi is a winsome oddball with a healthy amount of snark, it is fun just to listen to him all on his lonesome, and it is even more fun to hear him play off the other characters. The insanely guarded and moody; self-proclaimed 'tsudere' Hitagi Senjougahara has a sharp tongue and a warped sense of humor. The fact that it is hard to tell when she is joking and when she is not makes her all the more interesting to watch. In contrast, the class rep Tsubasa playfully teases Araragi (and the audience). Every character has their own distinct way of talking, as well as their own reoccurring gags and catchphrases, which is exactly what makes their conversations so entertaining to listen to; add to that Shaft's usual cleaver word play and anime in-jokes.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is just as crafty with the supernatural as it is with its dialogue. The show has an uncanny way to tie the characters' issues with the weird supernatural circumstances that afflict them. Whether it is an inability to cope with reality, family problems, or jealousy; the personal problems of the characters are connected to the supernatural in cleaver, and sometimes surprising, ways. A lot is revealed about the characters through their interaction with the supernatural, fleshing out their already likable personalities. The class rep Tsubasa, in particular, gets great character development in the final arc; revealing insecurities hidden behind her playful demeanor. \\n\\n\r\nPossibly the most important factor to Bakemonogatari's success is the relationship between Araragi and Hitagi. Aside from being the focus of the show's opening arc, their developing relationship add continuity to the loosely connected vignettes. This prevents Bakemonogatari from degrading into a puddle of randomness  the way many of Shaft's works often do. Furthermore, their relationship gives the show a nice emotional core for the audience, and it is gratifying to see how their relationship progresses as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, this show has Studio Shaft written all over it. The minimalist and bizarre visual style is not unlike what the studio has done before, in fact it is kind of expected. This, however, does not mean it is any less entrancing to watch. The color scheme is constantly being played around with, and there is always something interesting to look at. The odd camera angles and quick editing fit the show's off-beat tone very well. Character designs are well detailed, especially concerning the girls' assets; and while the backgrounds are not the most stunning you will ever see, they give the show an appropriately surreal atmosphere. Like most works form this studio, the show does get a bit carried away with visual gimmickry, but does not ever get jarringly so. The sound design is splendid; it is very successful in setting the tone, and consistently impressive on its own right. The music itself is excellent; it is especially good at sustaining the mystery and mysticism that envelops the series, and does a great job in the more tense or funny moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith Bakemonogatari, Studio Shaft has crafted a very cleaver and highly effective supernatural romp. At the same time, retaining the off-kilter charm that the studio is so well known for. The show is equal parts deranged and heart-felt, creating an experience that feels unique despite the many similarities it has with other Shaft works. It does get too wrapped up in itself at times, but overall it is still a damn good watch.",

            "content": "There\u2019s some debate about whether or not Bakemonogatari (pr. bah-keh-moh-no-gah-tah-re) is an ecchi-harem. A mere six seconds into the first episode, one of the female leads is introduced with a panty shot, and several shots of panties, boobs, and butts are dispersed throughout the series. Aside from two other characters that appear in a few episodes, the main character, Araragi, is the only male, and he\u2019s usually surrounded by females who\u2019ve developed a fondness for him after he helped them in some way.\r\nIs it an ecchi? Most likely. Is it a harem? Probably. Regardless, what distinguishes this series from other ecchi and harem anime isthat this one could still be entertaining without the ecchi and harem elements. It\u2019s not an ecchi with some story, but a story with some ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari, the first adaptation of Isin Nisio's Monogatari novel series, can be summed up as an allegory of how problems grow beyond our control when we don't tend to them. In this story, unsolved problems transform into apparitions that can handicap, possess, and even attack people. This premise was likely inspired by the Buddhist \"\u0101sav\u0101\" concept, which is defined as an influence or mental bias that binds people to their desires and attachments. In this story, various types of mental biases are illustrated through the lives and interactions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was headed by veteran director and animator Akiyuki Shinbou, whose style has become synonymous with the Shaft animation studio. His distinctive use of lines, shadows, and off-centered shot compositions are in full effect here. There are some scenes that are likely just meant to look cool, but, generally, the visuals have purpose and avoid garishness. The visuals are specific, and help to establish tension, isolation, and other tones.\\n\\n\r\nThe true highlight of Bakemonogatari is the Tarantino-esque dialog written by Isin Nisio. When the characters converse, they\u2019re not simply saying things that\u2019ll move the plot forward. They\u2019re having in-depth conversations, free of restraints, that seamlessly transition between topics as conversations do in real life. However, that\u2019s not to imply that the characters take themselves seriously. It\u2019s quite the contrary. The characters often tease and challenge each other, and sometimes break through the fourth wall to make the viewer a part of an exchange.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series would be appreciated by most anime fans who enjoy sleek art, witty dialog, the supernatural, and don't mind some fanservice. If you decide to pick it up, I suggest watching it in the order that it was adapted: Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari: Kuro, Monogatari Series: Second Season, Hanamonogatari, Tsukimonogatari, Owarimonogatari, Kizumonogatari.",

            "content": "Winner of the 2009\u2019s popular vote for Best Anime of 2009 on Animereactor, Bakemonogatari is yet another anime that Shaft can add up to their collection. To make it short, Bakemonogatari is overrated.  Overrated in a sense that the animation style has nothing to brag about, the story isn\u2019t unique in any sense and that the characters aren\u2019t even special in the first place. However, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Bakemonogatari is still a very good anime to watch and it is among my favourites of 2009. \r\nBakemonogatari is structured with five story arcs, with the fifth one being aired solely online. Forthose who are Shaft followers you will see no difference in how the story is told in this anime. Just like most of their work, Bakemonogatari\u2019s story is driven by the dialogues rather than the action. This being said, Bakemonogatari dialogues, while they make most part of the story, aren\u2019t exactly telling the story itself. More of a casual discussion between two peoples, the plot is not given away for the purpose of being vomited to the viewer, but it rather flows with the casual talk that the show tends to offer. Now of course, there are some action scenes and fighting scenes in Bakemonogatari, but it is mostly used in a way to conclude an arc or for adding a bit of spice. I have to say that the story arcs aren\u2019t original and can be quite repetitive as it uses the same recipe for each of them. It is repetitive in a way that each story arcs starts the same way and pretty much end the same way as well. Of course, not being original and being repetitive is not a synonym for boring. Bakemonogatari always managed to interest me with each story arcs with its direction toward suspense and climax build up.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a problem with the story arcs and its character. Because the story arcs holds almost no connections toward each others, Bakemonogatari fails in term of characterisation and it always seems that the relation between Senjougahara and Araragi is stalled. Step aside the social and love relations, this series hold way more interest in the characters individually, and by that I mean Senjougahara. While Araragi is an interesting character, he\u2019s nothing different from any other male lead that Shaft use to have, and they all have the same voice actor of course. He may be fitting leading for this anime, but his lack of originality and the fact that he\u2019s just a Shaft preset doesn\u2019t make him a good character. On the other line, Senjougahara, to make it short, is the spotlight character of this show. While the anime tends to put her as a side character, being not so important except for the first arc, she is a woman that is very interesting for her sarcastic tonality and her way to lead everything. Now, there\u2019s nothing that support her characterisation very well and that I have to admit. It\u2019s more of her personality that makes her a good character. Bakemonogatari also has a strong set of side characters that really supports the show very well. These side characters are cool, fun to watch and entertaining, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond those points. Just like any side characters should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual is perhaps one of the most controversial in anime history. I\u2019ll say it, those red screens is not a form of art, it simply a form laziness and does not bring anything, except for pissing off the viewer big time. Now that I\u2019ve talked about those screens, let\u2019s look at the actual art. The visual is nothing original, as it is the same that Shaft uses in almost all of their anime. Bakemonogatari uses lots of pretty colors, high contrasts, typical chalkboards and many cut scenes that one would recognise as a Shaft work. However, the characters are very well made, unique and distinctive. And even though it\u2019s been made dozens of that, I actually never get tired of Shaft\u2019s fancy visual style and it actually compliments the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is on a whole new standard. In fact, it is absolutely amazing. Without no hesitation, Staple Stable became an instant opening favourite for me, and for the ending as well. Bakemonogatari also offers a new opening song for each story arcs that supports the soundtrack very well. The inner songs in the anime actually capture the moments and intensity perfectly. Voice actors are also top notch. Hiroshi might have been using the same kind of voice, but it\u2019s simply because it\u2019s the same kind of character. Chiwa Saito, who also sings the opening, is the highlight voice actress of this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Bakemonogatari has its reason for being overrated, because it is actually enjoyable and very good. Fans of Shaft will obviously love it, and for the others it might as well be a hit or miss.",

            "content": "\"To be blunt, I just enjoy talking to you... so I want to talk with you more.\"\r\n\"If our opinions clash, let's talk it over.\" (Dialogue from episode 5)\r\n'Bakemonogatari', cleverly translated as 'Ghostory' or 'Monstory', is about five not-so-normal girls that Araragi Koyomi, a vampire himself, encounters and attempt to save from oddities possessing them.\r\nCHARACTER:\r\nThe main characters of 'Bakemonogatari' are among the most unique and complex I have yet to encounter.\r\nHeroine Senjougahara Hitagi is a tsundere like half of all modern heroines in anime, but she is also \u300c\u30c9S\u300d, a sadist to an extreme degree, which is more common for side characters and rare for heroines.Our protagonist, as expected, is rather on the masochist side who takes constant verbal abuse from Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the couple extraordinary, is that Senjougahara is often boke while Araragi is tsukkomi. Traditional Japanese stand-up comedy consists of a duo: One takes the \"boke\" role who says something stupid while the \"tsukommi\" role points out the flaws in boke's argument, often with a violent slap in the head.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that's right. Boke is masochist by nature and often not very intelligent, while tsukommi is sadist by nature and often more observant.\\n\r\nThe leading couple in this series, on the other hand, take turns with the roles. It is particularly interesting when the sadist and intelligent Senjougahara purposefully take on the boke role and overwhelms tsukkomi. Such as making insulting statements that sound flawed, but when Araragi tries to make a comeback, he realizes what she said was true. Or Senjougahara makes a blatantly flawed statement just to hurt Araragi, and his comeback fall into deaf ears. And of course, plenty of intentional boke or tease spoken with so much authority that Araragi just gives up and let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nThe unlikely toggling of comedy roles were delivered extremely well, and this back and forth interaction between the leading couple is a key part of this show's appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining four main characters are not as complex as the leading couple, but they all have their own unique issues that drive the story,each with distinct personalities that made them memorable.\\n\r\nThere are 6 main characters in this series, and total of only 5 side/peripheral characters (Meme, Shinobu, two sisters, and Senjougahara's father) in the whole series. The limited character headcount made thorough character development possible despite being an arc-based series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nSimply put, half the show is about the romantic relationship between the Senjougahara and Araragi.\\n\r\nThe other half is about a constant argument between two values: The rational vs the idealistic, with Araragi as Mr. Nice Guy seeking happy end for everyone. Solution of supernatural oddities as the topic of the argument.\\n\\n\r\nHachikuji, Kanbaru, and Hanekawa's arcs developed the relationship of leading couple while offering new topics to the story.\\n\r\nThe only flaw in the story in my opinion, is that Sengoku's arc was pretty much by itself, and contributed very little to the whole series other than loli and moe fan service.\\n\r\nEach arc is an incident focusing on a different girl, but all the arcs combine to show a whole picture of Araragi and Senjougahara closing their personal distances.\\n\\n\r\n\"Bakemonogatari\" is essentially a verbal performance with visual support. Story is driven by back and forth debate on various issues.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWith verbal performance playing such a big role in this show, voice acting is taken to a whole new level in this series.\\n\r\nEvery characters' voices fit perfectly, and not only that, distinct tones and nuance of speech establish unique impressions for every single character. The characters speak so fast in this series with lots of tongue twisters, but the seiyuu cast had done a wonderful job in keeping up. I don't think it's an exaggeration to describe voice acting in this series as epic.\\n\\n\r\nMusic score in 'Bakemonogatari' has a generally consistent ambient feel to it with a nice flow. Other than intense music for action scenes, they don't particularly set the mood or enhance drama as what I usually consider to be strong BGM for anime, but the usually upbeat sounds in the background set the quick pace for dialogue, and make conversations all the more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nOP song \"Staple Stable\" is one of the best anime opening theme song by a seiyuu, ever. Really memorable tune accompanied by great vocal and lyric by meg rock was simply amazing.\\n\r\nThe other four OPs sang by seiyuu of each arc heroines were nowhere as impressive as \"Staple Stable\", but offers refreshment value to the OPs, and fits each character perfectly.\\n\r\nED song's lyric made little sense at first, but its meaning was unveiled in a conversation between the leading couple in a certain episode, and it turned out to very suitable for the series. The two Senjougahara theme songs (OP1, ED) were masterpieces.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAnimation in 'Bakemonogatari' mainly serve as a visual aid to the verbal performance, and it proved to be very effective.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals for the anime got somewhat of an \"art house film\" treatment. There were many abstract and surreal scenes, unconventional cuts, and intriguing camera angles that made the viewing experience very pleasant. It's the perfected form of SHAFT's signature style.\\n\r\nCharacter designs were attractive, and main characters had visually shown a wide range of emotion that further portrays the character's state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have with the animation is the use of photographs/videos of real-life imagery. At the risk of sounding like a super-otaku, I would say 3D images do not belong in the world of 2D.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs a fansubber and having seen thousands of hours of fan/professionally translated works, I can tell you that at least 10% of the meaning is lost in translation, no matter how well translated. In conversation/narration driven series filled with wordplay and metaphors, at least 20% of the meaning, therefore enjoyability, will inevitably be lost to non-Japanese speakers.\\n\r\nStill, 'Bakemonogatari' is a true masterpiece with experimental production that actually worked. Attention was paid to the tiniest details, and a story well-told. Truly amazing direction by Shinbou Akiyuki left us with so many memorable scenes, and this will definitely be a series to be remembered.\\n\\n\r\nThe 8-month wait for the final three episodes were excruciating, but the ending was so satisfying that it almost made it worth the absurd wait. Given the commercial success 'Bakemonogatari' has achieved, I will be hoping for the remaining novels in the series to be animated. Possibly 'Kizumonogatari' OVA/film and 'Nisemonogatari' as a sequel season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be blunt, I just enjoyed listening to them... so I want to listen to them more.\\n",

            "content": "For every medium, there are few masterpieces that transcend the genre and become something special.  Since I consider anime, as a genre, to be just as legitimate an art form (despite the bad rep it often gets), I will also review Bakemonogatari as a work of art, and it is irrefutably one of the special few anime series that fully capitalize on the strengths of the anime medium.\r\nSTORY\r\nPeople have complained that the story is too episodic, too disjointed.  However, the virtue of Bakemonogatari's storyline is that it is so minimal.  In all senses, this anime is a character-based experimental, and an elaboratestoryline would actually detract from that experience.  There are plenty of anime out there that thrive on plot twists and progression that keep the viewer on their seats, but Bakemonogatari isn't one.  The episodic storyline is a brilliant framing device for character development and nothing more, which works out perfectly for this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nAs usual Studio SHAFT splurged on art.  This is definitely a series to be enjoyed in high-definition, preferably with the room lights turned off.  Anime, by definition, is a genre segregated from realism.  The beauty of anime as a medium is that every cut is animated, so that the blemishes, imperfections, and limitations of reality can be omitted in favor of stylized, beautified perfection.  Anime art style that attempts to be too realistic are bound to lose that edge and, naturally, pale in comparison to live-action works featuring comparable visuals.  Anime that go all in on stylizing can often seem distracting and too detached from reality.  With all of that in consideration, Bakemonogatari is one of the few shining masterpieces of the anime genre that hits the sweet spot.  Everything in this anime is crisp and beautiful, from the characters to the slightest scenery detail.  What would have seemed tacky when drawn are boldly stylized and symbolized, rather than allowed to compromise the atmosphere.  For example, people have complained about the cuts to photographs and abstract diagrams that pop up frequently.  But imagine if all of those were actually animated; it would have been clunky and distracting from the dialog.  For example, Senjougahara's mother isn't a character in this anime, therefore having an designed, animated character to her credit would distract from the very small and tight cast.  I don't know how much budget went into this production, but they sure splurged where it was needed (characters, scenery-porn sequences, pivotal action sequences) and were decisive in radically minimizing what would have been superfluous.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThere is quite a rave about Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari and Staple Stable, and they are indeed catchy and appropriate opening/ending.  Much more underrated are the mundane, ambient sound design of this anime.  Just as Bakemonogatari should ideally be viewed in high-quality settings, so it should be heard with at least \"nice\" audio.  Perhaps I had the fortune/misfortune of being an impeccable audiophile and watched the series with headphones that cost me half a fortune, but everyone should at least watch Bakemonogatari with real speakers or decent headphones.  This is a series that can only be fully appreciated when the viewer is immersed in it, and laptop speakers simply won't do.\\n\r\nHaving said all of that, the non-intrusive BGM and ambient sounds do a perfect job of accentuating the dialog/situation without, again, distracting from what is really important.  Perhaps the best example is in the TV finale, where the BGM swells and fades without the viewers really noticing because they are so perfectly integrated with the ebb and flow of verbal/situational push and pull between the two leads.\\n\r\nThe voice acting, without even the need to elaborate, are top-mark.  The seiyuu for Koyomi is appropriately serious, jocular, and reflective.  I especially enjoyed the sequences and inserts in which Koyomi is thinking selfish/perverted/silly thoughts.  Excellent sound designing makes it sound like Koyomi's voice is really ringing inside my head, adding to the effect and how identifiable his character is.  Voice acting for Senjougahara seemed a bit too fragile and breathy at first, but it was revealed to be not the fault of the seiyuu, but part of character development, but more on that will border on spoiling.  Let me just add that voice acting for both leads hit the sweet spot at least by the TV finale.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAll of the other elements, story, art, and sound, up to now were accompaniments to the brilliant characters of Bakemonogatari.  If those elements had their virtue in garnishing the backgrounds of this anime, the characters' virtue lie in their shocking assertiveness and charisma.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi - Of all anime leads I've seen, he is one of the few truly-believable leads that are likeable.  He is objectively decent-looking and decently dressed, not, as are many a blue-haired shounen characters, outrageously flamboyant.  He is not an outspoken paragon of bravery and power.  He is even a bit of a sociopath.  However, the subtle inner stability he shows makes him stronger than Goku or Lelouch in my opinion.  He isn't a social butterfly, but he would never seriously harm another person.  Though he is a bit of a pervert, just like the rest of us, the viewers can't picture him ever being disloyal to his romantic partner.  Koyomi's inner strength and stability are what keeps this series from becoming a typical harem anime, and such qualities of his character are what makes the viewer so strongly and ineffably identify with him.\\n\\n\r\nSenjougahara - First of all, her name is awesome, just phonetically.  I read that it means something like \"battlefield\" in Japanese, but it sounds so feminine and appropriate to her character.  With that aside, if Koyomi is the steady, dependable drummer keeping beat to the Bakemonogatari band, Senjougahara is the lead vocalist that captures and enthralls the viewer.  Anime is, more than anything, a visual art, so it is of course important that her every frame is perfected and beautified with adoration.  Not only is she one of the most flawlessly beautiful female characters in anime, the way she poses and moves is also idealized.  Imagine a girl who never does anything unsightly: never makes an unflattering face, is never without makeup (or always looks perfect without one), never goes to the bathroom, you get the idea, and that would be Senjougahara.  Again, the creators of Bakemonogatari really cashed in on this aspect of anime to create a visually flawless female lead.  Utter perfection, however, isn't always likeable, as none of us are perfect.  Senjougahara, therefore, needs some profound flaw in order to offset her physical perfection, and that's when her character development comes into play.  I won't say much more on that for fear of spoiling, but she exists not as a perfect, standalone being, but someone who absolutely depends on Koyomi to complete her.  That's why their interactions work, even though they should logically have zero reason to even know each other.  Senjougahara is the modern Yamato Nadeshiko, though the usage of that term to describe her may be controversial.  The numerous attempts to categorize her as a tsundere/kuudere/yandere/whaeverdere have all failed because her character is grounded not on a trope, but a real-life ideal of feminine beauty. She is the culmination, or rather, an amalgamation, of decades of anime heroines that captured the viewers, male and female alike.  Senjougahara and Koyomi have such subtle and inexplicable chemistry because they are both subtle, ultimately mysterious characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThis is the one category where I admit that the 10/10 is highly subjective.  Objectively, Bakemonogatari is a top-quality art form, and I firmly believe that high-profile artists, filmmakers, etc. would appreciate that Bakemonogatari is the epitome of modern anime counterculture (Suzumiya Haruhi being the mainstream crystallization of modern anime).  However, you have to be looking for the right thing to enjoy this anime.  If the anime you typically enjoy are Naruto, TTGL, etc. (not that they aren't fantastic either), Bakemonogatari is perhaps not for you.  This series is really for people who have watched a lot of anime, perhaps even an otaku, and were drawn to the more sophisticated, post-modern aspect of the genre as a whole.  It is, in a way, analogous to how Mozart is universally loved (for a good reason!), while composers like Hindemith appeal strongly to those who have developed a taste in classical music.  I personally pick this series as the number one anime of all time (along with NGE) because it had all I was looking for: deep, subtle characters, platonic romance, somewhat surreal atmosphere, idealization only possible in anime, wit, and that pinch of sociopathy shown in each character, as are present in every human being.  There isn't one thing about this anime that is the \"hook\" (though, if I had to pick one, I'd go with SENJOUGAHARA FASCINATION). Rather, every aspect of it plays its role perfectly to create a gestalt whole.  Oh, and by the way, if you're like me and are desperately looking for non-moe, non-loli (getting harder and harder to find) anime made in 21st century, welcome to Bakemonogatari. This series is for mature viewers looking for a subtle, yet decisively anime experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you think yourself the discriminating, intellectual beta-component of modern society (who also happens to watch anime), you will love this series.  It's a love or hate type of anime, in my opinion, and if you are the type of person this show caters to, you will come to thoroughly appreciate every aspect of the show, besides just Senjougahara.  If you're not, that doesn't mean you're not as cultured or some nonsense; just need to find your anime masterpiece, as I found Bakemonogatari.",

There's the selfless main character, the Tsundere girlfriend, the shy Moe girl who turns out to actually be psycho and manipulative, the smart girl whowears glasses (for a brief time anyway), the little sister(s), the athletic girl, the lesbian, etc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of them are written with more nuance than what you'd expect, as in, they get backstories, but on a basic level, I don't feel like it's any deeper than the character backstories from any other anime. But they do have a bit more depth than what you'd expect from a harem show, meaning they are not in a round-the-clock quest for the main character's dick. I'm not a fan of the characters (except for Kaiki Deishuu and maybe Meme Oshino), and don't think they're anything noteworthy, but I do give the writer credit for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also the same as what you'd expect from an anime. Talking about motivations, delivering exposition, and bantering whenever there's nothing going on. The difference is that most the show is just that, talking, with nothing else going on. However, I don't have that much of a problem with that aspect and some of the dialogue is occasionally funny. Nevertheless, even then, the dialogue often tends to go in circles and isn't strong enough to carry the whole show in my opinion, but more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, however, a lot of the story arcs start out with potential, but then they end up focusing more on the dialogue rather than doing something interesting with the premise, and then end unmemorably. The biggest example of this is in Monogatari Second Season's Mayoi Jiangshi arc.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, despite the first scene of this show being a 15-20 second-long panty shot, there isn't actually all that much fanservice. However, when there is, it's rather unappealing.\\n\\n\r\nTwo running gags with Koyomi include going out and molesting Mayoi, who is 11, and planning on tricking his little sisters into being molested by him, and he suffers no real comeuppance for it. I'd say it's refreshing to have a subversion as a change of pace from the typical harem humor wherein the main character does something perverted by accident and gets beaten up for it, but I don't think child molestation or incest are funny.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to mention the rape snake from the Nadeko Snake arc, and two extended scenes from Nisemonogatari, wherein Shinobu, who is over 400 years old but is physically 8, bathes with Koyomi, as well as the infamous scene where he brushes his little sister's teeth and it looks like they're having oral. I have read an essay analyzing the fanservice in Nise, of all things, and apparently it's supposed to represent teenage sexuality. Okay, but that doesn't mean that I have to feel it's worth wearing  a monocle and a top hat while smoking a Cuban cigar, listening to Mozart and waxing philosophical about this aspect. Might as well apply that same logic to every ecchi harem out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with Monogatari, however, isn't inherent, since I've read some of the light novels and think they're okay, despite having these flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks nice and clean (despite the obvious low budget resulting in all these still frames), however, it is also its biggest flaw (besides the fanservice).\\n\\n\r\nShaft has been using the same visuals for every Shinbo-directed show for several years (10-11 years as of the time of this review), but I feel that when making Monogatari, they rely on their visuals too much.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time, during the dialogue scenes in Monogatari, they keep cutting to Dadaist visuals, text screens, weird camera angles and extreme closeups, which wouldn't be a problem, except that they focus on them for so long and so often, that it detracts from the experience. They go too overboard with those and fail to build up a good momentum for the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't judge a show based on the animation, as long as I'm interested in the story and the characters, but this is one case where I have the opinion that it detracts from everything else. In this case, I feel like the animation department is too busy showing off what I already know that they can do while not advancing the story in a significant measure in each episode with little pay-off, and that aspect is what I actually care about in a show. I've already seen this exact same type of animation in multiple other Shaft shows previously, so it doesn't do anything for me anymore, I'm not going to give it extra points.\\n\\n\r\nImagine if someone made an adaptation of a book, and instead of adapting the events of the book in a visual format, the adaptation entirely consisted of watching some guy sitting there, reading the book out loud. That's what watching Monogatari feels like.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that the Monogatari light novels are okay despite their flaws, but that Shaft's direction makes the anime boring to watch, and that I would have likely enjoyed the show more if it was made by another studio, or if Shaft hadn't gone so overboard with the animation to the extent that it detracts from everything else. The only reason I continue to watch it is just because I'm waiting for the moment where it finally lives up to its potential.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari is a love-it-or-hate-it show, watch it if you want, maybe you'll like it, but if you end up not liking it, I recommend watching Monster or Mushishi as preferable alternatives.",

            "content": "\"Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?\" - Senjougahara Hitagi, Episode 6\r\nWell, you won't be sighing anywhere in this anime.\r\nBakemonogatari from the start can give the wrong impression to the viewer. They must be wondering, \"Why is this rated so high, if it all it is, is just random words popping up on the screen?\" However, it is a really good anime in its own weird way, and you're probably going to have to appreciate it that way as well.\r\nCharacter: Usually, I'd start my review with the main part (story), but I believe the most important part of Bakemonogatariis its character development. You have Koyomi Araragi, who interacts with 5 different girls throughout the story; the tsundere Senjougahara Hitagi, the cute and small Mayoi Hachikuji, the tomboy Kanbaru Suruga, the other cute loli Sengoku Nadeko, and the Queen of Fanservice Hanekawa Tsubasa. Oh yeah, I almost forgot Oshino Shinobu. Each interaction and arc is unique. From funny wordplay, to stapling someone in the mouth, the character development is what makes this series a really entertaining one. If Bakemonogatari didn't have a storyline at all (which it does), it would still be entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nStory: The first episode actually starts off with flashing scenes from Kizumonogatari, the prequel of Bakemonogatari. You have Koyomi Araragi, who was recently bit by a vampire. In the beginning of the story, he meets Senjougahara by catching her fall. Was that the right decision to make? Araragi himself says; \"Not ignoring her was the right decision... I think\" (Episode 1). She then tells him (in fact, forces him, by stapling the side of his mouth) to be quiet about her \"incurable disease\", but Koyomi insists on helping. He gets his friend who had helped him recover from the vampire attack; Oshino Meme. He specializes in supernatural problems to help not only her, but everyone else throughout the story. The series overall isn't a story-focused one. It's more focused on the character interactions. The interaction between Senjougahara and Araragi are always entertaining to watch.\\n\r\nSenjougahara: *to Araragi* \"I'm suprised you know such useless things. This is the first time since birth that I've admired you.\"\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voices sound really nice, and the voice cast has a lot of popular names. The dialogue plays an important role is this anime, and is done really well, especially with its jokes. The OPs are really catchy (notable mention to Senjougahara's \"Staple Stable\" and Nadeko's \"Ren'ai Circulation\") and the ED (supercell - Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari) is just great.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is somewhat similar to SHAFT's other work (as expected). It's almost like a mix of Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei and Arakawa Under the Bridge, but everything is crisp and clear nonetheless. Another element that plays a huge role in Bakemonogatari is the flashing text and small detail that happens almost too frequently each episode. I think it is done well, and sets a mood for the episode. You don't have to stop and read everything, but the flashing words do provide some info and foreshadowing.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bakemonogatari has a lot of entertainment value, and all the elements combined make it a really good supernatural-romance-comedy. Each arc is enjoyable, and has a good amount of fan service for those who enjoy it. The romance was also done very well, which leaves the view with a warm feeling at the end. It took some time to get used to the weird flashing words in the beginning, but once you get used to it, you'll be in for an entertaining ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10",

            "content": "**Monster Story**\r\nGatari is voicing form of Katari. Katari is a tale which by oral tradition, is passed down from generation to generation. Thereby, the words \"Bakemono\" means monster and \"monogatari\" means story. Thus, you get \"Bakemonogatari\" which is an anime that contains tales of monsters.\r\nAlright, enough of the trivia. Let's get down to business.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIt'd be very difficult to describe the story without letting out spoilers. With that in mind, I can only tell you that Bakemonogatari is a collection of monster tales that are revelant to life. The story depicts surrealism and \"supernatural phenomenons\" amongst people, which occur when the main character, Araragi, interactswith them. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, SHAFT saves the day! SHAFT is well known for their artistic techniques to portray abstract scenes. Their other works, such as Ef - A Fairy Tale of the Two, are very much similiar. Bakemonogatari utilizes many, unique camera angles that are relevant or not relevant to what is being said. Such scenes could be the sky, cars, the character's hair, etc. Additionally, multiple screens and walls of text pop up to give the viewer a sense of abstract understanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing. I don't really know anyone who dislikes the OP and Ending themes. To make Bakemonogatari interesting, director Akiyuki Shinbo, allowed only a few episodes to have certain OP/Endings and mix them so it won't get boring. Indeed, it's nothing like your standard anime where there is the same boring OP and Ending played over and over. The insert music is also very excellent.\\n\r\nOP: \\n\r\n#01: \"staple stable\" by Chiwa Saito (Eps. 2, 6)\\n\r\n#02: \"Kaerimichi (\u5e30\u308a\u9053)\" by Emiri Katou (Ep. 4)\\n\r\nEnd:\\n\r\n#01: \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari (\u541b\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u7269\u8a9e)\" by supercellxnagi\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for the 8 is because, I feel the characters aren't being introduced thoroughly. Of course, it's understandable that Bakemonogatari will only be 15 episodes - thus they have to \"pack and condense\" the character development (Tales) to fit the 15 episodes. Had Bakemonogatari been 24 episodes though, I think overall character growth would be KILLER. The romance between tsundere-Senjougahara and male lead-Araragi is pretty nice, however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9\\n\\n\r\nBeside the story and character development-in-15-episodes, Bakemonogatari deserves a good two thumbs up. Also, for a anime having a tsundere female, I'd say it REALLY stands out from Shakugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima. Albeit the many interesting anime coming in 2009, Bakemonogatari is certainly something else. It's unique because it stands out from your traditional anime.  It is as if Bakemonogatari is wearing a green shirt while the other anime series wear white.To put it bluntly, Bakemonogatari offers this sense of upmost perfect surrealism that is damn near addicting. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari (Monster Story) is definitely a MUST-SEE.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime seemed to have a lot of mysteries in it, but the biggest mystery it presented to me was why I took such a violent dislike to it even though it has been favorably discussed by intelligent viewers. I stopped watching it early on, out of simple irritation. To me it was marching straight down that wrong road we are warned against in the aphorism, \"Don't gild the lily.\" \r\nIt's episode number 2, and an interesting \"exposition\" conversation is taking place between the anime's Girl Number 1 and the hero. It presents a considerable subsidiary mystery--why is this girl acting in this unusual andunpleasant way? This viewer would have liked to watch the interchange closely to try to find that out.  But I couldn't! Or at least I couldn't do so with full real comprehension, because it was just here that the director intensified his already-established habit of complexifying everything on the screen beyond reason. \\n\\n\r\nThis scene is taking place in some kind of loft-like living space within an industrial building. Beams and pillars cross and recross the whole field of view of the \"camera\", which is set at a middle distance from the action. In addition, when the camera moves, it is often to new points of view that are also well-removed from the action--and every one of the resulting fields of view is also seriously obscured by more architectural elements. In this long scene there are times when the camera does get closer to the \"actors\", and there are even a few--very few--closeup shots of the players' faces, but when those shots arrive they are usually jump-cuts--a quick close-up of the face in question then away. The overall experience of dealing with this as a viewer is similar to trying to interact with someone you've never met before in a dark room where the only light constantly goes off and on at irregular intervals. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this ladles on lots of mystery. FINE. The director's primary job at the beginning of a show is to suck us into the story--that is, to make us at least begin to make the story imaginatively ours. One way to do that is to mystify us at the outset, but this can be overdone! When the basic premise of the show, given in the first episode, is already a very large mystery, do we really need in the next scene to be presented with constant subsidiary visual mysteries? The other usual way to \"suck us in\" is to make us at least begin to identify with the protagonist. That's pretty hard to achieve here, where, in their very first substantial conversation, both the protagonist and his antagonist have been distanced from us both by too much shooting of their conversation with long shots and by constant visual clutter that has nothing to do with the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut I bet lots of you liked it all. And my best guess as to why lots of you do, and I don't, is generational. Modern technology permits all lilies to be easily gilded, I bet few directors can resist doing so; so most of you have gotten used to this. I'm an old guy, and I can't.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this intriguing anime, please, and see what you think. It may be announcing the beginning of a new rococo age.\\n\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nYou don\u2019t have to be a member of the anime community for long to know that the Monogatari series is very, very highly praised. Inevitably, I gave into the hype and tried it out for myself. The result? Well\u2026 I walked away entertained, but FAR from impressed. Yes the characters are amusing, yes the dialogue is witty, and yes the visuals are beautiful, but make no mistake: Bakemonogatari is just a harem. It exists only for comedic gags and fanservice. The characters are shallow and have little to offer beyond their archetypes and their dialogue, not to mention that the \u201cplot\u201d is looseand unimpressive to say the least. I guess I have very mixed feelings about this anime; I\u2019m happy I watched it, but the people hailing it as a masterpiece need to check themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Koyomi Araragi, our harem lead, gets himself involved with all sorts of supernatural stuff, including vampires, spirits, myths, ghosts, and other apparitions. Being the overly selfless, and unreasonably nice harem lead that he is, Araragi meets a series of girls, each of which with their own problems. He finds a way to solve those problems, thus making essentially all of those girls fall in love with him until he has his very own harem.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you\u2019ve probably heard that sort of plot premise many times before, and that\u2019s because there is nothing unique about this show\u2019s plot what so ever. Even the supernatural thing has been done before. It\u2019s quite simply a show about a boy helping girls with their problems one by one, a-la every visual novel ever made (even though this show is not based on a VN). There really isn\u2019t much to say about it except one thing: Holy shit is there dialogue. Now, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; lots of my favorite anime are considered dialogue heavy, but Bakemongatari is essentially \u201cDialogue: The Animation\u201d. Granted, it's usually very witty and well-written dialogue, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't lose interest on more than one occasion. I really enjoyed the action scenes because of how incredibly animated they are, but they were few and far between to say the least. You can count them on one hand. In short, this plot is just a bare-minimum narrative framework for the show to conduct comedic gags and show tons of fanservice all the while attempting to incorporate every otaku fetish ever conceived. Needless to say, the plot is NOT the reason to watch this show\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe real selling point for Bakemonogatari is the characters: They are praised to no end for their likeability and depth. The former I can get on board with. The latter, however, I must wholeheartedly refute. The cast of characters is simply shallow, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s debatable (I\u2019ve been told they receive more depth in later seasons, but for now, they are shallow). Senjogahara, everybody\u2019s obligatory \u201cbest girl\u201d, may be amusing with her witty remarks and constant insults, we never get to know who she really is as a person. The romance between her and Araragi has its moments, but it comes across as unrealistic and misguided more often than not. Araragi claims to love Senjogahara but... does he? It doesn't seem like it at all. She constantly berates him, constantly puts him in uncomfortable situations, and is clearly mentally unstable. Senjogahara\u2019s love feels very unreciprocated, making it quite difficult to empathize with their relationship. Speaking of that love, the show also doesn\u2019t bother to flesh out why Senjogahara loves Araragi in the first place. As the anime itself manages to point out, it seems like she's just a mentally unstable, lonely girl who would fall in love with anyone who showed her the slightest bit of kindness a-la Yuno Gasai. That person just so happened to be Araragi, making the entire relationship based upon coincidence rather than legitimate connection on a psychological and/or spiritual level. The question is simply this: Is the show making fun of these tropes, or merely utilizing them? Who knows, but in the end, it doesn't really seem to matter since nothing profound is ever actually discusses and no commentary is ever made. For that reason, I just can't get into them as a couple; I don't like the confusing and round-a-bout way that it was handled. The other characters don't receive any remarkable depth either. They come and go at random intervals in between episodes; uncomfortably blurring the line between minor and major character. Our protagonist, Araragi is the prototypical overly generous and generic harem lead, with the exception of his tendency to create situations with unfathomably sexual undertones (even more so than an average harem). Don't get me wrong, the characters are witty and entertaining; they had me laughing multiple times, but there is an obvious problem with depth. They are funny, but shallow and archetypical.\\n\\n\r\nI would be doing the show a disservice if I didn\u2019t mention the beautiful animation, which was easily the best part of the entire anime. Bakemonogatari\u2019s beautiful, experimental art style and orgasmic uses of shot composition and lighting are the real reason you should watch this show. Any fan of animation owes it to themselves to bask in the glory of this genius art direction. There are a FEW shots that don\u2019t really work, but as a whole, stupendous animation. The music was good as a tone setter, but a tad underwhelming as a whole with the exception of a single track: The ED; AKA my new favorite anime ED of all time. My god is it increadible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bakemonogatari consists entirely of witty humor and fanservice in a beautifully animated and surreal setting. It has lovable characters and great dialogue, but it seriously lacks depth and originality in the departments of plot and characters. The plot isn\u2019t memorable at all, and if the characters are memorable, it\u2019s for their humor and boobs rather than their motivations and complexity. While I totally understand why fans of harems consider this to be the pinnacle of anime, it\u2019s quite clear that Bakemonogatari is not worthy of that title. I think the show is worth watching, but don\u2019t let the ridiculous hype surrounding the series ruin it for you. Remember: At its core, this is just a harem.",

            "content": "It is very rare to see such a successful marriage of a director\u2019s vision and an author\u2019s material. Bakemonogatari\u2019s existence is an anomaly especially in present day where adaptations are subpar when compared to the source. However, there has never been a more potent combination than Nisio Isin and Studio SHAFT\u2019s Akiyuki Shinbou. Shinbou\u2019s quirky, and imaginative art direction greatly compliments the fast paced dialogue and witticisms that Nisio is known for. The end result is a tour de force of both visuals and prose. Bakemonogatari is a meticulously crafted tale that never ceases to maintain the viewer\u2019s attention and titillate the imagination.\r\nStory- Bakemonogatari isa broken into individual arcs, each focusing a certain character dealing with a supernatural \u201cOddity.\u201d There is an overarching plot that is delicately threaded throughout each arc. Every character is related to one another either directly or indirectly. Throughout each arc, we learn more about each girl and their specific affliction. In other shows, this would mean long, drawn out expository dialogue that lacks personality and charisma. However, Bakemonogatari is unlike other anime. Every interaction is interesting due to how well the visuals compliment the dialogue. Although the dialogue seems to meander from time to time, the interactions between characters are always at the very least entertaining. And through these seemingly meaningless conversations, we learn more about their personalities, motivations and personal beliefs. It is all done in a very subtle way so it may take some close attention to catch some of the nuances of the characterization. Bakemonogatari does not try to baby the viewer; it tells you only what you need to know and lets your imagination fill in the gaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of writing remains consistent throughout each arc but the show takes a bit of a downward spiral during the Nadeko Snake arc. Not that it is a bad arc as much as it is underwhelming. Sengoku Nadeko is easily the most uninteresting female in the cast. She is timid, shy and cute. She does not have any stand out traits or eccentricities like the other members of the cast. It seems her sole purpose in this arc is to appease fetishists due to her being placed in many compromising positions. She wears school swimsuits and her affliction is the most sexual in nature. The conclusion to this arc also leaves much to be desired but it is only a minor dip in the overall quality of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Studio SHAFT has become synonymous with eccentric art and whacky animation, and Bakemonogatari really benefits from SHAFT adapting it. It is a true visual spectacle, using a mixture of different art styles to make conversations much more interesting. Most scenes are vibrant and full of color and unusual geometric shapes which breathe life into the show. It also uses an interesting blend of typography and simple black and white scenes that really support the tone of the conversations. You could argue that Bakemonogatari\u2019s success is due to the visuals. It truly is a feast for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Bakemonogatari features of one of the most intriguing cast of characters I have had the pleasure to watch. However, the crowning achievement of the show has to be Hitagi Senjougahara, the protagonist Araragi\u2019s girlfriend. She is cruel and cynical and never ceases to make Araragi her whipping boy. But that is all a part of her indelible charm. Past her ice cold exterior, lays a really gooey and lovable center. Her change is gradual but very apparent by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n The relationship dynamic between Araragi and Senjougahara is simply a joy to behold. It is free of all usual issues that plague romantic anime: awkward confessions, a melodramatic backstory and a general lack of believability. The development of their relationship is set at a slow but realistic pace. Think of it as a flower in bloom, when it blossoms you can truly appreciate it in all its beauty. Throughout the course of the series, Senjougahara\u2019s presence makes itself known even she is not on screen. Araragi\u2019s relationship has actively changes his character and influences what decisions he makes. Each encounter also builds upon their relationship and builds an unspoken bond of trust and affection.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of females also serves to facilitate the development of Araragi\u2019s relationship with Senjougahara. While each arc deals with a specific heroine, it very subtly also tackles aspects and issues within any romantic relationship such as: miscommunication, jealously, and infidelity. Every obstacle they face reinforces the strength of their bond.  \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are not only mere catalysts for the development of Araragi and Senjougahara, but they stand strong by themselves. The cast is comprised of the usual harem archetypes: the little sister, the class representative, the loli, and the energetic girl but they are given distinguishable traits that separate them from any other character. For example, take Kanbaru Suruga. Although she falls into the energetic girl archetype, she completely betrays our expectations of what that character should be like. She is not only athletic, but she freely embraces her sexuality by making jokes about it and making advances towards Araragi if only in jest. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a tour de force of visual storytelling. It represents the best of the medium as it completely defies all storytelling conventions of anime. It is wordy but never ceases to captivate the viewer with its beautiful imagery and wit. Bakemonogatari popularity and acclaim is well deserved as it will likely linger in your mind, whether you liked it or not, for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "Author's note: Please don't take this review too seriously. This is merely describing my own painful experience with this show. I'm not personally attacking Monogatari fans! Thank you.\r\nOverview:\r\nBakemonogatari is generally hailed as a masterpiece for being bold, innovative, challenging, and overall an unforgettably unique experience. While all of these things are certainly true, it is only a partial truth. Those above listed traits would all describe Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi, but Bakemonogatari is QUITE different from those series. Tatami's philosophy, comedy, and characters can transcend the language boundary. This is also true for Mushishi with its amazing visuals and atmosphere. Bakemonogatari though, is a seriesin which full mastery of the Japanese language is an absolute necessity. It feels that roughly 90% of Bakemonogatari's value and 100% of it's enjoyment is based on clever prose and wordplay that doesn't translate outside of Japanese. There is a reason this series will NEVER be dubbed. I feel that  Bakemonogatari lovers can be neatly divided into 2 categories: those fluent in Japanese and fucking liars!\\n\\n\r\nLanguage and translation:\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why novels have widespread appeal outside of their countries of origin and poetry typically doesn't? People aren't kidding when they say things get \"lost in translation\". Prose that is immensely intricate in its original form will often get butchered into something clunky and brutal. The English speaking world fell in love with Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through the translations of Constance Garnett, who is considered by some to have been a sub-par translator that eviscerated the original Russian. It didn't matter because the characters, themes, psychology, etc was able to shine through. Even if it kind of sounded crappy and had awkward sentences. The poetry of Alexander Pushkin though has never really found fanfare outside of Russia. While we can certainly appreciate his brilliant narrative poems like The Bronze Horseman and at least partially appreciate Evgeny Onegin, we non-Russian speakers can't seem to really understand his prose and just what makes it so \"good\" to Russian ears. Similarly, Bakemonogatari to a non-Japanese speaker like me has all the appeal of listening to Igbo or Yoruba poetry while nodding my head and pretending to understand because I want to be smart. \\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters\\n\\n\r\nA bland male character finds girls with supernatural problems and solves them. Lets be honest. You are NOT watching this for the plot. Would you watch a performance of Love's Labour's Lost for the plot? NO! You watch it for the prose! Or if you're being perfectly honest, you watch it because your girlfriend dragged you to the Shakespeare festival and you want to get laid. At least we all know Costard is awesome. Senjougahara is an obnoxious bitch. Yes, she is a self aware, meta character that plays around with classic tsundere tropes. I get it. She's still an obnoxious bitch. \"i'm like that magical dragon from that one anime. I can grant you any wish you want. I can wake you up naked or perhaps if you are a pervert you could give me an enema!\" In the original Japanese this was undoubtedly a biting, crude, but clever comment because the Kanji for \"enema\" resembles the Hirigana for another word in that sentence. In English, you are just left scratching your head. She mentions that adding another \"Ra\" to Araragi makes it rather lewd, but once again I can't understand. She got some interesting character development in episode 2, but mostly I'm just frustrated by the characters and left in a state of total non-comprehension...like I am with most aspects of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very unique and the animation is top notch here form Studio Shaft. The series experiments with wild camera angles and often looks stunning...when it isn't straining your eyes. It also has a real habit of flashing to black and displaying random text before flashing back. Personally I found it (flash) \"Tedious\" (flash) \"contrived\" and (flash) \"pretentious\". Of course that's just me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI give Bakemonogatari a decent score based on its art and ambition. However, I am incapable of rendering a truly valid judgement because I don't speak Japanese. Imagine a native Telugu speaker with no knowledge of the German language. That person couldn't appropriately judge the poetry of Heinrich Heine. I find myself in the same position. I can't say this is a bad series. I can't say it's a good series. I don't feel I'm qualified to say much of anything in regards to its merit. I wrote this review for one simple purpose. Don't make the mistake that I did and go in expecting to love this series because its popular with the elite crowd. If you don't speak Japanese, avoid this one like the plague!",

            "content": "Finally giving in to the hype, I picked up Bakemonogatari, the most discussed anime of '09, on the very first day of this year. The show's appeal was lost on me during the first few episodes, but after a while the reasons for this anime's charm on so many became apparent. As to whether that charm worked on me as well, that's something I'm going to explain a bit more thoroughly further on.\r\nThe story of Bakemonogatari may at first seem confusing with the odd events of the show's beginning. Soon, however, the plot's structure comes clear enough as new characters (all female) are introduced, witheach of them having their own arc consisting of a few episodes at a time. Amidst the weirdness of Bakemonogatari's characters, artwork and animation, a simple storyline like that is a welcome asset. Of course, on the occasion you're not one to enjoy a storyline based on  a few episode-arcs, it'll be exactly the other way around for you.\\n\\n\r\nDespite each story arc concentrating on a new character each time, the story of our main couple, Araragi and Senjougahara, flows along nicely as well. The relationship between the two is somewhat the core of the entire show, with the story-arcs functioning either as a means to deepen their chemistry as they go about solving the encountered mysteries together, introduce new characters, or bring more depth to our main hero, Araragi. This I have no qualms of, for I quite like the way a clearly harem-esque series has the most prominent love interest set in stone instead of the guy tinkering on edge until the very end about who it is that he loves.\\n\\n\r\nBe not completely turned off yet, all you who despise everything which has the word \"harem\" attached to it, for even though I dubbed Monstory as \"a clearly harem-esque series\", this show isn't an average one in that category in the least. Yes, it's yet again a series where a single guy is surrounded by attractive females (sans the loli character), and yes, all of them are expressing more or less of an interest in him. But they're not brainlessly-unconditionally-helplessly or otherwise idiotically in love in him, nope. In fact some, if not most of them are having open and cheeky banters with him _AND_, unlike in most of your typical harems, the guy isn't actually an utter retard with no redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to what I believe is commonly praised as Bakemonogatari's greatest strength, which namely is the wonderfully wicked and excellent character chemistry. As I stated before the characters actually have more intricate interaction between them than your usual scenario of a bunch of chicks loving on an idiot with an attraction level somewhere around -9000. The verbal battles between Araragi and co. (and especially with Senjougahara) are indeed the shows most prominent and refreshing aspect.\\n\\n\r\nBut whereas \"a bunch of chicks loving on an idiot\" can be seen as one frustrating extreme of character interaction, at times I felt as though Bakemonogatari presented a polar opposite no less frustrating. All too often it seemed like the heavy dialogue was there just to accentuate the girls' excellency over Araragi as the poor fellow always appeared to get the short end of the stick in their interactions. A feature meant to be humorous for sure, and I do remember smiling at times, but I certainly wasn't as entertained as I guessed I should've been.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fracture burdening on the show's enjoyability is the usage of still-images with text which I suppose were there to support the story. I can't remember if there was a single episode where there wouldn't have been a series of stills flashing on the screen so fast it was impossible to read the sentences on them without stopping your media player to read them. You can guess if I myself cared much for doing so. A hint: I didn't. Surely I didn't miss anything of importance when I opted to roll my eyes in annoyance instead of stopping to read each time when a still featuring either a sentence or a meaningless word like \"red\" or \"black\" appeared on the screen, but it certainly didn't add to my viewing pleasure either.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it from me this time, really. Other factors you'd usually pay attention to while watching, like the music and art, fell into the vast category of \"alright\". The theme songs let alone the rest of the soundtrack left no impression on me whatsoever, and just like everybody else, I did notice the artstyle in this show was a bit funny at times. Surely nothing which folks familiar with Gankutsuou, Zetsubou-sensei, and SHAFT in general can't handle. Characterization, relationships, and intriguing story are the plusses, somewhat questionable humour and stupid stills the minuses. Sounds like yer cup of tea? Then drink up. It doesn't? Then go look for another one - but not before sampling this.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is your typical harem Anime that adds nothing less and nothing more to the medium of Anime. It is a show that has been done before and is still being done after it\u2019s release. It is a show that is praised often by the community for God knows why and for whatever reasons, but I honestly found it to be unoriginal and uninspired in everything it did and presented. Bakemonogatari is basically an Anime that is filled to the brim with ecchi and sexually stimulating scenes to increase it\u2019s sales to whoever buys it (you know them horny kids finna have a blast tothis boy), a boring plot which became predictable at around episode six, a stereotypical cast of characters that has been done so many times before, no explanations as to what the heck is happening in the damn show, and some of the stupidest visuals I have ever come across. This is what people are calling \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d now\u2026 noice\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so let us just get the easiest one out of the way real quick. The characters. The characters in this Anime are terrible, because they have all been done before, so many times too. Listen, you can do stereotypical characters right, you can turn a character that has been done a trillion times before into a three dimensional character just by executing them properly and developing them. Does Bakemonogatari do this? No. The characters in Bakemonogatari are basically unoriginal stereotypes with little to no character depth or development whatsoever, and they feel like cardboard cutouts of other done before characters. First off, you have your badass, emotionless, abusive tsundere lead girl. This girl likes to abuse the main character and threaten his life for the stupidest of reasons. After all is said and done, she suddenly confesses that she loves the main character because she felt lonely and he saved her because he has a big heart. This is the epitome of the unoriginal  tsundere character. Her character is so annoying, not only because I rarely like this type of character, but because she always keeps on saying Araragi\u2019s name all the time. Every. Damn. Sentence. It gets extremely annoying after a while, having to hear \u201cAraragi-kun\u201d being the ending statement after every sentence she speaks. Then you have your main character, no personality or depth, no nothing. Did I mention that he has two sisters? The Anime never develops any of them, they are just there so that Neroragi-kun can talk to a loli girl. They are not even one dimensional, just an excuse to advance the nonsensical plot forward. So this guy is basically a one dimensional pervert who\u2019s only traits are being a vampire and saving girls, all of which start flocking to him after he saves that tsundere girl whose name I can\u2019t pronounce (Didn\u2019t I tell you it becomes predictable?). Of course, his parents are never shown or known, we get glimpses about his relationship with his mom, but that\u2019s about it. Then you have your typical loli who appears for the sake of the plot, and does not appear for the rest of the Anime, until the plot needs her again that is. Her only purpose is to be a plot device. Same story with characters like Hanekawa and annoying tsundere girl, whom I like to call fan-service #1 and fan-service #2, because they only appear for plot convenience and fan-service. After some of the girls\u2019 backstories are revealed, the Anime does not bother giving the characters more growth or development. Rather, it presents their backstories and glosses over them like they were never there to begin with (loli girl, sport loving lesbian girl, snake girl). These characters appear out of nowhere with little to no explanation, or for the most lazy reasons ever, and get no development. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Bakemonogatari has bland, unoriginal characters and a bad, boring plot. It tries to shroud itself in some supernatural mystery, but the only mystery I found in this Anime was the question of whether or not I was going to be able to finish it without facepalming my face through a brick wall. \\n\\n\r\nNow let us talk about the visuals. Basically, this Anime is one of the weirdest looking Anime I have ever seen, if not the weirdest looking. It has weird faces, different camera angles on characters\u2019 faces, those very stupid head tilts the characters do with their stupid grins, the eye zoom ins, the realistic images, etc. It also likes to change the art style of the Anime for some odd reason, an example of this is placing real eyes on Araragi\u2019s face during a certain scene where his eyes were going to be harmed by a knife, which I found to be distracting from the scene rather than it being a cool visual. Some viewers may find this change cool, while others may find it unnecessarily stupid, I stand firmly with the latter. My guess for all of this is that they were trying to save money, all while trying to look \u201chip and cool\u201d for the kids. This would have actually been cool to see, if the Anime used it once every five or ten episodes. Rather, I saw this being used in almost every episode, so it became stale and boring. I also like how the Anime shamelessly reuses scenes seconds later after originally using them (An example of this would be in episode 9, Hanekawa does the same stupid grin and hand movement when she is talking to Araragi in the library). So you can tell this Anime has no heart or soul poured into it, it\u2019s cheap. \\n\\n\r\nThe intro card of the show has to be the most annoying, infuriating thing I have ever seen. No, I am not talking about the openings, those were mediocre at best and did not generate any emotion from me. The intro card that plays after the opening has been proven by scientists to not only give you seizures, but also give you Cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, brain damage, heart palpitations, Alzheimer\u2019s, blindness, baldness and multiple strokes. I was tilting my laptop to the side every time that intro card came on, my eyes were begging me to stop looking at the horror. You know you need to change your intro card when half of your viewers are dying because of it. By the time I arrived at episode 13, I had already gone blind from that intro, thank you Bakemonogatari!  \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t even get me started on the lame jokes. The jokes can be summed up as meta jokes that are there to be there. They are there just to break the fourth wall and nothing else. Tsundere girl mentioning the term tsundere is not funny, nor is it executed properly so that it can make me burst out laughing. The characters also like to mention Doraemon for some odd reason, which I found to be unfunny and pointless. I remember Lord Beerus making a meta joke about Anime during the first episodes of Dragon Ball Super, and it was funny and witty. Maybe the fact that I was a naive fifteen year old kid at the time made me laugh at that joke? Or maybe Bakemonogatari does not know how to do jokes? I don\u2019t know. You answer me, because Bakemonogatari is the type of show to have it\u2019s main characters make jokes about looking at a girl\u2019s body, even when the girl had been abused in some way and the scene is supposed to be serious. Top notch \u201cComedy\u201d right here. \\n\\n\r\nThe Anime also does not know how to execute it\u2019s arcs properly. You will have an action arc first, and then you will be interrupted by a romantic episode in the middle, as if nothing had happened and we are supposed to just forget about it. Personally I really disliked the fact that episode 12 was thrown right in the middle of Tsubasa's arc, which was supposed to be an important arc. It's not that I didn't like the episode or don't like Gahara (She\u2019s ok I guess) but it just felt wrong and for lack of a better word, annoying. It was so oddly placed and the fact that all of my attention had already been strongly towards Tsubasa's arc, having this happen right in the midst of it all kind of threw me off and as a result, I wasn't invested in it as much. I wasn't captivated, nor did I actually think there was anything particularly special about the episode, though it is a decent episode, it just felt like a random bit that was thrown in. While it was a pretty looking episode and a decent one, I just did not find myself caring as much as others in regards to the whole Gahara laying her heart on her sleeve part.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari also likes to copy other stories like The Monkey\u2019s Paw, a brilliant short story written by W.W. Jacobs. The fans will probably look at this and say \u201cAha Bakemongatari is referencing another story as always, brilliant reference!\u201d But it wasn\u2019t brilliant in any way. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the final part of why I dislike this Anime. Nothing in this Anime is explained, and if it is, then it is explained very poorly. The vampires\u2019 existence, why a vampire attacked Arararagi, why these mysterious Gods keep appearing and disappearing. Why does this happen? The Anime gives no answers whatsoever other than a brief explanation of what they are, but nothing else. I know that this has God knows how many more seasons, and maybe, just maybe, they get answered later on, but I don\u2019t think I can sit through more of this to be honest. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is based on a series of light novels by Nisio Isin, and is later produced by Shaft. It features different short stories all related to the main character, Araragi Koyomi. Bakemonogatari is now known for its superb art and animation, and the unique way the story was presented to us. Adding to that, Bakemonogatari surprised many due to its weekly ranking sales and how well it sold across Japan. This was clearly evident in the field of BD sales, where it made history, selling 29,000 units of Bakemonogatari Vol.1, beating out the previous record holder of Macross Frontier, which sold at 22,000 units. Italso took first place in DVD sales in Oct 26 - Nov 11, beating other titles such as Gintama, Haruhi and Eden of the East. Volume 3 of Bakemonogatari also sold a lot, getting 1st place again in terms of DVD and Blu Ray sales, the margin between 1st place and 2nd place (Detective Conan Movie) being around 5 million. Volume 4 will be delayed a little while and will be released in January 27th, hoping to take the title of 1st place again.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear at why Bakemonogatari sold so well over the time. Bakemono is a collection of short stories, all with their unique characteristics and aspects that makes a show great. It showcased different supernatural cases such as the Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail and Tsubasa Cat. Plotwise, Bakemono surely delivered and made it an entertaining show to watch. These different stories usually panned out in 3-4 episodes, where we see some character development and background story on some of the characters. Although each story shows a different heroine, one can still say that these stories are connected together, and this becomes evident in the later stages of the light novel, which has yet to be animated. The stories are engaging, and keeps the viewers interested with new materials to showcase each time. This allows endless opportunities for OVAs and even a second season due to its numerous heroines with each a unique background and even later chapters in the light novels which have yet to be shown in the animated version.\\n\\n\r\nAs already stated before, Bakemonogatari has its fair share of characters. Although 4 heroines is typical in a generic romantic comedy show, Bakemonogatari is somewhat different, as each heroine has their own story that can be deeply developed and shown more insight to in the future. The characters are well thought out, and what makes the show shine is their mindless rantings and they way they interact. Hitagi, being the central heroine of the show is aware of her \"tsundere\" status and is possessed by a crab who takes all of her weight. Then, we have a loli girl who gets her \"first touch\" taken away by Koyomi, and has entertaining fight sequences with Koyomi. Not only that, we have a smart and well mannered girl who you would consider as the clumsy one in all anime. However, she is anything but ordinary, and has a completely different persona which is because of a cat! These characters are a unique touch and strives to break out of the ordinary. Bakemonogatari offers us a distinct range of characters that are all unique in its own way, and tries to enhance the show even more with the interactions between the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is definitely a true highlight due to its plot and characters, but it doesn't stop there. Bakemono offers us a unique art style and animation that is just as good as its story and cast. From the moment it started, Bakemono offered us a visual treat unlike any other, and the use of lighting and colours truly brought the world of Bakemonogatari to life. The art is high quality, and the characters are drawn exceptionally well. the background is unique and uses different techniques that you don't see in a regular anime. The fight scenes are also choreographed really well, and the animation is smooth. I mean, what more is there to not like? I was absolutely blown away by Shaft's effort in the new art direction it gave us and it certainly created a visual masterpiece. It was consistent all throughout the entire season, and although some may say that the Nadeko arc was a bit rough on the edges, it didn't mind me at all. Overall, the art and animation of Bakemono was another highlight to the series, and is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari also offered us different new openings for each heroine. My favourite would probably be Nadeko's and Hachikugi's openings as they were upbeat, and the animation sequence it provided was spectacular. The musical score of Bakemono were great too, and each track was done well. The seiyuu's did a good job too, especially Chiwa Saito as the voice of Senjougahara Hitagi.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is by far one of the best animes I have ever seen. Combined with a great plot and entertaining characters, every minute was truly enjoyable. It didn't stop there, as it also presented a visually stunning work, filled with vibrant colours and the animation being generally smooth. The different openings were great, and were always a blast to listen to. Bakemonogatari is definitely something you should watch - and make sure to download it in the highest quality possible to truly enjoy this new anime by SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\nGrade\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A+\\n\\n\r\nStory: A+\\n\r\nCharacter: A+\\n\r\nArt: A+\\n\r\nAnimation: A+\\n\r\nSound: A+\\n\\n\r\nPros: A great story and overall entertaining to watch. The characters were all unique in their own way and the character interactions were nice. The art and animation was absolutely spectacular; a visual masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCons: You are not watching it right this second.\\n",

            "content": "'People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save anyone else'\r\n- Araragi Koyomi\r\nTo begin this review, I shall say that while there were always disagreements whether a certain show was good or not, no series was ever able to split the community like the Monogatari series does. And there will always be the ones saying that it is the best of the best in the anime world, and the ones that will see it as just a pretentious over-the top harem show. Now, before you cast of my review thinking that I'm just going to praise the show, I'll have to ask you tostay until the end, since I started this anime just so I could drop it because, I too, thought that it was just a philosophy for horny weebs. Let me show you what made me change my mind. I'll try my best to keep the review spoiler-free for all the people who haven't yet seen the show.\\n\\n\r\nLets begin with what I think is the reason Bakemonogatari excels more than most of the anime you'll run into: the characters. Now, if you ask any qwasy-elitist about the Bakemonogatari characters, he/she will probably tell you that the characters fall very well into the defined tropes of the anime: unassuming/confused lead protagonist, a female tsundere lead constantly insulting the MC, a bratty loli, a shy and innocent imouto trope, and so on. And on the surface, they are right. But as each of the  characters develop, they restrain themselves of these labels to the point that it almost reaches the deconstruction of the certain anime character tropes. And what Bakemonogatari does so good, is the connection it constantly makes by bonding the story with the characters, making them equally progress.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to further explain the characters, I will base myself on the actual story. Bakemonogatari follows a 18 years-old Araragi Koyomi, who is 1/10 vampire, as he encounters various number of girls. Each of them comes with their own unique story, and a complete arc primary focusing on one specific character. Each of the characters is followed by an apparition (supernatural being) AKA aberration (unusual, unwelcome entity). They are phenomenons of supernatural nature, in which a person is involved, both as a cause and a victim. To be precise, apparitions are the supernatural creations of ones own mind, possessing the host. The story mainly focuses Araragi, with a help of Oshino Meme, the balancer, attempting to help and save those who suffer from such spiritual illness. But then why did I choose that specific quote to begin my review if it now seems incorrect?\\n\r\nAnd so we come across with what makes Bakemonogatari one of the best shows of all time: it is a metaphorical battle with one's own inner self. Each of the apparitions is carefully presented as a specific animal or a monster symbolizing the ones problem. And it is no coincidence that it turns out that each of the monsters turned out to be projected by humans. Or rather, they all seem to resemble the problems of one's own personality, the parts they try to deny and hide from the others by burying them deep inside, and metaphorically constructing a false reality and projecting them into a harsh enemy: a soul-sucking demons, apparitions.  And so the only way to solve the problem is to confront them as what they truly are. the show smartly illustrates the struggle it takes to overcome your own inner pain. And no, that's not pretentious. You need to learn to separate the edginess from the actual depth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to explain that, lets move on to the various elements that make the series work, and how they interact. So, storytelling. Through each well-defined arc, we slowly dig deeper into the character, ripping apart the trope, and revealing what lies beneath. This compelling introspection of the characters is what drives the story. Even tho the show contains some nice well-combined comedy and few action sequences, it primarily revolves around dialogues. A well-packed, meaningful and thought-provoking dialogue, with various use. Whether it is used to serve some good laughs, develop the character or advance the plot, conversation is never there just to fill the 23-minutes of free space, which is expected from the Godlike-writer NisioisiN, who's wordplay transcends beyond just a simple rebuses.\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't just end there. The visual aspect in Bakemonogatari isn't just there for the aesthetic value. Director Tatsuya Oishi takes the whole media into his advantage, making surrealistic and abstractly symbolic visual storytelling. Using the first-person perspective through Araragi's narration, his world remains without the people he has no interest in, whether it'd be an empty street in the middle of the day, or an empty classroom. Every camera angle is focused primarily on what he is interesting in and what he wants us to see, or pay attention to. Otherwise, there is a fantastically fluent animation, incredible use of colors and a regular SHAFT's head tilt. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is there just to keep things alive. It never fails to bring a character motion to life and to project the certain emotion, whether it is making you be at the edge of your sit with eyes wide open as the mystery gets unraveled, or it is making your heart break apart from the sadness of the moment. Boosted with various number of melodies and instruments in soundtrack, the enjoyment is guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude:\\n\r\nPersonally, this show has in itself everything I ever wanted an anime to have. Philosophy, abstract symbolism, depth, fast pacing, interesting and well-written characters, emotional and slightly tearjerking elements, creativity and innovation, and a weird, but unique way of storytelling. All together, an anime that everyone should see, but not everyone will like. It is not a story that will destroy your brain with lots of mindfucks, nor is it one that will ask you questions and make you wonder about the answer. This is not a show that knows everything, but it knows what it knows. It will tell you everything it can and it has the knowledge to.\\n\r\nBut what you will do with it \\n\r\nis up to you.",

I prefer action and suspense and Bakemonogatari did not invoke any feeling in me.\r\nI simply clicked an episode and as soon as it started my mind would wander due to sheer boredom.\r\nThe story was very poor to me, I didn't know what was going on 99% of the time and there are a lot of pointless scenes (fanservice included, I guess). They repeatedly jumped around scenes and there was some skipping here and there... Not that I really cared.\r\nThe art was alright. It wasfine to look at, but wasn't great or \"different\" or anything. You could say the random shots of random things are creative, but they were nuances to me and weren't particularly thought-provoking. They were just random and just, well... There.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, I could bear. It wasn't inspiring and didn't enhance the scenes for me. Sometimes the sound didn't match with scenes. Very confusing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was poor. The characters seemed very one-dimensional. Plastic. I found myself asking the screen \"really...?\" as I watched this series.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely did not enjoy this.

            "content": "ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE, SORRY IF I WRITE SOMETHING WRONG\r\nSpoilers! (kinda)\r\n\u2727 Introduction/the story\r\nBakemonogatari, A story of a guy that casually meets different types of girls throughout the episodes. Coincidentally, all of those girls are possessed by a curse that resembles an animal.\r\n\u2727 The characters\r\nThe protagonist is a guy that wants to help every single girl he meets, even if he met her only 5 minutes ago, just like your typical self-insert protagonist. Like a male lead in every harem out there he is bland, boring, and doesn't know what to do with his life.\r\nThe story just introduces female characters that are all veryarchetypal, but they want to \"hide\" this fact through the pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Most of the time, their role is diminished to flirting with the protagonist, adding nothing to the typical formula.\\n\\n\r\nI might add that the \"jokes\" between the protagonist and the little girl, Mayoi, are very disgusting and uncomfortable. I'm not going to describe all of the girls because they are forgettable due to their lack of charisma and originality. You can describe them in one sentence, except for the protagonist's girlfriend, Senjougahara. She's kind of memorable thanks to her attitude towards the protagonist and because she has the most screen time out of all the females. But she is not an important character after all.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The script\\n\r\nUnless the dialogue is made with a bit of effort, it feels pretentious and unrealistic. It's not intellectual, it's not deep, it only tries to make you think that they are saying something smart, but if you analyze it properly, it makes no sense at all and most of the time it doesn't add anything to what's going on. This is just an attempt to \"not to be like the other harems with empty dialogue and bland characters\", but it ends up being almost the same at the end. Why? I'm going to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided in mini-arcs in which the protagonist meets and interacts with every cursed girl, conveniently, every girl ends up having a \"crush\" on the protagonist, so the show becomes a harem really fast, but there is no plot, there is no sense of progression, there is not a specific goal that would drive the plot. \\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Production values\\n\r\nThe art is amazing and very versatile, but most of the time it feels like an ornament more than an element that would complement the actual story. Sometimes the art has nothing to do with the story or the characters at all. This, plus the dialogue, which is not as smart as everyone says, are the most recognizable elements about this anime, and that's why it's loved so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are very good, they fit the characteres very well. The music is not that memorable and sometimes it feels repetitive, but it's apreciated how they made one opening for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi shots sometimes feel completely out of place, ruining the atmosphere, and the same goes for the jokes. One moment they are trying to sound smart (and failing miserably) and after two seconds the conversation changes its focus to panties or \"touches\". This all happens without a proper transition and I can't take what they are saying seriously because the fast change in tone overwhelmes me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Conclusion\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is try-hard slice of life harem that wasted all its potential to be meaningfully different by staying in its comfort zone and the show ended up being mediocre.",

            "content": "SHAFT's chaotic experiment is certainly a welcome break in creativity for the industry, and Bakemonogatari has all the right elements to make for a great anime: a promising premise, great character design and a shot of insanity. Yet here is a great example of how deliberate attention to detail can cause directors to miss the mark entirely, resulting in a bigger picture that revels blindly in its mediocrity.\r\nThere isn't much of a story. Episodic in nature, Bakemonogatari is driven by an almost Japanese-folklore perspective on loneliness and loss layered beneath the tone of this generation's rebellious youth. Sounds clever enough, but the not-so-subtle hentai subtextcheapens any semblance of artistic endeavor. Perhaps it was a failed experiment at integrating pop-culture critique within its chaotic fabric, but my guess would lean towards a pathetic attempt to draw a larger audience.\\n\\n\r\nBut, well, critics are really going crazy for the art, so I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised. Only to be let down. Hard. Like the unmethodical and distracted camera angles, the artistic choices were made with the most pompous cries for attention. The still-scenes flicker in an epilepsy-inducing fashion, while the gorgeously rendered characters and back drop were drowned in the quickness of the scene-changes and flashes of blank screen with (unreadable) text. Moments that are meant to be mulled over pass too quickly while the more exciting scenes seem to linger with pure apathy. It's almost as if director Akiyuki Shinbo's job stopped pre-cutting-room-floor, leaving the series a chaotic mess with miserable pacing and an unspectacular storyline.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about its fall from grace. Bakemonogatari may still be one of the best series the industry successfully produced in 2009. What SHAFT does well is create a highly entertaining series whose shiny surface can cover its internal flaws. The eclectic feel is enough to draw an audience, while the screenplay and writing remains surprisingly mature despite its rather unfocused story. And while certainly flawed, the artistic expression still garners appreciation for its bold step out of the ordinary. If you are a SHAFT fan, this title is unlikely to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "Story\r\nIn total the anime is divided into 5 arcs (separate and independent stories). In each arc, the main character meets new girls, and helps them to solve their problems with \"monsters\". Thus problems are solved in various ways, they never repeat and therefore the feeling of secondariness doesn't arise.\r\nAt the same time it is possible to see other storylines in the background: Koyomi's relations and Hitagi I consider that it's not a bad move to let the main plot run parallel with the love storyline. Though, I think that it would be possible to develop their relationship more clearly. All of this with great battlesunderway, but more on that later.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nIn most of the cases, animation in Bakemonogatari, serves as an addition to dialogues between the main characters, and that certainly benefits the very anime all the more.\\n\r\nThe picture in an anime is quite unusual - for it studio Shaft should be credited.  The majority of the backgrounds in the anime is rather abstract.  Although it is strange, such an abstraction goes very well with Bakemonogatari - probably because of the type of narration, which is chosen by its creators. The background doesn't distract from the subject line and all attention is engrossed by characters.  And it\u2019s with background that made in some striking colours. Not bad. Everything happening behind the characters is quite chaotic, but it starts to be pleasant to the third episode. \\n\r\nEven continuous flashing of various inscriptions and numbers doesn't prevent from watching this anime but only gives it charm. \\n\r\nCharacters are traced perfectly. And they look good against the background. It should be noted  that characters sometimes appear in strange poses and from some freakish point of view. It only admires the viewer. Dialogues are filled with additional inserts, because of it listening to the dialogue won't bore and there are no wish to turn away even for a second. There is everything that possible. Both bloody scenes and scenes with smart fanservice, and paranormal effects which bewitch the viewer. Fights also look very showily and colourfully. They are dynamic and realistic. Magnificent animation deserves an appreciation.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic plays very important role in the anime. Kosaki Satoru put a lot of effort into creating a huge number of \"small masterpieces\" which are wonderful and catchy. Special charm to culmination points of the anime is given by different variations on the main music themes. \\n\r\nEach opening (there are five of them) corresponds to each heroine\u2019s character.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters - one of the greatest strengths of this creation. All heroes of an anime turned out unique and special. Each character has characters which aren't similar at each other and, of course, each of them they correspond their own special habits and qualities. Founders collected almost all characters existing in an anime in this anime. Each hero is thought over ideally. The main characters should be loved : )\\n\r\nSeiyuus of characters are picked up ideally. They very precisely demonstrate characters as a hero, which forces you to fall in love with them even more. The actor's voice perfectly fits into the atmosphere of an anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMagnificent anime. I would tell anyone that it is a masterpiece. It's a magnificent animation, with a fascinating plot and dialogues filled with sense. I received a sea of pleasure from watching it. Bakemonogatari is an anime in an unusual format. I advise all fans the supernatural and the unusual to watch this anime. This anime really intrigues.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I'm sorry, if there are mistakes in the text. I'm not very good english ^^",

            "content": "Shaft is a studio well known for their weird experimental style, seemingly endless stream of anime in-jokes, and plentiful fan-service. Needless to say their work is an acquired taste and can be hit-or-miss. While this certainly applies to Bakemonogatari, it uses Shaft's signature style very well. Incredibly weird, and at times intentionally obtuse, yet undeniably intriguing and charming (albeit in its own weird way). This is easily one of the studio's best efforts.\r\nThe show follows high school student and former vampire (it's complicated), Koyomi Araragi, through a string of bizarre supernatural happenings. Each happening is centered around an individual (all girls, of course) whom somehowhas become involved in the supernatural, and stumble upon our protagonist, who by nature feels the need to aid them. The show is divided into five arcs, each intriguing and creative on their own right, which are loosely tied to each other into a well thought out whole.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might sound like the show is formulaic, but rest assured, the show's unhinged creativity always keeps things interesting. Every minute feels fresh and engaging, even when a single conversation takes majority of an episode... which happens quite often.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really quite astonishing just how entertaining it is to hearing the characters banter amongst each other. Araragi is a winsome oddball with a healthy amount of snark, it is fun just to listen to him all on his lonesome, and it is even more fun to hear him play off the other characters. The insanely guarded and moody; self-proclaimed 'tsudere' Hitagi Senjougahara has a sharp tongue and a warped sense of humor. The fact that it is hard to tell when she is joking and when she is not makes her all the more interesting to watch. In contrast, the class rep Tsubasa playfully teases Araragi (and the audience). Every character has their own distinct way of talking, as well as their own reoccurring gags and catchphrases, which is exactly what makes their conversations so entertaining to listen to; add to that Shaft's usual cleaver word play and anime in-jokes.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is just as crafty with the supernatural as it is with its dialogue. The show has an uncanny way to tie the characters' issues with the weird supernatural circumstances that afflict them. Whether it is an inability to cope with reality, family problems, or jealousy; the personal problems of the characters are connected to the supernatural in cleaver, and sometimes surprising, ways. A lot is revealed about the characters through their interaction with the supernatural, fleshing out their already likable personalities. The class rep Tsubasa, in particular, gets great character development in the final arc; revealing insecurities hidden behind her playful demeanor. \\n\\n\r\nPossibly the most important factor to Bakemonogatari's success is the relationship between Araragi and Hitagi. Aside from being the focus of the show's opening arc, their developing relationship add continuity to the loosely connected vignettes. This prevents Bakemonogatari from degrading into a puddle of randomness  the way many of Shaft's works often do. Furthermore, their relationship gives the show a nice emotional core for the audience, and it is gratifying to see how their relationship progresses as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, this show has Studio Shaft written all over it. The minimalist and bizarre visual style is not unlike what the studio has done before, in fact it is kind of expected. This, however, does not mean it is any less entrancing to watch. The color scheme is constantly being played around with, and there is always something interesting to look at. The odd camera angles and quick editing fit the show's off-beat tone very well. Character designs are well detailed, especially concerning the girls' assets; and while the backgrounds are not the most stunning you will ever see, they give the show an appropriately surreal atmosphere. Like most works form this studio, the show does get a bit carried away with visual gimmickry, but does not ever get jarringly so. The sound design is splendid; it is very successful in setting the tone, and consistently impressive on its own right. The music itself is excellent; it is especially good at sustaining the mystery and mysticism that envelops the series, and does a great job in the more tense or funny moments as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith Bakemonogatari, Studio Shaft has crafted a very cleaver and highly effective supernatural romp. At the same time, retaining the off-kilter charm that the studio is so well known for. The show is equal parts deranged and heart-felt, creating an experience that feels unique despite the many similarities it has with other Shaft works. It does get too wrapped up in itself at times, but overall it is still a damn good watch.",

            "content": "There\u2019s some debate about whether or not Bakemonogatari (pr. bah-keh-moh-no-gah-tah-re) is an ecchi-harem. A mere six seconds into the first episode, one of the female leads is introduced with a panty shot, and several shots of panties, boobs, and butts are dispersed throughout the series. Aside from two other characters that appear in a few episodes, the main character, Araragi, is the only male, and he\u2019s usually surrounded by females who\u2019ve developed a fondness for him after he helped them in some way.\r\nIs it an ecchi? Most likely. Is it a harem? Probably. Regardless, what distinguishes this series from other ecchi and harem anime isthat this one could still be entertaining without the ecchi and harem elements. It\u2019s not an ecchi with some story, but a story with some ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari, the first adaptation of Isin Nisio's Monogatari novel series, can be summed up as an allegory of how problems grow beyond our control when we don't tend to them. In this story, unsolved problems transform into apparitions that can handicap, possess, and even attack people. This premise was likely inspired by the Buddhist \"\u0101sav\u0101\" concept, which is defined as an influence or mental bias that binds people to their desires and attachments. In this story, various types of mental biases are illustrated through the lives and interactions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was headed by veteran director and animator Akiyuki Shinbou, whose style has become synonymous with the Shaft animation studio. His distinctive use of lines, shadows, and off-centered shot compositions are in full effect here. There are some scenes that are likely just meant to look cool, but, generally, the visuals have purpose and avoid garishness. The visuals are specific, and help to establish tension, isolation, and other tones.\\n\\n\r\nThe true highlight of Bakemonogatari is the Tarantino-esque dialog written by Isin Nisio. When the characters converse, they\u2019re not simply saying things that\u2019ll move the plot forward. They\u2019re having in-depth conversations, free of restraints, that seamlessly transition between topics as conversations do in real life. However, that\u2019s not to imply that the characters take themselves seriously. It\u2019s quite the contrary. The characters often tease and challenge each other, and sometimes break through the fourth wall to make the viewer a part of an exchange.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari Series would be appreciated by most anime fans who enjoy sleek art, witty dialog, the supernatural, and don't mind some fanservice. If you decide to pick it up, I suggest watching it in the order that it was adapted: Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari: Kuro, Monogatari Series: Second Season, Hanamonogatari, Tsukimonogatari, Owarimonogatari, Kizumonogatari.",

            "content": "Winner of the 2009\u2019s popular vote for Best Anime of 2009 on Animereactor, Bakemonogatari is yet another anime that Shaft can add up to their collection. To make it short, Bakemonogatari is overrated.  Overrated in a sense that the animation style has nothing to brag about, the story isn\u2019t unique in any sense and that the characters aren\u2019t even special in the first place. However, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Bakemonogatari is still a very good anime to watch and it is among my favourites of 2009. \r\nBakemonogatari is structured with five story arcs, with the fifth one being aired solely online. Forthose who are Shaft followers you will see no difference in how the story is told in this anime. Just like most of their work, Bakemonogatari\u2019s story is driven by the dialogues rather than the action. This being said, Bakemonogatari dialogues, while they make most part of the story, aren\u2019t exactly telling the story itself. More of a casual discussion between two peoples, the plot is not given away for the purpose of being vomited to the viewer, but it rather flows with the casual talk that the show tends to offer. Now of course, there are some action scenes and fighting scenes in Bakemonogatari, but it is mostly used in a way to conclude an arc or for adding a bit of spice. I have to say that the story arcs aren\u2019t original and can be quite repetitive as it uses the same recipe for each of them. It is repetitive in a way that each story arcs starts the same way and pretty much end the same way as well. Of course, not being original and being repetitive is not a synonym for boring. Bakemonogatari always managed to interest me with each story arcs with its direction toward suspense and climax build up.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a problem with the story arcs and its character. Because the story arcs holds almost no connections toward each others, Bakemonogatari fails in term of characterisation and it always seems that the relation between Senjougahara and Araragi is stalled. Step aside the social and love relations, this series hold way more interest in the characters individually, and by that I mean Senjougahara. While Araragi is an interesting character, he\u2019s nothing different from any other male lead that Shaft use to have, and they all have the same voice actor of course. He may be fitting leading for this anime, but his lack of originality and the fact that he\u2019s just a Shaft preset doesn\u2019t make him a good character. On the other line, Senjougahara, to make it short, is the spotlight character of this show. While the anime tends to put her as a side character, being not so important except for the first arc, she is a woman that is very interesting for her sarcastic tonality and her way to lead everything. Now, there\u2019s nothing that support her characterisation very well and that I have to admit. It\u2019s more of her personality that makes her a good character. Bakemonogatari also has a strong set of side characters that really supports the show very well. These side characters are cool, fun to watch and entertaining, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond those points. Just like any side characters should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual is perhaps one of the most controversial in anime history. I\u2019ll say it, those red screens is not a form of art, it simply a form laziness and does not bring anything, except for pissing off the viewer big time. Now that I\u2019ve talked about those screens, let\u2019s look at the actual art. The visual is nothing original, as it is the same that Shaft uses in almost all of their anime. Bakemonogatari uses lots of pretty colors, high contrasts, typical chalkboards and many cut scenes that one would recognise as a Shaft work. However, the characters are very well made, unique and distinctive. And even though it\u2019s been made dozens of that, I actually never get tired of Shaft\u2019s fancy visual style and it actually compliments the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is on a whole new standard. In fact, it is absolutely amazing. Without no hesitation, Staple Stable became an instant opening favourite for me, and for the ending as well. Bakemonogatari also offers a new opening song for each story arcs that supports the soundtrack very well. The inner songs in the anime actually capture the moments and intensity perfectly. Voice actors are also top notch. Hiroshi might have been using the same kind of voice, but it\u2019s simply because it\u2019s the same kind of character. Chiwa Saito, who also sings the opening, is the highlight voice actress of this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Bakemonogatari has its reason for being overrated, because it is actually enjoyable and very good. Fans of Shaft will obviously love it, and for the others it might as well be a hit or miss.",

            "content": "So it's time to review the one of Monogatari series, Bakemonogatari.\r\nAnd yes, my general opinion about Bakemonogatari is :\r\n\"The interesting thing is not about its story, but its SHAFT-styled story-telling and character development.\" \r\nThat makes every character seems real, as if they are really exist IRL. Let's start from the main protagonist, Araragi Koyomi. Koyomi's character was rather unique, despite his ordinary circumstances for being surrounded by girls, like other harem animes. He was a perverted man, but very wise and willing to try his best to solved his friends' problems. Sounds ordinary though, but in this review I'm talking about SHAFT. Yes, since thisanime was developed by SHAFT, the audiences will definitely have new experience after watching this one. For example, pausing in every \"red scene\". That's the art of trolling, LOL. Every episode was always interesting although each of them have many dialogues. Furthermore, most of them didn't really important, but still worth to enjoy. Audience who used to watch anime with full of action and less dialogue will definitely got bored easily. I felt that at first, but then I realized that those dialogues are needed to develop each of characters' personality.\\n\\n\r\nMain plot of this anime is about Koyomi and Oshino Meme solving problems of these girls: Hitagi, Mayoi, Suruga, Nadeko, and Tsubasa. Each of their stories are good but not really impressed me. The good thing are these two things that I said again and again: story-telling and character development. In addition, the artwork was awesome and extraordinary. Very different from other animes. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let me tell you once again, this is what I like about this anime: CHARACTER. This anime itself has a CHARACTER that really differs it from other animes, not just mere \"physical\" characters. If you know what I mean, hehehe. Talking about characters, the most significant characters of this anime are of course, Koyomi and Hitagi a.k.a the couple. Both of them have unique character. Hitagi claimed herself as a tsundere. But since there is no way a tsundere admit that he/she is a tsundere, so I think her argument is invalid, hahaha.. She was definitely a yandere a.k.a the sadist, but she has sweet and romantic side too. Koyomi successfully take advantage of her sweet side and won her heart. Finally, they started going out.\\n\\n\r\nThen Hitagi revealed herself as a very protective girlfriend. So protective that she won't hesitate to intimidate Koyomi. Koyomi realized that she was dealing with very dangerous girlfriend, so he took his steps carefully to avoid something bad happen to him. Although he tried it, he still couldn't control himself, especially when meeting Mayoi. So, it's a proof that Koyomi is actually a lolicon and yet he was going out with Hitagi. Watch yourself, Koyomi.. hahaha.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime revealed that Koyomi have two little sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. Both of them rarely appeared, and just like alarms to wake Koyomi up. Story of Karen and Tsukihi will be told in Nisemonogatari, this anime's sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, time for summary. This anime have five separated stories, but interconnected. Some unnecessary but hilarious moment and dialogues made this anime have strong character development. The OSTs are amazing, especially first OP by Chiwa Saitou (Hitagi's seiyuu) and the ED song \"Kimi no shiranai monogatari\" by supercell. Therefore, sound is an important factor for this anime. That's why I gave score of 9 for it. For enjoyment, yeah I enjoyed the show. Sometimes I rewatched an episode to read the kanji on \"red screen,\" watch the hilarious moment again, or just enjoying the extraordinary artwork. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, I'd like to say thanks for this anime. This anime really inspires me about the art of story-telling and character development.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all folks! Thanks ^^",

            "content": "Some people says that Bakemonogatari is a milestone in the anime history. That's correct, because before the appearance of this one, the anime industry doesn't know what the ultimate shit is. And now it knows, all of us knows right now. The standard of ugliness, standard of boredom, standard of tastelessness, standard of potboiler, national team of all shounen's cliches, the lowest mark on the scale of the quality from now on has a material incarnation - Bakemonogatari. So it's, no doubt, a great milestone in anime history.\r\nWell, i understand that i have to say something concrete about this series. But what i have towrite about? \\n\r\nA plot? There is no plot. Yes. There. Is. No. Plot. And arcs again. Disjoined arcs, absolutely identical arcs. Because of which Bakemonogatari has no outset, no outcome, no common climax (only within an arcs). And what the hell? The main heroine (as she pretends to be), Hitagi Senjougahara, has a shortest arc and has too few screentime. Closer to the final episodes it looks like her total screentime is even smaller than, for example, Hanekawa's. Episode 12, a part of Hanekawa's arc, and why the hell there is no even mention of Hanekawa in this ep.? Dialogues are an epic twaddle about (literally) nothing with tons of mutually exclusive conclusions, so it's obviously necessary to increase duration of the series and give a reason to the underage seekers of the deep sense to think that Bakemonogatari is a high-intellectual postmodern work. Jokes about \"wait, are we in anime?\" are not postmodernism, it's a motherfucking cliche that pisses the shit out of viewers since at least 1990.\\n\r\nThe world? There is no world. Weak undeveloped universe, second-rate mystery setting, everybody must be bored with already. Author fabricates its rules right in the middle of narration. And again: no outset, no outcome, no common climax. Instead of these we have many minutes of twaddle and not about the Bakemonogatari's universe, not about what's-going-on, not about what-we-have-to-do, but about panties, breasts, virginity, nekomimi and other undoubtedly important for the plot developement things. So, maybe we have to be a little more honest and say that this series is about panties, breasts and other similar \"pillars of the universe\". Fullscreen panties at the 6'th second of episode 1 - a sprinter-like start.\\n\r\nThe characters? Oh, cmon. It's all the same shit, right? Senjougahara is one of the 9000 usual crappy sub-tsunderes, and i confident that tsundere along with moe is a cancer that kills anime. Araragi is a pestered for the last 5-6 years type of protagonists: \"Ah, you such a worthless man but i still love you, don't know why\".\\n\r\nAn art? Oh, it's a biggest sore of Bakemonogatari. Background design and especially those slides... ugh... It's a worst thing i've ever seen in anime. It's just like Endless Eight in \"Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\". A similar pathetic attempt to disguise a low budget, one of the greatest potboilers in history of anime and claim all of this as a special and original idea. And JUST LIKE in case of Endless Eight, crowd becomes wild and yells: \"How deep! Brilliant! Masterpiece!\".\\n\r\nI'm in deepest shock. I nearly had a stroke. The score \"8.46\" totally shreds my ass. Good God! It's bigger than even NGE's. The reviews with overall rating \"10\" and bullshit like \"623 of 858 people found this review helpful\" makes me cry in pain: \"World, what the hell is wrong with you?\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall: -10/10, ultimate shit and worst anime in existence.\\n\r\nAnd sorry for my terrible english. %)",

            "content": "The story follows third year high school student Araragi Koyomi; a past vampire. Over his spring break he was attacked by a vampire thus turning into one. With the help Meme Oshino, an expert in the field of oddities: Who helps Araragi become a human again with payment. The series has a set of chapters, with a heroine in each chapter being induced by an oddity. This show is full of word play, which is the author's strength in his writing of the light novels.\r\nThe art in the series is nothing less than spectacular. The lighting, the animation, the colors is just all so beautiful.The scenes that would be plain have some sort of interesting aspect and life to it. This is done by Studio Shaft (one of my favorite studios) so it's very familiar to those that have seen Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei or Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase. Which are fantastic as well. And yes, Shaft does make use of production slides and storyboards for dialogue or just for some effect on the situation. CAUTION: Some of the storyboards/production slides go by really fast. You're going to have pause to read them.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. I'll mention OPs and EDs. The OPs are great, different ones for chapters and they fit well based on the heroine of the chapter. The ED is by supercell (they did the theme for Cencoroll as well) is fantastic, the animation in the ED is personally a favorite of mine. Now, to the real sound that counts, the BGM. It's great, fits every scene well and adds emotion to them as well. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is all over the place. Araragi is overly kind and tries to help anyone he can. Amongst the heroines there are the basic characters that stick out. There is Hitagi Senjougahara who describes herself as a tsundere. She speaks in a very threatening way to anyone. Suruga Kanbaru, a self-proclaimed lesbian, masochist, and fujoshi. Many other characters appear with other personalities which gives a delectable assortment of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is definitely one to check out; one of my favorites from this season. With the overtone of spirits, mythological creatures, ghosts, and gods there is room for romance in this anime as well. Chapters are relatively short (limited to three/two episodes for one chapter) but capture a lot of the story through this dialogue heavy anime. An anime to a remember with the great depth of the characters and how the chapters help the characters develop.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is the first third of the first season of the Monogatari Series, a series of novels originally written by author NisiOisiN which were later adapted into an anime by Studio Shaft.\r\nI first got introduced to the series through the internet, mainly YouTube, even before I started watching anime as a hobby.\r\nSo one day I decided to pick it up out of curiosity and I was absolutely amazed with what I witnessed.\r\nAnd now I'm going to develop on why I think this is one of best anime series of the 2000s and 2010s\r\nNarrative: 10/10 (Fantastic)\r\nThe way the story of the Monogatari Series is told isthrough characters-centric arcs which, in the case Bakemonogatari, are composed by groups of 2 to 5 episodes that focus mostly on the problems of one of the specific members of the cast and the subsequent solving or halting of said problems while, at same time, commenting on them.\\n\r\nEvery arc is handle with care, doing an excellent job at introducing, exploring and developing the character that is being focused, as well as the other pre-existing characters by showing more of their individual personalities, their views of the world and other people.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (Fantastic)\\n\r\nThe cast is filled to the brim with complex, likeable, memorable and relatable characters each with their distinct and quirky personalities which make them amazingly entertaining to watch and favourite character material for a lot of people including myself.\\n\r\nAlso, the way the narrative is written and structured and the chemistry between all the characters make them shine even more individually.\\n\r\nIf I had one complaint to make in this department would be Nadeko who's character is by far the least interesting of the girls and of all the characters in general. But this is just a nitpick since it is a problem that can be solved with future seasons.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal favourites: Araragi, Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Oshino, Kanbaru and Hachikuji.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 10/10 (Fantastic)\\n\r\nStudio Shaft did an excellent job at giving the Monogatari Series a very distinct, polished and simply amazing look that still holds up even when compared to the anime coming out in the present day.\\n\r\nThe detailed and fluid animation, particularly in the few action scenes, is just a delight for the eyes that put most action anime to shame.\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the visuals that is worth pointing out are the changes in artsyle, with references and visuals gags, that help a lot in magnifying and expressing the feelings of the characters at those specific moments.\\n\r\nAlso, the use of the short-duration images of text shown mostly when Araragi is thinking add to the distinct presentation of the show and show us, the viewers, more of what is going through his mind.\\n\\n\r\nAudio: 10/10 (Fantastic)\\n\r\nThe fantastic soundtrack composed by Satoru Kosaki elevates every moment in which it is used in, be it the conversations, monologues or more tense scenes.\\n\r\nThe five opening themes sang by the voice actresses of the main girls of the show are all amazing and memorable songs with a lot of personality and the ending theme by band Supercell is a beautiful and hard hitting song that perfectly describes how Senjougahara feels about Araragi.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else to say here honestly\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Fantastic)\\n\r\nI loved every aspect of this show and thoroughly enjoyed all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend every anime fan to give this a shot.\\n\\n\r\nWritten on the 2nd of January, 2019\\n",

            "content": "I would wait until the series is done before writing a review, but unless episode 15 is a complete bomb that ruins the whole the show, then my opinion probably isn't going to change. Bakemonogatari is one those special animes that come out maybe once every couple years. On the surface it appears as a generic harem show with a funky artstyle and tongue-in-cheek characters. But I would be selling it short if I said that was it,  Bakemonogatari at its core is a deconstruction/parody of the harem genre. \r\nBakemonogatari's story is nothing special. The basic premise involves a boy named Koyomi Araragi comingacross and solving people's problems or \"oddities\", which is to say supernatural anomalies. The plot is there simply to propel the characters around and move them from situation A to situation B. Though that's not necessarily a bad thing since storytelling isn't the focus of this anime. The narrative recognizes itself for what it is: exposition that that merely leads the characters along a path but never actually becomes a focal point. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're looking for a good plot, you definitely won't find one here.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of the show, and the main reason why anyone would watch it at are the characters. This is where the harem deconstruction sctick comes into play, all the characters are written as realistically as possible which is a stark contrast to most harem shows. Most of the time, the female characters fall madly in love with the male lead for stupid reasons, yet in Bakemonogatari, the relationships are written well and are feasible. Not to mention that there's a very tongue-in-cheek approach to all the archetypes that have become so common in anime. The female lead for example, Senjougahara is a self-proclaimed \"tsundere\" yet she displays not of the traits common in other characters of the same archetype. If anything, she comes across as more of a kuudere/yandere. Araragi also displays characteristics that aren't typical of a harem lead. Most are spineless self inserted Gary Stus that the entire cast loves for no apparent reason, while Araragi is a snarky anti-social punk that comes across as more of a shounen lead. Needless to say all of the characters are well written and its fun to see them interact with each other on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is another main feature of the series. I've heard many people say that its intelligent and witty, but in my opinion its neither of those two. The dialogue is extremely fast paced so it might give off the impression of being witty when its actually just poking fun at itself. Many of the exchanges between characters tend to meander around aimlessly and have no real significance at all, but if anything that's a testament to how enjoyable the show is. If the majority of an episode can be filled with nothing but absurd dialogue and still manage to be extremely entertaining and funny then I'd say its doing its job incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has a very clean look to it, albeit a bit generic yet its extremely stylized. There's a lot of debate over the animation, but there a big difference between bad animation and not that much of it. All the actions that are animated are well done and smooth, characters generally move around while talking and don't make static facial expressions. The lip flaps also aren't just the open and close variety, characters do give off a decent impression that they're forming vowel sounds with their mouths instead of just the old open and close routine. The bottom line is that a show like Bakemonogatari doesn't really need animation, hence all the skepticism when it was being adapted. However Shaft did a good job to play to the show's strengths and all the stills/cuts are there to get the viewers to focus on the dialogue. Simply watching people talk would get boring but the frantic cuts and text screens keep the viewers on their toes and have them focus on the audio aspects when the visuals are far too haphazard to make sense off. All the style definitely works in favor of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are all terrific, they do a splendid job in delivering the lines with the perfect amount of emotion or lack of in some contexts. The background music itself isn't too memorable, has a nice beat when everyone is rambling on and becomes dramatic during important scenes. The openings are all really catchy and well sung by the female cast. The ending in particular is probably one of the best I've seen/heard in general. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I had lots of fun watching this anime. One important thing to realize is that its best to go in not having any expectations for this show. I had no idea what I was getting into when I first started watching and I'm glad I didn't. If I had to put a label on it, I'd say that it's tremendously quirky and its awesome for it, sorta like FLCL. It has a lot of charm, and if you take it for what it is, you'll enjoy it too.",

            "content": "So let's imagine for a moment a world where harem anime wasn't susceptible to so many bad tropes, the MC wasn't a complete dolt, and all the female cast were fleshed-out microcosms of pure fun. Now, let's make all the female VA's do openings for the arcs of their characters and then toss in some silly innuendos that are ultimately non-intrusive and part of the ride. Now, multiply it by Mr Bones' Wild Ride (Google it). Ready?\r\nBakemonogatari is the first in the Monogatari series and unlike the adaptations of the rest of the novels, it aims to bash your brains out with how fun itis. Each arc seems self-contained at first and like GitS: SaC does contribute to the overall story, but unlike the other it doesn't seem to notice that there is an overarching plot. As if self-aware, the series takes every opportunity to tell you what's what and then turn around and say \"Oh, I was lying.\" before dragging you through another story; and believe me when I say it doesn't need to drag you.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is wrong with the music? Nothing. Every OST from the high-energy \"Iroboke Neko\" to the almost creepy \"Hyouri\" and even soft, melodic \"Senjoughara Tare\" make each scene they're used in feel all the more authentic. But then there are the openings. \"We have a budget? Since when\" went one SHAFT employee. \"Since forever. Money doesn't just grow on trees.\" Replied the other. \"What is this 'money'? Sounds like some bullshit you just made up.\" Employee 1 retorted angrily. \\n\\n\r\nBut I would be lying if I said the music made the series. While a big factor, you'll end up staying for the art and animation. Each scene is cleverly put together with a combination of posing (sometimes in ways that seem painful) and \"cut-ins\" of the MC's thoughts in text. Perhaps because the budget was kill on the music (\"DAMMIT MAN, I'M THE BOSS! JUST USE CUT-AWAYS TO TEXT AND GET ME MORE MUSIC!\") but the stylish method they do this with feels too natural to be anything but a welcome addition. The only issue is our \"cut-ins\" don't last long enough to read through before returning to the scene and you might feel the need to go back and read it. Personally, it flowed really well.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do people enjoy this series so much aside the music and art? The characters. There is a waifu for everyone and no-one and while it is typical \"Everyone loves MC\" harem style, the personalities feel fresh and the interactions are anything but typical. Sengoku Nadeko is the only character the fanbase can't find it in themselves to like (until Second Season) and it's understandable and at the same time not. The \"Fire Sisters\" are the MC's siblings and our first shot of them leaves a bad impression that is later fixed. Finally, Tsubasa Hanekawa, Hachikuji Mayoi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade Shinobu Oshino are the female cast held in the highest regard for this part of the series. Later on, Karen Araragi and Tsukihi Araragi get their well-deserved spotlights while additions to the female cast only work to freshen things up.\\n\\n\r\nShould you try Bakemonogatari? Not if you have a life and aspirations for it. This series will pull you in and keep you from escaping with a combination of sharpened pencils and duct tape. And the best part is, you'll enjoy it.",

            "content": "*Spoilers included*\r\nRegret lives inside everyone: It's an unstoppable feeling that at times can drive some into a corner \u2014 make them stop progressing as they can't overcome the hurdle that is their past. But that doesn't have to weigh people down. They can't change their past, neither should they desire to. People are who they are because of all of their experiences. No matter how big of a hit a person takes, they can get back up and learn from it, find ways to utilize it and make their lives better in the future.\r\nIn Bakemonogatari that regret is personified through \"aberrations\": gods and beings thattake advantage of people when they're at their worst. Often times however, they do so with the consent of the \"victims\". People are given a chance to fix their situation with the help of inhuman powers, and so they take it without a second thought. While aberrations initially seem to just be a depiction of their pasts and regrets; they also symbolize the parts of them hidden deep in their hearts, waiting to be unleashed...\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, one could see why Araragi is such a fitting protagonist for the Monogatari series. As I mentioned, the show is mostly about characters understanding their feelings and facing them to remove their inner demons; both figuratively and literally. In that case, the person that would interact with them would have to be someone who would allow for that process to be put in motion, and Araragi is exactly that. He's the show's catalyst thanks to his specific set of traits. The main one would be his empathy, which allows him to spot the problems in the first place. He himself is half vampire and has helped his friend get rid of an aberration before, so it's safe to say that he's at least knowledgeable enough to spot a similar issue, but that's not the only reason why he decides to help. Simply put: He's just like that. He really wants to help people, or how he puts it, allow others to help themselves. If the person wants to change but just can't do it, he will do anything in his power to allow for that to happen, often time without regard for his own well being, so not only is he empathetic, he's an altruist as well. That combination can prove to be all sorts of dangerous, as he pushes himself far more than any mortal can. He comes close to death numerous times for the sake of people he barely knows and doesn't really owe anything to. Again, he's just that type of a person.\\n\\n\r\nThis attitude proves to be difficult not only to him, but to others that he interacts with. As Araragi develops bonds with other characters, he becomes a meaningful part of their lives; everyone sees him as someone special, be that their savior or their love interest.\\n\r\nThe first character we see Araragi push towards a better future is Senjougahara Hitagi: His mysterious and withdrawn classmate. Her tragic past is revealed in the second episode, and more importantly, so is the reason for her frigid persona. She doesn't want to get close to others because her trust has already been severely damaged. Her mother, who's been a part of a cult, brought home a person that attempted to rape young Senjougahara. The impact of that situation followed her around until she met the aberration that caused a massive change in her life. From there on out, her future started revolving only around getting rid of that creature, and after experiencing people failing at that and cheating her out of her money, her distrust in humanity kept progressing... until she met Araragi.\\n\r\nMeeting him - the first person who offered help without a promise of a reward and came out with actual results - allows for a healing process to start. Senjougahara can once again believe in and get close to someone, not to mention that she was finally freed of her burden. A relationships starts to blossom between the two. That relationship technically comes out of nowhere. Senjougahara revealed her feelings all of a sudden and Araragi responded with a \"yes\". It could've been anyone else for both of them, but it just so happened that one had the courage to ask and the other had the courage to respond.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that \"just happen\" in Monogatari, as you'll notice. The main storyline focuses a lot on destiny and fate, things that just sort of happen and how that sets others in motion.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari is structured in a way where every character gets their own arc or arcs, in which they take the main stage. In this instalment, we are presented with five smaller storylines, however they do create a cohesive and coherent plot for the season, mainly revolving around Araragi's and Senjougahara's relationship. Them beginning to date sets off a chain reaction, starting with Kanbaru Suruga's arc and culminating in Hanekawa Tsubasa's arc. One simple, on the spot decision caused major consequences for the rest of the cast, be that immediately or throughout the next seasons. Each event from the past gains more and more meaning as the time goes on, because you understand it's importance and what has it caused. The flow that it maintains is precisely what makes Monogatari's style of storytelling so impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, like a proper story would, Bakemonogatari's plot has a beginning, then proceeds to add crises along the way, raising the tension until the climax point, and finally resolving it, definitely or indefinitely in some cases. However, on top of that, it's also able to consistently introduce new characters; while also giving them proper exposition and develop their own storylines. Nothing really stands still in Monogatari. Each new element seems like it can't work, like there's too much for the writers to work with already, but the show handles it with such care and attention to detail, leaving subtle clues along the way so that no event will ever feel like it lacked meaning. Making the whole thing even more impressive is the fact that each addition is unlike anything we've seen before, they all bring in new traits, attitudes, gags, questions and ways of exploring Monogatari's thematic depth. All that and it still manages to maintain a good, steady flow and a clear idea of what it wants to do. There's no amount of words that could describe my respect for Bakemonogatari's writers upon a realization of the work they put into this and how great it truly ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to a competent team, the show gets enough time and space to really dig deeper than most anime stories do. Unlike them, it has time to explore its values, not just rush through the story and leave no human emotions behind. Bakemonogatari takes time to look into most of the characters views on topics important to the show's thematic depth, giving the viewer an understanding of things such as Araragi's and Kanbaru's moral codes, Hanekawa's inner dilemmas, or Senjougahara's doubts and thoughts about people creates a certain image. That image responds directly to the viewer. It often holds very little importance to other characters, but to people watching, knowing the characters so well not only helps with a better comprehension of their future actions, but also provides dilemmas to think about.\\n\r\nNobody in Monogatari is inherently right about everything, their worldviews are twisted by their pasts, by the aberrations that dwell inside them. It's through the bits and pieces of happy moments that we see what's truly right. Araragi's and Senjougahara's first date is a prime example of a way things should be like. It's a pure moment, clear of any evil and doubt, as it replaces them with passion, trust and truth, all that wrapped inside a beautiful, heart grabbing conversation between two lovers. This is truly how it should be, and the show sells you on this idea by inserting it in episode twelve, amidst all the chaos that goes on in Araragi's life, after he's nearly been killed and just before he nearly gets killed again. And to think that this episode, as well as most of the show leading up to it, consists primarily of dialogues and monologues.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari rarely gets flashy, if it does it's for a climax of an arc where the aberrations reveal themselves, which really requires a lot of tension and excitement given their fantastical nature, however besides that, the show is pure talk. Initially off-putting, this kind of storytelling supports the two pillars on which the story is built: Character interactions and exploration of their psyche. Despite the constant array of words, almost nothing is thrown in your face; each trait is showcased through individual decisions and actions, only being revealed at the end, for those who couldn't catch onto their meaning. Araragi choosing to help people constantly showcases his empathy. Hanekawa hiding her true feelings is a sign of her shyness and modesty. Senjougahara's obnoxious behaviour is a part of her defence mechanism. Hachikuji telling everyone that she hates them provides a clue to her real intentions. There's just almost no dialogue in which character relationships don't progress or the viewer doesn't learn something about said characters. Bakemonogatari is very dense in that aspect. It can get confusing at some points because of it, but if you pay close attention, there's something that should help with catching onto the most important aspects: It's the directing.\\n\\n\r\nAkiyuki Shinbou and his team utilized a few ways to both make the dialogue interesting visually and to emphasize the flow of a conversation. Undoubtedly their best idea was using silence when a discussion ends or stops to change to a different one, giving the viewer an easily noticeable sign of a change in topic or pace. This is often accompanied by an out of place shot, focusing on things like the outside of the place the scene is taking place in, an object inside the room, the characters eyes and so on. Due to the rather fast pace of the dialogue and the plot in general, those shots are a great way to give out fast bits of information, like the layout of a room or the current feelings of people included in the scene. Those types of shots are also often used for comedic effect, for example, during a conversation we switch between two perspectives of Araragi and Senjougahara talking, until at one point she casually throws a witty remark and as we cut back to Araragi, we can't see him, until the camera pans down and we see the defeated man lying on the floor. There's lots of stuff like that throughout the show, making it never feel like it's running out of steam. Lastly, the use of sound. The music isn't supposed to draw attention to itself, it serves as background for the characters as their tone of voice and their line delivery sets the tone and pace of a scene. For that reason most of the soundtrack is comprised of monotonous, steady sounds put on repeat, all of which are certainly pleasant to hear. Because the music isn't all that noticeable, the show uses sound in other ways: There are sudden burst or cut outs of sound accompanying the previously mentioned breaks in conversations. One of my personal favorite things is how the key lines are often highlighted by some sort of an effect mixed in with the characters voice, allowing for an easier watch for people paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nThose examples are only a few of the ways Bakemonogatari makes itself interesting. I think this shows how much passion and creativity was put into this project, as well as how fun it was to make it. There are so many little touches and so many big ideas in the show, it truly feels like it aimed for something more, like it was meant to nudge its viewers with certain ideas, to give them a sort of a lesson, not just an experience that will fade as time goes on. I believe it succeeded in that. Despite me needing a re-watch to give it a proper chance, once I did I came to a realization that Bakemonogatari does go that extra step. It dares to state an opinion about the world as a whole, about human cruelty and the faults that reside within our society. By giving them a physical form, their consequences become more than just thoughts inside of the victim's head. Crab Gods that take away people's weight, invisible snakes that squeeze your body or cat aberrations that take over your body to release stress  may not exist, but you know what does? Problems such as people hating their body after being raped, leading to medical issues like anorexia, bullying leading to the bullied kids scarring themselves, uncontrollable fits of rage as a result of pathology and other issues in life.\\n\r\nBakemonogatari doesn't provide all the answers, it's only the first season of a long story. Slowly, episode after episode it analyses individual issues of each character, even adding some along the way, and eventually arrives at conclusions for each, giving off the author's overall look on the world, as cruel as it is. That's exactly why I believe watching Monogatari is worth it. You may not like it's style that I gushed about, you may not like the way the plot works, but if watched with enough attention it can really provide the viewer with something important, but finding that is something everyone has to do for themselves. After all, nobody can save you, you can only save yourself.",

            "content": "There isn't really a middle road to be found with Bakemonogatari. It's a show that one may take in much delight or endeavor in extreme frustration. Those familiar with director Akiyuki Shinbo will know why since he brings a style of visuals and direction that is often very surreal and frantic. He meshes together typography with a world of visual captivation that accentuates every action, conversation, and detail. This style of direction is then applied to the extremely heavy, fast paced dialogue of Nishio Ishin's Bakemonogatari which also tends to include a lot of word play. Some may find this combination to be akin tothe creation of Frankenstein, but the way I see it, the two form an awesome combination that has yielded a strikingly imaginative, engaging, and most importantly, an entertaining experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Bakemonogatar revolves around the male character Araragi Koyomi, whom apparently has recently gone through some supernatural events that led him to temporarily becoming a vampire, though he still has some after effects, and how he proceeds to encounter more and more of these types of events where he ends up trying to help several girls get through these problems. The structure of the story thus lends itself mostly to developing its characters in arcs, which is really what this show is mostly about. The dialogues, conversations, and banter of the characters which serves as the main source of entertainment in the show, is also the main tool of character exposition. Throughout each arc the many conversation strings often to converge to propel a couple of main ideas and movements in character relations.\\n\\n\r\nThis of course just shows how critical Bakemongatari's cast is to the show, and like the show itself, the characters are representative of its imaginative and engaging style. Some of them are childhood friends, random strangers, potential love interests, or friends of friends, all of which bring something to the table in some form or another.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular the main female lead, Senjogahara Hitagi is at the forefront of this. She has several characteristics that make her a memorable, and unique character. Firstly, in contrast with the usual overly sweet cream-puff girl, Hitagi is very witty, frank, and upfront about everything. She also has a tendency for sharp and biting sarcasm. To top it all off, she is self-deprecating. She realizes that her sometimes aggressive and jealous side is a fault. Even though she is nicknamed in the story as \"tsundere-chan,\" and even calls herself one at some point in jest, she really is so much more than that usual tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nI often find that tsundere characters in anime are often dishonest with very everyone around them including themselves, often have very few attractive or redeeming traits, and are also very needy. Hitagi is not like this at all though. She is often more than willing to try and improve herself as a person. Many times tsunderes form what I call doormat relationships (One person is basically grovelling at the feet of the other character) with their love interests, which tends to be a very souring experience, but Hitagi does not. Hitagi and the main lead Koyomi actually ends up forming one of the most balanced and believable relationships around where neither serves as a doormat for the other.\\n\\n\r\nIt must be said though that Hitagi is not the only character that seems to flaunt their trope in one way or another, or manages to bring something with just a little more substance underneath. We also have for example the main character Araragi Koyomi. Koyomi while displaying the usual traits of being the kind and helpful main lead, also has a lot of personality about him. He is not so kind to let somebody run over him with words and is willing to trade in biting remarks, and at the same time may even be a bit of a  sociopath in nature, whether it be his perversions or treatment of others. So while there is ample reason why many of the characters end up liking him, he is not sold as the perfect human being either, which really in a way naturalizes a lot of the story. \\n\\n\r\nIt is important to note this because the relationships  in this story are not  merely formed on weak pretenses such as random whims of kindness. A lot of it is how the chemistry of the characters work. Characters in the story do not simply become friends in name, but actually learn about and try to understand each other. The conversations are a two way street, where you really get the impression that there two human beings interacting and figuring out stuff about each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt is these types of nuances in the characters that really exemplify Bakemonogatari's strengths. The series does not rely on cookie cutter formulas or anything of the sort, but actually goes above and beyond the usual tropes to bring truly genuine story telling which is utterly indispensable to any great story. Must of this is owed of course to just how self-aware this story is and how it makes sure to come across as above the average run of the mill stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, love it or hate it, Bakemonogatari certainly is a unique experience that I think anyone should be willing to try out. It lives or dies by its crazy style, but it really manages to leave an impression one way or another. In my personal point of view, Bakemonogatari has offered one of the most pleasurable and interesting viewing experiences in the last few years.",

            "content": "So Koyomi Araragi's this ordinary high-schooler, only one fateful night he's ambushed by a predatory vampire in an underpass and if it weren't for the sudden intervention of the mysterious stranger in his neighbourhood given to spouting sardonic witticisms about the occult he'd have been in real trouble, so now he's one-quarter bloodsucker with preternatural healing powers, mentoring under the mysterious stranger to pay back his debt, investigating his classmates' run-ins with the paranormal.\r\nAnd all that gets set up in the time it would have taken most series to run their opening credits.\r\nBakemonogatari ('ghost/monster stories'), adapted from the light novels by Nisio Isin, is ashow bursting at the seams. It's well aware of genre conventions - there's an extended panty shot only seconds into episode one - but it's toying with them, revelling in wordplay, in-jokes and running its fingers along the fourth wall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe production design draws heavily on artist Vofan's original illustrations for the light novels - this is a distinctive, eye-catching world of layered silhouettes in soft pastel colours, using minimal animation, staccato cutting between still frames and copy and paste to sly, humorous effect (like the running visual gag that every car looks exactly the same). Studio Shaft are obviously angling to save money, but it's done so neatly it rarely becomes an issue - Araragi's errant plume of hair mirroring his emotional state, or psychedelic colour changes camouflaging some truly gruesome violence later in the series. Few shows in recent years have played so strongly to the limitations of the medium.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say Bakemonogatari is ever less than visually inventive. Stop-motion collages, live-action models and super-deformed characters all crop up but the standout feature is undoubtedly the wordspam peppering every episode, passages from the novels flashed rapid-fire in between shots like a soundless inner monologue. Even subtitled, the effect is (literally) staggering, almost synaesthetic - sometimes played for laughs, sometimes ramping up the atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time Bakemonogatari is very much pitched totally straight. For all the rampant self-indulgence, every story arc is a neat, succinct and often startlingly emotional exploration of someone's pain, and how Araragi can't stop himself from trying to help them, even if it's not always in his best interests.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere's even an odd restraint, even maturity, in some of the most blatant fanservice Shaft dream up. Troubled female lead Hitagi Senjougahara graces a shower scene as censor-baiting as they come, yet her lack of concern with her own nudity is a world away from the tropes of the stereotypical harem series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe camera keeps drifting back to her, naked or semi-clothed, again and again but the way in which she taunts Araragi is characterised far more as dry amusement at - and later genuine, grudging admiration for - his innate goodness rather than yet another succubus with a one-track mind. And yes, there's pain there, too; Senjougahara's problem (the subject of the first story arc) is she's nearly weightless, her mass a fraction of what it ought to be. 'Now you're just showing off,' Araragi accuses her. 'I'm just not good at wearing clothes,' she corrects him quietly. 'They're too heavy.'\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time the constant sense the show is largely preaching to the converted - clich\u00e9s are clich\u00e9s to some extent, regardless of whether they're being sent up - does make for heavy going. Viewers with little tolerance for anime excess could well find the opening arc a turn-off, and it doesn't exactly let up - on top of acres of skin there's over-sexualised under-age characters, lipstick lesbianism, shrill, hyper-speed Japanese pop music, occasional showers of gore and more besides.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome will take such a list as a ringing endorsement, others will probably flee in terror. It bears noting Shaft never allow any of this to drive the narrative, though. Anyone looking to be pandered to outright is probably going to leave disappointed. The genre elements are always part of the dynamics - for every wink to the audience, every popcorn moment there's a scene of quiet introspection, artistic beauty or clever verbal sparring and they're all just as effective.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAraragi is a likeable, admirable lead for all his naivete, and he and his friends readily invite the viewer's empathy without (or despite) mugging for the camera. We care whether their problems get resolved, and where his relationship with Senjougahara is headed (yes, a couple in a shounen series who - for all their lunatic idiosyncracies - openly confess their feelings, actually talk things through and plan for the future!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, for such an utter fantasy Bakemonogatari feels strikingly human. The self-indulgence is undeniably part of the appeal - the show is hugely entertaining and frequently very funny - but for all it can be wickedly crass it also displays subtlety and a kind of grace lacking from far too many mainstream productions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIgnored by distributors at the time of writing, currently only available on (non-English friendly) Japanese DVD and Bluray or fansubtitled digital release, for any anime fan after something playful or experimental - a portmanteau of witty short stories, beautifully drawn and scripted with genuine heart - Bakemonogatari comes hugely recommended.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is a creative and unique anime that meshes fantasy with your modern-day harem/romance; it falls short of greatness, but is distinctively good. By incorporating a balanced mix of action, fanservice, and subtle romance, Bakemonogatari aims to please a wide variety of viewers although it is directed towards fantasy, harem, and ecchi viewers specifically.\r\nAs one of the first animes made based on a novel, Bakemonogatari possesses many elements that an anime viewer would find refreshing including distinct character personalities and a non-recycled storyline. The animation itself is fairly original and the plot was stunningly detailed at times.\r\nThere are many things a typical viewer can appreciateabout Bakemonogatari. One can notice the producers of the anime were aiming for a home run. The voice acting and songs itself were amazing. The plot was uniquely represented; it just had a new feel altogether. While Bakemonogatari will not be seen as a great anime, the development of the anime had one thing in common with many great animes: it presented the story in new and innovative way. For a bit, it was superb and appeared to have major potential, but the producers of the anime just couldn't finish it off with a twist.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Bakemonogatari is stunning at first, there is a dropoff. Many aspects in the anime were decent, but it never fully came together to produce an awe-inspiring finish that would slap the viewers in the face and cause them to think, \u2018This was great.\u2019 It didn\u2019t come close.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw in Bakemonogatari was the underdevelopment of many, if not, all of the characters. Each character had a personality that stood out, but there just didn't seem to be enough substance to make any of them shine.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Bakemonogatari might have done a big favor for anime viewers by opening a new door for modern-day animators: novels. In a time when game-based animes are receiving a lot of hype and publicity, yet lack in breadth and plot, Bakemonogatari offers a potential alternative. In the beginning, Bakemonogatari seemed to possess some rare characteristics of your modern-day anime, intriguing detail and uniqueness; unfortunately, it disappointedly ended up just being decent.",

Say what you will about animes like Ghost In The Shell, FLCL, Evangelion etc and how they're heavy handed, full of themselves, whatever but at least in those animes, SOMETHING WAS FUCKING HAPPENING! \r\nand I know all Monogatari fans are gonna tell me that I don't \"get it\" to which I reply \"What's there to get?\" It's a fucking harem anime with a nice budget. It's about a bunch of assholes talking about NOTHING for what seems like a small eternity and then add in some supernatural shit about ghosts justso you can call it a plot and pretend that there's something there.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the person who created this was like \"Hmm, I want to make something that features all my otaku fetishes but I don't wanna seem like a pig so I'll give it a supernatural element so it'll seem like I'm not just making a harem anime and have the characters talk about mostly pointless shit but these conversations will go on for a long time so it'll seem avant\u2013garde\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to give you some advice that if you're going to watch this show. Watch the first story arc only that for two reasons:\\n\r\n1. It focus primarily on Hitagi Senjougahara, she's really cool and the only character besides Kanbaru in this show that I find interesting (Seriously, why are purple hair women in anime so perfect?) and \\n\r\n2. You'll know what the show is like after that and there will be no reason to watch the rest at all, you won't be missing much. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, all these stories are the same exact story: Koyomi comes across a pretty girl (in the most empty town in the world apparently), finds out that she has a ghost problem with an animal theme, he tries to help (usually by bringing her to Oshino) and she gets better from the ghost in someway shape of form and I just gave you the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nUsually in these story arcs, they spent about 3 quarters of the time talking alot about nothing important at all. A typical conversation in this show goes like this \"Hey, I wonder if I have a sister complex. Anime fans love wincest shit so lets beat that shit into the ground until the actually conflict comes in\" and then the actually ghost shit gets dealt with.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't even mind this so much if they only did these scenes when the characters are bored and they have nothing better to do except they do it even in when they have something important to do. Like when Koyomi is taking Kanbaru to see Oshino to help fix her, you'd think this would be a good time to shut the fuck up, right? NO, they talk some more about if Koyomi makes a good Uke or not and all I'm thinking is \"What the fuck does this have to do with anything?!\" and I laugh soon after that because the scene ends with Koyomi saying \"lets stop wasting time chatting and lets go\" It's like the characters themselves know that what they're saying is bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nDoesn't help that alot of the time there are these obnoxious title cards that keep popping up that are really only there to say shit that probably doesn't mean anything or to point out the blatantly obvious like when Oshino would call something Rainy Devil and then a title card would appear saying \"Rainy Devil\" like gee thanks, I really needed you to tell me that\\n\\n\r\nThe music's nice... when it's not constantly repeating itself and I don't mean they use the same songs but for different scenes, no I mean they repeat the songs on a 5 to 10 second fucking loop. You could say the the music needed to repeat itself to catch up with the dialogue which first of all, that's just shitty writing if that's the case but it's not, I've seen some episodes of Katanagatari (written by the same guy) and it didn't have this problem, the composer for this show did a terrible job, pure and simple. I felt like I was watching Manos: The Hands Of Fate with this fucking soundtrack. Hip Hop music doesn't repeat itself as much as this soundtrack does (I actually like hip hop btw).\\n\\n\r\nOkay aside from everything else I've bitched about, what do I like? The art and animation. This is seriously one of the best looking animated tv shows I've seen. This animation is so good, it could probably work well for a movie or ova and there are alot of very striking imagery in this show and they're all very memorable. You could probably take a snapshot of almost any scene in this show, and put it in an art museum, it's that good but good art work and animation is about all this show has really\\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen the other entries in the Monogatari series but from what I'm told, they seem to have even less of a story than Bakemonogatari and just seem to focus on the conversations and the fan service which you know what, that's fine if that's what you're into. If you like to watch this series for the witty banter and the fanservice then that's alright but lets not pretend that there's much to this show outside of that. I'd probably like these other ones better because they cut the bullshit and don't even pretend to be anything more than what they are or at least that's the impression I'm getting from them\\n\\n\r\nI never want to hate something that's popular, why would I want that? I'm always upset that I don't love something the way most people do because I wanna share that love with people and have a good time, so if any Monogatari fan wants to enlighten me about this show, by all means you're welcome to try, maybe you can convince me and maybe I at least can understand why you like this outside of obvious reasons but as it stands this is just a pretentious, artsy, pointless piece of crap trying to appeal to the hipster otaku crowd and I personally wouldn't recommend it\\n",

Absolutely not would I actually lead people to watch an anime that is not very \"user-friendly.\" However, what I do believe is how people can actually be open to new things in anime and perhaps be open-minded about the whole aspect of somewhat ecchi or bloody content. I guess you could say that the content is mainly for adults but anime in itself is holistic and in many ways is not restricted to serving one audience. So enough with that argument\r\nBakemonogatari by the name initself is a wordplay between two words; bakemono (monster) and monogatari (story). Of course a name like this would bring people into thinking, \"It might be just your typical supernatural show.\" However, one should realize that the name Bakemonogatari as the title is the essence of the show. As a continued reference, having a wordplay in the titles of each monogatari series is something that it does to represent each show. In literary context, you could say that each title of the series has meaning and that meaning is translated into the show.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a 12-episode show while the last 3 episodes were streamed online. The overall story of the show is essentially divided into \"stories\" quotation mark quotation mark. I say this because that is what monogatari (story) is. Bakemonogatari is separated into 5 different arcs, each with a title representing that \"story\"; these being Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, Suruga Monkey, Nadeko Snake, and Tsubasa Cat. Each arc focuses on particular characters tied to the arcs. The plot essentially follows a former vampire, Araragi Koyomi in his journey through high school meeting various oddities. \\n\\n\r\nNot to dissuade you from watching this but this anime is absolutely full of dialogue. Bakemonogatari has one of the most mind-provoking monologue content I have ever seen. There are a couple of action scenes animated but the gist of the show is how Araragi engages in interesting conversations with many different personalities. How Bakemonogatari keeps people interested in listening to monologues and dialogues is its use of artstyle, animation, music and interesting characters. Although you won't see much action, you will definitely see a lot of interesting landscapes, backgrounds and animation styles. What really got me interested was the content of Araragi's monologues and his dialogues with most people as well as the characters. Somehow one can relate to these. Some of it can be funny, and interesting but as I said if you prefer shounen animation then this anime won't probably appeal to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Bakemonogatari is absolutely superb and used effectively in a lot of the scenes in the anime. Funnily enough the anime reuses its music in its sequels and prequels which I appreciate with the addition of new music. To me, Bakemonogatari was the door that led me into the world of Monogatari. It got me interested as the relationships and references in Bakemonogatari carries over to the other Monogatari series. You can see how one part in Bakemonogatari had an affect with another part of another story. All in all, I think Bakemonogatari is an extremely well-done anime (not surprising that it was adapted from light-novels). It contains a good plot, a well paced timing, glorious art, amazing music that complements each scene and characters that stick with you till the end of the Monogatari series\\n\\n\r\nThereby I rate Bakemonogatari as 10/10 for my personal enjoyment as well as the overall score",

            "content": "Filled with gorgeous shots of underaged women, inventive fourth-wall breaks, and highly detailed PowerPoint slides, Bakemonogatari single-handedly redefined what it meant to be a pretentious anime at the time of its release in a way that no anime since has been able to capture the essence of. It is an incredible feat that a harem anime manages to get across so little humor and emotion with so much ostensible effort. Perhaps if I was steeped in Japanese culture, I would understand that the tsundere girl talking to the viewer about being tsundere was actually a post-ironic meta-commentary reference about the overabundance of meaningless fourth wallbreaks and not just a waste of time so that SHAFT could save a few extra yen to work on another frame of Zetsubou-Sensei. Alas, I do not have time to live in Japan, so instead the fansubs written by people who probably didn't get half the jokes will explain to me in translator notes that it's common to joke about being a lolicon around a loli, and then draw her in sexually suggestive ways as to completely undermine the very criticism it seems to be making. Very funny joke! Really shows a level of thoughtfulness and effort that's only seen in things like people who smoke at gas station pumps or bundles of rocks.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a show that has its cake and eats it too, and while there can be a trashy fun to shows like that, most of the fun of Bakemonogatari is squeezed out of it like a snake that squeezes out scene after scene of suggestive underaged girls in short skirts and tank tops. Sorry, I promise I'll stop talking about the whole loli thing, but can you imagine taking a show like this seriously when it \"ironically\" sexualizes little girls? Anyway, the reason why this show amounts to nothing more than a slightly unintelligible fantasy for Western NEETs to beat off to is because the parts of this show are very weak on their own. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is extremely formulaic, with the plot of each character arc being more or less the exact same. That within itself is alright and often a playground for character studies, as we get to see how each character reacts to the various highs and lows of that plot's structure. However, when the characters are these ironic caricatures, there end up being these very flat scenes where instead of learning about the characters' motivations or their feelings or what they've gone through, you get the feeling like you're learning about the director's knowledge of popular character tropes in anime. This ends up making the characters not feel like characters at all, but rather these weird symbolic stand-ins for ideas that, ultimately, make you feel this weird emptiness when you watch because you're not actually watching people but rather ideas, and ideas make me feel nothing without a human representing them in a natural way. I can't explain it exactly, the closest I've felt to this is by watching the live action Western comedy Community, but that was a lot more clever of a show than this, and it had a lot of different plots (divergent and varied situations that cause the flat caricatures to maybe reconsider their typical responses to thinks and thus become more round; something this show sorely lacks) to boot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, beyond being softcore lolicon hentai a third of the time, is impressively drawn, with most impressive being the lines given much weight and detail. When Araragi starts to laugh because he got some thought in his head, there's some over the top reaction he shows that's done in meticulous detail, and there's a lot of examples of that throughout the show. This works because of SHAFT's ability to draw small/medium/large lines for character models and within their bodies for color detail, then how they give them depth through their shading. On another show, a character may just put their hand to their face to hide laughter in that situation, or you'd see a thought bubble with chibi heads giggling. These details that show without telling can be found throughout the art of this show, which is all the more strange when the story of this show feels almost like the opposite as it tells instead of shows. Bakemonogatari exudes an undeniable style from its art, and that alone is worth the price of admission for many people, me included. I feel like the various characters' designs were mostly boring (seeing as though they were often kinda trope-y or ironically sexual in nature, they ended up being a bit plain), but I did quite like Araragi's and Senjougahara's character models, although the latter's look gets muddled when new girls are introduced into the show with similar color schemes/body types.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is really jarring about the art is the direction the show was given. I honestly do not mind the PowerPoint slides like many people might. I think it's a shallow, lazy artistic choice if done more than once, which it was. But okay, it is forgivable in and of itself, it adds a little bit of humor or flavor, fine. Yet when scenes are placed a kilometer away from the action for artistic effect, then zoomed in close to the face, then there's a jungle gym, then a shot zoomed only half a kilometer away and you can see half the character's body in the shot even though it's the other character that's talking...there's a pointlessness to everything that is going on, and the slides seem exceedingly lazy. When you \"break the rules\" of what makes a scene well shot, you should do so on purpose, with reason. When Tatami Galaxy shows the main character in a kaleidoscopic and impotent hellscape, it's because the main character is losing his mind since he can't get any. It makes sense why the director would choose really weird, wide angles for those shots. When I see the floor and ceiling of a house with dialogue and quick shots of characters interspersed throughout, I don't think it has any meaning or purpose for the story than beyond just being different or weird. So then you have to judge it by how pretty it looks, and since the REAL purpose of those weird shots were to save costs, it makes the anime seem a lot less beautiful. This made a lot of dialogue-heavy scenes feel like a total drag, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, when you combine the show's self-congratulatory use of irony that it did not earn the right to congratulate itself on, the often meandering direction that comes across as someone trying to act really cool, and the very forgettable character motivations and story that are done up in an opaque way on purpose (instead of a more traditional harem story of a boy meeting a bunch of girls at school and they do normal stuff with each other or fight things with them etc, which this could have easily been, there's supernatural elements mixed with plodding repetitive plots that the characters never fully realize themselves within), you get this empty shell of an anime, a real waste of beautiful art, a show that if any other studio produced, would be a trashy mid-level anime that would be totally forgotten. A comedy that takes itself seriously when it wants to in order to seem as artistically cunning as possible, while in reality it's less deep than Oreimo, Bakemonogatari is the prime definition of a pretentious anime, and as a result I find it hard to connect with on any level beyond some empty anger I feel for having my time wasted.",

During a day at school he comes across amysterious girl by the name of Hitagi Senjougahara and saves her from a crab aberration with the help of a Specialist, Meme Oshino. The story goes on as Araragi saves mulitple girls from different types of abberations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for me gave a satisfying feeling when watching Bake. Shaft has done a wonderful job with animation in Bake and the rest of the monogatari series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bake had 5 different OP themes for a 15 episode series \"staple stable\" by Chiwa Saito, \"Kaerimichi\" by Emiri Kauto, \"Ambivalent world\" by Miyuki Sawashiro, \"Renai Circulation\" by Kana Hanazawa and \"Sugar Sweet Nightmare\" by Yui Horie\". The openings were all great but I was in love with the ED theme \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" by supercell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'm not going to go over every character but just to point out the main character \"Araragi Koyomi\". How he deals with all of the girls and abberation while maintaining a stable relationship is beyond me. He cares for each charater and has a special bond with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Once I started I could not stop. Every episode for me was a cliff hanger. I have never had the urge to rewatch an anime before but I'm most likely to with Bake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: While I find this anime amazing some people may find it boring or just dumb but that won't change my opinion on it. I strongly recommended it for everyone but don't judge it by the first episode, try watch it through.",

            "content": "I watched Bakemongatai simply out of the art style and premise. Being told the story I don't think I knew exactly what to expect, but overall I'd say it was enjoyable. So much so that by the end of the series, I knew the problems with it, and still went ahead and decided to watch it's sequel series, Nisemonogatari.\r\nI will say this, the art style is amazing, with it's own unique style that makes even the most simple things look absolutely gorgeous. The music is it's own unique blend for each character that can be either incredibly lighthearted or absolutely depressing. \r\nThough my favorite partof the series is actually the characters. Kanbaru in particular sticks out with her happily perverted nature. The real disappointment in this is aside from Meme, Shinobu, Senjougahara, Hanekawa and Araragi, every other character has their own arcs and then quietly just move aside. I really would have liked to see more of characters like Sengoku who didn't get much time. At least they come back for Nisemonogatari and will apparently be back for Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all that, you may wonder why I'm rating it a 7. The reason for that is the story of Bakemonogatari is hit and miss. With the exception of Suruga Monkey, it was really had to follow some stories. The series really likes throwing a lot at you and just hoping you'll understand. This is one of those series in which you'll miss something if you glance away for a few seconds. In addition, the pacing for these stories are bizarre at points. Nadeko Snake had a very interesting premise then as soon the issue comes up, it's solved almost immediately and we move onto the last arc. On the other hand, Tsubasa Cat dragged on too much. Five episodes dedicated to what I would argue is possibly the weakest story in the series. It would have been fine had it just been three, even four episodes, but being both the longest story in the series, then having scenes that drag on forever when compared to the much more fast paced nature of the show is a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I did enjoy the first three arcs as well as the everything else enough that I'm willing to give this a recommendation. It's much different than any other anime I've seen before, and I mean that in a good way. It's not the best anime I've ever seen, but it's still a really good one.",

            "content": "Utterly unintelligible garbage.\r\nI have never found myself so confused as to all the hype and praise surrounding an anime as I have in the case of Bakemonogatari. This is the only anime I have ever tried hard to finish and been unable to. The issue is this: the script only makes a vague amount of sense; one never knows exactly what just happened or why it\u2019s happened, only a general gist, much like watching a movie in a language you don\u2019t really understand. To further add to the frustration, text appears constantly in flash frames, that is to say, in single frames of nothing buttext and a solid background interspersed for \u201cartistic effect\u201d. It would appear that these do not add anything at all to the plot or the development, but are instead simply reflective of what is going on at the time; sadly these writings are also cryptically vague. They also have the added irritation of forcing completion-ists (like myself) to pause the damn video repeatedly every few minutes to try and read the stupid things. \\n\\n\r\nIn fairness, I have often wondered if perhaps it is the sub translations that I used that caused the thing to make no sense, but I have a few friends who have continued to watch the series and have been left equally confused. The premise does seem interesting, but without being able to understand what is going on, it gets infuriating really fast. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show is passable, but the long gaps in the soundscape leave awkward holes that add absolutely nothing but disorientation to the overall feel. The art, on the other hand, is beautiful in its simplicity. Honestly, this is Bakemonogatari\u2019s only redeeming feature. \\n",

            "content": "Get ready for the bash, because I will have the unpopular opinion of disliking Bakemonogateri. Let me break it down to you:\r\n*Characters: while they had some kind of depth, it wasn't enough to convince me they were more than archetypes with a pile of quirks.\r\nIt also pissed me off that the creators couldn't make up their minds regarding the main protag: Is he dumb or is he smart? It is one thing to have different areas of strengths and weaknesses, but when you switch between full retard and sherlock holmes in the same area of strength, then you aren't doing your character right, which isbad considering he's the lead...\\n\\n\r\n*Plot: While I've heard it has an interesting plot, I never got to experience that myself. Either you watch the show without stopping and miss alot of important backstory from the pop-ups or you are the guy trying to read 'em all. In any case, it is not easily accessible. I was the guy who read all the pop-ups and I still ask myself if the info was enough justification for causing me so much frustration. The pop-up system might be innovative for its time, but it is a stupid one.\\n\r\nOther than that, it is a regular \"monster of the week\" anime that really doesn't stand out at all to me.\\n\\n\r\n*Music: Was pretty good. It set the mood correctly, but other than that I really didn't think much about it. It was definitely above average though.\\n\\n\r\n*Artstyle: Probably the strongest point of the show: It had a unique and really iconic artstyle that still holds up today. Credit should be given where credit is due.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall thoughts and enjoyment: The reason why I grade the show this low is because I really didn't feel much at all for the duration of the show. I didn't sense enough depth in the characters worth involving myself with, and the story and the way it was presented was like an overpretentious slap to the face screaming \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND ART DAMMIT?!\".\\n\\n\r\nAs a piece of entertainment, it was shit, but as a show it had several good qualities\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the show, I value entertainment above all other aspects, and I had none while watching the show. The only thing pushing this rating so high was the artstyle, and even then I was generous.\\n\r\nThis show was not for me, but I can still recomend it for artsy people",

            "content": "Hey everyone, today I have the wonderful privilege of reviewing BAKEMONOGATARI.  \r\nFirst, the STORY & CHARACTERS. The best thing about this show is the dialogue and character interactions. Nisio Isin, the author of the original light novel, has incredible wit and great humor, which clearly shines in the anime as well. However, this also means that there is a lot of dialogue, and if you are planning to watch this anime with subtitles (which most of you probably are, including me) it might be a pain. However, I also feel like that the dialogue is one of the main draws to the show, Inever really had huge problem with it being \"too wordy.\" Unfortunately, this anime has no dub and most likely will never attain one because the jokes and lines are very liken to Japanese [anime] culture.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story of BAKEMONOGATARI is honestly not the most original thing I have ever seen. Guy meets girl with problems involving spirits, he helps them out, done. Next girl. However, other aspects of the series more than make up for it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, for example, are very interesting. We have Senjougahara Hitagi: the sharp-tongued, self-proclaimed tsundere. Hachikuji Mayoi: the vibrant grade-schooler who is victim to our lead protagonist\u2019s ...umm.. assaults. Kanbaru Suruga: the lesbian kouhai (to our main character) with a dirty mind. Sengoku Nadeko: the cute, shy middle-schooler with a huge crush on main protagonist. Hanekawa Tsubasa: a class rep among class reps; a kind girl with an ideal body and mind. And finally...we have our lead character Araragi Koyomi: a nice guy who likes to help people..and who also has a thing grade-schoolerss......anyway moving on. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the MUSIC. Oh My Goodness the music. With a total of 5 arcs in BAKEMONOGATARI, there are FIVE Awesome OPs and one AMAZING ED. One anime, SIX new songs to add to my music playlist? You've just killed 6 birds with one stone.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\n\r\nWe are now at the point where I can talk about the ANIMATION. Shaft, the studio behind the series, and Akiyuki Shinbo, the director are geniuses of creativity when it comes to animation. They have an eccentric style, unique to Shaft, in which they incorporate unorthodox animation techniques, random jump-cuts, pans, eye close-ups, crazy angles, random instances of cartoony-ness, then back to anime-style, even sometimes incorporating live-action shots of scenery and even characters, and of course the trademark Shaft head-tilts. If you've ever heard your music/performing arts teacher say that \"to make the audience feel a breeze, give them a hurricane,\" Well, in terms of Shaft's eccentric animation style, I felt TWENTY hurricanes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBAKEMONOGATARI is truly a one-of-a-kind experience that anyone interested in the slightest should attempt to take. However, be warned: it is not necessarily for everyone. It mostly likely appeals mainly to people already very into anime and manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~AndreKumori, December 6 2014 \\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari - very simply, this anime proposes an interesting, overused premise, but with a lack-luster portrayal. There are similarities to the Natsume Yuujinchou series in that Ayakashi and Youkai are involved, except that Bakemonogatari uses arcs while Natsume Yuujinchou tells the story and usually resolves the plot within the same episode. \r\nBakemonogatari has darker contours and frames that skew the images not away from reality, but rather toward it. SHAFT Grupp's unique style of animation is present throughout the work as they seemingly meld bits and pieces of the anime and life in general together, somehow awkwardly connecting. Vivid colors give way to forceful imaginationand torture the brain and eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are somewhat memorable--not developed enough to \"favorite\" them but enough to remember what they did in general, and what anime they might have belonged to. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound, however, was supremely excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the OP's and ED and if anything, the music was the highlight of the work. Oddly, even the lyrics seemed to fit, although the songs seemed more lively to me than the actual anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakemonogatari is an excellent work for a very specific audience. If you enjoy Ayakashi-related topics and anime, this will be the work for you. If you prefer cold-hearted and understandably paranoid Tsunderes, this is a piece for you! If you do not enjoy femdom I would advise staying away from this work; your eyes may be subject to violent younger sisters and a girlfriend who spouts verbal and physical abuse without so much a loving word. This eventually changes, however, but not much...\\n\\n\r\nTo be utterly generous, 3.5 stars out of 5 for the morbidly frank and seemingly wacky Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\n-Jay\\n\\n\r\nP.s.

            "content": "This review is spoiler-free.\r\nLet me open by saying Bakemonogatari is in the top 20% of my \"top 5 anime of all-time\" list. I fell in love with it near instantly, in the middle of Episode 2. Perhaps it's because I'm a (huge) Studio Shaft fanboy, or I like Nishio Ishin's (the writer) work; for whatever reason I enjoyed it immensely.\r\nThe unique characters and their interesting development is something I haven't found since, in fact Bakemonogatari's made me more alert to shows with lazy character development.\r\nSenjougahara, my favourite of the series, was a very intriguing character and I genuinely found myself feeling sympathetic towards her whenthey went into detail on her backstory. I've never seen tsundere personified in such a unique manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe sheer beauty of the scenery was a big thing; some of the backgrounds are phenomenal. Sometimes I forgot to pay attention to the dialogue because I was entranced by the beauty of the mountain scenes (the Snake arc).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time watching the show was spent just admiring the effort that must've gone into making it so pretty. The whole thing's eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nEven the fansevice was creative! The scene early on, with Senjougahara naked in her bedroom and plenty of generous cleavage/panty shots, was different. Usually it's \"Look at these boobs!!1!!1!1 Upskirt shot!!11! Buy the Bluray for uncensored!!!!1!1!1!\" but in Bakemonogatari it actually fitted with the story and I didn't find it obtrusive. It takes skill to make fanservice not feel like it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still hands down one of the best things I've ever watched, disregarding the above. 9/10.",

            "content": "Watching Bakemonogatari gives one the same feeling of reading a fast-paced book. It\u2019s very important to keep your mind on the content of the page, and if you slip; finding out that you haven\u2019t been paying attention while scamming through the page, you have to collect your thoughts, go back to where the situation started, and start all over again. That\u2019s a lot like how Bakemonogatari is, except way less fleeting and easier to concentrate on. I tried watching and reading reviews on Bakemonogatari and I heard it was a little ambiguous, so I dove in, only to be hit by something so fascinatingly slow-pacedthat it\u2019s fast-paced, something so ambiguous that it actually makes sense, and something so fleeting, that when you blink, you miss it. I find it not to be the anime for everyone, definitely not. Only a significant few can watch something like this and enjoy the experience. Only the most patient and alert people can get this anime. The impatient will drop it on the first episode. When watching it, though, the impatient; heck, even the patient, are hesitant to drop it because it feels like this anime is a test. It\u2019s testing your intelligence, your personality, your weaknesses, your strengths, etc. and that is why I believe this anime is popular; because so many people want to challenge Bakemonogatari and defeat it, defeat its test and its scrutinizing nature; that\u2019s also why I didn\u2019t drop it, because I am a naturally competitive person and don\u2019t take defeat well. \\n\\n\r\nAnalyzing the plot of Bakemonogatari is a waste of time. What plot? There IS no plot in Bakemonogatari. I mean, yes, the creators TRY to make a plot, but it\u2019s so minor and such an insignificant part of the anime, that it\u2019s useless to give it a tangible score, but I\u2019ll try to give you the general jist of it. The main character\u2019s name is Araragi Koyomi, a third year in high school. He\u2019s a \u201cPseudo-vampire,\u201d bitten by one at one time and only being half-cured, now having an immortal body. The story focuses around him and his experiences with different girls that are tied with a supernatural entities (spirits, apparitions, gods, etc.). And since he\u2019s a generous guy (And also a bit of a pervert), he helps them out. But never mind that. It\u2019s hard to even focus on the plot most of the times when it\u2019s jammed in between all of the talking, and talking, and talking, and talking. The main attraction of this anime is definitely its dialogue, with the witty aphorisms and humorous interactions; it\u2019s the highlight of the entire anime. The interactions and clever details added to the dialogue are really what makes this anime and sets it apart from the others. Also, the dialogue and interactions are so deep and fast-paced, that I have to be careful not to miss a single detail, for everything was important even when it wasn\u2019t supposed to be. This anime is like the hipster of the anime world. The creators must\u2019ve been like, \u201cPlot and action scenes are too mainstream, let\u2019s develop around character interactions,\u201d which sounds really crappy in a plot summary, but ends up being a pretty good element to the anime. Trust me, if I could put an N/A rating for plot, I would, because analyzing it is just unfair. Unfortunately, I cannot, and instead I\u2019ll give the \u201cplot\u201d a 7? (Note the question mark)\\n\\n\r\nApart from plot, the design of this anime was gorgeous. With a pop art style and freely executed color experimentation, you\u2019re never sure of the setting of the anime, especially during a witty interaction. Everything changes colors so faced, and the art can change from one style to the next in an instant; while also flashing a bunch of different colors in your face. If you are prone to epileptic seizures, then I warn you about this. The art, though, is also what makes this anime different from the rest of the world. Every single art element is just so beautifully stylized and fits the ambiguity of the anime perfectly, also adding to the fact that it is indeed, \u201chipster.\u201d Even the horribly bloody action scenes (Which were basically made up of the main character getting his ass whooped and intestines pulled out, excuse my French) were pretty and colorful. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I have a twisted mind, or the anime was trying to convince me that I do. In that sense, I lost to Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the opening was not how I expected it to be. Considering it\u2019s the first thing a watcher sees when starting an anime, you\u2019d expect it to be much more fitting to the anime. I mean, yes, it was quite cute, but didn\u2019t really characterize the anime very well and lowered my expectations. The OST is one of the very few I actually remember in an anime. It was surprisingly fitting and had a \u201cCuriosity\u201d mood about it, as if foreshadowing something; of course, that was during the interesting dialogue, adding to my suspicion and enjoyment of it all. The voice actors, I believe were casted very well. It\u2019s kind of hard to imagine that the perverted, nonsensical main character is voiced by the serious, frightening Corporal Levi from Shingeki no Kyojin, but Kamiya Hiroshi (The voice actor for Araragi and Levi) pulled it off surprisingly well. \\n\\n\r\nAnalyzing the characters for this anime is the most fun in the entire review, mainly because they made up the entire anime and their interactions were the reason of my enjoyment. Every single character has such a weird and different personality that makes it easy for the watchers to distinguish between the characters. Araragi, though, seems to be the weakest character (If I had to pick one), mainly because of his interpretation and display as a helpless and submissive character that Bakemonogatari managed to trick me into once again. Another point to Bakemonogatari, 0-2. The other protagonist, though; Senjougahara, his tsundere girlfriend, had an opposite appeal to me. With her unique and witty, yet seemingly emotionless attitude, her school supplies weapons, and just overall likeable personality, I was instantly drawn. She is amazingly clever and always surprised me with her humorous interactions with Araragi, making her a logical competitor for one of the most likeable female characters in anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel, deep down, that I secretly enjoyed this anime while also trying to defeat it as well. It\u2019s like this anime is my rival; I don\u2019t want to lose to it, but I can\u2019t help but enjoy competing and playing the game. The likeable characters and overall hipster nature of the anime really set it apart from any other anime I've every read. Unfortunately, though, since I am not a very patient person, I couldn't help but grow tired of some of the never ending dialogue and all of it seemed a lot to take in. Me 0, Bakemonogatari- 3. In the end, Bakemonogatari\u2019s mind tricks and witty dialogue ended up being the successor in this battle and I lost. I failed the test that Bakemonogatari threw in my face, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t enjoy the process of getting there. \u201cWhich is more important, the result or the adventure in getting there?\u201d A common question indeed. With Bakemonogatari, the answer is obvious. With no caring in the world of the plot and solutions, instead of the transitional dialogue, I believe that the adventure is more important. If you passed the test, I congratulate you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n",

As such, reading this review will be more meaningful to those who are able to recognise in my descriptions those remarkable qualities and consequently, find themselves in agreement or otherwise, and so continue their thought on the subject. \r\nTo begin.\r\nThe overarching genre of visual media \"anime\" is for the most part bound tightly to the concept of entertainment, incurring through thisrelationship many restrictions and characteristics. The jargon we use when talking about anime is for a large part due to this relationship. Only very rarely is the creator of a series given complete freedom, and when it does happen these works often become something other than \"anime\" in the previously mentioned sense of the word. They become completely, art. Bakemonogatari, to my mind, is not one of these. Art, though not denied the use of the commonplace, exists outside of it, acquires its nature and value by compressing into itself the many things unsaid, unsayable, and lacking in shape or definition, be it to the individual, the interpersonal or the cultural. These works of \"complete\" art do not require popularity, or mass review because they retain themselves. \\n\r\nOne of the great strengths of Bakemonogatari -and the necessity of all these grandiose definitions I have just given serve as evidence for this- is that it fills with art to maximum capacity an anime that is placed firmly within the confines of the entertaining. There is, as they are in their basic elements, very little about the main characters, or the setting of the series that is new or unsettling. We have all seen the harsh and intelligent, yet kind woman. We have all seen the schools, the uniforms, the outsider and the vagabond. We have all seen these characters placed in extraordinary situations through contact with the supernatural. We have seen it over and over and over again. Even so, nothing in Bakemonogatari stays in these commonplaces. In the end they serve only as the soft and comfortable bedding from where the creators of the series have been able to stretch and play with the genre.\\n\r\nIt is probably one of the greatest compliments to say that they have expanded the possibilities of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll this having been said, the manner in which they achieved this still needs to be expounded. That is to say: the concrete visual, aural and narrational aspects of the series I have yet to treat.\\n\r\nThis is of course a difficult thing because it is the work as a whole that induces effect, and with a series so tightly woven in all its facets, a separation of these different aspects will do it no justice.   But this being a review I will try to keep them interconnected while still describing them in necessary detail.\\n\\n\r\nFor the moment not taking into account the story as a whole, it is likely to be true that in most anime the main body of content consists of the animation and the story as voiced by the characters. These two elements give us a physical, emotional, psychological and theoretical framework to place the world and events, the story as a whole, of the anime in. Usually the two exist next to each other. The voice is, in a way, subservient to the logical restrictions of the animation, the visual world created, be it knights in a vaguely mediaeval world or an insecure girl walking from school to her home (cherry blossom leaves falling around her of course). In Bakemonogatari the two are differently linked. They are mutually influential. While the animation in itself is of a very high standard (movement is fluid, characters are distinct, colours are vivid and yet blended beautifully) it is this fluidity caused by mutual subservience that truly makes the animation great, because it allows for an amazing amount of freedom. Inner dialogue, monologue and dialogue between characters are punctuated with all sorts of abstractions, mutations and cut-aways. Abruptly interjected frames, illustrate what is said and at once adjust the meaning of the words. The surroundings are constructed out of symbols, formalised everyday objects and composition. The spoken words ebb and flow and change the colours and shapes of the visual world presented to us. Everything seems to be in a continuous state of transformation. \\n\r\nAnd while this animation is brilliantly creative, the writing and voice acting are on par with it. There is an incredible amount of distinction to be found amongst the characters, not just in the characters' voices themselves or between the different voices, but also in use of cadence, subtlety of displayed emotions, the playful back and forth and semantic sensitivity. It is because of all this that the series is at its best, not at its moments of high drama, during battles or good byes, but when things are slow, when conversation can linger between slapstick laughter, superficial philosophy and philology, and quiet hallucinations, when movement is slowly juxtapositioned against foreground and background, when all combined the different qualities of the series are allowed their gentle interplay, their ebb and flow and their surreal quirks. The music in the series contributes to these qualities too. It is never overstated and usually no more than a slightly atypical repetition of tentative chords. The few moments of high drama are in fact the only area of the anime that is sensitive to criticism because, due to its very nature, the things that make it great necessarily retreat at these moment, and it becomes somewhat too much like the commonplace anime that it usually so cleverly avoids becoming. \\n\r\nThe story, consequently, is of the least interest. Even though through it we are given some nice character development and depth, it remains to me almost like an excuse, a method of display, and it fulfils this function to satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I believe this anime to be one of the greats. It rises above the frivolity of much of SHAFT's other work, at times equals some of the narrational depth and intensity of Aku no Hana, has artwork as good as Mononoke, though in a completely different style, and yet manages to remain truly humorous. While a viewer won't be swept away by villains or traumas of shadowy days passed, the same viewer can let himself sink away into an animated world wherein the illogical formulates its own rules and becomes coherent in the subconscious, and the experience of the everyday becomes something wholly beautiful.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari follows the life of Araragi Koyomi, a student in his 3rd year of high school. An otherwise normal kid whose life changed after becoming  partly vampire. These turn in events will shape the life of not only Araragi Koyomi, but also the life of Senjougahara Hitagi, a girl who never talks to anyone. A fateful fall down the stairs into Araragi arms sets the couple\u2019s destiny in stone.  More mysteries continue to unravel as Araragi figures out that Senjougahara weighs close to nothing. Araragi offers to help Senjougahara with her \u2018physical illness\u2019 by taking her to the very man that stopped himfrom becoming a full vampire. This incident sets the ball rolling for the anime as the series follows the couple seeking solutions to other strange supernatural cases. The variety of these unique cases offers a new perspective of the main character each and every time. The development of his personality is thus more fulfilled than your average anime. \\n\\n\r\nBeing new to anime, it took quite a while to get used to the unique art and dialogue led scenes that made bakemonogatari stand out, However, very quickly, due to the anime\u2019s unique artwork, soundtracks and compelling character, my curiosity became clear. Bakemonogatari became very engaging in every aspect as everything complimented each other. Mere conversations became artwork and a fantastic viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari consisted of 5 Opening theme tunes, with each new opening theme tune used for the introduction of a new heroine. This helped advance the plot and accentuate each of the new characters. The song \u2018Staple Stable\u2019 stood out in particular for me. The soundtrack was truly a masterpiece, it really helped set the scenes and worked hand in hand with the quirky art styles and visuals. The visuals are always slick, and always impressive. Anime attracted me because of the unique artwork and compelling soundtracks. Bakemonogatari  is unique even amongst anime, thus making it that much more striking. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari takes it\u2019s time with advancing the plot. Every conversation is either meaningful, humorous or exciting. Every conversation grabs my attention with the diverse and artistic interactions between the characters.",

            "content": "Utter garbage.\r\nThis is Twilight for older Japanese men.\r\nIt is a fantasy for many older Japanese men to live out.\r\nFirst off. Araragi is a self insert character for the viewers. His appearance is generic, his personality is bland, and his entire character just screams \"typical Japanese male.\"\r\nNow I can say a lot more things about this subject. But I'll move on.\r\nThe show is based off of dialogue and Japanese puns/humor. \r\nSo exactly what type of entertainment can be derived for non-Japanese people?\r\nAbsolutely none.\r\nThe jokes are absolutely terrible and cannot be translated to an American audience very well. Proof of this is the lack of a dubfor the show. Many popular Japanese shows are quick to be licensed and dubbed. But it was only recently that Bakemonogatari was licensed, and it is speculative(and unlikely) that it will get one even with the licensing. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'll get to the actual animation/art of the show. At first glance, you might say \"this looks beautiful!\" And you're absolutely right. But as you keep watching the show, you'll realize the animators didn't actually take the time to animate the whole thing and put in slides with words.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this show seems to be nearly non existent as well. But I admit, I've only seen 5 episodes. It seems the premise of the show is about a boy who was once turned into a vampire(and regaining his humanity later) helping out girls with problems that are supernatural. The show is based off of arcs where he \"helps\" a different girl each time, but there doesn't seem to be a focus.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the just worst I've seen in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari has quite possibly the worst character in all anime/manga.\\n\r\nJust an awful, spiteful, vile, wretched, selfish, cowardly, ungrateful, loudmouthed, overdramatic, angst filled little ***** named Senjougahara Hitagi.\\n\\n\r\nHer presence alone can kill even the best of series. Now add her to this already terrible show and you can understand what kind of a horror this show can be to watch.\\n\\n\r\n5 episodes was far too much for me to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is legitimately THE worst anime I have ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ahh Bakemonogatari. I wanted to like this show. The concept behind it sounded like it would be an interesting anime. I was told that this would be a harem with intelligent dialogue and supernatural elements by a competent staff. So I settled in, put the show on and prepared myself for a wonderful ride.\r\nEpisode one begins and the first thing that strikes me is the art style. Words flash on screen too fast to be read that would usually describe an emotion a character is feeling or what they are thinking. The lighting and backgrounds also have a quirky touch to it, giving me afeeling that this could be fun and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we meet Araragi; the \"average\" protagonist, then Tsubasa; the class rep, and finally, Senjougahara; the \"tsundere\". These are regular characters in the harem genre, but that doesn't suggest anything is wrong, yet. The rest of the episode focuses mostly on the supernatural and I can say the show has grabbed my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThen the first scene of episode two happens and it becomes clear the direction Bakemonogatari is taking. Fan service galore, girls only existing to fill an anime character trope and to flirt with Araragi without having any reason to like him, plots that have no interaction nor lead to any development for Araragi and no other male existing other than Oshino who is only involved in the supernatural side of things.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is generally praised not for the supernatural side, but for its take on the harem genre where the dialogue is described as \"witty\" and that there's \"great wordplay\". I disagree. The supernatural side is what seems to be the most competent part of Bakemonogatari's storytelling. The dialogue though is childish. The girls don't flirt the same way a normal person would; instead they are completely openly sexual towards Araragi. The dialogue is especially flawed when the girl would be naked in front of Araragi yet acting like she's not interested in him and for some reason he believes that she isn't interested. Either he is braindead or they couldn't think of a better way to portray flirtation. Don't get me started on the amount of times Araragi would be called generous or caring when he's clearly doing things that no one in a monogamous relationship would ever do.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style had potential in this series but never really added anything once the show got going. The female characters are all drawn exactly how you'd expect a fan service anime would portray its women. It was amusing that the girls didn't just have beautiful bodies, but their skin was actually shiny. The backgrounds and settings were interesting to look at though; generally having weird lighting to give a unique feel. What was most prominent though was the SHAFT awkward body positions and head tilts.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does its job in attempting to give a quirky feel to each scene. You get the feeling that the show's creators wanted this to complement the many jokes throughout the show, but it falls flat when the dialogue is poorly written. The openings and endings aren't remarkable. The voice acting is done decently well enough to portray each character trope.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime because I had heard Nisemonogatari and Monogatari: Second Season were must see animes. In the end though I gave up on Nisemonogatari a few episodes in because it had the same flaws as Bakemonogatari. I understand people enjoyed this and I can see why. If you're into fan service and simple dialogue, you will enjoy this and I have nothing against that. But if you're looking for something more intelligent, with actual witty dialogue in a romance type anime, watch something like Spice and Wolf instead.",

For a casual highschool drama it had ridiculous amounts of depth and character development. It actually gave a shit you know. Instead of making these one dimensional cliches you see in every other anime, bake went the extra mile.\r\nThis series consumed most of my adolescent years and shaped my entire outlook on anime. It is an amazing show. Bakemonogatari and Welcome to the NHK are to me the top 2 dramas with slice of life elements and (out of the ones I've seenso far) with inspiration and a clear message behind them.\\n\\n\r\nShaft has perfected the way of telling a highschool drama because they've been doing it for decades. Bake is the result of years of hard work culminating into the perfect highschool drama pseudo-slice of life anime. Not to mention the unique gorgeous artsyle that makes every character pop out of the screen and the legendary cast of VA's that voice them is just the cherry on the top.\\n\\n\r\nBake may have had it's ups and downs (Monogatari second season and first half of Owari in my opinion being the weakest of the series) but it is an artistic masterpiece. When you're first watching it, it can drone on for too long and get lost in itself telling you an extensive story but I guarantee you, you've never seen an anime quite like this. Stick with it. This series dipped my toes into something incredible that otherwise would be unbeknownst to me. Bake will forever be immortalized in my heart as my favorite long running series of all time and I doubt anything that I'll see from this point forward will change that. The Monogatari series was and is a much needed breath of fresh air in an otherwise oversaturated and generic genre.",

            "content": "Hello everyone this is Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and welcome to my month of MVM Entertainment reviews. For this one we are taking a look at the first enter of the Monogatari Series Bakemonogatari.\r\nNow I for the longest time I was never a huge fan of Monogatari series because while I kinda liked the series the first time when I watched it back in 2015 I thought it was just an another waifu pandering show that have nothing but flashy visuals and fan-service. Also, I wasn\u2019t a fan of heavy dialogue shows at the time.\r\nIn short I thought this series was kinda overrated.\r\nHowever, this all changedwhen I decided to randomly buy Bakemonogatari on DVD for \u00a315 brand new in that comic con anime shop and when I got home I decided to watch it again on my TV and well. Did I like I like the series and saw the other side of Bakemonogatari series or do I still think Bakemonogatari is just an overhyped series that not that good?\\n\\n\r\nWell let\u2019s find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Bakemonogatari follows  Koyomi Araragi meeting Senjougahara our female lead by catching her as she fall down a giant spiral staircase. What surprises Araragi as he catches her is her weight because she is light as a feather. This is due to a type of spirt that is taking her weight. Lucky Araragi knows someone that can help Meme Oshino, Oshino previously helped Aragai with his own problem which resulted Araragi to become part vampire so he obviously takes Senjougahara to Oshino for help.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here and out its pretty much the same plot being recycled but the only difference to this are the different girls that he meets that have this spirit problem.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s about it for the story of Bakemonogatari and despite this the story of Bakemonogatari still remains fresh by containing wood humour at you giving us very interesting supernatural elements and switching up which girl get the focus.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the most part Bakemonogatari is an episodic show typically 2 or 3 episodes that are given for each mini arc rather than only one.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, am not a fan of episodic things because usually the show ends up being rushed. This is why I wasn\u2019t a fan of episodic shows like Death Parade. It has a lots of interesting themes and conspectus but only had time to induce them before the episode was over. Shows like Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star are good at telling episodic episodes because not only there are well paced but they introduce its themes at the right time without being rushed.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Bakemonogatari doesn\u2019t suffer from this because each episode/ arc are very well written to the point where you actually care for the story progression and character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Bakemonogatari special is the use of heavy of dialogue and let me tell you it has some of the best heavy dialogue I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot only there are extremely well written but it always has that meaningful edge throughout. Whether it\u2019s to make a joke, reveal character depth, character development for that set arc or to advance the plot ever conversation has a purpose.  With all that said it\u2019s impossible to translate the whole Monogatari series in English without screwing the dialogue up. This is part of the reason why the series hasn\u2019t got a dub yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story of Bakemonogatari is just great.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a very character driven series meaning the character have to be good or else the show would have flop.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Bakemonogatari features a great cast that is different, relatable and original.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters start off with generic tropes meaning you will have your everyday harem male lead Aragami,  Senjougahara a cool tsundere, Mayoi who is a bratty loli , Nadoeko who is a innocent moto type, Suruga who is a energetic athlete  and Tsubasa who is a perfection  But as each main girl\u2019s arc developed the restraints for those types break apart. Treating us to meaningful exploration of the defence mechanism people used themselves from the harsh reality from outside the world or in the own minds.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound like edgy writing and character development on paper but it isn\u2019t because the execution is just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the girls are flawed in they own ways and also just seeing how these characters break apart from they generic tropes is just amazing and very rewarding for the audience.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I can tell you more about the characters in Bakemonogatari but I won\u2019t because I would have to spoil every arc and its themes and to be real honest you don\u2019t want to get spoiled while watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters of Bakemonogatari are just amazing and well fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Bakemonogatari is beautiful every scene from Bakemongatari is filled with life. From the action scenes to very experimental animation Bakemonogatari has it all and.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service of Bakemonogatari is handed well because unlike any other ecchi anime out there Bakemonogatari uses fan service to advance the plot or reveal character modulations. Not to mention the symbolism is just beautiful here that also has meaning and substance to them.\\n\\n\r\nThis is fan-service done right\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that I want to mention each girl and each arc have they own opening that is sung by the Japanese voice actors and each opening reflects a certain theme and aspect of the girl. I personally that that approached to very unique because it gives each girl and they arc meaning.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals are just wonderful to watch and very appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\n11/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound production for Bakemonogatari is just a masterpiece and it really made the show more a relaxing experience while you hear lots of dialogue of character taking. Not to mention the sound quality of Bakemonogatari is very clean and realistic making each scene from the sound effects and background music have a greater impact.\\n\\n\r\nNow as a guy who watches dubs am glad that this haven\u2019t receive the dub because it will look and sound terrible. The dub of Bakemonogatari will suffer for having horrendous mistranslations with the dialogue the story nature with be butchered and the character personalities will also be butchered. Am saying this because the original Japanese audio for Bakemonogatari is just flawless and having a dub for it will ruin the fame of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack and voice acting of Bakemonogatari is just amazing.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is easily one of the best animes that I seen in modern anime. It\u2019s a very unique experience that you can\u2019t get in any other medium. While the story arcs were great for what it was the character really driven the story along thanks to its well written narrative structure and great use of heavy dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were extremely artistic that has a purpose and the soundtrack was just amazing and well used.\\n\\n\r\nLastly all of the girls in Bakemonogatari avoided waifu pandering route where all the girls are only there for style over substance where shows like Niseoki where that show didn\u2019t know how to use female characters correctly and instead that show became waifu pandering show with no soul or identity.\\n\\n\r\nI use to find this series to be kinda overrated after my first watch but after my re-watch of Bakemonogatari this series this show immediately became a favourite of mine and it\u2019s my second favorite Monogatari series only losing to Monogatari series second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Bakemonogatari a 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is available from MVM Entertainment in the UK on DVD and Blu Ray.\\n\\n\r\nAnime Recommendations\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari\\n\\n\r\nxxxHolic\\n\\n\r\nMawaru Penguindrum\\n\\n\r\nThe Tatami Galaxy\\n\\n\r\nFLCL\\n\\n\r\nMushishi\\n\\n\r\nSayonara Zetsubou Sensei\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "One of Bakemonogatari's main purpose is the exploration of its concept regarding the supernatural. In addition to this, Bakemonogatari heavily focuses on dialogue that gives a heavy sense of social realism and realistic character traits we see in everyday humans.\r\nFor the conflicts that happen throughout the story, the lessons are meant to be learned figuratively. Things that happen within the plot feel satisfying due to unique character actions and interactions that feel realistic and understandable.\r\nThere is very little generalization upon any one character besides Sengoku Nadeko. However, this problem is washed away upon Second Season where her character blooms fully. Every other character feels unique,meaning they generally do not feel like other characters. Now although in wording it may sound simplistic and therefore unimpressive, Bakemonogatari handles the difference of characters in believable ways with each character holding many different set of morals, beliefs, knowledge and anything a person may possess. Time is something valuable, and Bakemonogatari uses this time wisely to not only let us bond with the characters, but to let us understand that there exists a critical dimension of personality for its characters.\\n\r\nThis is how stories make good characters. Good is not something like a good person though... Good is how realistic & believable a character feels; and to make a character feel real, there must be little room to question the aspects of their lives that we do not see.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is visually unique, possibly one of the most abstract creative artful anime. The animations may not be filled with a lot of doing, but the show may have still-shot images to fit and invoke the atmosphere of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, the soundtracks are extremely pleasant. Not the exciting kind of pleasant, but more so on the relaxation side; you could listen to this music in any generic time, like when you are doing your homework. It's not precisely relaxing like meditative music (although that's possible), but its great for a casual life. And because of this, the music helps greatly to let yourself be at ease while you watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith those two aspects said and done (Art & Sound), mainly I will review why the writing for the characters of Bakemonogatari are done so well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't simply unique towards one another, but the major uniqueness comes from its realistic and believable characters compared to other anime. You get the sense that these characters more than likely exist; or at least someone out there would be almost identical to them in personality, beliefs and/or ideals. While watching the show, you get to experience and explore the thoughts and actions of the characters, and each and every character is mentioned often enough (whether they are on-screen or not) that it's as if the viewer will understand the sense that those characters are living their own lives, not actually being scripted, even extremely minor characters such as Senjougahara Hitagi's father.\\n\\n\r\nThe production's styling of the characters in relevance to the overall story is something special. It's not neither cliche nor forced; we expect to not see the end of any one road/conflict, because the characters themselves have no goal that feels generic like saving the world, defeating evil, etc. Even if that kind of concept is iterated upon certain characters, it is a mindset for the characters (to emphasize their personalities) rather than a plot's purpose. Characters are shown as if they are naturally so, like human beings living their lives without a clear end-goal.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show does well towards its emphasis upon the feelings of characters, more than anything else. That's where its sole objective lies: \"How Do These Characters Feel as the story progresses?\" And we majorly discover and discover... repeatedly discover more and more that we are wrong. That we are always wrong. Wrong about how we saw these characters in the first place, and that these characters are like real individuals; unable to be judged by our preconceived notions. This is the dimension of character complexity that makes Bakemonogatari a respectable work.",

            "content": "-Overall-\r\nProbably the most overrated anime I have ever seen, do not watch with high expectations from glowing reviews like I did - this is, at heart, another cliche rom-com. The only reason scores are so high is because the \"art\" (refer to the art section right below for an explanation of the sarcastic quotes) is so different and the waifus are numerous. \r\n-Art-\r\nThis section is first because it is one of the biggest reasons for the show's popularity. The simplest explanation for all the praise is this analogy: imagine our world without any of the art movements that started with the 19th century until today;someone then decides to let their cats step in paint and then on a canvas, the art world is taken by storm. \\n\\n\r\nBecause 99% of anime takes so little chances with animation, what Bakemonogatari does is lauded as a masterpiece. The problem is it's all a facade, there is rarely any meaning or intent behind what is done - it is done just for the sake of doing it. Sure you can try to look for some symbolism in this show but you can do that for any work of art/literature and what you find may not be what the artist intended. \\n\\n\r\nOther shows, if only a handful, pull off the art card much more successfully and meaningfully. Example: Gankutsuou - just about every character wears epilepsy-inducing, flamboyant clothes; the count has nearly no pattern on the surface of his clothes but the inside of his cloak is insanely vibrant. The art was not only used to beautifully set the mood of scenes in the show but also as a basic symbol for character motives - simple yet effective use.\\n\\n\r\nIt's wrong to be overly critical of someone trying something different, god knows the anime world needs that, but it's important to keep perspective with praise, to differentiate between someone trying something different artistically to illustrate a certain view of the world and someone just letting their cats step in paint then on a canvas because they thought it would be neat and different. \\n\\n\r\n-Plot-\\n\r\nProbably the best part of the show is the premise: supernatural presences affecting characters due to their personal problems. Sounds great on paper, the problem lies in the quantity and execution. \\n\\n\r\nThere just isn't enough story aspect to these events, you basically have a one minute supernatural explanation from the Hermit Guru and a one minute exposition from MC at the end about why it happened to the victim and that's it - the rest is all dialogue over 2 episodes that attempts to be witty but comes off as incredibly unrealistic or explains the nature of a character with the subtlety of a Wiki article. \\n\\n\r\nOh and of course, supernatural events involve only young, attractive girls - to be fair they seem to be the only population around the MC. They could have at least inserted a bs line of dialogue such as \"women are more emotionally in tune with themselves than men and that causes the supernatural to gravitate toward them.\" I just made that crap line up with zero effort and it sounds like a plausible explanation, but the writers couldn't be bothered to even do that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso aggravating, the first episode spends a brief minute depicting this very interesting story that happened to the MC. The point is to explain his situation but it shows so many cool 5 second scenes that it becomes quite disappointing not to see the whole story.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe weakest link and the final straw as to why it it's hard to recommend this anime. Take away the overly long dialogue and the show's style and what do you have? \\n\\n\r\nBland protagonist that every girl gravitates to because he just can't help but try to solve their problems. And he actually doesn't do much, except for getting beat up, the Hermit Guru is the one with all the answers and solutions so why do the girls like the MC? Because they're supposed to. \\n\\n\r\nThe girls are supposed to be the high point of the show because they are more interesting and have more depth than those of the average anime, but the fact that they ALL fall for the MC negates any positives that could be said about their personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC has got to be one of the stupidest I have ever seen in ALL of anime. Take this spoiler-free example from episode 11: Your attractive, intelligent friend of the opposite sex, your ONLY friend seen thus far, shares their deepest problems with you: the highlight being that, because their parents are so horrible, they are depressed about a one week school vacation because it means they will be home where they're not even wanted. What would you do? Whether you are attracted to them or not, the correct thing to do as a friend would probably be to invite them to spend time with you over break. Oh wait, sorry the correct answer is to just nod along and act slightly bothered by the parents' attitude; and of course by doing that the friend couldn't love you more if they wanted to.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nWhether it's the incredibly dense protagonist with no redeeming features, or the girls that all fall for him for just being the intermediary in solving their problems, or the sisters that wake up their onii-chan in the morning (said sisters make a COMPLETE 180 in their attitude in season 2 for no reason), or the absence of any type of character -except for the Hermit Guru- that isn't an attractive girl, or the out of place fanservice..... This show is just cliche after cliche but the brain fails to notice because of the pretty colors and the massive amount of dialogue that needs to be processed. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is simply a rom-com with supernatural elements and there's nothing wrong with that premise. It's just that it tries too hard to set itself apart and act like something that transcends the medium when it really doesn't. Watch it as you would any rom-com with the clueless, bland MC that has girls falling for him left and right for no good reason and you won't be disappointed.",

Circle one: Yes/No/I don't know\r\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, rate the Monogatari Series. Circle one: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\r\nThis series is just like a color. Its style is so unique to a point that no other show has ever tried its method ofpresentation. Therefore, whether you think this is a masterpiece, a well attempted show, or a even complete trash, you are able to justify your opinion one way or another. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how good is the color Purple? \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't find this review helpful, please give me some feedback so I can provide content with better quality in the future. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (Concept 6/7, Development 2/3)\\n\\n\r\nI purposely adjusted my story rating system for this show. The concept is so overwhelmingly important that the development is no longer within our interest. \\n\\n\r\nMonogatari series is a harem anime. To put it bluntly, it is as generic as a anime can ever get: A guy called Araragi, or, Arararagi, who is in his third year of highschool, encountered multiple supernatural spiritual phenomenons related to... girls and creatures that look like girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe key of this anime's success is its unique style of presentation however. Characters in this show does nothing but talking. Araragi talks to girls who happen to love rant and bullshit about stuff that are... very intellectual and interesting. Of course, everybody has his/her own definition of the term \"interesting\", but there is no doubt that all the dialogues are well thought out. Aside from talking, the images on the screens change frequently in a manner that makes you think it is a slideshow: some slides display phrases Araragi or the speaking person is think, some slides show character's movement in brief seconds. None of the slides move too dramatically, but the slight, vivid moments give the conversations \"souls\". This practice essentially solves an issue that most other intellectual conversational show have: the majority amount of screen time is filled with a still image of a speaker who moves his/her mouth for 10 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not to say the conversation does not get boring once in a while. It is just like looking at the powerpoint presentations in college, you simply cannot concentrate on the slide shows for that long, because you are a human. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari, as the series' opening piece does a great job of getting audience interested. The 16 episode show has 5 arcs, each arc deals with a spiritual being and a new girl: Crab, Snail, Monkey, Snake and Cat. I will discuss the girls individually in the character section coming up next. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 4.5/5, Development 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in the show, tho I really don't want to use this term since I love them, cliche. A calm and smart one, a small and happy one, the underclassman and her friend, the girl you know with boobs. Our main Hero Araragi is a very typical guy who has supernatural power but don't really know all that much about his power. However, the girls are all unique that they all have distinct, and at least 2 dimensional character treats. Comparing to other shows in the harem genre, this is about the most you can ever get from a harem girl. \\n\\n\r\nI apologize in advance that I will not provide examples that describe character developments, since it would absolutely ruin all the fun you will get from this anime considering how simply the plot is. \\n\\n\r\nCrab. The first arc introduces a girl who has lost most if not all of she body mass due to her influence of the Crab spirit. She is what I would describe as a calm psycho. She is so aggressive at times that she threatens Araragi with a pile of things you would find in a pencil case (please refer to the anime's cover). She constantly comes back in other arcs as Araragi's supporter, so if you are the type who likes to get attached to the \"Main\" girl, you are in luck.\\n\r\nThe rest of the arcs (sorry for being lazy) are almost following the same formula. 1, understanding the situation, 2, Obtain help, 3, help the girl to either get rid of the spirit or limit the spirit's influence. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about these character is that all of them are given a very interesting background story by having a conversation, unlike most other shows that present boring flashbacks to explain a certain character. The characters are also not simply just \"vanished\" after the incident since they all have something left unresolved for the main character to deal with in the later time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 4/4, Fanservice 1/1)\\n\\n\r\nWtf there is a score for fanservice? Yes indeed. As an ecchi anime (arguably?), the quality of fanservice is inevitably important as that's part of what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe art uses simple and appealing color to outline the characters. The location of the conversations receive different style of background that fits the theme of the conversation. The visuals of slideshow are also very unique and well designed. Try pause once or twice and look closely on those slides, the Japanese writing placement are very clever. Not to mention the different camera angles and zero recycled materials. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for hard core action scenes, you are in the wrong neighborhood. The selling point of this anime's animation is the detailed movements and unique camera angles that catch those movements in the most unexpected way. The use of CG, unlike some of the other shows (Fate/stay night, cough cough), are surprising well done and they actually FIT with the 2D art. \\n\\n\r\n----------If you hate fanservice to the point of killing yourself, skip to the next section----------\\n\\n\r\nNow fanservice. This show has some most \"thought provoking\" services you can ever find. Unlike the fan service from other shows such as Highschool of the dead and Highschool Double D, the first thing that comes out of you is not a boner. The fan service gives you an impression of how beautiful the human bodies can be. Sure they are targeting the male audience, but with that said I believe female audience can also appreciate the art with a good mind set. I personally loved the fanservice (well comparing to other fanservice from other shows), not because they turn me on, but the fact that they show nudity in a good way, unlike those disgustingly presented ones that reminds you of porn. Again, you may still hate the fan service, but the fanservice in this show was very well done indeed without a doubt. \\n\\n\r\n----------You can keep reading now----------\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2/3, OST 2/3, Voice 4/4)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEvery arc they present a new OP and ED. All of them fit the current arc and the animation is beautiful (or bizarre). That said, out of all these songs, I might be able to recognize 2 or 3. They aren't memorable. \\n\\n\r\nOST are background music. They serve to set the atmosphere of the scenes. Absolutely nothing melodic or memorable. They are easy music that are made of clear and refreshing notes, rather than layers and layers of effects that distract the experience. \\n\\n\r\nVoice is awesome. Period. Oh in case you are asking for dub. Ha. Ha. Ha. Too bad. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nHarem is what led me to the world of anime, and this is the most awesome harem show in existence(SAO fans please don't hit me). Instead of putting all the girls together and make a giant mess, Monogatari tackles every individual girl one by one in the most detailed way possible. AND THERE IS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. When do you ever see that in harem? The pop culture references are simply hilarious. The unique presentation was a jackpot for me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd btw, I love the color Purple. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite being extremely superior in pretty much all the aspects comparing to its competitors, it failed to give me \"void\" if you know what I mean. But hey, it is not finished, so it is always good to look forward to the story, right? This anime certainly deserves its hype. Some may hate it and that's totally fine cuz all shows have haters. \\n\r\nBest harem/ecchi show ever? Yes. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how would you rate the color Purple? \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "I found this series very hard to enjoy. I was watching the show with a good friend of mine who recommended it due to his own personal love of the show. Unfortunately it wasn't the case for myself, the story of the show follows a pattern which soon you'll come to see after the third \"aberration\" which for me boiled down to a mundane repetitiveness that I couldn't grasp. Essentially, A problem arises, they talk evasively about it for a good long while, until the \"issue\" clicks, they then consult someone who helps them with said issue and then finally, moral learnt?\r\nBut whilst this isall happening certain other things repeat themselves too, such as with environments. Take for example, you'll be in a playground, you'll see that same environment for the whole episode, they'll pan the camera statically about the same point for a good long while followed by making use of the environment in some way, example a swing set, then back to the scrolling background, certain sounds are then also repeated, all the while flashing text will pop up on the screen which serves to highlight \"key emotions\" or plot say like \"anger\". These flashes whilst seem cool to begin with, for me became rather irritating, its not like you can even read the messages sometimes as they flash for a second containing a paragraph, you wouldn't want to pause the show as to ruin immersion, so what purpose do they ultimately serve? Art. Well see that's the thing, the show's artistic side is one of merit, its gorgeous, nothing short of what Studio Shaft is known for. But, whilst its beautiful its also rather \"artsy fartsy\", for lack of better vernacular. A little TOO excessive? Maybe a little too try-hard? The show does have other highlights, which for me came in the form of breaks between large chunks of conversation. I make it sound like the dialogue is bad, but that's not the case, it is well written and genuinely engaging at times, I just wish there were less random rambles and playing around the subject at hand and more focus on A to B (If that makes sense) as a pose to A C D E F then B.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this brings me to my overall verdict, the show aimed to be different, it aimed in some sense to set itself apart from the crowd by engaging you in cleverly written conversation. It may have also created a genre, but the question is, is this genre for you? For me, no, because whilst intelligent conversation sounds good, the shows creators know that this alone cannot carry the show, so in an attempt to keep you entertained we are served distractions, one of said distractions is the age old \"fan service\" which although I didn't see a LOT of, I have also read many a review about this series as a whole and to my understanding this will become a thing throughout the series, not to mention that the show's follow the patterns highlighted above. I have no MAJOR issues with mild fan-service but if it serves no point then I'm opposed. There is no action, so don't expect that. There is a lot of creative conversations, but are you willing to listen to random ramblings too? Then this might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nFor the above reasons, my enjoyment levels were low, I have now since dropped the show at episode 7.  In a sense, I an disappointed I didn't like the show more. I consider myself rather artistic, I am a graphic designer of sorts, I totally dig the art but art alone cannot carry a concept. Get ready for conversation! 6/10.",

            "content": "If I had to pick a word to describe Bakemonogatari, it would be \u201cbad\u201d. And I don\u2019t mean that in a positive way. \r\nBasically, Bakemonogatari is a Harem show. There is nothing special about it. It is just like every other harem show out there. We have Araragi, our protagonist who\u2019s exactly like every other harem protagonist other than the fact that he\u2019s a vampire, has a meaningful backstory, and doesn\u2019t get into stupid perverted situations with girls who act irrationally for the sake of comedy. Minus all the things that set this apart from other harem shows, this is nothing special. \r\nThe characters inthis show all fall into certain archetypes: We have the sexual assault victim who seems to be a tsundere but really is just bad at communicating with others and is using it as a defense mechanism. She even has the stereotypical broken family with a mother who, just like all anime mothers, got sucked into a cult and disowned her daughter. \tWe have the loli who\u2019s actually dead and is bratty because she doesn\u2019t want people to get hurt by being friendly with her and whose parents are divorced just like all anime parents. We even have the sporty girl who is, like most sporty girls, a lesbian and hates the main character because he took away her love interest. Most of them are simply used to deliver unfunny jokes that don\u2019t make sense unless you put in the effort to actively listen. And we all know just how awful that is. A lot of time is spent on meandering dialogue that isn\u2019t important to the plot at all except for all the times that it is and only serves to throw jokes at the audience that aren\u2019t funny because I didn\u2019t think they were funny. The characters are also constrained to their own \u201carcs\u201d. Each one only gets a few episodes before moving onto the next boring archetype character. This is inherently bad, no matter how well executed it is or how much story and character development is put into just a few episodes. Not that there\u2019s any character development anyways. After all, all the characters are cliche archetypes and this is just a normal harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo what makes Bakemonogatari unique? Well obviously the art, since everything else is pretty standard. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is animated in a very strange way. This isn\u2019t surprising. After all, it was animated by Studio SHAFT, who are, at this point, famous for their bizarre animation styles. In this show there\u2019s lots of times where there\u2019s real life photography and walls of text that go by so fast you can\u2019t read them unless you pause (and god forbid you have to pause). Aside from all the times that the characters are animated, there\u2019s very little animation to be found in this show. In fact, I can think of a lot of times where there\u2019s just static images. I can think of lots of times where there\u2019s actual animation as well, but those don\u2019t count. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is certainly interesting. However, there are times is was obvious they were just saving money. In fact, you can calculate how much each scene costs, with precise amounts such as \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201cnot very much\u201d. It\u2019s a lot more effort than pausing to read the walls of text, but it\u2019s harder to complain about, so I\u2019ll play it off as a game I played during this incredibly generic, boring show. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the backgrounds are unusual, the character designs are very normal for a harem anime. Honestly, name me one harem anime that DOESN'T have a monkey girl in a raincoat. As a generic harem anime, the main draw is the cute girls and not the plot or intricate character relationships. The supernatural elements aren\u2019t that interesting either since they were obviously there to trick the audience into thinking that this wasn\u2019t a generic harem show. While this show does have slightly odd directing, the girls are all attractive and in generic harem positions such as being constricted by invisible snakes while wearing a school swimsuit, or ripping apart the main character with your monkey arm while wearing a raincoat in the creepiest way possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe show breaks the fourth wall a lot, with the main female lead, Senjogahara, calling herself a tsundere. At times they question the fact that they are characters in an anime. Most people would use this and say that it\u2019s proof that Bakemonogatari is \u201cself-aware\u201d. While they\u2019re right, I\u2019m going to be edgy and different by trying desperately to prove them wrong. \\n\\n\r\nSee, Bakemonogatari isn\u2019t really ironic. It just pretends to be in order to protect itself from criticism. It\u2019s saying \u201csee we\u2019re poking fun at ourselves, therefore you can\u2019t criticize us for our use of tropes. This is not irony for the sake of humor. It\u2019s simply a way or utilizing anime archetypes and creating a cast of one-dimensional characters that aren\u2019t fleshed out or sympathetic except for all the times that they are. It\u2019s just proving how lazy the author was. He didn\u2019t feel like creating complex characters so he decided to use stereotypes and then poke fun at them. This obviously took no effort at all. The author needs to learn how to make believable, sympathetic, well rounded characters like Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nThe heavy use of self-aware humor has several downfalls. First of all, it is hard for simple people like me to understand it. Second, it\u2019s easy to make fun of and trash-talk. It also seems to think that the audience isn\u2019t going to notice that it\u2019s relying on the same cliches it\u2019s making fun of to stay afloat. I cannot think of a single scene where it was held up by it\u2019s intriguing story or interesting characters because all of them are so cliche. I mean honestly, I haven\u2019t seen a single harem show that doesn\u2019t involve a girl who was almost raped when she was 12. The series feels very empty because, aside from charming characters, entertaining dialogue, and interesting art and story, it had nothing to offer besides cliches.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Bakemonogatari is just a bad anime. It tries to sound smart and avoid criticism with interesting art and faux-ironic jokes when really it relies on nothing but cliches and tropes. If you want to see an anime that doesn\u2019t rely on tropes, cliches, or deus ex machina, AND has well rounded, interesting characters, check out Sword Art Online. It\u2019s the best anime ever made.\\n",

            "content": "\"If you're kind to everyone, that means there's no one special\"\r\nThis anime centers around Koyomi Araragi, a not-so normal high school guy, and the supernatural forces burdening them. \r\nCharacters:\r\nIn my opinion the most important part of any story, the cast of Bakemonogatari do not disappoint, with varied personalities and traits. The two main characters, Koyomi Araragi and Hitage Senjougahara, themselves have won a place as some of my favorites out of any anime for their mindsets and chemistry with one another. They have an interesting relationship, to say the least, with Senjougahara acknowledging herself as a tsundere but also taking jabs at Araragi, whom takesit wearily as he knows he can't win as any response has no effect. This never ending conflict is part of what makes this show so compelling, to me at least. The 4 other heroines all have their own personalities and problems, and while not as deep, are still interesting in their respects. The last major character is Meme Oshino, who aids Araragi in resolving various problems.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe anime basically moves in arcs depending on the various females and the entities affecting them. Along the way Araragi and Senjougahara's relationship develops slowly in the midst of all the madness. I was happy with the arc style as it didn't detract from the ending, but I felt one in particular felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nProduced by Studio Shaft, this anime followed the studio's style to a high degree of different angles, cuts, and inserts. If you are new to the series, it may take some time to adjust to all the madness that pops up, especially with the dialogue shots, which often flash on and off screen at a moments notice. Just enjoy it and overthink it too much. While some may find it distracting, I found it quite enjoyable to be presented with such an experience. My only major qualm was that in the midst of all this, they even added some real life  clips/pics, which I believe didn't really belong in there. The characters themselves are (in my opinion) all well designed and look good, with fluid actions and expression. \\n\r\nP.S. some fanservice thrown in if you like that also\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nVoice- The seiyuus did an excellent job on this series, with each voice matching the characters spot on, on emotion and tones. With Bakemonogatari so heavy on dialogue, they really did an amazing job. I really wish I could understand Japanese as the series employs generous helpings of sarcasm, wit, and pop culture jokes that cannot fully be appreciated in translation. \\n\\n\r\nMusic-The music fit well with the scenes, providing the something extra to the dialogue. For a short-ish anime of only 15 episodes, it has five whole OP's, each different in tone and style. \"Staple Stable\" is the first and probably the best imo, and the ED Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari by supercell is becoming one of my favorites just for listening to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can whole-heartedly say that, while subjective, for me myself, this was a 10/10 anime for enjoyment. Everything just came together really well to be a lovely slew of arcs, characterization, and dialogue. I loved the characters and their interactions with one another, and the romance was great in that it wasn't sappy but meaningful over time. This was honestly just the sort of thing I was looking for, and I am already craving more.",

I watched the monogatari series many years ago and left it somewhere in the middle. Back then while I did enjoy it it was lacking for me, some parts bored me and just went over my head, and some parts just weirded me out.\r\nBut after rewatching it again with a different mindset from when i was young, i came back here to change my rating from an 8 to a 10. The story was much more clear tome now than before and the parts I once thought were boring n longer existed. The whole series was interesting from start to finish. Each character had something interesting about them. Heck, I remember hating nadeko before, and now I honestly cant even remember why! \\n\\n\r\nA unique anime that relies heavily on its clever dialogue to run the show, but despite that doesn't shy away from giving us fantastic visuals. the soundtrack is also spot on (who can forget beloved renai circulation? though many of the other songs are great as well)\\n\\n\r\nQuite possibly the greatest \"harem\" anime of all time.",

            "content": "I received monogatari series recommendations a long time ago but never had the right motivation to watch it, as there were a ton of other anime every season plus I was never that interested in watching it. But one day I just had a sudden intuition to watch it so I started to watch it and boy I had missed some good shit up till now.\r\nNow let me clear one thing with all the people who call this a harem anime ,you guys are half right. I mean ok  the main character is quite a cliche but still its way much calling it aharem anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the story. The story is basically the same as written in the summary, that is, a boy saving different girls from abbreations(supernatural beings) and all. As the name suggests \"monogatari\" meaning a story which strictly refers to the japanese literature, is a collection of stories which are very well written and pictured. The humor, the references from japanese tales, and the story line is quite commendable. The world play by the characters to talk and tease each others are very well written. Character development and the story line flow is also done very nicely. In this anime you can't just like or hate a single character. Each and every character has its own importance and play a unique role in the story. You just can't simply choose the best girl in the series as all of them are very likable characters, even after saying that I like Shinobu-chan the most.\\n\\n\r\nAnd resting my case I would 8/10 recommend this anime for its story. There were some scenes which I had to slow down, pause and even re-watch to understand it but it was totally worth it. If you are a frequent manga reader then should absolutely read the manga, but its quite difficult to understand rather than watching the anime.",

I felt like someone was sticking needles into my eyes and woke me up with a hangover. \r\nThe story seems good, the characters seem good. The sound is top notch.\r\nBut the art. Ugh.\r\nCharacters look like, animated well. No issues. But the colour palettes and the scenery is just dreadful to my eyes.\r\nAt times entire scenes are bathed in a monocoloured lighting, at other times entire sections of the scenery are completely missing, replaced by said monocoloured background.\r\nIt feels likeyou're at an abstract art show and you're being told that this art style is awesome and you must like it because it's so bloody awesome.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's not. It feels sloppy, artsy for the sake of being artsy without any purpose behind it. It doesn't add anything to the show, only takes away.\\n\\n\r\nSame can be said for the art direction. There's no smooth scene transitions or well animated traveling scenes for the characters. Nope. Inbetween the actual anime scenes you get countless flashcards thrown into your face. It's impossible to read the text because they only show for a fraction of a second. Yet pausing the anime to read them gives irrelevant information. So you're screwed either way. You either get epilepsy and be incredibly annoyed by the useless noise, or you keep pausing the anime, piss yourself off that way, and still obtain nothing of use.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show is one of the few times I got legitimately angry, because I feel like a good potential story and good characters are absolutely ruined by the art choice and direction. It's like picking up a good book only to find that it's written completely in Comic Sans and every other page has a different coloured background. That's what it literally feels like.\\n\\n\r\nWatch at your own risk.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is about Araragi Koyomi, getting involved in unusual supernatural creatures known as oddities. In this part of the Monogatari series, it has 5 stories set, talking about 5 different girls that Araragi meets.\r\nCharacter: \r\nAll of the characters are of a typical harem anime. They have a loli-type, tsundere-type, little sister type, big sister(little) type, smart-type, etc,. Disregarding that, this part of the anime focuses mainly on Araragi's personality, and how he likes helping other characters in the story, which leads to them falling in love. It does not focus on the harem too much, since the stories are separated, and each story has Araragiand a different main or minor character as the main with him. Almost every character is a dynamic character, changing due to important events in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn Bakemonogatari, the stories that are told are all unique. About half of the series is mainly about Araragi and Senjougahara's relationship developing throughout the series, and there are other characters who develop romantic feelings for the protagonist. The series has Araragi portrayed as a a \"hero\", willing to help others at the cost of his own life. Each story in the series do not get sidetracked except for the ending, which was a truly magnificent scene. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is obvious enough to know that one of the producers is \"Shaft\" with their famous head tilt. This was animated in 2009-2010, so the quality of the series is not very good, but disregarding that, the characters still please the eye, and are not old fashioned. The art makes this show focus solely on the characters known in the series. Minor characters aren't even shown, only heard, or they're outlined and not shown. This art style suits this mysterious series very well due to it being very compatible with each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEach story had separate OPs & EDs which was the first anime I've ever seen switching repeatedly. Each OP and ED matches the characters personality most of the time, and matches the story. An example of how the OP matches a character, would be the child-like sound to the OP \"Renai Circulation\" in the Nadeko Snake story of the series. The last ED \"Kimi ni Shiranai\", matches perfectly with the ending of the anime as well. By far my favorite ED for the entire series possibly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI truly believe, if you love a high-quality romance, Bakemonogatari will be the perfect anime for you. The story is well-told and will not bore you. The series has many BGM that will also get you hooked into the anime that fit into the story, same for the OP and ED. I haven't watched many anime titles yet(little over 200) but this is by far my favorite romance, it does not get sidetracked, and focuses on the story. There are a couple flaws that I personally did not like, but the plot of the story made all of the flaws not even matter.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This will be my 10th review, so I\u2019d love to hear any critique or viewpoints on things that I can keep improving, or things that you think I\u2019ve already done well in improving.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\u201cBeing kind to everyone, simply means there\u2019s no one special.\u201d\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\r\nThe general (spoiler-free) plot is at first glance very simple. Araragi finds out about an aberration in some way, and then proceeds to deal with it in some way. Simple enough. \r\nHowever, even if all of these \u201carcs\u201d may seem pretty standalone, they all sort of tie together in a not-so-direct story related event, but how they all affect Araragi\u2019s relationshipswith people. \\n\\n\r\nI thought each of the \u201cproblems\u201d that appear throughout the series were quite well done, and rather interesting, and most of the episodes had small twists to further entice the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably know, this is a very dialog-heavy show, and so at first I thought it felt kind of slow. However, once you actually get into it, that problem quickly disappears. But because this is so focused around the dialogues, and they don\u2019t always talk about things related to any aberration or anything else seemingly related to the story of the episode, it can be hard to follow (or even remember) what the original point of the conversation even was. \\n\\n\r\nEven with this minor complaint, the show manages to keep you interested with whatever\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s an exorcism or talking about things you\u2019ve heard on the radio. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is simply amazing. While the quality of the art and the detailed backgrounds are a big plus, that\u2019s not all that makes up for the amazing art; It\u2019s also about the very special way things are visually presented. \\n\r\nAs someone else pointed out before me, a lot of the art in Bakemonogatari more or less serve as visual aid, as opposed to eye-candy. This is clearly exemplified by the \u201ctext-only screens\u201d (I\u2019m unsure what to actually call them, to be honest), where it\u2019s simply a single-colored background with a single line of text. This can sometimes be a repetition of what was just said, to sort of \u201cenhance\u201d the message trying to be delivered, and sometimes they transition between these screens really fast, to write out entire pieces of the story, (so to speak). \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is how there\u2019s not really a lot of movement going on in the scenes. While there are some scenes featuring the characters walking somewhere, and even the occasional fighting scene, which all have very fluid and good-looking animations when it actually comes down to it, a lot of the scenes play out with the characters sitting down, or moving from place to place in between jump cuts. \\n\r\nBecause of this, a lot of the scenes may sometimes have weird camera angles, a lot of jump cuts (as I just said) with characters switching positions in the area, and of course the occasional head tilt and \u201chair twitch\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this serve to keep the viewer interested throughout all of the dialog the show presents, as I think it might\u2019ve been a pretty boring experience had they done it any other way, whether they just had a static image of the characters currently talking, or more \u201cnormal\u201d animation techniques....\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nIn a series so focused on talking, it obviously won\u2019t work out if you have \u201cbad\u201d voice actor\u2019s, or VA\u2019s who don\u2019t really seem to know what they\u2019re doing.  Fortunately, this is not the case for Bakemonogatari at all. All of the voice actors do a very good job in portraying their respective characters, and they\u2019re all a joy to listen to. \\n\r\nThe cast also features one of my favorite voice actors, Hanazawa Kana, as a somewhat important character, so bonus points for that!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I think it\u2019s an overall great OST. A total of 5 different openings are used (one for each arc?), including one by Hanazawa Kana; However, only a single ending song is used, \u201cKimi no Shiranai Monogatari\u201d sung by Supercell\u2019s Nagi.\\n\r\nThe actual background music is also very well done, and adds a lot to each scene, whether it\u2019s a loving moment between two characters, or an intense battle between Araragi and an aberration. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThis would also be a section very important to an anime like this, but yet again they\u2019ve succeeded in creating interesting & enjoyable characters. All of the characters are rather different from each other, which makes for a nice contrast when they\u2019re interacting with each other. There is character development present throughout the story, though all characters don\u2019t share as much of this as the others do, however it\u2019s not really needed for these characters to develop any further at the moment either. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really a well done and interesting cast of characters which, again, is important to a series so focused on dialog, because having emotionless drawings talk about stuff would really take away from the feeling they\u2019ve managed to draw out with their work. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nAt first I was a bit reluctant, and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy this very much (or well, not as much as I did), since as far as I knew it was basically 90% dialog. But somehow, because it\u2019s so well done and whatnot, I really enjoyed just watching the characters talk to each other even if it did feel slow at first, and I\u2019ll happily watch the rest of the franchise hoping for the same level of enjoyment.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari - \r\nLemme start by saying that this entire show has been a fun ride from beginning to the end. It is quite possibly the best slice of life anime I've ever watched. And I enjoyed (almost) every minute of it.\r\nThe show is very funny, constantly teetering between high brow social commentary, to surreal meta humor, to slapstick nonsense. It's just so goddamned funny and that's the one aspect I enjoyed most out of Bakemonogatari. It's lighthearted and overall cheerful and fun all around.\r\nUsually I'd dismiss light novel-to-anime adaptations, but this show really works well as an anime, more so than as a light novelthanks to the surreal animation courtesy of Shaft. The constant switching of artstyle per episode and the freeze-frame cuts randomly juxtapositioned in strangely fit the scene depicted onscreen really well. And the surreal atmosphere is perfectly portrayed  by the unnatural character animations and backgrounds. Fantastic stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are all genuinely enjoyable, while Nadeko and Hanekawa_(human) are a bit too cliched for my tastes, te rest of the cast is very well written. The protagonist in particular is a lovable idiot who sticks his nose in place where it don't belong. While in other animes I'd abhor characters like this, Bakemonogatari makes it work by making him a foil to almost every other character he meets, making it an excellent story telling technique.\\n\\n\r\nSenjougahara in particular I believe to be quite possibly the best characterized character in the show, being an unusual tsundere character as far as tsunderes go, and overall being very likable due to her witty banter with Araragi.\\n\\n\r\nI do like the structure of a short story system in which different episodes focuses on different stories with an arc tying all of them together. It makes for a very relaxing pace and it's a nice break from the usual \"protagonist gets thrown into complicated scenarios every episode except in one or two\" animes I've been used to. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is very excellently composed. The very relaxing contemporary lounge like music fits the lightheartedness of the series very well, in particularly the piano tune that accompanies most comedic moments and the spaghetti western-esque leitmotif of Oshino Meme, both of which I consider to be the most memorable themes in the series. And the OPs are all catchy and fun too, Renai Circulation on one hand is very evil in the sense that it can't leave your mind ever.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't too fond of moments where the anime got too serious, not really a fan of how they handled serious scenes, they tend to be too ordinary or too normal for my tastes. It somewhat betrays the lightheartedness and surreality of the rest of the anime IMO. Of course they had to be there for plot purposes, but at times I wished Araragi wasn't that much of a white knight type of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice moments I didn't mind. The main protag is portrayed as a pervert anyway, so fanservice somewhat makes sense in terms of plot, and they aren't intrusive.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Bakemonogatari is highly highly enjoyable and one of the best animes I've the pleasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Better than the regular Madoka series.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character short stories :\\n\\n\r\nMayoi>Hitagi>Kanbaru>Hanekawa>Nadeko \\n\\n\r\n(My goodness all the names are weird) \\n",

            "content": "Story: 10\nI've never seen a series of this magnitude take such a risky and ultimately ingenious way of telling a story as showing it through a lens of a character. Some things in the story can even be disregarded completely as they could just be happening in the head of Araragi. It still succeeds in keeping a very slow pace very interesting, which is no small feat. It also keeps you on your toes, as you cannot know exactly what is going on.\nArt: 10\nWhy? Because it perfectly fits the mood, music, and most importantly, is composed from more than just pictures. It's made from thevery mind of the character of Araragi. From the touches like every car, every bike (excluding Araragi's own) looking exactly the same, to the big ones, like the absolutely empty city, it all enforces in a brilliant manner the way Araragi sees the world. Sometimes there are even absolutely pointless things on screen, but that's why it's brilliant: We all see and think about pointless things in one point or another. Also it's surreal nature makes it very interesting to look at, and it really keeps your attention.\\n\\n\nSound: 10\\n\nI simply love the soundtrack and the sound design in general. The characters' voices are spot on, and the soundtrack is always more than fitting. It's the kind that is enjoyable to listen on it's own, but almost transcending when shown with the brilliant artstyle and the real and surreal scenes the story takes place on.\\n\\n\nCharacter: 10 (Would give more if i could)\\n\\n\nEven if Araragi was the only character to rate, it would be a 10. Character portrayal is rarely seen to be so integral to a series as in Bakemonogatari. Bakemonogatari takes the simple idea of taking the idea of portraying the whole series through a lens of a character, and nails it in every possible manner. It makes the surreal scenes realistic, and adds mystery even to the most normal of occasions.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\nNormally it would be only 9, but when I realized that by a small change in the point of view can change a series an insurmountable amount, I started to enjoy this series on another level. It feeds my brains with ingenious subtext and never is too greedy with it's execution. It consists, mostly of dialogue, but it never feels dull, as the conversations are real in a surreal sense, giving it a rarely seen depth.\\n\\n\nOverall: 10\\n\nUltimately the best series I've watched until now, as it makes dialogue more interesting than action, and makes action and dialogue both an abstraction.\\n\nIt may sound hard, but believe me. Once you realize the way to watch the show as I think the makers intended, it makes the whole package stand out from all other series.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is a masterpiece in terms of anime and media itself. Telling the story of what seemed to me a typical lead character in Harem anime, one whom goes about helping various girls due to his \"kindness and purity\"; however, rest assured that is the only part of the anime that can be called even remotely generic.\r\nWhen I first began watching the series annoyance clouded my mind. I felt as though the story was purposefully being overly pretentious, the art seemed like a jumbled mess, and from what I had read before it was supposed to look like the animation studio decided to takeLSD. Despite my inherent displeasure I continued watching, not because I had nothing else do, but because (subconsciously) I fell in love with the essence of what Bakemonogatari is. If you did not enjoy the first few episodes I implore you to give this anime 6 episodes of your time to change your opinion of it. \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10: Following our \"hero\" throughout his quest to save a bunch of exclusively female characters from things called oddities. We begin the story with an inherent dislike for the character that our knight is saving; the classic tsundere character of anime provides us with the stereotypical opening of a harem-based anime that many viewers probably expect. That is where the typical tropes of an anime end, and an almost new type of story is born. Bakemonogatari is so dialogue-based that arguably 90% of screen time is filled with characters speaking to each other. Now that might raise a red flag to many people, but the storytelling aspect is so important to what makes this anime unique, that one might begin thinking why no one else has tried this before. You soon become integrated in the story and begin understanding the nuances of the walls of text that at first appeared annoying and even redundant. A light-novel anime in the most literal sense. The adventure that begins ensures you will never feel as though your time has been wasted whilst watching Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The animation creates a unique feel that surpasses most (if not all) modern anime in terms of presentation. Every bit of color that is given to the viewer is meant to invoke a certain reaction, a purpose. At first I found it hard to deal with and even became annoyed at the color schemes and walls of text. Why are there these random camera angles viewing the characters feet and backs? Why are you showing me a wall instead of the characters face as they are speaking? The art is done so as to give the viewer a perspective like no other, and cause one to think; instead of blindly staring at the screen and being given the answers. Truly one of the most beautiful anime I have ever watched. Bakemonogatari's visually aesthetic fluidity is magic to behold\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: So many anime have tried and failed to master the subtle; yet vital, use of sound to accompany the images being displayed. The sound dictates the mood, and thus dictates what needs to be felt during a certain scene, or to instantaneously change the mood faster than can be done with animation. The abrupt sound changes throughout the series are perfectly placed to create the desired effect upon the viewer. The at first seemingly random sounds created during walls of text show a transition, and based upon the mood change required, play a sound corresponding to an association of feeling in the human brain. Beethoven mastered music, Bakemonogatari mastered sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: Now you may be wondering why an 8 was deemed appropriate for an anime that has only received praise so far. Senjougahara Hatagari is your typical tsundere love interest at first, and does herself no favors with her sharp demeaning dialogue directed towards the Kiyomi (main). Despite this unfavorable initial position she blossoms into a character that one may sympathize with and even begin to love. Hanekawa is the on the opposite side of the anime-girl spectrum; a shy and caring girl (with glasses and large breasts because obviously) who is very attached to Kiyomi, and constantly goes out of her way to help him. Her character development during the final arc gives her the opportunity to flourish. Much like a flower the complexity of her character is only revealed once the facade of perfection falls away, leaving a less-than-perfect vibrant fruit. All of the female leads in this series focus on a trope typical in the harem genre, but with additional complexities that make them all extremely likable. All of the female leads are likable, but not the only male lead. Initially, Kiyomi is also portrayed as the stereotypical \"i'm kind, caring, and will save everyone\" main character. One would expect him to develop into someone who's flaws are shown to create a more complex personality than is initially established. NOPE. I didn't even like Kiyomi at the start, and by the end his stupidity, carelessness, indecisiveness, and lack of complexity serve to create a pile of sh*t used merely to dispose of the waste in the well-oiled machine that is Bakamonogatari. Now don't misunderstand, he has to be there for the story to develop. I merely wish that he had become a flushed-out character like the rest. Oh well, there's the 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Despite Kiyomi's blandness, this is a highly enjoyable anime that works to create a unique anime environment that is essential to its identity. All of the aspects of the story work to continuously support one another, and create an anime that can only be described as a masterpiece. The only qualm would be that the story starts off rather slowly, but once it picks up pace, it is impossible to stop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Kiyomi and the slow start are the only things keeping this anime from being perfect. From the art and sound, to the leading and supporting characters, to the highly engaging story. Bakamonogatari comes highly recommended for anyone looking for a show just short of a creative masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is my first review, and I was thinking that I was going to hate this anime after the first episode. So after finishing it I felt I owed it an apology in the form of a review. Thanks to all who read this far, and enjoy the show!",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is a series where I feel like I'm missing something crucial that everyone else appears to see. The series is applauded by many as being clever, creative, and entertaining. However, to me, it was none of these.\r\nThe concept of the show is that our main character, Araragi, became involved in dealings with the supernatural after an incident involving vampires. After this he meets various girls in his life who are haunted by supernatural entities, and Araragi must help them solve both their personal and supernatural problems. An interesting concept, but the execution completely falls flat.\r\nTo put it simply, this is a boring harem show.Araragi has the harem protagonist cliche of just having all of the women in his life throw themselves at him for no real reason. In fact, I'm really not sure how I'm supposed to feel about Araragi here. It's extremely hard to sympathize with someone who does things like sexually harass an elementary school age girl, but at the same time he's not downright evil enough for me to truly hate him. He comes off as simply a pervert, jerk, etc. without any truly redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nThe other big issue I have besides the poorly handled harem aspect is that the show is just plain boring. I hope you like talking, but this show is about 95% characters standing around and just talking. When I was reading about the concept of the show, I expected to see the characters actually, you know...dealing with supernatural creatures. Instead they drone on and on about both the creatures and tons of other irrelevant stuff. When they do finally shut up, their \"solution\" to every problem is always the same: go see Araragi's friend Oshino so he can tell them what to do. I'll admit that there is sometimes a good payoff, such as the climax of Kanbaru's arc. However, it's not even remotely worth the pain of everything that came before it for a few minutes of something that actually turned out to be entertaining. Had I not heard such praise of the show, I would have dropped it during the second arc, when one episode was almost entirely three characters standing in a park just talking about Mother's Day. Seriously, 22 minutes of boringness.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a show completely devoid of positives, however. The art is pretty unique and quite nice. The characters all have a \"soft\" feel to them that I liked a lot. The show does do some pretty strange things visually, such as flashing \"Red Scene\" and \"Black Scene\" text up on screen seemingly at random, sometimes throwing up giant walls of text that you can't possibly read without pausing, and sometimes showing real photography. And of course, sometimes the characters are shown in very strange and exaggerated poses (the \"Shaft head tilt\"). It's all just weirdness for the sake of weirdness, not adding anything to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, however, is good. I enjoyed a lot of the soundtrack and the openings. It's nothing outstanding that I'd download and put on a playlist, but it works well and I liked it. Not much to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakemonogatari was an absolute bore. The characters talk about doing things while rarely actually doing anything. It looks and sounds nice, but no aesthetics can save the horrible pacing and boring harem setup of this show.",

            "content": "It\u2019s not bad because of its paedo fan-service. There isn\u2019t that much of it anyway. It\u2019s not bad because it\u2019s almost entirely comprised of dialogue. Tatamy Galaxy is probably even more wordy, yet it\u2019s good. It is bad because of either its messages, or poor execution of them. And because of its abysmal pacing.\r\nThe first arc deals with Senjougahara\u2019s troubled past. She is a girl who was molested in the past bacause of her mother. She willingly forgets all this to lighten her mental and emotional load, which is metaphorically presented as giving her troubles and her literal weight to a crab oddity/spirit/demon/whatever. Something supernatural.\r\nThereare two ways to interpret this. A more literal one would be that she has supernaturally induced amnesia about the things that happened. Yet, this doesn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d her. On the contrary, she becomes more problematic, snapping at others, becoming a recluse etc. Why? There seems to be an implication that if you erased a traumatic event, you\u2019d somehow *wouldn\u2019t* be better off. I\u2019m guessing the crab didn\u2019t do a very good job at deleting everyhing relating to the incident. Why didn\u2019t it? Just so the author could shoehorn his morals in? I was never raped in my life. Should I get raped to somehow enrich myself by it? I resent the implications this interpretation has. But it\u2019s too literal. Let\u2019s move to a better one.\\n\r\nThe second interpretation is that she simply repressed her negative memories, no supernatural included. The crab stuff is merely a (pretentious and unnecessary) way to make the show more interesting. Okay. The crab couldn\u2019t take away everything about the incident because the show wants to be true to life, and this is how life works. Fair enough. But then my problem is that all this happens way too fast. Two 20 minute episodes. And a lot of the time is wasted on puns. But that\u2019s not the biggest issue, the puns don\u2019t take all the time, and you could argue they convey her character.\\n\r\nThe main issue is that everything is solved by just talking. Yeah, that\u2019s how it works IRL, too, you just talk to a therapist, right? But you don\u2019t resolve such a huge issue with just one session, do you? You might argue, but she doesn\u2019t she just opens up, she\u2019s isn\u2019t completely \u201cfixed\u201d yet. But that that happened too fast, too. I read a real-life biography of a woman who was raped by her dad when she was a child. There was even a cult involved, like in the show. It took her *years* after the rape stopped to say to someone, anyone, what happened (her mother). She also had intimacy issues for years, and couldn\u2019t open up to her last, most considerate, boyfriend for ages, or do anything physical with him even though she wanted to. I see nothing of that in this arc. And since the idea of \u201cyou must accept your past\u201d isn\u2019t that much on its own (imagine just reading that quote without anything else \u2013 do you consider it a masterpiece quote or something?), most of its potential lies in its execution. And for the reasons stated above, I found the execution very poor. Senjou\u2019s victories, ironically, feel too weightless to have any impact, whether emotional or philosophical.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is about the little girl Mayoi Hachikuji. Her three-episode arc is about cherishing your parents. She lost hers and this inspires Araragi, the protagonist, to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day, even though he didn\u2019t want to initially. I really dislike this sort of reasoning. Her parents were (presumably, even this isn\u2019t clear, but I\u2019m assuming it for the sake of argument) nice and loving. She appeals to emotion of Araragi\u2019s, that he should cherish his family while he has them. But this idealism is misguided. What if his family is horrible? Why should he cherish a family that only makes his life worse?\\n\r\nAnd since we don\u2019t see them, or see enough of them, how do we know whether they deserve to be cherished or not? This undermines the message of the story. But, again for the sake of the argument, let\u2019s assume they do deserve it. Why should he cherish them on a day when it\u2019s mandatory to do so? All that \u201clove\u201d then seems fake and artificial. As they say, you should cherish your family (if it deserves it) throughout the whole year. Or at least do it on days when it feels natural for you.\\n\r\nI\u2019d rewrite this arc so that his mother was nagging him to celebrate the holiday for years, but he refused because of how fake it felt. Finally, this year, being under pressure from her, and sick of it, he suggests that they watch a movie instead, hoping this would be a more genuine way to establish a connection with his mother. So he lets her choose the movie. But he didn\u2019t think it through, and she chooses something he doesn\u2019t want to watch. So he agonizes about it. Instead of Mayoi, I\u2019d have Senjougahara talk him into watching the movie after all. He\u2019d be confused why is she on the side of family, considering the way hers is, trying to get out of it. She\u2019d say something like \u201cThe fact that my family is horrible, doesn\u2019t mean *every* family is horrible. You might be wasting something I never had. I\u2019m not saying you must love them, but don\u2019t jump to conclusions, either.\u201d Moved, he\u2019d decide to give it a try. It would turn out he actually loves the movie, and after that bonds with his mother as they both gush about it, how they both really liked some major aspect of it. And maybe throw in a little disagreement over some other, minor, aspect for good measure. It would give awesomeness and depth to Senjou\u2019s character, and the whole conflict would make more sense and impact, while still having the same overall message. The only issue with my idea is that it\u2019s maybe *too* optimistic and idealistic. Maybe throw in that one of his sisters also goes along and hates the movie, and the three of them just can\u2019t see eye to eye on it?\\n\r\nI\u2019d also shorten the whole arc, most likely to 2 episodes. There is just so much time wasted on nothing. The show is lauded for its \u201cdeep subtext.\u201d It\u2019s pretty obvious in one of the episodes that Senjou wants the D, but she masks it with aggressive jokes. It\u2019s obvious from the first time she says it, but she repeats it for the quarter of the episode. The problem is also that the subtext is always the same. It\u2019s like listening to \u201cI want to fuck you\u201d or \u201cI want an emotional bond with you\u201d repeated for 5 minutes straight, except it\u2019s worded differently every time. It doesn\u2019t add anything meaningful or important, nor does it even build her character, as fans like to claim. It\u2019s just exasperating, unnecessary, and wasting the viewer\u2019s time.\\n\r\nThere are also claims that things make more sense once you watch more, that thing before reference things that come after and vice versa. To me, this simply seems like bad writing. It\u2019s okay to have things be connected, but you can\u2019t do it at the expense of the current stories losing sense or impact, which I believe is the case here. The whole puzzle aspect should be a cherry on top. You can\u2019t base an entire story and show on a gimmick. To stick with the Tatamy Galaxy comparison, I feel like that show both has the retroactive \u201ca-ha!\u201d moment, while still at the same time still being good episode to episode, unlike Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell you more than this, about subsequent arcs or seasons, because I simply dropped the show. It was that bad. Visually, it looks great, though. To mention something positive about it, in the interest of fairness. The ideas themselves also had a lot of potential, but they\u2019re either too vague, simplistic, crude, or poorly executed to be actually good. Just watch Bunny Girl Senpai, instead.\\n",

            "content": "~ You don't have to hold it in. You can say when it hurts. ~\r\nThe \"male protagonist surrounded by troubled girls\" is a formula that has been used time and time again. Often this goes hand in hand with a very predictable Slice of Life styling, complete of course with a fall guy, and a silent love interest. Bakemonogatari however, refuses to conform to anything. It takes on the challenge of turning a simple SoL formula, and even the vampire \"genre\" (i don't really consider this to be a genre), into something with a beautiful and distinct style of its own. \r\nIt's a short firstseason, and so it bodes well that it stays away from filler content. The first thing most people will acknowledge when they pick up Bakamonogatari is the extremely expressive art, and the cropping/jumping between scenes to an abstract extent. Although i was not initially a fan of this styling, i must say that it gradually grew on me... so viewers be prepared, because the backbone, and the very identity of the show is its unique and eccentric presentation...\\n\\n\r\nUsually i keep audiovisual judgement to a minimum when reviewing, but Bakamonogatari's art and sound couldn't possibly be better utilized by, and integrated into its abstract nature. For starters, the artwork is very clean and well defined. The settings makes good use of patterns, and minimalist, while vibrant artistic design. Sometimes words and visual metaphors are used as a really bold and creative alternative. Even real-life art isn't off-limits with Bakemonogatari, as it doesn't let anything come to hinder its expressive potential. Finally, if this wasn't enough to sell you the technical expertise of Aniplex, this 15 episode show also offer up a large amount of highly fitting audio tracks, in a genuinely noticeably beautiful score...\\n\\n\r\nNow... onto the substance of the review...\\n\r\nI remember being really confused near the start of Bakamonogatari, as it's not the type of production to pause and allow you to process what's going on, and so i can't stress enough that this one WILL require your full attention span. Don't get me wrong though, the context is an interesting one, but its also shrouded in layers of mystery, and shattered into a a fine powder that is consumed by the various female characters, and so it becomes more familiar and immersive overtime. Asides from deterring uncommitted viewers who after seeing and being stumped by 2 episodes decide to quit watching, this has always aided the show's rather cryptic, mysterious and unpredictable style; that invokes and awakens a primal curiosity in its viewers. This deceiving lack of clarity is of course where the abstract art and scene separator art comes into its own, and Bakemonogatari continues to express its own identity and motives, on top of the characters'.\\n\\n\r\nSome say that talk is cheap, but Bakemonogatari's existence alone is an appropriate riposte. Come stellar storytelling, comes really great dialogue... that's what i used to think.\\n\r\nBakemonogatari seamlessly integrates a lot of the storytelling INTO the dialogue. For up to 6 minutes or so, you could easily be under the misconception that you're being subjected to pointless SoL-related chatter, but i told you once, and i'll tell you again: this show makes damn good use of the episode time it was given. Therefore, you can expect a lot of substance, contextual background, and emotion in the dialogue itself, which is equally as important as the event-based plot. This script of which i speak of, is utterly packed with recursive dialogue, and hidden meanings throughout (which might even add some \"rewatchability value\"). To an extent, Bakemonogatari is one of \"those\" shows that actually uses the viewers' confusion and/or uncertainty to its advantage, by referring back to, and taking its own lines into different contexts as a method to shed light on \"the matter at hand\" indirectly.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, comes the very seamless implementation of character development...\\n\r\nAs a show being told from the POV of young protagonist: \"Araragi\", he is the viewers' primary gateway into feelings of relatability - as he comes across as fairly average, and a tad cynical. The show's expressive audiovisuals and abstract nature act a key to unlocking and more importantly, intimately expressing his feelings and thought processes. This is a subtle tether of attachment that emphasizes the severity of his unconventional plights, often through the means of minimalist soliloquies. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, for any show that follows the formula i mentioned at the start of the review, the real power behind character development originates from the viewers' emotional attachment to the diverse female cast. I can safely say that through a mix of in-depth, passionate dialogue and emotive gestures, Bakemonogatari somehow manages to cover quite comprehensively, the very personal character aspects, of almost all of the cast, despite time constraints.\\n\r\n(other anime could learn from this...)\\n\\n\r\nThis far, and i still haven't mentioned the story. Well just like in Bakemonogatari, the story itself - in the form of a series of events, is rarely referred to directly. It's a show that if described to others could easily come across and generic, and so it adopts each troubled character's emotional growth, separates their plights into arcs, and this journey that you accompany the characters on, becomes the story material, the substance to coexist with the mysterious setting that you as a viewer were provided with. \\n\\n\r\nI find that the oblivious nature of Araragi makes the whole journey seem so \"real\", and current... And so i can conclude that i thoroughly enjoyed the surreal experience that is Bakemonogatari. It can certainly suffice as a reference guide for many producers, and its strong suit in my opinion is the streamlined integration of devices, in the particularly vivid dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that goes out of its way not just to create scenes, but to place you inside a curious, surreal, and yet really realistic world of its own. One could easily get lost in such a world...\\n\\n\r\nCriticisms?\\n\r\nLittle to none...\\n\r\nThere seems to have been serious consideration into every aspect of the show. From story, to sound, it's all very appropriate. Perhaps (and i'm squeezing a dry cloth here) what i like the least, is how the abstract presentation can become a bit preachy, and how the show's conclusion was very vague. A more significant end to the show, and an elevated focus on the \"character\" over technique, could also have furthered my appreciation.\\n\\n\r\n~ Save me. ~",

            "content": "Shaft. A studio mostly known for its comedies, lolicon fanservice and other forms of softcore pornography. I don't know why this studio is praised so much, but at least it did seem to make some effort in a select few titles in recent years.. And this is one of them.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review.\r\n*Story*\r\nWhere do I start? In the story section I usually like starting with the setting, but in this case It\u2019s hard to describe what the setting is like. From what I can gather though, it\u2019s basically modern day Japan but with a bunch of random supernatural elements combined in to one(or what they call \"oddities\"). You have vampires, Gods, Devils, ghosts, curses and what not.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is basically separated in to a few different arcs. Each arc focuses on a different character that is introduced (all of which are female of course). And our self insert protagonist attempts to solve each of their problems. There's always some cool twist that's presented at some point at each of these arcs that you likely won't see coming. These twists are each heavily dependent on the supernatural elements that are introduced out of thin air, but are still cool. On the other hand, there's rarely any tension in it, since the main character is basically immortal and he heals faster than Wolverine.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that each of these arcs have little to no relation to one another, so the story here is almost episodic in a way. Also the characters that each arc focuses on have little to no role in later arcs. Even though it obviously tries to contrive a role for them once in a while it turns out insignificant for the most part. So the whole thing plays out like a harem or a more bizarre version of Clannad or Air. You know, it's about a guy going around and solving girls' problems. How exciting! \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying that makes the story bad, but that's pretty much how it plays out and what you can do with such a premise is pretty limited.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more technical level, the story is generally paced ok, but it's far from perfect because it seems too rushed in some arcs and pointlessly sidetracks in others (the final arc). But in general it's not a very eventful watch, it's mostly just people talking (which is the appeal of the show). On the other hand, I like the way it handles and explains its supernatural elements and even the harem itself seems to be excused in a way at some point (but that excuse later turns out to be a lie, which is disappointing). Besides that though, the whole thing still seems random and the big picture is still vague. I could be wrong, but my guess is that there's no big picture here, and this is just random stuff left and right?\\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven't watched this show yet, I'm sure you've heard about the witty dialogue it has, am I right? So yeah, it is witty and for me it was enjoyable to an extent. But beware, because a great deal of it is just pointless and hardly relevant to anything. It's pretty much like if I were to start talking about what I ate for dinner last night in the middle of this review and then say \"but I digress\" and then continue with the review. Or in the show's case, continue with plot exposition that is also pointlessly extended at times. I did enjoy it to a certian extent, but it did get a little tiresome after a while. To be fair though, it could be argued that some of this dialogue at least helps you know the characters better.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the series ends openly without addressing a certain elephant in the room (well, it's definitely something that sits in a dark room), but maybe this part of the review will be edited after I watch the next seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I guess there's some sort of story going on here, but not much.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nIn order to tolerate the characters in this show you need to have a certain mindset. They basically behave in very bizarre ways, it almost seems as if they're in some sort of play or something. They don't really question any of the weird stuff that goes on in their world. They just blend in to the weirdness so I don't find them very accessible.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is basically a self insert kinda guy. He's somewhere between an average joe, a loser of some kind and a pervert? I guess... I just don't know what to make of him. One minute he's being all kind and chivalrous, the next minute he randomly harasses a little girls' boobs.. So yeah, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are basically harem stereotypes and fetishes, but they're very well done. you have a tsundere, 3 lolis ( 5 if you include 2 little sisters), a tomboy, a big breasted glasses girl and some weird infodumping guy who's not expanded upon much yet. Yet, they're all very quirky, eccentric and fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the (female) characters have interesting backstories that are presented through narration. This is by far my favorite part of the show. The backstories are usually very dark and creepy.  And even if I still can't relate to the characters, their backstories do wonders in making you more interested in them and in helping me understand the problems they face.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said earlier, they don't play any meaningful role past the arcs dedicated to them, so that's unfortunate. Their presence loses its importance later on so they don't leave much of an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I didn't like is that they took these stereotypes a little too seriously, I think they should've made fun of them a lot more, like in Shaft's other work, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. The thing is, when I started watching this show, I thought I was In for a satire of these stereotypes so I was a little disappointed that they seem to take them seriously just as often as they make fun of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, I still think they're some of the best made and most entertaining to watch harem stereotypes I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nI personally prefer a more realistic type of artstyle, but I admit that the character designs are very creative. There's a lot of variety in terms of their features and they're all very sexy looking.\\n\r\nIn general though, whenever I think of this anime's art I think dark colors and shadows everywhere which is normally something I like. But this show isn't all that dark to begin with so I think it overstayed its welcome.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are very interesting and surreal, I really had fun looking at them. By far the most interesting part of the artwork for me. \\n\r\n Since the series has a great deal of dialogue, there's not that much to animate. However when the characters actually move, the animation seems pretty fluid and the few battles it has look pretty cool and bloody.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that was irritating though is the directing. The camera hardly ever stays in one angle for more than 5 seconds, there's a lot of awkward zoom shots and weird camera angles. They also keep showing flashes of written texts on the screen too fast for you to actually read it. All of this while not much of importance is happening on screen.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong it didn't bother me too much, but it still feels overly stylized and exhausting for the eye after a while.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nThe openings were relatively good j-pop songs, but they're not particularly memorable because they each last only a few episodes and most of them don't really fit the tone this show is going for either. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song is a pretty good and memorable rock/pop song and did stick with me, but that's probably mainly because it was there through out the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, sound effects and voice acting sound great to me. No complaints here. I'm sure the voice actors worked very hard on this one as well.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nYes, I guess did enjoy it to some degree. The supernatural stuff is interesting and some of the characters are fun, though the directing did get on my nerves sometimes and the dialouge did feel tedious a lot of the time.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: *Sequel and Prequel*\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the above also applies to the Nekomonogatari prequel. But I disliked it, since all it did was contribute a little more insight on a character who already has a 5 episode arc dedicated to her in Bake. And there was no comedy beyond the first episode, the pacing was slower than usual and it had lolicon/incest fanservice (classy!). \\n\\n\r\nThe sequel Nisemonogatari is just awful: It went totally overboard with the fanservice to the point it became cringe-worthy, it had a very flimsy plot that felt significantly more stretched out than usual, it doesn't contribute enough to fleshing out the characters for its length (though it did flesh out the little sisters and introduce a few more). Furthermore, some characters even seemed to behave out of character and randomly did stupid things they normally wouldn't do for the sake of more fanservice (as if there wasn't enough already), which is not a worthy cause.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall*\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my whining it was still a fine series. It definitely stands out and is well worth watching. Just go in expecting a well made harem, and you probably won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nBake: 6.5/10\\n\r\nNeko: 5.5/10\\n\r\nNise: 4/10",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is a show that is the very definition of wit. It's a show that conveys emotions and pure personality through intellectual conversations that are shared between characters. That being said, the show may turn off many viewers because of the fact that it mainly revolves around dialogue. I'm here to tell you otherwise. What you will experience from Bakemonogatari is something that is both comedic and expressive on a personal level, making the experience an unforgettable one.\r\n The story of Bakemonogatari has you follow the life of a high school student named Araragi Koyomi and how he interacts with a cast of girls whoall contain supernatural related issues in their lives. The story is, however, not a big factor of the show simply because of how the show focuses specifically on characters rather than an overarching plot. \\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing that should be understood clearly is that this is a show focused on character interactions, something that you would not typically find within an anime. Characters may converse with others for minutes upon minutes of time, but that is what makes this show so appealing. The conversations that you will hear are funny, dramatic, and sometimes even thought-provoking, or they may even contain relativity to certain aspects of your own life. Watching the characters indulge themselves with a multitude of intriguing conversations is one of the many things that makes this show so special.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are some of the most colorful that you can find within any show. What makes them standout so much is how each of them have certain facets and aspects to their personalities. One character is a sexually frustrated man/vampire who has trouble interacting with others, while another character is an overly-educated woman who is stubborn towards her own issues, causing herself to gather up ginormous amounts of stress. I have only described two characters out of a cast of that is extremely  unforgettable for there many quirks and features.\\n\\n\r\nOne other factor that makes Bakemonogatari so special is the art. I'm not lying to you when I say that the show is one of the best looking anime's that you will ever watch. Shots of characters are shown in locales that are aesthetically breathtaking. The show also manages to effectively use a wide variety of different colors. The different colors that are used in the show excellently capture the mood of the characters in many scenes, proving that the art is more than just being flashy and bright for the sake of being beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that may or may not frustrate you are the many different shots of text that will appear in conversations between characters. I personally had no qualms with them, but it should be noted that they are used frequently in the show. However, they should not distract you too much from your viewing experience, for they will even sometimes add more depth to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a somewhat cheesy and awkward ending, Bakemonogatari is a one-of-a-kind show. The amount of characterization and depth in its writing is unlike any show that I have come across. Watching this show is like watching a masterfully done character piece with beautiful artwork. If you're fine with a heavy usage of dialogue and wordplay then Bakemonogatari is your type of show. What you will gain out of this show is a new take on the word \"unique\".",

            "content": "The moment I saw the few first scenes in the first episode, I was rather puzzled and bewildered with the seemingly abstract visual arts and random fan-services. Despite that, as the series progressed, I realized that this series is basically an experiment.\r\nThe way the animation goes, it reminds me of 'Serial Experiment Lain', although both series are not comparable in any sense. However, SHAFT obviously went through some difficulties in catching up with the airing dates. Many incomplete scenes are instead replaced with 'black cuts'. It is really a minus point and sometimes annoying, evidently in Episode 10.\r\nStill, the strongest point of this series lieson the characters. Senjougahara has become my instant favorite. The way she anticipates everything with her utmost calmness and coolness (except at few very emotional moments) ensnares any guys who are looking for the inner beauty as well as the outer beauty. She might be labelled as 'tsundere', but she is the least bit unrealistic compared to any mainstream 'tsundere' characters outside there. Moreover, she has witty sharp tongue and plain sense of humour which never fails to bemuse and amuse me.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist, Ararararugi (sorry, I misspell), is my second favorite. He is quite wise and well-behaved for a typical harem guy. Unlike other harem guys, he is good at difficult subjects like maths (even though he nearly fails all other subjects) and still sticks to his family despite all troubles and decaying bonds. Nevertheless, the series has not revealed what stands behind that calm mask of his. He is an unlikely perfect match for Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters, such as the lesbo athlete and ponytail ghost girl also warm up the lengthy dialogues and the relatively slow pace. While the planning of the arcs is not the best ever (some characters regretfully do not show in few arcs, notably Senjougahara), the plot is concluded nicely and very sweetly with a unconventional date between both protagonists. Thus, this story of exorcism and supernatural phenomena is wrapped up in an unlikely manner, a typical teenager romance, but still much better than most series.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In this anime series bakemonogatari, i would like to compliment to the story writer who ever made this series up a great job and the artwork.\r\n Great artwork with the time and quality it must of taken great bit of work and the ideas of how it was drawn and scenes that pointed out into each episodes were out side of the box which did a great thing in persuading people and for people who is watching the series to question more about it. Excuse me for my grammar. :p\r\nThing is so great about that makes up the story is the characters, each character havetheir own unique standards and the person who did the story writing did a great job on keeping the characters on standard. And to compare most anime series would sometimes have people with all happy personality and yet there is almost like no flaw to them.\\n\\n\r\n What is also great about the characters is that the script was done well, with teasing the people and a few sparks behind them. And some perspective that people might expect from the story is that a bit of irony and the opposite what the view would be thinking, which sometimes bring in comic-relief, and the  way of how main character talks Hitagi-san is a complicated character but a friendly one, at first its a bit tense but as the story goes on you'd like want to fall in love with her with her personality.  But as the two main characters in the story is a funny comic-relief and a romance its a great story together put with one character being a serious tease joke and the other being a clumsy nice guy. \\n\\n\r\nThey did greatly on how the story comes together, and usually there aren't many anime series that would do great in to put in order, and like for instances xam'd was put in a really \"in the middle of nowhere\" which was totally confusing at the beginning of the episodes and made me not wanna watch it.\\n\\n\r\n And oh yeah... I forgot to add one part of it is that the scenes had great flash forwards when they show part of the episode in the beginning to make the viewer question which is a great persuasion technique in stories and etc.  And it relates to japanese sayings \"on the moon there is a rabbit making mooncakes\" or something like curses.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this series is one of the best one yet I've seen; however, that is just my opinion of thinking. but this story has great storyline, relates to reality and fictional, romance is cute, story is put together really well, a few teases in the story, and the characters are the really great that is really important into this story Bakemonogatari.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most weirdest, most unique and quite possibly the most amazing created anime =P. I could honestly say that this anime is a much watch altough the art may put you off, its the dialogue that truly makes this anime amazing. One of the very few anime that uses dialogue to create a masterpiece.\r\nStory 10\r\nBased on the light novel bakemonogatari by Nisioisin sensei, writer of Medaka box swell. Bakemonogatari tells of Araragi Koyomi, a half kinda vampire that encounters various characters each with a monster associated with them, from crabs to snails. Each with a unique story line that leaves the viewers amazedat each story leaving them loving the characters more and more.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art, is very unique and weird. To be honest at first i was kinda put off with the animation, due to the weirdness, but once i realised how well the animation worked so well with the Dialogue then the magic finally happened, with an average of about 100 eye shots per episode, the art with minimum movement truly creates a weird and mysterious atmosphere when watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special it doesnt really do much in making each episode more enjoyable or anything. But each character does gets its own opening song, which some is fairly well made causing you to listen to it again on youtube, plus the ending of bakemonogatari created by the amazing band Supercell, is a song that regardless how many times you listen to its still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nEach Character is very unique, Senjougahara Hitagi is an extreme tsundere and is incredible rude to everyone, this itself creates many comical scenes between her and Araragi Koyomi who's a character that thinks to much with teenage urges =P. Each character each provides a comical experience that puts Koyomi in touch situations in each of their story, and by touch situations i mean awkard situations, while continuing insulting koyomi =P.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this Anime a lot, each comical scene made me laughed my head off, and each of the characters story provided heart warming scenes or Horror/psychological scenes that is very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 \\n\\n\r\nIf your a fan of weird, screwed up, horror and comical animes then this is definitely the one for you. Most likely one of the best weird story that you will ever watch, it provides an expierence you will not forget, it'll be very unlikely you will forget this anime for a long time.",

            "content": "\"I don't know everything. I just know what I know.\" Hanekawa's most used line. Probably.\r\nWell this show definitely surprised me. I didn't really know what to expect when going into this show. I thought it would be about just a normal guy that goes around helping these girls like I did in recent shows I have seen. But bakemonigatari does a fantastic job of making this no ordinary show and has such a unique and interesting storyline and characters. There really are no other shows like this.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nOne day araragi (such a fun name to say) goes to school and sees a girl falling andhe decides to run and catch her, little did he know that she was very light and didn't feel heavy at all when he caught her, and she has an \"oddity\" and helps her get rid of it. But all before this happened araragi was turned into a vampire. And I felt this was the only weak part of the story. I felt like they didn't explain very well on how araragi got turned into a vampire, I think they did some explaining in the first few minutes of the first episodes, but it didn't seem to clear things up for me, it seemed confusing (maybe I just forget, because its been a few months since I finished this show) and this is really the only weak point in the story, well for me it does, and maybe I didn't listen well enough or something. Anyways, throughout bakemonogatari, araragi and senjougahara (I think that's how you spell it?) are the main characters of this show and we see how they grow in relationship with each other all the while araragi is helping out these other girls with their oddities and we see what he and senjohara do to help them out. The pacing seems slow to some, but overall good constant pace throughout the show. I'll leave the rest to watching the show. And one thing to keep in mind is this show is heavy on the dialogue so you really have to be focused to understand what's going on, so this show isn't for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all excellent. They all have their roles and play the roles well. Really no dull characters, everyone is well developed, except maybe for araragi's characters but get more development in the sequel. Araragi really wants to help everyone and will do what it takes to help the girls get rid of their oddities. Senjougahara is a very interesting character, seems frightening at first but actually cares about people and how her actions impact others. Hanekawa is a genius and might actually know everything, but says she doesn't. Her and araragi are real good friends and we get to see her always helping out araragi when he doesn't know what to do. There are much more interesting characters and you'll have to watch to see how amazing they all are\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy the soundtrack a lot. I liked the eerie music they played when the conversations were serious and prolonged which really fit into the scenes perfectly. I felt they were lacking the action songs during the action moments, or maybe its just me. But overall the soundtrack is great. They also have different openings for each arc (person). Endings were good. I also liked the air sounds you could say when the characters moved the arms or something or when moving the camera from one person to the other. Probably the weak point of this show for me but still really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 9/10 (close to a 10/10)\\n\r\nThis show has one of the best animations and art. I loved all of the weird camera angles shaft does, it can feel over excessive at some points but it really has a huge impact on the show. Like one example is that one person will be talking on camera, just statically, and then when the next person talks they'll zoom in a little, then the static person, then zoom in more on the zooming in person, and does for a few lines for each people and gives a very unique view of camera angles. The character art was just stunning. They all looked very proportioned and highly realistic. Well the only un realistic part would be when someone's arm gets cut off and about 100 gallons of blood spurts out and I say to myself, is that even possible? But overall animations were great. Especially the fighting scenes, they were very fluid and the visuals were amazing. Also this show is pretty darn graphic so be prepared.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nVery unique and highly interesting storyline. Extremely nice art. Great characters with great development. Decent soundtrack. Highly enjoyable, all makes this show amazing. I definitely felt for each character at the end, all very likeable. I probably could of watched the whole show in one go or day but couldn't cause of time restrictions (school..). One of the more interesting and fascinating storylines which made the show highly enjoyable for me. Recommend this to anyone wanting an amazing story, characters, art, and a little romance here and there, not much comedy but still there.\\n\\n\r\n+Great unique storyline\\n\r\n+Stunning visuals\\n\r\n+Senjougahara is in this \\n\r\n+Araragi is fun to say\\n\r\n+Awesome camera angles\\n\r\n+Never gets boring (not for me)\\n\r\n-A little weak on the soundtrack\\n\r\n-Unrealistic amounts of blood\\n\\n\r\nDid I make you want to watch this? I hope so, you wont be disappointed",

            "content": "If I have to describe it in three words- unfinished, distracting, incoherent. Vague, but I think others who watch the show will agree.\r\n__Unfinished__\r\nIt seems that all of the important scenes consist of still, blank characters. And I mean STILL. Like, either they don't move, or their mouths don't move, or often times both. See episode 10 for a severe example.\r\n__Distracting__\r\nThroughout the entire show, there are 4-frame scene cards that show up every 10-30 seconds saying either \"Red Scene,\" or \"Black Screen.\" 10-30 seconds is generous, as sometimes they will show up within 2-3 seconds of each other. It's absolutely dreadful, and the fact that theyremove quite a few in the BD version shows how unfinished and broken the anime is. Chalk another one up for unfinished, as these are often used to replace blinking or mouth movements.\\n\\n\r\n__Incoherent__\\n\r\nImagine watching a show that demands you to read a chunk of the story via paragraphs that show only for a frame followed by 20 more said frames in succession. Well, with Bakemonogatari, you don't have to imagine it. It's awful. Or imagine watching a walk cycle that cuts to a sitting shot that cuts back to the same walk cycle- then back to the sitting shot. Pretty normal for a flashback but no- this is real time. You're expected to believe that as they're talking with one another, they are switching between sitting on a bench and walking within a single frame.\\n\\n\r\nThe music direction is trash as well.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari. The best anime of all time?\r\nSurprisingly, I did not expect this to be another harem anime. This is, perhaps, one of the best harem anime by far but not the best anime of all time. It is good in some ways, quite enjoyable and the art is amazing.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThere\u2019s not much of a story but it is quite enjoyable at times. Some parts are really funny, thrilling, exciting, romantic, erotic and philosophical but most of the time it\u2019s all talk which is half interesting and half boring. The story pretty much follows a step by step formula: problem, help and solve. It is somewhatsimilar to anime Hell Girl and xxxHolic but with an additional spicy kick to it so, unlike the two, you would be, somewhat, eager to know what would happen in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the art. It is different, indeed but at the same time pleasing to the eye. They have ingeniously incorporated different artistic medias such as 3D images but still maintains the mood of the anime. Sometimes it\u2019s sullen, tranquil, dark and at times confusing but it all worked out well. The way the characters are animated is also quite memorable so despite being a harem anime, it does not give off the same clich\u00e9 harem feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (8/10)\\n\r\nThe intros and eds are good but unlike its art, it\u2019s not quite memorable. Though, the background music and other sfx are fun, strange and can bring out the mood of the characters and the scene \u2013 the way they manipulated some of the sounds to give out confusion and other quirkiness is quite brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty well done and memorable especially Senjougahara and Araragi. They have their own strangeness going on and not to mention their strange powers. All of their personalities are quite unique so they stand out. Despite having a simple and sometimes boring story, the characters pretty much made the talking quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, I find it a bit strange that there are very few \u201cnormal\u201d characters lurking around in this show. Despite being in a school, there are no other students but the main characters themselves\u2026not even a teacher for that matter. It has a sort of small world and lonely feeling but whether it is a good or bad thing all depends on how you look at it. It was able to bring out your focus on the main characters but the sense of it being socially realistic is taken away. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nSounds 8\\n\r\nCharacters 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it does not have much of a story but the rest of the other artistic elements are great; it is memorable in a way \u2013 some of the jokes, some of erotic moments, the odd characters, the bloody scenes and the art most especially. \\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari\r\nThe title itself is a word play combining Bakemono(monster) and Monogatari(story). SHAFT really hit the target this time. However I must warn you, that if you're the kind of person who hates to watch anime with looooooooooooooonnnnnnggggg dialogues from the character, then STOP! Don't watch this anime. Though I would say, that you're missing a really smart-made anime.\r\nBakemonogatari is consisted of different arcs which is all connected to the male protagonsit, Araragi. Each arc is quite interesting. Though I must admit, it did not really caught my interest that much. Well, maybe except the scened where Hitagi (heroine) and Araragi are together. The two charactersare just awesome. Well, back on the plot. It is not a one-in-a-million plot. It's about a guy who got bitten by a vampire and was cured by some other older guy. And the kid then helps the other heroine in the supernatural problems throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is an anime with a really really long dailogues between the characters. Though the plot did  not caught my interest that much, you must be wondering why I gave this anime a perfect score of 10. Simple. It's the characters. The characters are well developed and made that it will be hard for you to hate them. Each character have unique and VERY interesting characteristics and personality (especially Hitagi ^^)\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the long dialogues. I enjoyed this anime. Though some may find it boring and cannot stand the characters yapping throughout the episode, I do like it. Cause behind all those long line, the humor. The humor just makes my day. I like how they throw in some humorous line every now and then (which will sometime catch you off guard). I especially like how Hitagi teases Araragi and Araragi explaining to Hitagi. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of this anime is the are, the animation itself! Being made on 2009 you would definitely ecpect a very high quality of animation. An yet! The Bakemonogatari exceeded my expectations and blew me away. The animation is so great and unique that it will be the first thing that will attract you into watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound! Oh man! The opening song changes depending on the arc. The song is GREAT. Special mention is the song KIMI NO SHIRANAI by supercell. Man! Oh man! That is my new favorite song. ^^ The song is another of the strong aspects of this show. Must hear! ^^ Not much more to say. Just go on youtube or whatever and type bakemonogatari and listen to the songs and be entranced by it's great melody.

            "content": "PRE INTRODUCTION: THE REVIEW PORTION\r\nIt's good. Go watch it. 10/10.\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis is a study. This is about two histories. This is about dreams. This is about what I dream about when I write fiction. This is about what Edogawa Ranpo dreams about when he writes fiction. This is about what Nisio Isin's dreams about when he writes fiction. This is about what I dream about when I write mystery fiction.\r\nThe first section is the stupid section about me. The second section is about the world. Part two is probably the part you're looking for because no one gives a damn about the obligatory digressionary masturbatory partwhere I talk about my feelings towards this very specific franchise that every otaku and their fujoshi mom has most likely heard a thousand and one things about before. I allow you to skip to part two without being burdened by the guilt of violating the specific writer-reader contract of having to read the entire text linearly.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 1.1: WHAT I FELT WHEN I FIRST WATCHED BAKEMONOGATARI\\n\\n\r\nI watched Bakemonogatari after Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. I thought that the first few episodes of SZS were funny, but that it got progressively less interesting as it went on. Now I feel the opposite way. SZS is the anime I watch for comfort. I can turn on any episode and just start watching. I can enjoy its irreverent style, its wit, and its frenetic explanatory cadence. I press pause when the screen floods with examples. I have told myself again and again: This is what I want to do when I grow up, I want to be a satirist rock star avant-gardist.\\n\\n\r\nWell, when I finished reading Karamazov I told myself: I want to write honestly and vividly about humanity and society.\\n\\n\r\nMy attitude towards my influences have always been sinusodial. I love them to death, then I want to destroy them whole. I want to eat them for breakfast. I want to imbibe their so-called Genius. I tell myself \"I can't write like this!\", but then I tell myself \"I can write like this!\".\\n\\n\r\nMy advances towards my literature has always been inspired by Pierre Menard. I believe I can write Don Quixote word for word if I tried.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I watched Beckett's tale about his two impoverished hobos standing under a tree, I watched episode 3 of Bakemonogatari. A boy and a girl sit at some pop art conception of a park and talk about everything.\\n\\n\r\nLinklater was probably the one who first figured that there is something immensely comforting about watching two characters shoot the shit. I am glad that later seasons of the Monogatari series have only gotten 'worse' in this regard, in the increase of excessive verbiage. Alienate all your audiences! Who cares!\\n\\n\r\nI watched Steins;Gate four times precisely because of the specific character oriented comfort developed in the first 12 or so episodes. There is a skill in combining movement with stillness. You want to walk slow-fast. You want to reach your destination but take your time. This is something Key adaptations have never mastered.\\n\\n\r\nBut from the sales it seems that other people, too, love nothing more than a good mystery, a good romance, a great art style, abuse of fanservice, and a whole bunch of verbiage.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is an accentuation of the body. The body is the vivacity of potential motion. In the Monogatari series everything moves. It is this movement that delineates, or rather, transfers the libido into Art. It is the mix between Kabuki and striptease.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Monogatari series the words snake around the bodies, the bodies play around the words. This innate connection between the angel of our thought and our sorry beast connection to nature is the essential foundational substance of any great acting.\\n\\n\r\nIn Kurosawa's Kagemusha, when Nobunaga hears the death of his great enemy, he doesn't say much, but dances. The song he sings while he does so is a solemn evocation towards the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death. Every step he makes feels powerful, anchored to great destiny.\\n\\n\r\nAt its most visceral, guts are spilt, and limbs are twisted in strange unnatural directions. Bakemonogatari understands the truths of the body. It understands the specific emotion crease in a face that spells internal suffering, as well as the highest bound of playfulness.\\n\\n\r\nBut why should I have to explain all of that? Everything is nicely bundled together in this little package here.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOP3GyF1IMg\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 1.2: A LOCKED ROOM WITH NO KEY\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section where I talk about murder as one of the fine arts. Specifically I talk about murder in relation to my own fears. If you want the fine-tuned stuff, skip to the next section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first manga I ever read in my life was the new Young Kindaichi Case Files. It was a translation from a newly established Singapore publishing company, but they only released two volumes, and shut down shortly afterwards. The two volumes were The Cerberus Murder Mystery, and The Scorpio Killer of the Silver Screen (yes I'm too lazy to actually search up their proper names). I read it in Primary School, or rather, I skimmed the pages, being completely clueless about what a non-linear story structure meant. I thought that, at the end, when the killer was flashbacking about his past motives, time was still moving forward, and I wondered how the murder victims came back from the dead. I was just enjoying looking at the pictures.\\n\\n\r\nLater my father got the whole set of the official Tokyopop translations. This was in Secondary School. Afterwards he got Case Closed and I started following Detective Conan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy old home was a small flat. There were cabinets full of books. One cabinet had nothing but Agatha Christie novels. These novels had illustrations full of mystery and horror. You had your milieu of broken creepy dolls, cracked mirrors, various murder implements, and other strange surrealistic images. Until now I have never read an Agatha Christie Mystery, except for flipping through And Then There Were None. Back at my old home it still had the old unsanitary title: \"10 Little Niggers\". My father had no qualms about using the old title, although the new one has a better ring.\\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about my fear.\\n\\n\r\nThomas DeQuincey's essay on Macbeth explains the murder of King Duncan in such a way:\\n\\n\r\n\"...the retiring of the human heart and the entrance of the fiendish heart was to be expressed and made sensible. Another world has stepped in; and the murderers are taken out of the region of human things, human purposes, human desires...The murderers, and the murder, must be insulated\u2014cut off by an immeasurable gulph from the ordinary tide and succession of human affairs\u2014locked up and sequestered in some deep recess; we must be made sensible that the world of ordinary life is suddenly arrested\u2014laid asleep\u2014tranced\u2014racked into a dread armistice: time must be annihilated; relation to things without abolished; and all must pass self-withdrawn into a deep syncope and suspension of earthly passion.\"\\n\\n\r\nI have never been comfortable. Certain shades of dark still transfers into this 'another world'. When I first flipped through those pages of the Young Kindaichi Case files, I was so frightened by the images of death that I had nightmares for weeks. Fumiya Sato is an amazing artist of death, compared to the more moe-fied Aoyama from Case Closed. Her corpses are splayed in all directions. Their eyes are empty. The deaths are imaginatively horrific.\\n\\n\r\nYoung Kindaichi Case Files murders are usually structured around a myth, as opposed to the more human-centric Case-closed mysteries. Per book the death rate is usually 3-4 before the case is closed. This is what grants the case power. You know a human is behind it, but the murders are always structured around this higher narrative. With the Cerberus murders you have claw marks as a motif and tearing in the flesh. In the Scorpio Killings, the murders are centered around Film motifs. The Magical Express is so far, in my opinion, the most powerful and most carnivalesque of the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nOnce I saw a face in the crowd staring at me. It was any stranger, but he seemed wrong and full of dark intent. I cried in my bed 3 week after the event, when one day the memory came back to me. Now I know I was utterly hysterical, but at the time the visage of the stranger was so real to me that any small connection could send me spiralling into paroxysms of fear.\\n\\n\r\nEven till now my dreams have always bested me. Sleep Paralysis and layered nightmares have always occurred to me. I wake up from one layer, and find myself back in my room, except that there is a presence, and everything is off. Every chemical in my brain feels off during these moments. Inexpressible fear permeates through the layers of blankets and pillows. These dreams are locked room mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nYet I am enamoured with my dreams. I have tried to ride these states of fear all the way through. I am always curious to wonder, after reaching the other end of being crushed, will I wake up in a strange new state? That's because on the other end of the spectrum, when everything becomes lucid, the feeling is an equally inexpressible sense of awe and wonder. Everything feels possible.\\n\\n\r\nMore frightening to me, than the standard Gothic Outlook and Bizzare Experience that usually characterizes Horror Fiction, is that sense of something underlying everything else. I thought Ligotti's Fiction was lovely and poetic, yet Nabokov's Signs and Symbols sends chills down my back.  This evocation of an unsolvable but infinitely deep mystery is terrifying to me. With Ligotti, as with Lovecraft, at least you have the certainty of Man's insignificance wrapped in Gothic flair. It is the idea of a truth just within your grasp, yet always elusive, and invokes strange omens of a different structure of existence, that entraps me in a labyrinth paranoia. Higurashi captured that feeling perfectly, of nothing being right, yet wrapped in inexplicable mystery. Without mystery, horror is quite tame.\\n\\n\r\nSo my ambition has always been to create that labyrinthian structure of elusive meaning. The good mystery is always out of reach, and earth-shattering upon discovery.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 2.1: IRREGULAR MYSTERIES AND THEIR PREDECESSORS\\n\\n\r\nAll roads lead to Poe. He was the first to conceive of the Detective story in its most archetypal form. He was the first to grant it its dignity. First there was Auguste Dupin, and he begat Holmes, who begat Poirot, who begat all the way until you have as diverse manifestations as Moffat's variant of Sherlock, to Nasu's over-explaining rough and hardboiled Aozaki Touko, to Borges's ridiculous homage, Lonnrot. If you really wanted to trace 'puzzle-solvers' back to ancient times, you would have wise men like Solomon disputing cases with logical clarity, and in India you'd have tricky couriers like Birbal, Tenali Raman, or haunted parables like those in the Vikram Vetala tales, and in China you'd have your famous tales of old judges. Then there's disputes about whether it was Poe or Wilkie Collin's the Moonstone, and all that other stuff. But I bring your attention to Poe because, at least in the vein of irregular mysteries, you can link everything back to him.\\n\\n\r\nActually we have to firstly talk about the etymology of this idea of irregular. By irregular mystery, I'm talking about the demarcation that occurred in Japan between the Honkaku Tantei Shosetsu, or regular mystery, versus the Henkaku Tantei Shosetsu, or irregular mystery. And even then there's confusion translating it like that. The translation irregular comes from Japanese Science Fiction: A View of a Changing Society . On the other hand The Discursive Space of Japanese Detective Fiction and the Formation of the National Imaginary (TDS) translated the divide as Authentic Detective Fiction and Inauthentic Detective Fiction.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as you can tell from the terms, the Hen in Henkaku is the Hen in Hentai. This provides a scope of definitions larger than irregularity and inauthenticity. It covers connotations of perversion and bizzareness. A subversion of normal values in its strangest form. Dreams from Below: Yumeno Kyusaku and Subculture Literature of Japan goes into the henkaku definition, with the erotic and subversive connotations, even more fully, but with specific reference to the Literature of Yumeno Kyusaku who wrote the surrealistic detective story Dogura Magura.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into that definition though, I want to focus on the Authentic vs Inauthentic debates, as fully described in TDS. As with any particularly flourishing period of avant-garde or new forms of literature, you'll have literary criticism. As with any literary criticism, most of it will be semantically dense and usually about stupid trivialities, like whether writing in first-person is more literary, or writing in third person (the 'I' novel debates).\\n\\n\r\nIn the case of the Honkaku vs Henkaku debates that was taking place in the new magazine ShinSeinen, it was between a highly rationalistic procedural form of Detective Fiction, as in those of the Agatha Christie variety where every clue is left for you to see, so by right the reader can divine the truth as well, or basically any other type of fiction that had a veneer of Mysteryness but was more focused on affect and doing stupid literary things like delving into people's guilt and stuff. The Honkaku faction were against Dostoyevsky style meandering mystery fiction or weird BDSM stories marketed as detective fiction.\\n\\n\r\nAt the center of this debate was the mystery-god of Japan himself, Edogawa Rampo. From TDS, here's some of the numerous complaints levied against Rampo and his ilk:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cthe modern detective fiction of the prewar years, which started after the publication of Shinseinen and the debut of Edogawa Rampo, consists of an overwhelmingly large number of stories that play with the fantastic world of horror and bizarreness that rejects social reality.\u201d Gonda describes prewar detective fiction as \u201cirrational dreams rather than rational logic, utopian fantasies of a splendid death rather than harsh social reality,\u201d and discusses the genre with the metaphor of \u201cabysmal dreams of a deep-sea fish.\u201d\"\\n\\n\r\n\"(He also argued that) modern Japanese detective fiction was influenced by the Japanese romantic school of serious literature, such as Tanizaki Jun\u2019ichir\u014d, Sat\u014d Haruo, and Akutagawa Ry\u016bnosuke, and thus tended to emphasize the human criminal rather than the logical solution of a crime.\"\\n\\n\r\nDue to the influence of the Decadent Movement, the Symbolist Movement, the Romanticsts, the Gothic Writers (including Poe), and other people like the Grand Guignol playwrights. Japanese Romanticism was developed, and culminated later into what was widely known as Ero-Guro Nansensu. Rampo was widely into that kind of thing, and so one of the rumors developed around him was that:\\n\\n\r\n\"Rampo kept a certain distance from the debates and even claimed that he lost his confidence in writing detective fiction in 1932\u2014less thanten years after his debut in Shinseinen. While he rarely published his detective stories in dedicated magazines of detective fiction after the 1930s, he continued to be a prolific writer of \u201cgrotesque\u201d serials with detective tastes in general magazines and newspapers,which contributed to establishing the \u201clegend\u201d among the public that he wrote only at night in a storehouse (doz\u014d)\u2014which he aptly called \u201cthe castle of illusion\u201d (gen\u2019ei no kura)\u2014under the dim light of a candle surrounded by pictures of cruelties (muzan\u2019e).\"\\n\\n\r\nAs can be seen from the above quote too, Rampo has always had a strange relationship with the Authentic vs Inauthentic debates. He was able to write on both sides of fence, creating numerous and tightly plotted stories revolving around his own Detective Kogoro Akechi, while also writing stories of bizarre gothic nature such as 'The Caterpillar' and 'The Hell of Mirrors'. Sometimes he even combined both types together to create tightly plotted mystery stories with surreal dark atmospheres. Some people have even interpreted some of his stories as having an ambiguously derisive view of the whole enterprise of mystery fiction in general:\\n\\n\r\n\"In his \u201cNingen isu\u201d (Human Chair, 1925) for example, a popular female writer receives a letter from her enthusiastic fan, in which a furniture maker, supposedly the writer of the letter, confesses his perverted desire to sneak into the cavity inside a large arm chair. The letter scares her in the course of her reading because the chair he refers to in the letter seems to be exactly the one she sits in right now. Yet, his subsequent letter reveals that the initial letter is just a manuscript sent to ask her criticism. In \u201cAkai heya\u201d (The Red Chamber, 1925), the confession of the ninety nine murders of probability and the confessor\u2019s subsequent killing of himself as his own one hundredth victim turn out to be a setup for the bored audience of a members-only club in the gloomy red chamber. Not only a logical resolution in the end but also the grotesque imaginations are rejected and mocked as daydreams that temporarily make bored everyday life bearable.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo while Rampo was more or less doing his thing all the way, contributing to the debates while also making works that subverted their arguments in every way possible, there were some others in defence of Henkaku Tantei Shosetsu. This included the famous mainstream literary writer Sato Haruo who commented that:\\n\\n\r\n\"In short, what we call detective fiction is a branch of the tree called rich Romanticism, a fruit of curiosity hunting, and a mysterious light emits from the multi-faceted gem called poetry. It is no exaggeration to say that it originated in a peculiar admiration of evil and on the strange psyche of horrified curiosity common to all human beings and at the same time related to the healthy mind that loves explicitness\"\\n\\n\r\nHaruo was all in favour of widening the narrow definition of Detective Fiction, and linking it to the Romanticist movement. Indeed the Romanticist movement, at its core, was generally an affirmation of humanity's splendour and beauty, even above concepts like religion and god. Detective fiction was, in effect, and as Poe originally conceived of it, a Romantic take on procedural rationality and logic. The super-detective isn't just a man of logic, but of fashion as well. In response to the idea of the dis-enchantment of the world due to Modernity, there is a case raised that Fantasy Fiction, Science Fiction, and Detective Fiction are representatives of a re-enchantment with the world.\\n\\n\r\nYet even Rampo, with his usual ambivalence about his stand, stepped in to clean up Sato's definition a little:\\n\\n\r\n\"Sat\u014d\u2019s aestheticism cannot be just anti-Naturalism or a return to romanticism. It is rather a juxtaposition of the two in relation to the modern concept of rationality. As Edogawa Ranpo points out, although Sat\u014d\u2019s definition is not strictly about the detective fiction genre and it might be more appropriate to call it crime literature, writers at the time \u201cwanted to give a certain name to the kind of literature Sat\u014d defined,\u201dand the term detective fiction was thus employed to denote the literature of romantic rationality\"\"\\n\\n\r\nRampo was supportive of Sato's definition, but he was still at odds with linking Detective Fiction completely to Romanticism, and so settled for an in-between idea. But from the slight differentiation you can see at the time he still thought that a proper procedural was of paramount importance if one were to define the fiction in such a way as to be true 'Detective Fiction'. So due to the grand floofing of these debates, I've decided that the best term for me to use is irregular mystery fiction, since I want the definition to be broad enough to go beyond just the grotesque erotic nature of henkaku or to be politically charged as the word inauthentic. Later we'll see how the whole thing gets even more complicated with writers from the New Authentic School or New Orthodox School, and by then I'll probably have given up trying to explain the semantical differences and just stuck to the formal structure of the mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nSo we've chased the idea of Henkaku around a bit, mainly focusing on the erotic-grotesque romanticist poetic aspects vs the rationalistic structurally sound aspects. Now let's bring the I-Novel debates into the picture.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 2.2 WHAT DOES 'I' HAVE TO DO WITH THIS ANYWAY?\\n\\n\r\nIn my OreGairu review I talked about the PsObE mystery, which I thought was like a new trend in mystery fiction. Apparently I spoke too late, because the Japanese had been throwing lit-fits over this issue for ages. I won't go into it. To make a long story short they were arguing about intensely personal First-Person novels (because stream of consciousness style First-Person narration is a really weird and pretty new thing in the less pronoun-centric Japanese language) versus descriptive and literary Third-Person novels. Obviously this carried over into the Detective Fiction debate about Authenticity and people figured you can't have an 'objective' set of facts displayed in the first-person voice. If you want to know the roots of OreGairu and why so many Light Novels appear in first-person with snarky protagonists, blame the 'I' Novel or 'State-of-the-mind' Novel. (Strangely they count Dostoyevsky as on the good side, probably because he wrote beyond just a single first-person view, but I think that such a statement is just plain off)\\n\\n\\n\r\nActually I still think its a new trend in current mystery fiction, at least at its current state, but now I know its roots. I think today's self-awareness and postmodern playing around with the mystery format has all-around deepened characterization and has led to narratives focused on the principle of 'know thyself' over solving any objective truths. Or rather now both go hand in hand. So you have Hyouka, which is about self-awareness but also about solving mundane everyday mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this was pretty brief, I think we're quite ready to put together all the building blocks leading to Nisio Isin's career and style as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 2.3: THE FIVE GODLIKE BEINGS OF NISIO ISIN\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first way to know something about a writer is to know his predecessors. Thankfully Wikipedia, quite kindly, has this quote for us:\\n\\n\r\n\"He said that he learned much from the novels of Kiyoshi Kasai (the author of Vampire Wars), Hiroshi Mori, Natsuhiko Kyogoku, Ryusui Seiryoin and Kouhei Kadono. He also said that the five writers were, metaphorically speaking, the God-like beings, who had shaped and molded his writing style.\"\\n\\n\r\nBefore we go into these, lets bring together what we know about the 'Isin-style' (at least from Monogatari series and Katanagatari. I've only read the Death Note BB Murders besides these two anime, and that's a conventional mystery story.)\\n\\n\r\nPuns & Wordplay\\n\r\nMagic or Supernatural Phenomena based around Semantics and Etymology rather than straightforward mystery solving\\n\r\nInnovative and self-referential narrative structures\\n\r\nMysteries or Phenomena being thematically relevant to character's internal states (and since our thoughts and abstract moods are reflected in language, this is why words are weapons in Isin stories)\\n\r\nEccentric Characters that are the farthest dramatizations and parodies of simple internal states (something Dostoyevsky also did very well)\\n\r\nOtaku references (mandatory of course for any prevalent writer in the subculture)\\n\\n\r\nSadly of the above 5, I can only talk about two, which is Natsuhiko Kyogoku, because I watched Moryou no Hako, and Kouhei Kadano, because I watched Boogiepop Phantom. Hiroshi Mori wrote The Perfect Insider, which is being animated with character designs by Inio Asano, so we'll get to witness his finesse soon.\\n\\n\r\nNatsuhiko Kyogoku is a member of that New Authentic School I was talking about above. New Authentic, as you can tell from the definition, was a revival of Honkaku Tantei Shosetsu to its firmest roots, that being the standard detective locked room mystery. Except now being New, they're more complex, more playful, more metafictional, and crazier than ever before. One of the main works of the New Authentic School, Ayatsuji Yukito's Decagon House Murders, is about an And Then There Were None style mystery taking place in a mansion where all the inhabitants are members of a Mystery Club, and everyone is named after a famous detective.\\n\\n\r\nThe New Authentic strains are described quite well by this mystery blog (http://ho-lingnojikenbo.blogspot.sg/):\\n\\n\r\n\"Ubume no Natsu, together with Mori Hiroshi's Subete ga F ni Naru - The Perfect Insider, forms the start of the so-called second wave of the Japanese New Orthodox/Authentic detective novel school by the way (Note: I normally use the term \"orthodox\" here, but because I mainly used \"authentic\" in my MA thesis, I might use both terms here at times). The New Orthodox school is both a revival, and reconstruction of the classic detective novel. Ayatsuji Yukito's debut work Jukkakukan no Satsujin is seen as the start of the New Orthodox movement and novels of the early writers in the movement like Abiko Takemaru, Norizuki Rintarou and Arisugawa Alice all showed strong influences from classic novels, but also deconstructive and reconstructive elements to the genre (thus making it \"New\" Orthodox, as opposed to just a copy). The second stage of this movement however, as envisioned by genre critic/scholar Kasai Kiyoshi, represented by novels like Ubume no Natsu and Subete ga F ni Naru - The Perfect Insider on the other hand, while still more-or-less classic puzzle plots, tend to be 1) very long novels and 2) 'a bit' more pedantic, which explains the different fields of sciences and more information being jammed between the pages.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo the New Authentic School followed closely the old rational structure of mostly closed room mysteries, but played around with formal experimentation. Their late strain becomes more Henkaku in that it involves specialized topics like hard science, occultism, philosophy, or youkai studies.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the definition above, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni, and Higurashi too for that matter, would probably fall very nicely into the New Authentic School style. Umineko represents the late strain, while Higurashi represents the early strain, one being more philosophical and meta-textual, chock full of references, while the other is more straightforward despite its recurring time structure.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched Moryou no Hako, you should watch it. There's episode that is a complete etymological analysis of a certain type of Youkai essential to the plot that upon watching it you'll see Kyogoku's influence on Isin so clearly and plainly. Also the ending is a brilliant revelation of coincidence and psychology that would make Borges proud. (somehow the plot also reminds me of the visual novel Kara no Shoujo).\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of the late strain school can be seen here:\\n\\n\r\n\"Kokushikan Satsujin Jiken takes on the form of a standard detective story, but it is never really about the murders. It is just a set-up for Norimizu Rintarou (and author Oguri Mushitarou) to hold page-long expositions and discussions about pretty much any topic, but mostly occultism, mysticism, criminology, religions, astrology, astronomy psychology, heraldry, medicine and cryptography. Mostly. Any time Norimizu sees anything, he starts rattling about how this relates to a certain book, or a certain writer, or an experiment conducted somewhere, which in turns is related to another topic and so on. The number of works referenced in Kokushikan Satsujin Jiken is easily more than two hundred, with a majority of them being obscure books on occultism. Heck, probably about 70, 80% of this book consists of just pedantic talk. It makes this novel practically unreadable, because you are confronted with a master course Occultism every two pages.\"\\n\\n\r\nFrom Kyogoku and Mushitarou, you can also see possible strands to Kinoko Nasu and his metaphysical mystery plots.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Kasai, another of Isin's gods, is also quite the pedant it seems. His largest book seems to be a 2000 page or so mystery novel about a Detective who solves things using Phenomenology (mainly of the Heideggerian variety).\\n\\n\r\nThe pedantism and extreme knowledge-specificity of these novels has been linked to the Otaku subculture (as in the general database or reference centric fervor filled Otaku definition, rather than the anime or idol centric Otaku definition). The flaunting of specific obscure knowledge or technical knowledge, especially with regards to weird occult stuff, requires quite a certain database hound sensibility to get by.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei Kadano, and Boogiepop Phantom in extension, falls into a different strand, being more psychological and simplistically written in nature. Less of a Detective Mystery and more of a psychological thriller, it pulls off the super-powers linked to character mental states or internal-to-external supernatural phenomena. If you could see the etymology and occult centric taste from Natsuhiko Kyogoku, this is where Isin gets his psychological drama from.\\n\\n\r\nNot many people realize this, and this is a flaw from most Fantasy Writers, but magic is simply philosophical Idealism impinging on Material reality. The Internal Reflects the External. Further down the road the Internal is linked to the Transcendent. Kinoko Nasu understood this perfectly, and he made use of it by not making a cohesively 'sciency' magical system in the vein of Brandon Sanderson, but basing his framework on abstract Buddhist concepts with a whole lot of room for maneuver. That's why a Nasu Magician always feels transcendent or just plain miles above even the basest human being. If you systemize magic, well, it loses what makes it magic in the first place. Likewise Bakemonogatari is an exploration, the same way Evangelion 'explores' internal states with alien battles.\\n\\n\r\nSo I think we can quite clearly see Isin's straightforward influences, from old Authentic school crossing to New Authentic, to the otaku variant of it... and then the 'state-of-the-mind' variant of psychological mystery, sourced from I-novels and writers like Dostoyevsky, crossing through Kadano, into Isin's frenetic dialogue style. But that's on the narrative quality. In the end we still have to dissect Shaft's visual quality.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 2.4: ERO-GURO NANSENSU, THE RETURN\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"In these examples of Ky\u016bsaku\u2019s post-earthquake reportage, which spanned autumn 1923 to spring 1925, his usage of hentai leans toward the sexual\u2014and therefore sensational\u2014 aspects of Tokyo culture. This is similar to the way he used hentai in \u201cAyakashi no tsuzumi,\u201d but over the course of his career, there would be a subtle change in which the emphasis shifted from sexuality to psychology (from seiyoku to shinri ). Ky\u016b saku\u2019s writing brought questions of madness and identity to the surface, and this exerted a strong influence on the development of henkaku detective fiction. His fiction was less an account of madness or \u201cabnormal psychology\u201d as much as it was a look inside the hentai mind. He made frequent use of the epistolary or monologue form in order to avoid an omniscient narratorial voice. Koky\u014d wrote that hentai was not necessarily the same thing as illness, but it was, nevertheless, \u201cabnormal.\u201d Whether one\u2019s hentai shinri manifested itself as kleptomania, paranoia, or mathematical genius, I would argue that these conditions signify that there is something in excess, and this would become a prominent feature of Ky\u016bsaku\u2019s henkaku literature, too.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe above quote, from Dreams of Below, characterizes something about Yumeno Kyusaku's fiction, has something very interesting to note about the concept of abnormality or perversion. An excess is involved in the process of any kind of Henkaku mode. Simultaneously, Shaft's visual style has always been characterized by this mad need for excess in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nShaft's animation is revolutionary in the grandest sense of the word, and it has always been, and this can never be denied no matter how reactionary one is towards the content of their shows. No company has ever done the marriage of so many forms of animation, stop-motion, traditional, sometimes CGI, with an even higher variety of visual styles, ranging from sleek minimal, to high expressionist, to flowery gothic lolita, to fairy-tale like, to plain manifestations or homages to old style Ero-Guro (like countless moments from SZS). Yet while SZS was their testing-ground work, and Ef a tale of two or Hidamari Sketch still had their genre trappings of romdrama and slice-of-life respectively, the Monogatari series was the company's full work to have a distinct set of visual codes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series mainly focuses on the city. It focuses on the lines and roads, the signs and traffic stops, the classrooms and alleyways. Along with that many people have drawn up the point that the show itself is structured like a stage-play rather than a straightforward Anime narrative setting. Even Katanagatari has a greater sense of place. The city is startling and empty. Even Madoka had its primary visual conflict be between the skewed fairy-tale world of the Witches and the highly sleek Minimalist architectural style of a Modernized city. These were also the primary struggles back in the day when Japan was first dealing with the starting movements of Modernity and opening up to newer influences.\\n\\n\r\nYet, as I have said above, there is nothing more comfortable than the delivery style of Bakemonogatari. People talk. The whole anime curves around the Word. It is nothing without the Word. Either it drowns you or you think its the best feeling in the world. For that reason Shaft (and the Tatami Galaxy) are pioneers in creating this style of narrative that best unifies Image, Sound and Word, other than the strangely and wholesomely immersive form of the Visual Novel. Although countless others have arguably created better movies or shows, the form here is more or less without precedent. The most over-narrated or over-spoken movies, from Trainspotting, to City of God, to Linklater's stuff, have yet to reach that kind of speed. I think only a 2013 movie, the Oversimplification of Her Beauty by Terence Nance, comes to that level.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at the bottom of Shaft's style is also the vivid movement of their characters. Like I mentioned above, beyond just normal fanservice, accentuation of the body itself. The most famous mark of their is the absurd head-tilt. But even in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, one of the early episodes (Kaere's first episode) had the entire first part shot from a wide-view of the classroom's front row with all the main characters of the class in sight reacting to each other with full body movements. Madoka Magica Rebellion 3 had this moment in the finale when Homura is talking, and her hands have nothing better to do than to snake around in weird patterns, as if just plainly displaying Shaft's animation capability. That's the sort of excesses underlying it.\\n\\n\r\nAt its fullest momentum, the fight scenes are animated by famous Sakuga artist Hironori Tanaka. At this state the limbs of the combatants become hyper-rubberized, and prevalent with gore and innards.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not always in the old poetic/gothic sense of the term, with its ridiculous fanservice, its moments of surprising bloodiness, and its pun-focused highly associative editing, the Monogatari Series does fall into the triptych structure of 'Ero', 'Guro', and 'Nansensu'.\\n\\n\r\nSECTION 3: JUST A PLAIN GOOD OLD MYSTERY STORY\\n\\n\r\n\"But experience has taught me that travel presents nothing more than \u201cidentical objects moving in identical spaces\u201d\" (Cat Town, Hagiwara Sakutaro)\\n\\n\r\n\"And (to give my Credo an even score of items) I herewith list a few of the devices which no self-respecting detective story writer will now avail himself of. They have been employed too often, and are familiar to all true lovers of literary crime. To use them is a confession of the author's ineptitude and lack of originality. (a) Determining the identity of the culprit by comparing the butt of a cigarette left at the scene of the crime with the brand smoked by a suspect. (b) The bogus spiritualistic se'ance to frighten the culprit into giving himself away. (c) Forged fingerprints. (d) The dummy-figure alibi. (e) The dog that does not bark and thereby reveals the fact that the intruder is familiar. (f)The final pinning of the crime on a twin, or a relative who looks exactly like the suspected, but innocent, person. (g) The hypodermic syringe and the knockout drops. (h) The commission of the murder in a locked room after the police have actually broken in. (i) The word association test for guilt. (j) The cipher, or code letter, which is eventually unraveled by the sleuth.\" (20 Rules for Writing Detective Fiction, SS Van Dine)\\n\\n\r\nAs most people are starting to figure out, there are only so many configurations of Simple Machines, Red Herrings, Psychological Tricks, Alibi Manipulations, and Locked Room Style settings, and even that is being exhausted beyond all hope of replenishment. Even with an ingenious formal or narrative structure, as all sorts of people like the New Authentic School, to Moffat in some of his Dr Who episodes, to Christopher Nolan's Memento... all this only goes so far as to add a few stretches more to the eventual exhaustion of your normal idea of Object-Mystery Solving. Yet Subjectivity has always been the greatest mystery of mankind. Intention-centric Mystery, Specialized-Information Mystery, Metaphysical Mystery, Anti-Mystery, and, generally, Irregular Mysteries are soon to become the only areas that have yet been touched by the coming exhaustion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what Nisio Isin does, and is best at: The creation of wildly artificial and yet wildly imaginative Irregular Mysteries. And Shaft, the most artificially and artistically excessive animation studio out there, has got his whole supernatural vampire-monster etyomological-existential mystery series backed up with full support.\\n\\n\r\nYet on the Western side of things (or maybe its a language bias and the Japanese side is actually equally swamped), besides a small selection of Postmodern Anti-mysteries, some cyberpunk and science fiction (Stanislaw Lem's His Master's Voice), and some Urban Fantasy style comedy fiction (like Fforde's Nursery Crime series, some of Pratchett's stuff, or maybe some of Gaiman's stuff), the market has been more or less overrun by legal dramas, crime dramas, badly written conspiracy theory plots (compare Dan Brown to Eco's Foucault's Pendulum), and thrillers (Gone Girl, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo etc...). Even on the Television Department, the Mystery series with the most irregular tastes, Hannibal, was bogged down by such a conventional CSI style monster-of-the-week structure, which was completely distracting from the real plot. And so little out there has yet to even reach the standard of Literary Philosophical Mystery set by Dostoyevsky in The Brother's Karamazov.\\n\\n\r\nOh the things I would give to see a great Irregular Mystery movement rise up from the ashes of the current milieu of fluff!\\n\\n\r\n4.

Now, don\u2019t misunderstand me mere \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with not being able to understand the masterful writing and production behind Bakemonogatari.

            "content": "Whatever drugs they are on at Studio Shaft, I want some of those.\r\nStory:\r\nAt first glance, Bakemonogatari is an anime about supernatural beings and a boy trying to solve the problems they cause. But that is just the background for an actually pretty romantic story that develops and eventually takes over. I'm not really sure how this works, but it does. I'm not going to give out futher details as they would be spoilers, but Bakemonogatari makes for an interesting story with a rather slow pacing that still fits very well. For example, in the snail story the characters don't actually do something, yet the dialogueprevents it from ever becoming boring. The show reveals some secrets and keeps some, develops constantly in little steps and ends in a feel-good way somehow. As you can see, describing Bakemonogatari is not easy.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nShaft is known for its trippy artwork and Bakemonogatari is no exception. I'd even say they go very far in this one, having a lot of dialogue screens interrupting the actual animation, which itself looks pretty good, yet a little creepy. The town these characters live in feels big, cold, empty and loveless. And then we have the occasional art shift to wake one up from being lulled into the scenery. If there is one thing to criticize, I'd say the characters could look a little more imaginative, but that's nothing that will really hurt your viewing experience.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound effects and background music absolutely work into the experience of watching Bakemonogatari. While there often is no music present, when it kicks in it gives off a vibe that corresponds well with the visuals and dialogue. The concept of mutliple openings representing the different characters that are focussed on in that specific episode is a great concept, though it would have worked better if the songs themselves would be more diverse. The ending song is very good and even ties in with what a specific character is feeling as revealed later on.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is a heavily dialogue driven anime, so the characters are naturally much more important than anything else. The talks between Araragi and Senjougahara are very interesting and entertaining, they just play into each other very well. Kanbaru works just as well with Araragi, though I don't think she ever really talked with Senjougahara, would have been interesting. Sadly, not all characters are as interesting as these three. Sengoku for example, as incredibly cute as she is, didn't really add anything to this anime. Another main character, Hanekawa, did not really click with me either, though this is probably only a question of preferences.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie here, watching Bakemonogatari is very exhausting. If you are into fast action or flashy animation, this is not for you. Following the train of thoughts of everybody in their dialogues can be a little hard, especially in the earlier episodes when you are not yet familiar with the characters. If you decide to go along with this however, you will most likely entertained. I don't know if reading all the text that appears onscreen is really necessary, but since I mostly didn't i would guess it's not. Bakemonogatari is an entertaining anime, that needs a little while to get into and that keeps challenging you to pay attention, but is ultimately rewarding.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

But after having looked at Bakemonogatari's character list for a few minutes, having seen the video 'Courage to tell a lie' and my love for Karen Araragi based on her picture alone, my desire to watch this simply went through the roof. Because of this, I started watching this anime with huge expectations, expecting an anime to which I couldgive a nine and place on my favorites list. The synopsis sounded interesting and compelling. In the end, though, I was quite disappointed. Why, you ask? Well, let me expand. Starting, as always with the story element. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the storyline is quite disappointing, living up to my (low) expectations of Shaft. Instead of a storyline of some kind, the anime progresses through arcs, representing events that have little or no effect on other episodes. Not only that, but the snippets of storyline are very repetitive - find a girl who has encountered an oddity, take her to Oshino and perform some kind of ritual to get rid of it, usual with some kind of revelation in the meanwhile. There is barely any suspense. In fact, whilst writing out the storyline, I would mark barely anything as a spoiler. \\n\r\nSimilarly, characters are introduced, stand in the spotlight for 2 or 3 episodes, then are promptly forgotten about, perhaps appearing as background characters in the following few episodes, or merely being mentioned. In fact, apart from Araragi, the characters from the arcs all get roughly the same amount of screen time, apart from Karen and Tsuhiki, who appear solely as a villain force of two teenage girls who take up violently waking up their older brother as a profession, the reason he does not wish to return home on Mothers Day and MCs at the end of episodes; and Shinobu, who does nothing except looking at men and women differently and eating donuts, helping out Araragi on occassion.\\n\r\nIn typical Shaft style, they prefer not to show events themselves, instead showing the aftermath and getting someone, usually Oshino, to explain. What's wrong with showing them? Also, arcs are often interrupted with other story elements, mostly focusing on the romance between Araragi and Hitagi. \\n\r\nThe element of humor, whilst not completely unwelcome, is a little forced, relying on shallow jokes, slapstick and sexual jokes - sometimes even chibis. I won't deny I laughed a few times (that's already better than the humor in Kyoukai no Kanata), but I do wish they would actually give a shot at deeper, non-sexual jokes. \\n\r\nThere are also numerous... strange elements which don't add anything to the anime, such as an ahoge with a will of it's own and random bits of text that flash onscreen, especially 'Black'. I don't even know what section this fits into, so I'll just put it in here.\\n\r\nTo the anime's credit, though, everything I found confusing was explained in the next episode or so. Whilst I still remained confused about certain elements, it was nowhere near as bad as the other Shaft anime I've seen, Mekakucity Actors. I am also able to say, for almost the first time in a review, that romance was not soppy. It was a bit fast-paced instead. \\n\r\nTo conclude, there is almost no storyline to speak of, character appearances are very inconsistent and most add nothing to the storyline except a couple of episodes, the show and characters are overly sexualized and the romance is face-paced. However, elements are rarely confusing, which is definitely a very good point. I give it a 5, because frankly, it didn't impress me at all. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this, I treated myself to more of Shaft's depressing animation, such as strange, alternating colors (blood turning light pink, then blue, hair becoming golden under the light, yellow skies) and inconsistencies with everyday life (deserted streets, houses all looking exactly the same). There were a lot of repeated scenes, for instance, in the driving scene of Episode 11, the same message written on the road is shown about 5-7 times. What bugged me the most though was that I felt that the producers were trying to be smart in trying to make everything look as lifelike as possible, like the strange tear ducts, eye veins and, horribly, actual pictures, mainly of scenery and in black and white. The worst of the worst was the telephone calls though - the same image every time of a REAL hand holding a REAL phone and random things going on onscreen during the conversation. This is absolutely unacceptable. When I watch anime, I expect animated art, not pictures of real life sceney and things/people. Somewhat ironically, when the scenery is animated art, it looks bland and unrealistic. Maybe if they put a little more focus on the art instead of trying to make enverything look life like, it would be better.\\n\r\nDespite all this, I really liked the character art. Ignoring the tear duct and especially visible nostrils, their art is quite nice - in general, I liked them, especially Hachikuji and Nadeko. \\n\r\nOverall, I give art a 6.5, because it is too good for a 6 yet not good enough for a 7. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is undoubtedly one of the stronger elements of the anime. There was a lot of it. Unfortunately, most of the tracks were very repetitive and they often felt out of place. I really enjoyed the ending theme and the different character openings. \\n\r\nI give sound a 7. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the characters were the saving grace of this anime. Ultimately, they are likeable, their quirks and characteristics are unique (between themselves at least), memorable and enjoyable. Despite this, I came to realise that they are very stereotypical (luckily, I haven't seen much anime so it wasn't all that bad for me). \\n\r\nSome characters are much better than others. My favorite character was definitely Hachikuji - she is not only adorable and extremely cute, but her personality is fun, fresh and entertaining. \\n\r\nAraragi felt a little stale - he was pretty much the typical male anime protagonist. Despite this, his character was still rather enjoyable. \\n\r\nHitagi is a character I don't quit understand. She is one of the most popular characters, yet her personality is so off and confusing. At first she's mean, as soon as Araragi helps her she, all too soon, becomes a girl in love, sometimes jealous, her personality swinging around a lot. She is called a tsundere, yet she sometimes becomes a kuudere, sometimes even something of a yandere. \\n\r\nIn general, the characters were quite strong, though as I mentioned earlier on in the 'story' aspect, some of them get way more screen time than others, and all the girls are overly sexualized. I mean, Nadeko didn't have to take off her bra when showing Araragi and Nadeko her scale marks, did she? Kanbaru didn't have to take every opportunity to strip. Araragi didn't have to ask Hachikuji (even jokingly) to show him her panties either. Hitagi insisted too much on the fact that Araragi is a virgin. All this is needless, and drew away from the pleasure of the characters.\\n\r\nI give characters an 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't say I really enjoyed this anime. After hearing so many positive things about the show, I started watching it with high expectations, hoping this would be an anime I could add to my favorites list. Perhaps I set the bar too high. I was very disappointed with the uneventful, repetitive storyline which is organized in seemingly unrelated arcs, shallow humor, sexual references, characters that are introduced then almost forgotten in following episodes, the art, and some of the characters (whether it's as a whole or just parts of them which are unnecessary in my opinion). Upon telling this to my friend, she told me \"Shaft tends to concentrate on the art and not the storyline.\" I disagree - they seem to focus on neither. \\n\r\nI give enjoyment a 5.5 because although I can say that liked the anime to a certain extent, I was very disappointed and would recommend to my friends not to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this is not an anime which you can start watching with a serious complexion, looking into things and trying to find ulterior motives, particular reasons for actions and whatnot. It's something you've got to be really light about, never delving below the surface, because once you do, you'll realise just how simple and bland it really is.\\n\r\nIn one word: Meh.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 6.5/0\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.2/10 (rounded to a 6)\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this review unhelpful, please take two minutes to advise me on what you did not find helpful so that I can improve my reviews :3.",

As it is the first anime I had ever watched out of my own curiosity, and because of this it was a much more hard core introduction to anime then a normal person coming into anime with shows like bleach or naruto.\r\nIt gave me a lot of mixed feelings, not bad ones more like feelings of question towards myself. The soundtrack is to blame as well as the dialogue between characters because I was just blown away immediately byhow different they were from normal people and characters in tv shows I had saw before anime. Even now this series stands out, not just because of the style it has but because the writing of these characters felt so charismatic and natural. \\n\\n\r\nThey feel so real and make you really interested in who they are, and I suppose its that mystery this show possess that brings people to holding it so dear. The mystery is also strengthened by how its release order went, and while most shows kick off with an origin story, this one went and threw you in after a big change happened with the mc and it just made you so curious and invested in learning more and I loved that.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for this series honestly.",

            "content": "\"I can't save you. Only you can save yourself.\"\r\nBakemonogatari tells the story of high-school senior Araragi Koyomi, and his run-ins with five girls, each with their own emotional baggage and afflictions in the form of aberrations or monsters that forever Mr. Nice Guy Araragi must help them sort out.\r\nI love Bakemonogatari. I love the entirety of the Monogatari Series, but no part of it stuck with me as much as Bake did. It's stories, characters, it's one-of-a-kind art design, truly make for a unique and breathtaking experience.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story, first and foremost, follows five arcs, each titled after the centric afflicted girl in it,i.e. Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, etc. Each one not only introduces or gives depth to the character in question but also reveals more about other characters and previously-established events, making for an entirely immersive experience. Bakemonogatari dives deep into psychology and how the human mind works, and is definitely one of the strong points in the plot department. How far would you go to save someone close to you? How would you deal with your emotions, your pain, upon being affected by an aberration or after a traumatic event? Bakemonogatari takes a deep dive into the human psyche, and it's honestly one of the best parts of it for me. Some parts are slower than others, for example the Suruga Monkey and Nadeko Snake arcs most notably, but they are still enjoyable in their own right and this shouldn't put you off of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is a particular standout in this installment of the Monogatari Series, having more ambitious imagery and overall artistic flair over the majority of the rest of the series honestly. It is only ever really done to such a high caliber again in Kizumonogatari. The character designs are very well done and faithful to the original light novel illustrations and descriptions for the most part, and even when they are different they still respect and even reference the original in some cases, i.e. Senjougahara's purple hair becoming brown in certain scenes like her LN counterpart. Absolutely outstanding effort from Shaft here and my favourite out of the entirety of Monogatari.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to Bakemonogatari is literally one of my favourites, trumped only by the likes of FLCL and Cowboy Bebop for me. Some tracks are repetitive in the series however, but this is definitely improved upon as the series goes on past Bake. Not much to say here, but very good and very original soundtrack indeed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely where Bakemonogatari shines the brightest. Each one is so amazingly fleshed out and given life here, each with their own mannerisms, motivations, emotions and problems. They all feel unique and memorable, even the male protagonist who can be taken as a mockery of sorts to typical harem protagonists. Trust me, you'll find a girl or two that you absolutely love here, and each arc where their initial problem is resolved is so well put-together and amazing. Definitely consider Bakemonogatari most for the characters if not anything else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nBakemonogatari's length, form and content above all else make for a fantastic experience. As I mentioned before, the Suruga Monkey and Nadeko Snake arcs are slower and with slightly poorer pacing, but overall Bakemonogatari is a fully immersive, completely enjoyable experience that is paced well and has a logically somewhat medium-sized length.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nSo, in short, Bakemonogatari is one of, if not my absolute favourite anime. It gripped me so much and stuck with me, and will be on my favourites for years to come. I really do recommend it for anyone looking for an immersive series to sink their teeth into, I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Wow. Okay.\r\nSo after two episodes of Bakemonogatari I was like 'hmmm okay I see that this anime is quite different but it's not allll that amazing, seems pretty overrated...\" skip to the end of episode 4 and I can't click to start the next episode fast enough. It's not that anything happens in episode 4 that really changes up the series, it's just that I found this series is just one that takes a little while to really captivate you - but boy, once it does, it has you in its grip FOREVER. And oh my it is worth the wait.\r\nSTORY~\r\nThe story is divided intoroughly five arcs and I mean it when I say that all of them are really interesting. The way the stories play upon the notion of 'aberrations' (demons, spirits, etc) is really unique and can make for really gripping content. It's not only the supernatural which makes Bakemonogatari so fascinating either - the way the stories delve into the human psyche and Koyomi and Senjougahara's romance are also remarkable. \\n\\n\r\nART~\\n\r\nOkay, the art is just amazing. The intermittent words on the screen, the flashing diagrams, the experimental backgrounds, the character design itself - just amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL~\\n\r\nMany say Bakemonogatari isn't for everyone, and they're right. Don't expect to immediately understand what's going on-- give it time. I was skeptical at first but after finishing this series, I cannot wait to watch the rest of the Monogatari series. Really, really good and I would recommend to anyone who likes their anime a bit more cerebral.",

            "content": "First, let me say, I have no idea why this anime is ranked in the 100's or why some people believe this anime deserves to be called a \"masterpiece\". I'd say this anime is below average.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nTo call this anime a mystery is a bit of an exaggeration; in mysteries, characters do things like collect evidence, develop theories about the crime, question witnesses, and reveal who the criminal is. This anime's idea of a mystery is this: Araragi meets a girl with a supernatural problem, he asks Oshino how to solve it, Oshino tells him how to solve it, Araragi does that and the episodeis over. \\n\\n\r\nFor such a simple plot the writer's sure know how to drag it out; every episode is at least a two-parter. What makes these story arcs so unnecessarily long is how about 95% of each episode is just the characters talking, with the other 5% being the supernatural stuff. It isn't even like they're talking about anything important; Araragi and Hachikuji waste so much time arguing about Hachikuji mispronouncing Araragi's name!\\n\\n\r\n Characters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAraragi is a good character; I like how kind is and how much he wants to help people. Also, he plays a pretty good straight-man as he's always at the receiving end of all the supernatural craziness. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSenjougahara is a tsundere. That is a fact not an opinion because she call herself a tsundere in the first episode. She's also acts like a stereotypical tsundere by constantly insulting Araragi, the guy she supposedly loves, and only acts bitchy to hide her true emotions. However, what I hate about Senjougahara is how she's just a tsundere and there isn't anything complex or unique about her. All she ever does is insult Araragi and tell him how she loves him at the same time. It's pretty bad to have such a bare basic main character!\\n\\n\r\nOshino is a good character, but I was really disappointed we never learn more about him. Why does he live in an abandoned school? What does he do when Araragi isn't around? How did he and Araragi meet? Maybe these questions will get answered in season 2. \\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow, let me address the elephant in the room: the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious this anime had a small budget to work with, but there's cutting corners and then there's having scenes that are just a black canvases with the words \"animation number: none\" at the bottom of the screen which happens regularly throughout each episode. Even stranger then that there's one episode where Araragi and Senjougahara are walking then Araragi's head turns into a live-action cake that a bunch of live-action people eat. Why?\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know if this was some artistic choice by the creators, maybe the cake is a metaphor for something, or if my first assumption was right and the animators had an extremely small budget, but either way the animation is what really ruins the anime most for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know why so many people seem to think this anime is a masterpiece; the story was mostly filler with very little mystery, all the characters, except for Araragi, are more like character archetypes then real fully-developed characters, and the animation just seems to cut in and out whenever it feels like it!\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good supernatural mystery, I'd recommend either Ghost Hunt or Garden of Sinners.",

            "content": "Warning: You are about to embark on an odd adventure. Because the Monogatari series is such a peculiar anime, rather than giving you a normal review, I've decided to spend this time writing a satirical anatomization of Bakemonogatari's heart, written in the fast-talking colorfully-random freeform style and wax-philosophical hyper self-aware excessively-detailed spirit of Bakemonogatari. A sample platter, if you will. As such, if you had fun reading this, you may very well enjoy this anime as well. If you did not, then I will leave you to your Naruto and Fairy Tail. \r\n\"This anime is a lot smarter than people realize. The problem is thatpeople typically don't like to think when they're watching anime.\" - Me, one year ago. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose I should explain this little comment made by the man I was a year ago. But before I give you an answer, let me first start with the question. The right question, that is, which is, what is art?\\n\\n\r\nAccording to the man I was a year ago, art is understanding, a sentiment the man I was yesterday would likely disagree with, and the man I will become a year from now would certainly scoff at. Rather, the man I was yesterday would know that the man I was a year ago made this comment after watching just one episode, of a long series, and simply did not have all the facts. Therefore, what he thought was understanding, was merely hypothesis. He had no answers, only clues, and clues, of course, are designed to mislead.\\n\\n\r\nRather, the man I was yesterday would pose a second synopsis, that art is a message. The message of this anime, being, a satirical allegory for life's conundrums centered on the theme of contradiction. Allow me to explain. =D Under Bakemonogatari's allusion to the real world, the masses would rather pretend there is a conspiracy against them, than accept responsibility for one's lives (lives, plural) - hence, blaming their demons. The contradiction in the parallel, therefore, derives from a half-vampire demon hunter who solves the most mundane of problems in the most gratuitously grandiose of ways, in a finely-stylized cuisine of art and animation. And to say \"solve\" is using the word loosesly, as beyond superficial glance, he really doesn't solve anything, leaving the girls to deal with their own issues. In other words, in the real world, where demons don't exist, we blame them for our failures. In this world, where demons do exist, the characters have only themselves to blame.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! !tiaw tuB .emalb ot sevlesmeht ylno evah sretcarahc eht ,tsixe... The contradiction runs not merely so shallow, at least not according to the man I was yesterday. The entire show, such as it is, is a satire for storytelling. For an artform that prides itself on showing not telling, the screen will subliminally fade to black, with instructions on what a person should feel, when watching certain parts of the story, much like how a superfluous comma, can dictate how a, sentence, is, read, despite its deminimis nature. When the show isn't trying to tell you how to think, the thoughts and emotions of the characters are literally flashed on the screen, albeit for a second, in the most tell-not-show way possible. It's all done in a way that is completely incomprehensible, in a truly masterful display of subliminal messaging, another satire for storytelling - i.e. the use of entertainment for propaganda.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the man I will become a year from now would disagree yet again. For the man I was yesterday did not get a chance to rewatch this anime and reform his conclusion, of which the man I will become a year from now will then know as truth, that is - art is change. While Bakemonogatari certainly is a satirical anime poking fun at storytelling mechanics, much like how the man I am today is proffering this satirical answer that really creates more mass confusion, and answers nothing. The truth of the matter is that we feel something for this anime not because it is satire, but because it imposes a change in us, regardless of whether it has a message or whether we can understand what that message is. Much like how my simultaneously brilliant and retarded answer/review/analysis did little to offer you enlightenment and was 99% non-sense and gravitas gibberish, there is somewhat of a poetic charm to it, and you enjoyed reading it nonetheless, didn't you not, no?

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is what is frankly called an unfinished tale.It gave me the feeling of nothingness perfectly.The series has no aim,no fixed story line,hushed relationships that make it seem like the makers were in a hurry to end the show right after it started.The series is actually made by borrowing bits and parts of the content from several other anime.\r\nThe animation is good enough but what really makes this series stand out is its awkwardness.\r\nTo start with the many flaws,oddities are not explained even once.Characters are introduced and then they suddenly disappear so that it keeps one wondering whether they had any significance or not.Character developmentsare not placed properly only except in senjougahara's case.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs are just okay but the ending theme has a nice and cheerful tune to it.The biggest drawback of this anime is the lack of an aim.After all the travelling,it seems to reach nowhere.And just when you think something's about to start,it ends abruptly. \\n\\n\r\nHachikuji could have played a bigger role and the worse part is that Oshino,the savior, has been totally left out.We don't get to know any history behind him,nor any touching background theme as to why he became a professional in oddities.It would have been very good if more information was provided about Oshino because throughout the anime one will feel Oshino to be more of a hero than the main character.\\n\\n\r\n Araragi koyomi's character is that what you get to see in every other high-school anime,i.e, an honest,extremely timid and humble boy who attracts all the ladies with his innocence,never seems to have any clue of what's going on because he's too kind to suspect anything and is complete with secret fantasies which the girls fulfill for him gradually and eagerly.So,it might turn out to be a boring persona for some. But overall the anime is okay for a light watch and also if you are looking for some high-school teen fan service because its got quite a bit of that and doesn't disappoint in that sphere.\\n\\n\r\nOne notable point is that it draws references in most episodes from various anime like Dragon Ball Z,Doraemon etc. and also from some classic pieces of literature like 'The Monkey's Paw' by William Jacobs and such which comes as a pleasant surprise for those who have seen those anime or read the books.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth episode has a different opening theme which is cute and lovely both to hear and watch.A disappointment is the ending story of the Tsubasa cat.It us incomplete and the last episode is nothing about the cat oddity which is awkward and strange.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are a few funny moments as well,like when Koyomi tries bribing Hachikuji and she blatantly falls for it and when Senjougahara throws her cruel sarcasms at Araragi and some more.\\n\\n\r\nSo in colclusion,if you are looking for a short,mindless anime with a pinch of tsundere,action,paranormal mushi-type creatures sprinkled with a bit of light comedy which won't take up too much of your time,you can give this a try but if you are looking for meaning,content,uniqueness and depth this is definitely not your cup of tea.\\n",

            "content": "To my complete surprise I was actually blown away by this series. This was a show that I had thought was ostensibly about a high school student who is vampire. Yes, a vampire! And with all the negative preconceptions about them due to The Twilight Saga I wasn\u2019t sure if I should be watching this show. But my, how wrong I was! I should have watched this show way earlier. And I really need to talk about this.\r\nBakemonogatari was fascinating, to say the least. Here we are presented with a character who is both despicable and sympathetic at the same time - sincere about wantingto save everyone and even ready to sacrifice himself for others like the best of us while nearly molesting and groping a grade-schooler like the worst of us.1 Also he is shown to be powerless against every female who is his social equal or better.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s start. The series started more like a shock to the me as a viewer throwing me entirely off guard. Although I believe this scene was meant to tease the viewer, I later realized it was quite important as it\u2019s a show which cannot we watched effectively with preconceived notions. Next you see a girl falling from those really gorgeous staircases.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some talk we see the same girl who fell from those staircase actually stapling Araragi\u2019s mouth. And quite ironically we get to know that Senjougahara wants to gain weight. By the end of this arc you realize connection between feelings and weight. The 2nd episode made sure that I am going to watch this show as the show is quite deeper than it looks while also cementing the fact Araragi wasn\u2019t just your average schoolboy pervert and that Senjougahara was more than her looks would suggest.\\n\\n\r\nNow that you might be interested in the show, go on and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? Already done? Anyway I\u2019ll put forward my take away from the show. You could say I am overanalyzing things, but hey where else is the fun? I do not claim anything to be right now as I personally have no experience of any sort of such relationships and am interpreting from whatever I know from seeing and reading things around.\\n\\n\r\nThe show really felt \u201csmart\u201d, subtly illustrating how often there is a power dynamic to relationships. The show focused on the need for authenticity in our dealings with the people whom we care about. Except for Senjougahara all other girls surrounding Araragi are in some way inauthentic. Senjougahara is direct and reveals everything she withhelds, she reveals on her own terms. In some way, episode 12 was the best episode of the entire series and also ends up being my favorite character from the show. Eventually we see a story of friends and friendship with Senjougahara representing romantic love. Also the cinematography and the text dump slideshows were really well done. After Madoka and now Bakemonogatari, Akiyuki Shinbo is certainly now among my favorite anime directors. Nothing in the show seemed without any reason - even the complete lack of anyone else other than the named characters - no traffic, no parents nothing - showing how disconnected the people are in any large city with nobody noticing anyone else.",

            "content": "First and foremost I'll say this, Bakemonogatari is not for everyone especially if you have photosensitive epilepsy... just saying. \r\nIf you're just starting to watch Anime do not watch this first, do not. Watch this when you have a respectably sized repertoire and can actually see for yourself that this anime is truly unique. I personally really enjoyed this anime, but it varies between each person and I can see why some wouldn't like it either.\r\nThis review is by no means a work of an expert and should not be taken as one. This review is made by an average viewer that is considerate tothe average viewer rather than critics that are bluntly critical about absurd things that most people don't really notice. (Some Spoilers, I tried to reduce the amount of spoilers just in case someone is just looking for an anime to watch and are just skimming reviews)\\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado...\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari in a nutshell: bizarre but well structured, for those who've seen this anime will now exactly what I mean and those that haven't should know that I mean bizarre in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): From the very start I was hooked because in the very first scene I saw a girl's panties... just kidding. I was hooked by the montage of random chaotic scenes of action, words, gore, abstract images, and the menacing music used. When I saw this I knew right away that I am in for a surprise. I do not have a large repertoire of anime so I can't really say this with much credibility, but this anime is the most original I've seen, ever. The anime is broken up into different story arcs, but they do it in a way that doesn't conflict with the relationship between the two main characters Senjougahara, Hitagi (Female Lead) and Araragi, Koyomi (Male Lead). Each arc is completely different from each other, but follows the same theme that it has to do with a myth or legend about a god or other supernatural entities and that Koyomi is involved. The viewer has to really pay attention to the dialogue because there is a lot of information being thrown around.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Watch this for yourself, because the art is what makes this anime so bizarre. It's not really something I can explain so I'll make this short. Fast cuts, a lot of different angles, abstract art, chaotic atmospheres, and vivid colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): The ambient music matched the mood so I can't really take points away for it if everything felt the way it should. I discount the intro/outro music purely because I don't really watch them sorry I either skip it or leave the room to grab a drink or use the bathroom, so professional reviewers will probably despise me even more for that, well that's if they continued to read this review for this long. I am in the process of rewatching this series to listen to the voice acting, but from my first viewing of this series the seiyuus seemed to really sell their roles so this will most likely stay unchanged. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue between the characters is really the selling point to this anime, in my personal opinion. I loved all the back and forth banter. I loved all the information that was being thrown around. Every time the two leads had a conversation together I wanted more. All the conversations between the characters had a lot of flow and there wasn't any awkwardness that I could tell. I mentioned that there was a lot of information being thrown around, and for that reason the viewer should pay a lot more close attention to the dialogue. The dialogue is sometimes fast paced and for those that don't understand the Japanese language nuances, not just for the vocal language but for the written language as well, they explain different kanji symbol meanings, could really be taken back a little bit. As for the references, there were subtext for my subbed version I had but when you explain a joke it takes away 80% of the joke most times, some are based on the Japanese culture so I couldn't understand a few of the references but points will not be taken out because of my inadequate knowledge of the Japanese culture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): I won't go into extreme detail, but the characters are undoubtedly the most unique I've ever seen. Almost every character has their own back story, and each back story is well written and well translated in this anime so it makes it easy to connect to any one of the characters, of course you'll have your favorites and least favorites. There is only one particular character that doesn't have a back story and that is Oshino, Meme which sort of bugged me because he is a very interesting character. I haven't seen the sequel series to this anime so I am not sure if his back story is given. Other characters that don't have a back story are Koyomi's sisters and Shinobu. Like I said I still need to watch the sequel series maybe these characters will have a proper back story. (editing this review after watching the sequel series: Shinobu becomes a bigger character and the sisters have a proper story).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (9/10): I think that this anime is great. It has a lot of things that I like, and very very little that I didn't like. There wasn't a part in the series where I felt like I could have done better. The art is the craziest I've ever seen, the story is a lot different to what I am used to watching, the dialogue is the best I've watched in a while, and I am really looking forward to watching the sequel series.",

            "content": "Just gonna quickly put it out there that this is by far the best anime I've ever watched (perfect for my taste, anyways.) So I'll elaborate why it's so outstanding.\r\nStory - 10\r\nIt's a really clever anime. Bakemonogatari will provide perspectives and new thoughts that other animes have failed to provide for me in the past. The solutions to any conflicts that occur make sense and it's not just \"anime logic.\" Things will fit together as you watch and it really connects well. It happens piece by piece into one big picture and it's really quite unique. c: This anime really makes me think sometimes, haha!Very original, to simply put. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe settings are very... minimalist in a way, but not so simple that it's boring, but also not so simple that it doesn't give off any \"feeling.\" The colors that are chosen for every scene are either very fitting or ironic and the entire thing is beautiful. The animation is very smooth, and the expressions that each character show are VERY well executed. When there's pain, you'll see it. It's not just a sob, it's not just a grunt. I also really like how they don't just stick to boring scenes where nothing moves and it's just the character sitting still (you know what I'm talking about.) Often times they (the creators) focus on what the character may be doing with their hands or show abstract symbols going on somewhere in the scene. It's really interesting if you pay attention to the details, because a lot went into this, you can tell!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is soo fitting with the settings and situations, it really got me into the same mood the characters were facing. There are jazzy tracks, smooth piano, and really energetic tunes that go well with everything that's happening. c: The only reason I gave this a 9 and not a 10 is because of personal preference when it came to the openings (which were wonderfully animated by the way.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThere is SO MUCH variety in the characters. At first, someone may seem dull but they could surprise you. Each and everyone of the characters have a uniqueness to them. They're all so quirky and moody and insane in their own ways. Tsunderes, yanderes, whatever. You want it, Bakemonogatari has it. c:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI was so happy that I found it after it finished airing since I could watch it all in one run. After each episode, I always looked forward to the next. I wanted to know what happened next, what did they do. Everything is very unpredictable and it's not like I would watch one episode and think \"they'll probably do this and this next,\" because you soon notice that it's too complex and clever to be like any other anime. And if you're like me, you really think about the conflict and when you finally get it, when it clicks, it's such a fantastic feeling. Like solving a huge mystery, hehe. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nIt's my most favorite anime, and this season was the best one in my opinion. The others are really just as good, but this is the one that started it all, and I think that it could be an anime for anyone. I don't like gore at all, but this anime was worth it. Personally, gore is a huuuge turn-off for me, even Attack On Titan couldn't get me to keep watching. This anime is really something. (:",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari. If you spend at least an hour aimlessly wandering on the internet you'll probably hear about it or come across one of the characters as someone's forum avatar. This is what got me. I saw Hitagi, I saw Shinobu, and I really took to their designs. I'm a figure collector, and when I see a figure I like, I feel the need to watch or read whatever the source material is, both so I can really know the character I'm spending money on, and because having figures I don't know the stories behind leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\r\nI saw Shinobu's Nendoroid andbought her without hesitation. No regrets there, she's one of my favorite figures in my pretty big collection (I got the premium goodies as well, those were neat). A few months before that, I got around to watching the first two episodes with my boyfriend, and both of us were far from impressed. Still, I gave it another chance when I returned home for summer break, because now I had Shinobu and of course I needed the others (such is the life of a collector) and because I'd heard that it got better with time. What a lie.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I understand the massive hype surrounding this show. The first thing I want to make clear is that it's pretty damn boring. It's essentially just fifteen episodes of two characters having very dull conversations, with the oh so hi-larious Koyomi getting bullied or verbally outwitted by the members of his haunted girl harem.\\n\\n\r\nI can't emphasize enough how much I hate Koyomi. He's your typical perverted harem protagonist with a heart of gold, willing to valiantly give up his useless life for anything with a pair of tits. His hobbies include staring at ass, popping boners over the slightest amount of female contact, and groping little girls. What? That last part? Groping little girls? That's right, groping little girls. Mayoi, the little fifth grade girl, is the repeated target of Koyomi's disgusting, grabby hands, and he is genuinely shocked when she fights back. Koyomi's got a pretty latent case of pedophilia; besides squeezing the chest of a fifth grader, he also gets an erection from touching a middle school girl's (Nadeko) MACHINE WASHED swimsuit and bloomers. This boy acts like he hasn't had an orgasm in three years, which is odd, considering the amount of masturbation material shoved at him every day.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi, unfortunately, is part vampire, so he's virtually immortal and heals quickly. He gets the ever living shit beat out of him a lot, which is pretty satisfying, but not quite as satisfying as it should be, knowing that even though he got a hole kicked in his abdomen, he'll be a-okay in the next scene. I was stupid for thinking that somehow, maybe the entire female cast wouldn't fall head over heels for him. Very stupid indeed. Every chick in this goddamn show wants to suck his nasty dick because he's their savior and is...no, that's it. Your typical damsel in distress scenario. Also, did I mention how ugly he is? If you're gonna have a harem of chicks vying for a dude's cock you better make him attractive. I can't say anything nice about this asshole.\\n\\n\r\nHitagi, his \"girlfriend\", is almost as bad as he is, the \"almost\" is purely because she isn't a pedophile. She is, however, a massive bitch. She treats Koyomi like the piece of shit he is, but it's not in any way satisfying because she's a bitch to everyone and her life is awful so we're supposed to feel bad for her. It's probably the most generic tragic backstory for a female anime character ever: she's a sickly girl who was great at everything (smart, athletic, popular), she used to be rich, she got sexually assaulted, and her mom is a nut who donated all their money to a shady religion cult.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit I pitied her at the end of the second episode and even shed a tear or two, but even though one of her massive problems was solved, she still acts like the world owes her everything. It's very hard to believe that her and Koyomi are even dating; she doesn't give a single shit about him. She pulls that edgy \"if someone kills you i'll kill them\" bs with Koyomi all the time and it somehow becomes a plot point more than once, but that's the extent of her affection. In one scene, she claims to have no interest in sexual activity due to her assault (understandable), but minutes before she was rubbing the inside of Koyomi's thigh, licking his ear, and whispering unintelligible, presumably dirty things in his ear...while in the backseat of the car her father was driving. What can I say? These two deserve each other.\\n\\n\r\nA whole lot of emphasis is put on Hitagi's \"tsundere\" personality, but I'm only seeing tsun and no dere. She is entirely a bitch and her \"sweet\" side doesn't extend past death threats.\\n\\n\r\nAny time not spent straight up ignoring Koyomi is spent verbally berating him and firing off one unfunny insult after the other. This shit is honestly, genuinely supposed to be funny, so it happens in every goddamn episode where Hitagi shows her ugly, scowling face. Koyomi acts as only a reactionary, taking the insults like the little bitch he is, which is also supposed to be funny, but it sincerely isn't. It's so painfully unfunny.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the two main characters are the most unsavory of the bunch. They're your generic harem male lead and tsundere bitch girlfriend with very little thought put into either. Their quarrels are intended to be funny and witty, but I found myself sitting through these scenes either completely straight-faced or just rolling my eyes at the money wasted on this mess.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, besides their appealing designs, there isn't much to them. You've got your cute yet sassy fifth grade girl, your sporty, \"lesbian\" chick, your shy childhood friend girl, and your generic smart, sweet, big-tittied honor role student. All these characters are are flat reactionaries with one or two oh so quirky personality traits that serve as Koyomi's arm candy and fanservice. This show isn't an ecchi, I can tell you that, but the ass and boob shots are so out of place in this *~*occult avant-garde mystery*~* that it's just embarrassing. \"I'm a monster that's possessed your friend and I kill people to relieve stress, but I'm also a sexy kitty with big boobies, nyahaha!\" That fucking laugh made me wish I was deaf.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Mayoi's character at first. I appreciated her hostility and hesitation to trust Koyomi, and her arc had an awesome opening theme. I cried a bit at the end of her arc as well. This admiration soon transformed into disappointment as she gradually became another one of Koyomi's bitches, losing basically ever bit of integrity she once held for me. She gets angry when being groped and retaliates as expected, but as soon as she discovers it's silly Koyomi's doing, it's alright! Also, the \"I flubbed your name\" thing got old, but she is a fifth grader, so I guess I can let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nSuruga, the athletic one, quickly became one of my favorites. She's cute, she's personable, and she knocks Koyomi's lights out twice! And get this: she's gay, so she won't want to suck Koyomi's chode! Awesome!\\n\\n\r\n...Haha, so na\u00efve. She's not gay. I mean, she is, for Hitagi (god knows why), but after being saved by Our Lord and Savior Koyomi Araragi, she insists on stripping down when talking to Koyomi and pretty clearly want to ride his shriveled dick into the sunset. Honey, you're not gay. I know, it was hard for me to accept my bisexuality too. You'll get through it. It's really infuriating to realize that even though these writers /could/ give us a gay character, they wont't, because apparently writing a female with no romantic or sexual attraction to men is literally impossible. I don't care if she's bi, in fact, that's great! Just don't call her gay.\\n\\n\r\nHer arc was probably my favorite, though. That scene where she stands ominously in front of Koyomi near the train tracks at night? Genuinely scary. That awesome, fast-paced fight scene? Fantastic! I loved that. Too bad it only lasted like, four minutes. Then she turns into another notch in Koyomi's belt. They had the chance to make a good character, and they didn't take it.\\n\\n\r\nNadeko is the reserved, quiet, childhood friend of Koyomi and his sister. Gonna cut right to the chase: she loves him too. Boooring. Not much to say about her, except that despite her age--no, wait, especially because of her age, Koyomi still wants to bang. Her backstory is...confusing? Why did her friend curse her? Because Nadeko said no to the boy her friend liked? Wouldn't that make things easier for the friend because she has a chance with the dude? I don't get it?????\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa's the perfect, sweet little cat girl with a rough home life. You want to like her because there really isn't anything to dislike about her, but the fact that she's another sweet smart pretty big tittied girl with a thirst for some ugly protagonist dick nulls any positives for me. I feel bad for this chick, but I just can't like her.\\n\\n\r\nMeme is a badass. He's the only decent male character, which isn't saying much, considering there's only two. He looks sleazy, but he's a cool guy who doesn't hesitate to help out someone in need. Half of me wishes he got more screentime, but the other half isn't sure what that time would be used for.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu doesn't say a word at all. She sits there with Meme, eats donuts, drinks Koyomi's blood, and eventually does do something important. Not much at all can be said about her unless you watch the following seasons.\\n\\n\r\nBesides his two sisters who don't do anything until Nisemonogatari and Hitagi's dad, whose face you don't even see, that does it for characters. Literally. There are no background characters. Other people, like Hitagi's mother, is mentioned, but never shown. I did actually like this, it made the town feel entirely empty besides the main characters, which gave it a more lonely and spookier feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is lackluster. It's not GORGEOUS like people make it out to be.  Hajime Ueda's art, the stuff during the credits, was the most enjoyable part for me. It actually made it feel like an enigmatic monster story, which Bakemonogatari apparently is not. I can't be the only one who didn't appreciate those goddamn flashes of text, either. Entirely pointless, distracting, and seems like a cop out to cut down on animation costs. From what I can tell, in Nisemonogatari, it gets cut down significantly, which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good. Each arc had its own opening theme, and I found myself listening to them almost every time. The ending was enjoyable as well, both to listen to and watch. I can't pick out any songs during the show that I loved, but most of it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I enjoyed this show that much. It's loaded with out-of-place fanservice, initially interesting characters that melt into puddles of affection for the MC, annoying flashes of text coupled with just average art, and long, long periods of boring dialogue and quips between Koyomi and one of his bitches. I found myself bored watching this, and you could probably afford to skip most of the dialogue parts because the plot is easy to follow. I'm sincerely hoping Nisemonogatari turns out better, but my hopes aren't high.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, being the sucker I am, I'm still gonna buy the fucking figures.",

I'm also not lying when I tell you that it is somehow perfectly balanced. Simply because the dynamic between the characters, especially Araragi and Senjougahara, is so entertaining to listen to. Well, read technically, but you get what I mean.\r\nEven though the banter is the main focus of the majority of scenes, the animation quality is topnotch. Studio Shaft have their own way of doing things, which in this case works really well with the style of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching this anime, you're going to experience a wide range of emotions including, confusion, laughter, satisfaction, and that weird feeling that you get when something has been foreshadowed, but you have no idea what it is. Just a word of advice here, pay attention to the wording of certain dialogue very carefully. This series likes to use wordplay that only those familiar with the Japanese language are going to get, but it's still discernible if you rack your brain enough to connect the dots.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, you should watch this anime if you want to enjoy some of the most 'natural' banter between characters that you'll probably ever see. And if the dialogue bores you, which I highly doubt it will, then you can stay for the fan service (or maybe some, Tsundere service *wink* *wink*)! We're all men of culture here, so I don't blame you. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, beware of tilting necks. Because they will tilt, and just keep on tilting...",

            "content": "(8.0/10)\r\nI began watching this show somewhat ironically with my friend. More specifically, i began watching this show with my friend to appease this weird insatiable almost gluttonous need to consume as much entertainment as i can. \r\nIts been about two years since i began to try take anime seriously. If you look at my track record, it has hardly been a positive one. Yet i try my best to give everything a fair shot. And for that i got pitiful attempts at entertainment with Fate/Zero, solid, yet flawed attempts at storytelling with Fullmetal alchemist:Brotherhood, and truly fascinating studies of editing and framing with Mononoke. \r\nSowhat have I dug myself into? Nine episodes in and watching a sexual pan of an animated twelve year old's comically red ass. Is this just a phase? Fuck. I don't know. \\n\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nStarting off my review with what I think carries this show. I can't tell if the director is good or bad, all I know is that almost every frame is visually pleasing in some way or another. This show is flat-out gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I will get into the story, and how that's written. But lets talk about this director first. I don't know his name, but I feel like i know his ideas. His take on this show is self-indulgence to its core. Every frame, cut, and pan is indulgent. Its gluttonous. Its horrific. Its sexual. Its gross. Its slimy. I feel dirty. But I want to. \\n\\n\r\nHe treats every piece of horrifically self-aware fanservice as if its his Mona Lisa. And in a way, this completely overboard self-indulgence is what makes this show better than every other shitty anime. And in a way, it makes it worse. Somehow the feeling that the director knows exactly what he's doing is unnerving.\\n\\n\r\n\"Why would he POSSIBLY want to highlight the fact that this twelve year old has pink panties on?!\" That's the wrong question though. A more reasonable one would be, \"Why does he treat his own self-awareness with such... seriousness?\" Does the fact that he's not so much as winking at the camera as he is spelling it out in front of you in growing neon colors? \\n\\n\r\nI don't know. \\n\\n\r\nWhat i do know is that the framing is great. The blocking shots are pretty. The art-style is unique. The crazy missing frames are hilariously ironic and flat-out nonsense, since I believe it has since been a completed product? But that's the show. That's quite literally the whole show. It has blatant use of weird blender-esq CG, but he even found a way to make THAT artsy! The colors are so vibrant and contrasting. The locations are so empty yet captivating. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole show can be described by its art. A non-conformist structure in the shroud of cliche. That i do know. I can't help but be enthralled in his complete and utter self-indulgent, comical, and truly fun directing. \\n\\n\r\nI remember my thoughts after i finished the first episode. \"I think the artstyle is interesting but i'm not convinced. Every art style needs to be grounded with a theme that relates to the show!\"\\n\\n\r\nOh what a naive little fuck i was. The theme is nothing. Its indulgence. Its over exaggerated everything. Its color. Its lighting. Its books. Its kanbaru's bubble butt. Its every panning shot over Sengoku's swimsuit. Its every sleazy shot of Hanekawa's tits. \\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the character design. Never has an anime been THIS unique with its design whilst staying in the realm of realism. The wide-angle shots of characters with disturbing fish-eye lenses are captivating. Every character is so well done (rendered?). I get more attached to their look than their personality. But more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nNever has a show captivated me more... whilst simultaneously making me self-aware that my state of captivatedness (Not a word) is disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know... \\n\\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe only logical step here is with the story. The writer(s) tell a very direct story in a very indirect way. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing, like the directing, is complete and utter nonsense. Reading into every handful of dialogue scenes per episode would be the death of you i promise. If you do read into it, you'll find that any idea of theming, development, or even progression is nonexistent. There is none. You are instead left in an endless loop of nothing being told as if its something. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the show at its very essence. Its redundant in the most glorious way. The dialogue is simultaneously worthless... but worthwhile. Its a dichotomy of character development with no development. A frozen state until the necessary final episode of each given arc is resolved with some sickeningly heartwarming monologue from Ararararagi-kun (I stuttered) about how much he \"loves\" X character. \\n\\n\r\nWhether its his sisters or his multiple harem-style lovers... he loves em all. Why? Cause he's a good guy!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why i can't speak so highly of the story here. It works. But that's it. Everything is laid out for the characters to play around with... and more on the characters later. \\n\\n\r\nThe simple storytelling structure is covered in a blanket of nonsense character dialogue that simultaneously carry the show and make it even more uselessly self-indulgent than it already is. And that's not even the most interesting part. \\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nYou may be thinking to yourself, \"Wow, so he just left off his last sentence with that sexy little cliffhanger. So he must be picking it up with this next subject. Is SOUND the most interesting part of Bakemonogatari?\"\\n\\n\r\nNo. Just like this show, i choose to pick up exactly where you don't want me to and start on a completely different tangent before looping back around and continuing my main points. \\n\\n\r\nIn this tangent, i'll be ranting about sound. Or... i don't know. Something like sound. \\n\\n\r\nEvery anime has this stupid god damn habit of outlining every \"comedy\" scene with a light-soundtrack that sounds like a free sample off of youtube's royalty free music distributer. Simply put. Its fucking unbearably lame. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does that. And it was starting to really get on my nerves too since this show has the habit of really pumping the music up there next to the dialogue. So the repetitive loops of awful royalty-free harping is never more blatant than it is in this show. \\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the original intros backing every single arc in this show, i would have given the sound a flat-out negative review.While these original scores aren't really \"my thing\" for the most part, their still a nice, albeit (mostly) eyerollingly self-aware anime intros. Everything from happy-go-lucky girls skipping around flaunting their well-tidied school uniform to abstract visuals signifying the artists knack for adobe aftereffects. You have it all in a nice little cliche bun. \\n\\n\r\nIt may be self aware... but like most of this show, the writer(s) have the cake, eat it, shit it out, and eat it again. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, i will note that the riffs do get a little better towards the end of the season. \\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nNow... lets get into the subject of the show's characters. The thing that single handedly almost drove me mad. The characters. At first i wanted to split this ridiculously complicated subject matter that i honest-to-god spent hours thinking about into three neat categories for whoever is actually reading this far to easily understand. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, i'll be rambling on in an incoherent mess of words and pretentious sentences that make it seem like i know what i'm talking about. Trust me, i don't know. This is a big ol' parody of a romantic comedy after all. \\n\\n\r\nLets begin by asking ourselves, \"what IS a good character?\" Is it a three-dimensional being with realistic thoughts, emotions, and reactions? Or is it simply something that is memorable? \\n\\n\r\nNow i'll say that these two things aren't mutually exclusive. There are MANY beautifully written and memorable characters in television. However, for this show, I was having a ridiculously hard time putting my thumb on what makes these characters so...I don't know. \\n\\n\r\nIts the simple fact that they're memorable, I guess. I was skimming through some reviews on this website and i saw one that said that these were some of the most complex characters EVER. I felt like i was watching a different show!\\n\\n\r\nI don't think they are complicated at all. In fact, they are quite literally the definition of flat-out cliche-driven anime characters. The tsundere, the shy loli, the busty smart one, the dumb tomboy, etc. These anime cliches are so common that whenever one of these kinds of characters pop up i want to take a cheese grater to the testicles. \\n\\n\r\nI can't stand them. I honest to god can't stand these characters. Anime has a lot of issues that i find it hard to look past, but these kinds of \"trying so hard to be cute and instead miserably failing, making me cringe SO hard\" characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, we have such a fucking bland protagonist. These poor girls fall in love with this complete and utter blank-slate self-insert piece of fucknugget like Araragi?!?! His defining trait is that he's \"a good guy\", that's it. What kind of greasy neckbeard virgin would actually believe this bullshit? \\n\\n\r\nI know i sound salty. And i am, cause these terrible characters plague television shows, specifically anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show has awful, generic, horrible, unbearable, self-aware have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too characters and i just want to eat an ashtray. \\n\\n\r\nSo...why the fuck can't i stop thinking about them? \\n\\n\r\nAm i gaining my virginity back? Has my body become pure again? Has the cheeto dust reformed over my fingers and my fedora has found its way back on my head? Am i a nice guy now? Will my katana protect every tsundere loli i can find? \\n\\n\r\nWhy the fuck can't i stop thinking about these characters? What about them has infected my mind at night. So much so that instead of counting sheeps i count different ways Ararararagi can sexually assault his sisters... AGAIN. All jokes aside, this is a huge deal. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes THESE characters so memorable. Why is senjougahara so memorable over any other self-aware tsundere? \\n\\n\r\nWhy is Kanbaru so memorable? Or Tsubasa Hanekawa? Or Shinobu? Or Hachikuji? Or Arararararararararararagi? Well... maybe not so much Aarararagi... although his character has a significant positive personality shift in Nisemonogatari, so i'll count him in there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo i've found a few simple explanations. One being something i've touched on already. The designs are amazing. I've never seen anime characters have this much... face. It sounds weird, but i have no other way to put it. \\n\\n\r\nWhile i always used to say that anime characters all look the same, and in some ways, they still do to me. I'd like to think i've grown enough to distinguish the different art-styles studios have. Whether its studio Gainax and its thick outlines with characters folding their arms. Or A-1 Pictures and their general cancer. I think i've developed enough of an eye for characters in anime, even if all of them do have similar ideas behind them. Such as big eyes, small nose, etc. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, Shaft has outdone themselves. I've never seen this much actual animation in an anime television series, let alone the absolutely gorgeous detail they have on characters. Every character has what i have come to call a \"Beauty shot\", where the director brings the metaphorical camera lens right up in their face. Intricate shading, lighting, and fish-eye is applied and you get what is a distinct character. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that these characters actually have lips is a sight to behold. And what magnificent fucking lips, man! Never before have lips been this well done in animation. They're gorgeous. As i said, even at the shows most fanservice-y, where the entire concept of the scene is \"wow, boobs and ass boobs and assboobsassbobbsadk;ad\", the director takes that concept and tries his best to make it as pretty as possible.\\n\\n\r\nNot pretty in the \"oh look, animated boobs and butt\", but pretty from a directing standpoint. In one of the shows lowest most incest-y moments (this is past these fifteen episodes by the way so i'll avoid every spoiler here), there is a toothbrush and moaning. The director found a way to make that awful, awkward scene pretty. \\n\\n\r\nSo the animation is gorgeous. The characters have details. They have beautifully done lips, noses, ears, etc. These are things that i find make a character more personable. These features which aren't usually highlighted in anime i find are helpful in giving characters identity. \\n\\n\r\nBut even in the none-closeups, there is still identity to be had. And that's mostly in the movement. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs i said above, this is the single most impressive looking anime television show from the animation standpoint. I feel like the studio and the animators had a blast animating this show. Every frame is dripping with effort. I felt like i didn't see nearly as many \"filler\" still imagery as i do in any other anime television show. \\n\\n\r\nI think that's whats so great and what helps establish these characters. I've never seen these god awful cliche's actually get effort put into them from a visual standpoint. \\n\\n\r\nHow does a tsundere walk? How does she talk? How does a shy loli who badly wants the main characters meat thermometer behave herself? Does she just blush and show her ass? Or are there little hand gestures in there? The way her irises dash from right to left. How her legs move back and forth. The expression on her face. \\n\\n\r\nHow a godawful twister scene can turn into a somewhat interesting study of expanding character through animation. \\n\\n\r\nThis memorable quality can be said about almost every character in the show. And while animation and the character it gives is probably the biggest reason, we also have the general atmosphere in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIts empty. I honestly can't think of a single time we've ever actually seen a crowd. Every scene is desolate. Its either in an abandoned building or in some beautiful, yet empty, park. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis emptiness helps the viewer draw focus on the character. There is no \"other\" character you want to be focusing on. Since every character embodies a cliche there's no comparing them either. Both these aspects create for an empty world where your one focus are these characters. \\n\\n\r\nSo perhaps that matched with the animations creates the most memorable characters i've ever seen in an anime. Its nothing but sheer confusion when an anime transcends simply cute character designs to flat out cute characters. Or flat out sexy characters even. Its the attention to detail in a barren world with the backbone of spectacular animation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo... why the 5/10? Because i still don't know! Are they good characters from a writing standpoint? No. They absolutely are NOT. But fuck are they memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's my internal struggle. Maybe i'll come back to this review in a year or two when i've finished the show and its future movies and regrade it. Hell, i might even do that soon when i catch up. But at the current point, i actually have no idea what say about the characters other than their the most memorable aspect of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is in a show that has one of the coolest art styles in animation. The art style is flawless. The characters aren't. Yet a scratch on a diamond is somehow the most visible aspect. Or maybe the scratch is ignored. I don't know. \\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION: \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nApart from my undying love of television, i love music. Specifically, I adore hip-hop. What started as casual listening blossomed into a full blown fascination with lyrics, wordplay, mastery of the english language, etc. Its something that i can honestly never get enough of. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that kind of lyrical rap music is what I love. I love going back to a song and catching new pieces of wordplay. I love the idea that the artist i'm listening to has a complete mastery of the english language and bends words at his will. That's the kind of rap i love. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the kind of television I love. \\n\\n\r\nIn Hip-Hop, especially in the modern day, there are so many different kinds of subgenres. There's Acid rap, pop rap, gangsta rap, southern rap, Bounce... i can go on. In this ocean of subgenres there's one specific one that i have a complete distaste to. Maybe cause its becoming so big, but i just can't stand it.\\n\\n\r\nIts called \"trap rap\", trap music. If you are reading this and don't know what trap rap is, i'll describe it for you. Its qualities (now adays) are usually bombastic beats with ominous, hazy, gritty production. The rapping is usually sidelined for catchy hooks and tone. So my favorite part about rap, the rapping, is usually a complete afterthought. Its simply there to bang. \\n\\n\r\nThe rapping usually consists of multiple cliches like Guns, violence, shooting, sex, drugs, cars, etc. Its known for being very empty and shallow. But it sounds good to some so they love it. \\n\\n\r\nSo i have this major bias to this kind of subgenre already. Even if i have listened to a LOT of trap rap. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBUT. Every so often there's a trap song that just captures my attention. Mind you, its not because the rapping itself is spectacular and full of intricacies like i like it... no. Its just something about it that really gets me going. Something i love. Whether its the production, aggressiveness, i honestly don't know! But i add it to my spotify and play it for the better half of a month.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, its a guilty pleasure. As stupid as it sounds, i take a lot of pride into what i listen to, what i watch, what i play. Its a character trait (flaw?). So i don't really want to be seen listening to some stupid trap song. But, nevertheless, i do listen to it cause this one song every so often sounds fucking awesome. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's Bakemonogatari. There's just something about it. I don't know what score to give it. Should i try being objective about these characters and assume that their memorability is a flaw of my own perception of characters? Or should I rate it as subjectively as i can, since every character is so god damn memorable and every frame is so god damn pretty. Maybe when I do end up rewatching the show in a few years i'll hate it. I'll realize that this love comes from perpetual loneliness or the need to see something greater in pure exercises of style over substance. If my career of becoming a director ever does pan out and i look back at this review it'll be some foolish bullshit. A pretentious kid rambling about what he wants to see to convince himself that he's seeing anything in the first place. But in my current state, i have to believe that there's a reason for my infatuation. \\n\\n\r\nI can write more than i just have about it and still i wouldn't even be halfway there in explaining myself because someone who is prideful can never explain something without making it sound like their being defensive. We say we aren't being defensive but we are. \\n\\n\r\nWe get embarrassed. We don't want to get judged, especially after the countless hours we spent convincing people and ourselves that trap music sucks we still hide under the covers and love the fuck out of some of it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's me. Its undoubtedly me. Its something i can't stand about myself. But there it is. There's something about that song. There's something about this one specific harem-esq. anime filled with cliches and generic character tropes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most defensive way I can put it while still maintaining honesty is that Bakemonogatari is the guiltiest possible pleasure. Its exploitative, gross, sleazy, sexist, beautiful, fascinating, memorable, and confusing. \\n\\n\r\nIts the guiltiest possible pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nOr it isn't, what do I know? Maybe everything, maybe nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't know everything, I just know what I know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

No anime like Bakemonogatari has done this to me and in such a tasteful manner.  When I first started watched it I thought in my head \"Hmm... this has potential\".  So, I continued on and let me say...  the colors and the substance of this just took my mind and sent it off to the lands of the strong minded and the rivers of the deep.\r\nNever has an anime made me think instantly \"Masterpiece\".  Ifound most complain lack of action or just simple talk.  No, they are wrong and do not understand the depth that Bakemonogatari is trying to tell you.  If you hadn't noticed, the colors represent their emotions in their individual struggles.  This is not an anime to be enjoyed by the weak and shallow minded but rather for those who are strong and intellectually able.  So please pick up this masterpiece and watch it.  Do not be swayed by the \"moe moe~\" image it tries to convey.  This anime means business and it dealt business by crushing the light novel charts and almost reaching Evangelion status.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari gets a 10/10; I would rate it higher but I am chained by this mortal coil of a website.",

            "content": "THE CREATIVITY LEVEL IN THIS SHOW IS TOO DAMN HIGH!\r\nI was exclaiming the phrase over and over in my head as I watched episode after episode of Bakemonogatari. This show marks my first attempt at watching a show that involves the supernatural, since I'm not really into ghosts and all that.\r\nI am pleased to say, however, that I was pleasantly surprised at what Bakemonogatari brought to me, and I definitely won't regret choosing this show as my first anim\u00e9 about the supernatural.\r\nThe first thing that I noticed about Bakemonogatari was its art style. I'm new to the anim\u00e9 scene, and my completed list certainly palesto those who've watched numerous types of these things. I am proud to say, however, that Bakemonogatari would still be fixed as one of my favorites had it been the art alone. It reminded me that anim\u00e9, just like paintings and movies, is an art form--and Bakemonogatari definitely does justice to this art form from Japan. Seamless transitions between animations and still images, title cards reminiscent of Spongebob Squarepants' time cards (of course without the comedy), and exaggerated styles that serve as emphasis to what this show brings--Bakemonogatari has it all, and it does all this pretty well. Opening and ending animations were also very creative and well-done. That's saying something, given the fact that they made six different opening animations for a 15-episode series.\\n\\n\r\nNext to be noticed firsthand is sound. Sound is in no way lackluster; it does aid the mood of the scene. It also manages to give the feel that you're watching a show about monsters and ghosts, and at the same time dismiss the unnerving feeling that you're watching a horror movie. That alone deserves praise. I feel that it can still be improved, though. I think much can still be done to improve the background ambiances Bakemonogatari provided. But, setting that room for improvement aside, Bakemonogatari still has something to say for itself when it comes to sound. Another thing that brings out its sound aspect are its opening and ending themes. Personally, I'm a fan of supercell; to learn that this show's ending theme was done by them (Kimii no Shiranai Monogatari) was a big pull-in for me. The fact that there were five different opening songs for this show got me interested as well. It appears that the voice actors for all the girls of the respective mini-arcs also sang their own opening songs. I especially liked the first opening, \"staple stable.\"\\n\\n\r\nWatch further and you'll notice the story and characters as somethings distinct as well. Stories are separated into five, with episodes allotted into each. Each mini-arc tackles one particular person and how Araragi Koyomi, the lead character, manages to relieve them of their monster-related problems. It's a new thing for me to encounter vampires and ghost crabs in an anim\u00e9, seeing as I haven't watched any show like this before. Given that, the divisions of stories certainly appeal to me. They're not so deep that it spreads thin across numerous episodes, nor is it so quick that it lasts just one episode. The mini-arcs manage to deliver five stories' worth of a show in 15 episodes; in fact, it feels as if I didn't watch one season at all. It really was more like five shows in one.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are impressive, to be short. Large amounts of attention must have been given to these characters to have made them so diverse. We have a part-vampire lead, a mysteriously lax spirit healer of sorts, a lightweight girl bordering on tsundere and yandere, among other things. It impresses me as to how much I remember the distinct characteristics of each even though there were lots of them. They don't feel like supporting characters at all--they really just feel like they're all leads, along with Araragi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakemonogatari was an experience like no other. It didn't feel like watching just another anim\u00e9; it felt like watching an artwork--complete with the mood and harmony. Character, art, story, sound--all join together to form a five-in-one story like no other. If all supernatural shows are like this, then maybe I should think twice about watching them.",

I was hesitant at first before I watched because I had heard that it was different. When it comes to anime, different can mean that its so different it is unbearable or so different that you just can not help to see how it goes. Fortunatly, it was the later.\r\nBakemonogatari uses one of the basic anime plots, a guy, in this case Araragi Koyomi, to help different girls with their problems. However, in Bakemongatari this is put forth in a different matter. Each girl has a spirit orAparation that is attached to her and how our protagonist Araragi does his best to help them. Or as said in the anime \"Help them save them selves.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt combines serious plot, clever and comical witty dialogue, and intense situations to bring together the anime known as Bakemonogatari. Personally, I found it to be very entertaining and had a very intense story to keep me watching yet very comical conversations and situations that keeps one amused.  The best part, in my own opinion, are the characters. Each character is so different yet so well created and brought forth that you cant help but be attracted to them. They are very unique and I havent seen an anime that does as good with character building as I have in Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nIts a unique anime with diverse characters, intense plot, and comical dialogue that is enough to keep mostly anybody intrigued by it.",

            "content": "Let me begin this review by saying this is one of my all time favorite animes ever. But for reviewing purposes I'll try to make this review as unbiased as possible. This review will also contain no spoilers.\r\nStory : 9/10 \r\nBakemonogatari in all honesty is quite confusing yet at the same, mesmerizing.The story is depdendent on story arcs, each arc is about the main character helping a different character. But the story itself is about a high school boy named Araragi Koyomi whose life has become ever so confusing since his first encounter with an oddity ( a non-living god/monster that \"attaches\" to humans andit's effect on the human varies from oddity to oddity )  a year prior to the story. Now, he must help the other main characters, all of whom he meets as the story progresses with their own personal oddity. The story in my opinion is extremely well paced, original, and interesting throughout all 15 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\r\nThe art of Bakemonogatari is probably what really caught my attention when I fisrt began watching this anime. The art style is extremely colorful, and really blows you away. The characters are all very well designed and look very original and not copy and pasted from other animes. Lastly the animation is extremely crisp and fluid which really adds to the \" oh my god this looks amazing \" feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound :10/10\\n\r\nThe sound in Bakemonogatari is superb. Everything from the openings and the ending ( There's a new opening for each arc, all of which are very appealing and fun to listen to ) to the voice acting and even the little things from a pencil hitting the floor to the sound of someone skipping sound very realistic and really emphasize how much effort Aniplex took to make this anime a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10/10 \\n\r\nI really can't talk about the characters of Bakemonogatari too much without spoiling a lot. So all I'm going to say is that each and every character, even the ones that don't get much screen time are all unique in their own ways. No two characters are near the same,  in fact, the characters are  so well developed that after watching this, you feel as if you kinda know them... in real life. That's all I'm going to say, but trust me the characters in this show are so fun to watch and leaves you wanting to see them more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\r\nI generally stick to the rule \" No anime is perfect, therefore it doesn't deserve a 10\" , but Bakemonogatari is one of those rare exceptions for me. The way Shaft meticulously executed such a complex story with so many unique characters and avoided many potential plot holes while keeping the show well paced and never boring really blows my mind. Plus the art and sound are some of the best I've ever seen/heard. This anime, in all honesty is an amazing masterpiece and is a must watch for all anime enthusiast. \\n",

            "content": "I've got to admit, Bakemonogatari has been one of the stranger and more unique anime that I have watched. The premise of an ex-vampire attempting to help solve the problems of his friends and fellow peers is intriguing on its own, but that is just what's on the surface. Underneath the surface lies an anime with heavy, but interesting, dialogue and unique artwork. I found that it wasn't easy to grasp all the concepts and ideas being thrown at me from the get-go, but I was surprised that the dialogue alone was able to convey the messages of the story with ease. Bakemonogatari is definitelynot for everyone, but those who decide to watch it to the end will be immensely rewarded. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nSHAFT is well-known for the unique artwork and animation that are present in their anime. This is no different in Bakemonogatari as the episodes are mostly filled with abstract art, creative backgrounds and artistic scene changes (i.e. duration of a scene, point of view changes, position of camera, etc.). Personally, the artwork did not fit my tastes. However, I do appreciate the effort and artistic thought that SHAFT put into this project. The artwork is definitely memorable as virtually no other studio has the same art style. Looking at the art objectively would have led me to rate it a 9/10 while a subjective point of view would result in a 5/10. By averaging both viewpoints, I ended up giving this category a 7/10. I believe all of SHAFT's artwork is either hit or miss. For me, it was unfortunately a \"miss.\" \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nEach of the main characters in Bakemonogatari face their own struggles and with the help of Araragi Koyomi, an interesting male-lead whose caring and strong-willed personality separate him from the all-too-typical generic male protagonist, manage to overcome them. Of all the characters in the series, I found Senj\u014dgahara Hitagi, who some call the main female protagonist of the story, to be by far the most interesting and complex. Never before have I seen a character who has managed to fall under three different character archetypes - tsundere, yandere and kuudere. Each of the other characters also has their own interesting traits and it takes great attention to detail in order to truly understand them and their actions. One thing's for sure though: the characters in Bakemonogatari are not just hollow shells with a voice; they are examples of what great characters should be - realistic, interesting and likeable. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe sounds in this anime were solid overall. The OPs fit each of the characters well while the ED was excellent, wrapping up each episode nicely. The BGM was also surprisingly memorable and interesting; they were not all generic piano and/or strings pieces. Finally, voice acting was done well. Each seiy\u016b matched their characters well and effectively conveyed the right emotions that were being felt by the character through their voices. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nWith a name like \"Ghostory\" or \"Monstory\", chances are, the story will be centered on supernatural beings or phenomena. For each of the arcs, we get to witness the \"exorcism\", as I like to call it, of unusual spirits (a crab, snail, monkey, snake and cat). Bakemonogatari strays from the typical supernatural topics of interest like ghosts, demons and zombies, but manages to tell an interesting and suspenseful story using what many consider as common animals. Broadly speaking, the anime tells of Koyomi's experience with each of the main females and their respective problems concerning the spirit. But I believe that, under this premise, lies deeper meanings that a casual watcher like me will not catch during the first time through. Due to the complexity of the dialogue and the hidden meanings embedded within, an analytic approach is necessary if one desires to truly understand the full meaning behind the story in Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nPersonally, I feel Bakemonogatari is overrated. But then again, maybe it's because I am unable to appreciate its true qualities and everything it has to offer. There were times where I found myself slightly bored but there were also times where I was genuinely interested in what would happen next. Watching it the first time through allowed me to conclude that this was indeed a deep anime with many hidden messages waiting to be discovered. I'm positive that watching this anime again will make things easier to understand for me but, as it stands now, Bakemonogatari was above average at best. However, if you're more of an analyst when it comes to anime, I highly recommend you give Bakemonogatari a try. And even if you're not (like me), this series is a fun watch, nonetheless.",

            "content": "As the name suggests, Bakemonogatari is a story of ghosts or rather more fittingly, monsters. My first impression for this anime was a bloody ghost story that is intended to scare children. But Bakemonogatari was nothing like what I had expected. \r\n~Story: A story called 'ghost story' would very unlikely be categorized out of the mystery genre. The general plot basically follows a guy who got to meet with a lot of strange girls. But of course, it is nowhere as simple as I have described it. In the story, each of the girls are faced with their own 'monster' problem and the guy wouldalways try to help them. \\n\\n\r\n~Art: When I started watching Bakemonogatari, I didn't really like the art in general. The constant flashes of the eye really gives me the shiver(a warning to those who have ommetaphobia). But as I continued watching, I started to see why it is like so. The art really brings out the mysterious aspect of the anime. What makes the art of Bakemonogatari really unusual is that it doesn't only features one art style. It also uses photos and manga imitations to really change the mood of the anime (mostly during comical moments). \\n\\n\r\n~Sound: The background soundtrack really helps to establish a mysterious atmosphere for the anime. The opening songs change roughly every 2 episodes. Each of the song would feature one of the girl to suit the episodes that are centered around them. Each of the songs have their own style to fit each character. The ending song stays the same throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters: Don't come expecting an ordinary high school because you won't find one. Even when some of the characters appear to be quite normal, you know immediately that that would never be the case. Every one of the girl has a problem related to some sort of occult monster. I find the characters to be quite interesting. They are all unique in their own way. The main character appears to be a typical baka pervert but  is actually one tenth of a vampire. The interactions between the main character and each of the girls are interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment: The comedy and the 'weirdness' of this anime really made it enjoyable to watch. I would often find myself laughing at the many awkward moments. I find the monsters described in Bakemonogatari to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think Bakemonogatari is meant to be scary because I had found myself laughing way more than I was shivering. So don't worry if you thought this anime was going to be a 'real' ghost story(like one of those really scary ones). For those who like blood, I would say Bakemonogatari only has a moderate amount of blood scenes. If you like awkward comedy, awkward love relationships and a touch of occult, Bakemonogatari is the anime for you.",

            "content": "I thought it might be interesting to write part of my review of Bakemonogatari in the style of its most wearying dialogue, but then I asked myself: in imitating that self-referential style, do I need to reference my own little gimmick in order to preserve the spirit of that dialogue? And if I do, am I still really mimicking that dialogue or am I doing something wholly different by virtue of distancing myself from that idea right at the get? Also, isn't the word \"self-referential\" among the most totally autological words in the English language? The word \"small,\" for example, seems autological, but one wouldneed to know the length of every word in English in order to definitively say that the word \"small\" describes itself. On the other hand, it's unquestionable that \"self-referential\" is a word that makes reference to itself. There's something very strong and pure about that, don't you think?\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, it's peculiar that a show so committed to developing believable psychological interiors for its characters has so much self-involved, unreal dialogue. Granted, said psychological interiors are regularly externalized as monstrous wordplay-based apparitions, but the show still seems to genuinely believe in its characters as real people. The whole postmodern self-referential spiel comes off as shallow and almost immediately becomes tiresome\u2014though in all fairness, it's mostly thanks to Senjougahara. Hanekawa, the smart, hardworking class president, was instantly my favorite character just because she talked like a real person. When she turned up in the Mayoi Snail arc, I was at the verge of dropping this altogether, but she was such a breath of fresh air that I kept going, if only to see her story\u2014which, by the by, was easily the best arc of the five featured in Bakemonogatari. The dialogue shines best when the show stops being so pleased with itself. The other most praiseworthy aspect of this show is its minimalistic, SHAFT-y style\u2014it's visually striking, and the surreal scenery is complemented by the equally spare BGM. You won't find another anime that looks and sounds quite like this one. But then again, you probably knew that already; it's pretty much the one thing everyone knows about Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is described by detractors as a wish fulfilment harem. I would agree, with the caveat that I have no idea whose wish this is granting. Besides Hanekawa, Kanbaru was the only other character I genuinely liked, and both of them had dialogue that was at least marginally more subtle and thoughtful than Araragi's painfully predictable interactions with Hachikuji or Senjougahara's incessant babbling. Hachikuji herself isn't too bad of a character in theory, but she's executed with the subtlety of a train crash. Sengoku allegedly has more development in later seasons; here, she's fairly bland, though I admit to a few juvenile snickers whenever she started pulling the submissive seductress routine and making Araragi uncomfortable. She might have benefitted from being given some more focus during her arc, but I certainly didn't object to seeing more of Kanbaru, whose good-natured demeanor belies quite a dark, conflicted character.\\n\\n\r\nReturning to the main point: I can only surmise that Bakemonogatari fans are all a bunch of unashamed masochists, because this show relies heavily on the assumption that Senjougahara is a character good enough to break up Hanekawa's arc with a date episode that completely excludes all the other girls. To clarify, it's pretty inarguable that she's a bad character, but I can't help finding her thoroughly unlikeable. \"Stapling my mouth\" pretty much tops my list of things that leave me with a seriously bad first impression, and even once Araragi starts dating her, there's this weird threat of physical violence pervading their interactions. After he tells her that he met Kanbaru, she gets up on the table, sticks a pen right up to his eye, and threatens to push it in and gouge out his eyeball. The usual range of explanations offered by fans in defence of her actions don't really satisfy me, either. She's had a troubled life, sure, but childhood trauma is a poor excuse; that is to say, her past might explain her behavior, but it doesn't justify it. Clearly, it isn't at the level of abuse here\u2014she's supposedly just teasing him\u2014but I still have to pacify myself occasionally with the explanation that Araragi is a masochist who enjoys that kind of thing. Luckily, the date episode was mostly free of violent undertones. Instead, it was just insufferably indulgent, and it's here that we strike at the meat of my problem with Senjougahara beyond any personal misgivings: frankly, no real person has ever talked like her and it makes her into this formless, jabbering nothing obscuring a halfway decent character. The idea that written dialogue can imitate real life speech is obviously flawed, but here there's no attempt to mirror it even superficially. This show wants to have its cake and eat it\u2014you just can't mix psychological realism with such transparently self-aware, self-referential archetypes. This doesn't make a bad show, but it really hurts Bakemonogatari's cohesion, far more so than even the most puerile harem moments. It's too damn on-the-nose, and it makes what could have been a great show into just a good one.\\n\\n\r\nThis might all seem rich coming from a user with Louise in their favorite characters list, but she's really just an affectionate holdover from my days of being a horny teenager who didn't really care if Louise beat Saito to death as long as she kept on being cute and tsundere. I wouldn't enjoy Zero no Tsukaima if I watched it now. Given that, I suppose I've inadvertently imitated Senjougahara here in coyly refusing to address the obvious conclusion until now: Bakemonogatari is a show best enjoyed by horny teenagers.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari isn't the typical anime. It can even be even in its own category, going above and beyond what the \"norm\" is. It frequently crescendos and comes back down, dramatically, slowly, eking every last drop of your attention and leaving you completely and utterly exhausted when the scene mercilessly ends. It's beautiful storytelling, really. One that will leave you yearning for more. It delves into the basic human condition: are we not all mortal? Do we not face emotional roller coasters in our everyday lives? Bakemonogatari goes beyond entertainment and dives head first into such tender topics.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story background is vague. Very vague. Thepast is hardly dredged up except a few subtle comments made by Araragi-San, interestingly enough. Just know that A. his life is beyond normal and B. there are vampires and other mysterious and metaphysical beasts that live among humans like you and me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, the storytelling is FANTASTIC. Told from one point of view but flitting from various characters many times, it never  leaves anything out. Usually, the episodes are labelled on what that particular episode, but not in the way you would normally imagine. Also, right after the OP, there are a creepy string of \"though messages\" which perhaps, if you are to read them all (I did. Like the loser I am), you would realize something distinct. Annoyingly, however, one of the main critiques I have for the story in general is how it tends to stray from the story-line and focus on humor and pointless bantering between characters. Of course, this being so high-class, there was a ton of play on words and generally it elicited a laugh every now and then. But seriously, when you spend 10 minutes of back and forth circular arguments, it gets old. Fast. Overall, though, there were enough plot twists to keep you entertained for the majority of the episodes. Otherwise it was sometimes uneventful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the anime just NAILS it. The art was stunning, no: perfect. Really, it was beautiful. The general theme was that of remorse, guilt, loathing, jealousy: and the art reflected that perfectly. The characters were drawn skinny and tall, with large female body parts and perfect curves. Eye-candy; but when those characters were interacting, the art did something dramatic I've never seen before. Instead of drawing two characters talking one on one, it would switch: maybe just the animation of a mouth, or a close-up of an eye, or a fade-out to the background. I've never seen something so perfectly executed. Instead of being bored to death with the average conversation, I sat there, mesmerized, as an ordinary conversation became a beautiful conflagration of colors, random angles, and astonishing precision. The emotions were never skimped on. The characters' various facial expressions changed quickly, and the art nailed that as well. This, of everything else, deserves a perfect score. It made this anime unique and definitive, drawing away from the crowd and going out on a tightrope to try something new. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGrand, epic music of fantastic proportions. I loved the music. It was never stale and never conflicted with the mood. I loved listening to the background music, even. It always matched the mood and continued throughout the story. The OP changed depending on what the episode was about; it was amazing. A little foreshadowing, which was good in and of itself. The ED was great and serious, as usual. Typical stuff. But seriously,the voice acting: astounding. Great. I mean, you have such a wide cast that covers a range of personalities and every character played their role with gusto and perfection. Amazing, amazing acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDang. These were some quality characters. There were a variety of characters with crazy personalities. None which usually exist in real life, which made for some interesting ways of interaction. However, the main character, though seemingly weak-minded, came out actually a little more forceful and had a beautiful character arc. Though he seems annoying at first, and though everyone along the way he meets seems too good for him, he ends up changing for the better. He meets various odds and ends throughout the anime, so you're never really disappointed with the character selection. The usual sort of people. But honestly, the way these characters interacted made it pretty worthwhile. Also, it was surprisingly dramatic and suspenseful at times, throwing me off guard. Especially since the light-hearted mood came bare minutes before a crazy drop to seriousness. But overall, amazing characters, great interactions, and fantastic way to put them together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThough going above and beyond the call of duty in terms of animation style, sound and some character development, key characteristics were missing, and the storyline became sort of repetitive after awhile. It lacked a certain finesse and grace that would have made this anime much smoother. It became focused on a person rather than the qualities that make him who he is. However, there were many pros that definitely outweighed the cons, and I would immediately recommend this to anyone. It had an interesting enough story line to pique my attention, as well as indiscriminate (and often inappropriate) humor that kept me yearning for the next episode. Who knows who you'll encounter in the world? And remember: Your best friend isn't necessarily just a friend. \\n",

            "content": "\"This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Koyomi Araragi of Chiba in the Kanto Region, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie 'The Graduate'. The girl, Senjougahara Hitagi also of Chiba in the Kanto Region, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only love two things. The first was her long hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Araragi meetsSenjougahara on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.\" And this line was taken from the intro of 500 Days of Summer.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Bakemonogatari reminds me alot of 500 Days of Summer. I loved 500 Days of Summer, and the film was released the same time Bakemonogatari was aired in Japan. Both Bakemonogatari and 500 Days of SUmmer shared the exact ideas of love, and relationship. But like 500 Days of Sumemr, it is not a love story.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonopgatari is adapted from a  light novel series by Nisio Isin and is produced by SHAFT studios, known for their artistic takes on various genres and is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, known for his works like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha and his recent work, mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Koyomi Araragi, an average high schooler who somehow turned into a vampire. During an afterschool hang out with his friend Hanekawa, he met a woman named Senjoughara Hitagi who's also Araragi's classmate. It turns out she's a woman who has an incurable disease that turns her into a weightless human. And this is where the romance begins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let me repeat this: This is not a love story.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Bakemonogatari is more of a series of supernatural stories mixed in with a harem story. Throughout his complicated romance with Hitagi, Araragi encounters females who are also supernatural entities like Senjougahara, and each of these females are told in a series of story arcs. In these arcs, You got Senjougahara who's suffering from a \"weightless\" disease, a little girl named Hachikuji Mayoi who got lost on her way home, a junior student of Araragi's school named Kanbaru who has a monkey's claw on her left arm, a girl named Nadeko who has a snake-like entity tied around her body and Araragi's friend and class rep hanekawa who has a bit of a cat problem. Each of these girls' arcs are well shown and follows faithfully from the light novel series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Bakemonogatari a really good series is the characters. Araragi is very similar to Tom from 500 Days of Summer: A snarky but average man with an interesting view of life. He's quite relatable in a sense that atleast he's not whiny or idiotic like most males in a harem or a romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have Senjougahara. She proclaims herself as a tsundere, but she's more of a kuudere and she's quite a cold person, but she is able to relate to Araragi and unlike most tsundere & kuudere characters, she doesn't try and torture Araragi, and even when she does, she does it to a point where Araragi can atleast tolerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe central supporting character in this Mimi Oshino, a spiritual healer who helps people with spiritual & supernatural disorders. He is also aided by Shinobu, a little girl who's also a vampire. He and SHinobu play a part in each arc, from helping Senjougahara's weightless problem to treating a girl who has an invisible snake entity tied around her body.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a SHAFT anime, so most of the time you'll be reading  a story that might make no sense at first, but makes alot of sense later. SHAFT always goes for this route. It takes a while to get used to this anime's storyline, and you will have a hard time understanding it unless if you have read the light novels earlier.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this is amazing. It follows a Film Noir style and It's pretty much influenced by French New Wave directors like Francois Truffaut and Jean Luc Godard, and the animation is pretty much based on Akiyuki Shinbo's previous works: Lots of cuts, the used of text and complex character interactions. This is Shinbo's most artistic work. DOn't expect a Pani Poni Dash or Zetsubou Sensei with this anime. It's way different than his previous works and it might just be his most artistic yet.\\n\\n\r\nI love the music in this anime. It's composed by Satoru Kousaki, who is pretty much one of my favourite composers in anime. He has done Lucky Star, Haruhi Suzumiya series and Star Driver, but Bakemonogatari is his best work, with insert music and background music inspired by Yoko Kanno and Leftfield. The OPs of this anime are based on the character arcs, and are sung by the females of this show. My favourite has to be Staple and Stable by Chiwa Saitou and Renai Circulation by Kana Hanazawa. Both are OPs that i've been listening to on my iPod for the past few days an di can't stop listening to them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kana Hanazawa and Chiwa Saitou, let's talk about the voice acting. The seiyuus in this are amazing, with SHAFT employing it's regulars like Kamiya Hiroshi, Saitou Chiwa, Sawashiro Miyuki and Horie Yui to fill in for their characters. All of these seiyuus have done a great job with this, especially Kamiya Hiroshi who does a great job as Araragi. When he's not doing the likes of Izaya, he tends to do characters like Araragi and Nozomu Itoshiki, and the amount of energy and voice he pulls to his characters are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Bakemonogatari is a work of art. it balances between a fun take on supernatural entities with a romance that resembles 500 Days of Summer. Watching this is like looking at beautiful paintings at the Louvre. It's just amazing and if you love Neo-Noir or French New Wave Films by Truffaut and Godard, then you'll definitely love this anime.",

            "content": "Well, many friends had recommended this anime, but I ignored most of their opinion.. \r\nAfter some months, I decided to give a try, and watched just two episodes, givin' up after watching.\r\nToday, I gave the final try, and for the surprise of my enjoyment, from 7 a.m to 3 p.m I had already finished the whole anime..\r\nLet's start with the points of this piece of art:\r\nSTORY: \r\n9/10\r\nThe story is fine, but the pictures you see don't define the point of all. It's something deeper, there are a meaning for everything in the anime, you have to stay alert to every detail on screen.Of course, doesn't mean it's complicated to understand the story, but, the details that count the most and that's what the story is about. \\n\r\nYou also have to be patient, the story guards a moment for every public. If you like action, drama, comedy.. there will be your moment, you just have to wait. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe anime shines in this area. The art follows side by side the characters reactions, it's an essential part of the development of those. \\n\r\nEvery situation has a mood given by the artistic design. It something breath taken. Watch this anime in the best quality you know, you'll get in tears of such beauty. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nAlong with the art, the sound design is a MASTERPIECE. The OSTs sounds fantastic. It deserves to be bought in an CD copy if you have an oportunity. Remembers a lot a game called \"Bastion\"(that I also recommend if you haven't played yet). \\n\r\nThe openings and endings are very creative too, the openings changes every arc of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nCharacter is a partial mix of the points above, the development is big. The characters represents a parody of the genre: harem.. you have the mainly character surrounded by girls, but the individual personality of these characters is different from everything you already has seen in other anime from the genre.\\n\r\nYou have positives and negative points in evey character, you really indentify them with yourself in some part. While someone says it's not to take them seriously, others will say there is something deep in each. It's all about a point of view. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThis is the personal part of my review, and here I say it's not an anime for everyone(even after all the thing I said before). The anime, is an animated manga. The dialog complains 90% of the anime. This really stays boring in some parts(my opinion), but the overall enjoyment you get when you complete an episode, is where the anime turns from a simple anime, to something EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nIs at the top of the best animes I ever watch. You have to give a try, at least six episodes, then, you can drop if you see that you don't have the patience.. \\n\r\nBut, the pleasure is big after you finish, you'll start a review like me. xDDD\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I pet a dog on the street, I'd be living. If I could get off my vehicle and offer a candy to the poor kid, I'd be living. If I buckle up and confess to my four year old crush, I'd be living. But all through my life, living feels extensively circumstantial to how I like to define it. I may have been at the right place and time to discover that I have often taken infatuation for love, polarity of opinions as disrespect and insecurity for defence, I may have been a second late or uttered a word more to hurt the peopleI have. But why does all of this need to happen if I could have easily fixed them? The border drawn between life and existence comes to effect. We dream towards an objective reality while constantly ignoring the subjective standpoint, or, in simpler frames, we choose to run away what (really) is. From the very beginning of the show, Bakemonogatari puts all of its skill in exploring this very border. The weight deficit, I think, is allegorical to the parents' negligence and incapability of confrontation dynamically inheres within the product as cowardice and irresolution. It's this cowardice that surfaces and impacts on Senjougahara's persona as desire for solitude. Her fear of embarrassment distracts her from seeking help. But as Araragi-kun says \"you're the only one who can help yourself\", but often a hand lent in favour can make chivalric a despondent heart. Only when acceptance supersedes Hitagi's own fear, she is able to see life in a new light, that is, from her standpoint instead of being afraid of revealing the lost 'normality' \u2014 a metaphor, hinted throughout, for the invaluable piece of splendor identity is. \\n\\n\r\nThis, fantastic parallel drawn between the two extremes in the first two-three episodes, made me reflect and appreciate the depth put into the show in large magnitudes. Thoughts are told through flickering cards, the emotional gap of the medium was bridged by distinct cuts of reminiscence. Bakemonogatari was like a spontaneous and sexy daydream ready to trade eminent escapism for the banal blemishes of my own life. But this kind of polish does not stay put. As I made it through further episodes, the imperfections grew in significance. The stylish dialogue was shaped into gross loli humour and mechanical blueprints started to eat up its steadiness. The nomadic existence of the thematic representation and execution, which the show once held proudly, was isolated into ridiculously drawn caricatures (I'm looking at you, Tsubasa Cat and Nadeko Snake) which would (often) forge unsettling side arcs to mock their own passive survival. Romance is precisely well done at some (ep 12, my favourite of the 15) and it is again assembled into a portentous cliche at the terminals.  \\n\\n\r\nFor a dialogue driven show, Bakemonogatari has its script proofread. The show breaks the fourth wall like it has the copyrights reserved, and it does so avoiding convention and embracing creative pursuits. The music is again, a riveting addition to the drama, Staple Stable is simply enchanting. Although when it goes out of its comfort zone to address themes such as farewell, reliance, it floats with a lot of baggage. Sometimes it mistakes warmth for pedagogy and tries to interpret simple events as something beyond its thematic perimeter. It loses out on animation too on occasions where the scenic impact bore great value. But the sublime consciousness and molded creativity, though in uneven amounts and periods, exceeds its aforesaid shortcomings. If loli humour can be gross, the finesse in dialogue can be sensational. Bakemonogatari emerges as a raw gem of brilliance tarnished and toned down by suspended disbeliefs. If it could've stayed on track, I'd be looking at one of my favourite entries in anime. For now, it's wonderful mirage that I'd revisit amidst coming years.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you were to personify the numerous parts that make up anime as a group of friends, then fanservice is that one guy that can\u2019t take a hint and constantly tries to join in, even though everyone hates him and are always talking shit about him behind his back. \r\nThe point that I\u2019m trying to make is that nobody takes it seriously, which is a real shame in fanservice\u2019s case, since it\u2019s actually a great tool that anime writers have at their disposal. Unfortunately, the majority of people who watch anime not only won\u2019t acknowledge this, but will even go so far as to criticiseany usage of said tool, regardless of the context it\u2019s presented in. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the first thing that comes to mind when fanservice is brought up is some shitty light novel adaptation where we see protag-kun walk in on a group of girls changing for the hundredth time, in a \u201cjoke\u201d so overused that any impact we might have felt is now completely missing. Unfortunately, the popularity of low effort shows that do this has led to the overuse of this clich\u00e9. I think this is the main reason why the majority of people treat it as that friend who can\u2019t take a hint, believing that all fanservice is this basic level of lowest common denominator shite. \\n\\n\r\nWhich just isn\u2019t true.\\n\\n\r\nThere are numerous examples where fanservice has actually enhanced the overall experience of a show and made it better, often giving a series its own unique and recognisable aesthetic. If you want to know the easiest way to tell the difference between productive and lazily done use of fanservice ask yourself \u201cWhat purpose has it actually served?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nJust look at the first 10 seconds of Bakemonogatari, which used fanservice in a completely upfront and in your face way. It doesn\u2019t tell us much about our main characters, or anything interesting about the world we\u2019re in, but that\u2019s okay. We have 15 whole episodes, and all of its sequels to do that. Right now, all it has to do is create intrigue so that the viewer will continue watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I find it impossible to not be curious about what happens next.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person that enjoys seeing high school panties, (and you know who you are) then you can get that basic perverse reaction that you want out of this opening shot. \\n\\n\r\nYou have a boner, congratulations.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this opening shot so great is that you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of it, even if you\u2019re not that kind of person. Shaft has one of the weirdest visual styles ever put to animation, and it makes even dumb things like a panty shot make you invested in what\u2019s to come. And once you\u2019re in, you stay in. \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows the panty shot is a summary of Kizumonogatari, a prequel which eventually got its own adaptation in the form of three movies, with a total running time of over 3 hours. All of this content was summarised without words in the next minute of the show and it makes as much sense as an autistic man-child analysing a panty shot and passing it off as a review.\\n\\n\r\nThis creates interest. Now you\u2019re hooked. You\u2019ve gone from a completely over the top and unnecessarily intense panty shot, to a trippy, violent series of events and you have no idea what the hell is going on. But you have to find out. \\n\r\nYou have to find out what some guy seeing a girl\u2019s knickers has to do with all the crazy shit you just saw.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to find out if this show will emphasize panty shots, the confusing tone that was created, or the extreme levels of violence you just witnessed. (It does all 3)\\n\r\nYou have to find out what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOpening a show with a panty shot is hardly a new idea. It\u2019s the way that Bakemonogatari uses this fanservice to draw us in that\u2019s interesting, and we see that throughout the entire series. The show often uses fanservice in a way that\u2019s productive for the characters, themes or ideas being presented. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance, there\u2019s a running gag where the protagonist will greet a 10-year-old girl by molesting her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes the police, great.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get arrested, at least here me out. There\u2019s a reason for this. I acknowledge that what I just said is weird and creepy, but I also think that was the point. It was used as a criticism of how the anime community constantly sexualises girls well below the age of consent by giving an over the top example of just how bad this behaviour is, in a way that otaku couldn\u2019t ignore. I think that this ability to use fanservice to criticise anime culture is something the show should be praised for, not taken as a sign that its weeaboo trash.\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\r\nYeah, I know it might be a stretch, so what. The fact that I even tried to justify is proof enough to me that the show did something right with its fanservice. I\u2019m not even saying I liked it. Aw, come on, who threw dildos at me-that\u2019s just weird.\\n\\n\r\nTo prove my point, let\u2019s go back to that opening shot and compare it to a similar show, called Strike the Blood, (specifically it\u2019s sequel), that did the same thing, to show how a complete lack of thought put into a show\u2019s use of fanservice can actively make a series worse.\\n\\n\r\nGranted the example I\u2019m showing you is the opening shot of season 2, so they spend a while doing recap, but since it took place before the opening credits, I would say it plays a similar enough role for this comparison to be justified.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing anybody watching the show would notice about Strike the Blood would be its completely lack of any visual identity. From its boring character designs and overused setting to its minimal animation, its crystal clear that they\u2019re not going to do anything interesting with the fanservice that you\u2019ve come to expect from the (just as terrible) first season. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no sense of intrigue, made even worse by its pointless dialogue. We can instantly tell that protag-kun and anime girl are cleaning the pool so why are we told that protag-kun and anime girl are cleaning the pool?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, finally, Strike the Blood gives us its own panty shot, really showing off why this clich\u00e9 has such a bad rep, and allows me to further appreciate how Bakemonogatari used it. Bake was completely in your face with how it did its stupid anime bullshit. You didn\u2019t even have context for what happens. The way the shot was framed completely focuses on her knickers, telling us everything we need to know about its personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has fanservice. If you can\u2019t look past that then fuck off. \\n\\n\r\nBake\u2019s complete lack of shame, while immature, was charming. It let me know that while I was getting fanservice I shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it and could just enjoy the scene for what it was. Strike the Blood feels like someone saw Bake\u2019s success and lazily tried to copy it while completely misunderstanding everything that made the original shot great.\\n\\n\r\nThis is especially true in how the dumb anime girl reacts to main character guy, giving the typical \u201cI\u2019m blaming you for no reason b-b-b-baka\u201d. \\n\r\nGuess what reaction Bakemongatari gave for its excessive fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNOTHING \\n\\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t give any, because it knew that we\u2019d seen the same overdone reaction a million times before. We wouldn\u2019t gain anything from seeing it again here. And what not including it did was actually make it completely different to what these scenes usually do. \\n\\n\r\nThink of it like negative space in a sketch. This is where you use the area around what you\u2019re drawing as a part of your sketch, using the blank spaces to enhance the material. You could fill more into what you\u2019re drawing, but if doing so makes it worse then why waste the time and effort ruining your art? In this example think of that reaction as something you could add. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of a shitty joke or basic reaction in Bake means that there\u2019s no justification for what we just saw. The audience is left to wonder if the show will ever give context for this scene, creating interest and investment in what\u2019s happening. The show just exploited this broken method of thinking to make us care about the series. This is in addition to the \u201cWe have fanservice, Fuck off if you don\u2019t like it\u201d tone the initial shot created. \\n\\n\r\nThe show didn\u2019t have to use this scene for the opening shot. It\u2019s from a completely different source material, and while it is an important scene, without context it should come off as dumb. And yet Shaft chose to do it because they knew that it was a great way to tell the audience what kind of show It was as quickly as possible. They pulled it off effortlessly, allowing me to feel smart about getting to see some knickers.\\n\\n\r\nLet that sink in.\\n\\n\r\nI CAN FEEL SMART ABOUT GETTING TO SEE SOME KNICKERS!!!\\n\\n\r\nNo other series would do this, because usually when they do, they get the forgettable mess that was Strike the Blood\u2019s opening scene.\\n\r\nBoth scenes tell you more than enough about the personality of each of the shows, which is great. I want to find out more about the world of Bake. I know that whether or not I like the 20 minutes that are to follow, I\u2019ll have a completely unique experience. I want to find out what exactly that experience is. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care about what happens next in Strike the Blood 2 since it\u2019s made no effort to make me care. I have no faith in the quality of the show since they\u2019ve completely failed to make me feel invested in what happens. I would probably drop the show if I didn\u2019t already have some stupid connection to the series in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the main difference between good and bad fanservice. While Bake used it to add to the atmosphere, and later on even use it as the crux of a relationship, Strike the Blood for the most part, feels like it had fanservice for the sake of having fanservice. Which is especially odd considering how its premise should actually make the fanservice feel more important than in Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s a discussion for a different video, which should be coming out soon. Emphasis on video. This is the script for a video that got taken down from my youtube channel. I figured that I\u2019d post it here in case anybody wanted to at least read it. If this is the first time you\u2019ve heard of my channel, feel free to watch some of my videos.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be having a more in-depth comparison between Strike the Blood and Bakemonogatari over the next couple of weeks, so if that piques your interest than go ahead and subscribe to make me feel somewhat important to someone somewhere maybe. (Also to stay updated on when those come out)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjH403VYBT6ah4dyPcMmBdg\\n",

            "content": "It's overwhelming that Bakemonogatari has turned amazingly popular over the years. Sure, we got the general harem that broke over 10k sales every now and then but Bakemonogatari was the first time it got a massive wide appeal. And as far as harem goes there generally is no better alternative Bakemonogatari. The 5 arcs each have an interesting story to follow through each week. Every new girl, whether it be Senjougahara's playful attitude, or Tsubasa's transformation, are great to watch in action at first glance.\r\nNow, listen up, because I want to make this straight up front. Nisio Isin, comparing to other writers in this industry,can write extremely well when he wants too. That's the drawback though, he doesn't want to. While watching various scenes in Bakemonogatari his writing jumps the shark and his jokes, if he wants to consider them that, completely falls flat. Half of the time it feels like he is showing off and is targeting only for people already into anime. These type of jokes have no effect on me, and often can leave someone scratching their head if they aren't deep into the culture. A major offender for me is that most of the time the characters he comes up with have no impact on Araragi's life. This leaves for most of the time a lot of disappointing arcs. (And one that should have been completely scrapped.)\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, it also leaves an impression that Shaft is also at fault here. This can't be confirmed though because I haven't seen any of the other anime Shaft has produced. That's not an excuse for Shaft though, because their visuals half of the time they are on the same big joke. It feels like Shinbou and Nisio are holding side by side, drinking and thinking they are having a really good time. When in reality the viewer on the outside is watching a mess. Their so called prose and directing often damage the product more than it should be.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame too, because many of the characters have some excellent scenes chocked full of tremendous dialogue. Hitagi Senjougahara and Araragi Koyomi bickering back and forth made it seem like they were really in a relationship. Senjougahara herself is an absolute treat to watch, and seeing Araragis reaction as the straight man played off very well. Another well-done scene that showed Nisio Isin range is Araragi fighting with Mayoi Hachikuji. When Araragi declares that he has beaten up Mayoi and feels bad about it, you can't help but leave a chuckle at it. If I had to pick one standout point, and this is why I would recommend this episode, would be episode 12. The climax on Senjougahara and Araragi's relationship is brilliantly done. Their story wraps up very nicely to the point that I felt like crying.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I feel like Bakemonogatari indeed does deserve a watch, even though all of my harsh words on the series. It's rare that you can see few seconds of dialogue so good. Not really many anime can compare to what Nisio can write. It's just a shame of what it could have been.\\n",

            "content": "I've been waiting a while to watch this anime, but was a little reluctant to see it until I found my self with nothing better to do than watch an anime.\r\nStory/Character:\r\nThe story is about a guy named Koyomi Araragi who had survived a vampire attack and is now immortal and gets involved with some weird shit that happens, there's other stuff but I'll let you guys watch the show to see for your selves. Bakemonogatari is one of the those shows that relies on it's characters and it's dialog, there really isn't a whole lot of action in this series and if you don't liketo sit and watch two people talk about stuff for 10 minutes at a time then you may not like this series because it's dialog heavy nature is it's biggest turn off, however the dialog isn't particularly bad, it's actually rather entertaining as it's coupled with with some acid trip like art and animation; if you have time to look up at the screen that is. The story is kind of like a harem I guess but not nearly as cheesy and cliche in my opinion. Koyomi doesn't come off as a typical boring character like in other harems and actually manages to have a personality and as for the female lead there is Hitagi Senjougahara who is a self proclaimed tsundere but doesn't really act like, I mean some times she's a bitch but other times she's pretty nice and likable. \\n\r\nOne thing that I could complain about in terms of story is how Koyomi's vampire attack is sort of shrouded in mystery and it's not made entirely clear what the the hell happened and it just seems like a piece of missing information to me.\\n\r\nAll in all the story and characters were pretty well done but there are more characters that I could mention but I don't want to spoil anything so I just keep it at this for now.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is kind of like if you were on acid or something but in a good way. This show has a tone of dialog in it but I would call it a talking head show where the characters are just standing around and talking, even though they actually are  the art and animation makes the dialog entertaining. I found my self in a struggle between looking at subtitles and looking up at what was going on; on the the screen.\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it was really good and it worked well with the animation the opening songs witch they used for each story arc were great but I think the ending song that they used was one of the best I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSub:\\n\r\nThere is no English at the time of this review and considering that if you don't like reading a lot, I would not suggest watching this.\\n\r\nNormaly I don't have the most positive opinion of subbed anime, I'm very picky and I think most anime sounds the same in japanese and watching nothing but subbed anime is kind of boring, but Bakemonogatari is an exception, not because I could only watch it subbed but because I actually enjoyed it. For me the japanese voice acting for this actually stands out as being good, even though I don't speak japanese so take this with a grain of salt. The anime although being dialog heavy was pretty straight forward which made it a little easier to watch subbed and there wasn't dull moment where I was completely stumped for what was going on.\\n\r\nWith that said, really enjoyed watching this subbed and this is defiantly the one of the elite few anime that I thought was genuinely good.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI rate this anime an 8/10 though I know it's not for everyone so keep that in mind.",

            "content": "In the year 2009, the otakudom was shaken by a certain creation of Studio Shaft, produced under the helm of one Akiyuki Shinbo. By now, Shaft has become famous as a powerhouse of experimentation and innovation in contemporary anime industry, and Shinbo's career has skyrocketed since then. While their tendency to deploy eccentric and experimental visual styles in whatever material they touched was established many years prior to its release, it was Bakemonogatari that launched them into the mainstream, serving as an important milestone and a valuable lesson for the studio and its most prominent director. Experiences gained and lessons learned during the making ofthis series ( as well as the huge pile of money it generated, it has to be said! ) were put to good use by Shaft and Shinbo, and eventually resulted in their ( as of yet ) crowning achievement, the 2011 masterpiece Madoka Magica. But does this important work live up to all the enormous hype its ardent fans generated?\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a difficult series to describe, at least when it comes to classifying it by genre or trying to explain what it's about, but there *is* one fitting label for it: avant-garde. While the label itself is predominantly used to denote the modernist works of fine arts, literature and film from the first half of the 20th century, it is still widely used by both the critics and general populace to describe the more experimental contemporary works in various media, and rightly so. After all, \u201cavant-garde\u201c means \u201cvanguard\u201c; it's a term used to refer to people or works that are experimental or innovative, particularly with respect to art, culture and politics. It represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the norm or the status quo, primarily in the cultural realm, and Bakemonogatari matches this definition in virtually every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe first obstacle one will encounter when trying to recommend or review the series is trying to explain or summarise the plot. This is because there is virtually no plot to speak of. The summary given here on MAL is very short, and potentially misleading. While the main character does indeed find himself surrounded by various supernatural apparitions and creatures, Bakemonogatari is not a supernatural-mystery/thriller/action series at all, certainly not in the usual sense. Saying that the plot is minimalistic would be a severe understatement.\\n\r\nThe story is split into several arcs, lasting from two to five episodes, each of them revolving around a supporting character who has a problem of other-worldly nature, and how the main character helps them get rid of a supernatural being possessing and troubling them. However, the resolutions to these cases and problems aren\u2019t achieved in the \u201ctraditional\u201c way associated with the supernatural mystery genre, i.e. by finding clues, acquiring some ancient legendary magical artifacts or casting complicated unholy spells. There is something resembling this, but in fact, 90% of this show consists of characters talking. And talking. And talking. And then, if they feel tired of talking, they talk some more. Seriously, compared to Bakemonogatari, Death Note looks like a silent film(!). But while this description might seem negative, the endless dialogue in this series is certainly not dull or stupid, even if it is just a bunch of nonsense. Basically, the dialogue in Bakemonogatari is what you'd get if you took a stream-of-thought approach and then just turned all that monologue into dialogue. Random, nonsensical, aimless, confusing... there's no end to synonyms that can be used to describe the dialogue in this series, for it's basically people bullshiting for 15 whole episodes, and yet, it is probably the most engaging and witty bullshit you'll ever hear. It's filled with countless word plays, puns, Japanese pop-culture references ( for example, a DBZ joke ) and the series can amaze the viewer with the sheer wit and cleverness of its script. By now you are already getting the idea where the \u201cavant-garde\u201cprimarily lies in the series. It breaks numerous conventions of story-telling, and there is little point in me trying to further describe the \u201cplot\u201d, simply because Bakemonogatari is so different. \\n\\n\r\nObviously,  this unusual nature of the story means it's definitely not suited for everyone and is more of an aquired taste. Not everyone will be amused by the endless nonsense the characters spout, even if it is witty and humourous, and while I'm presenting it in a positive light, Bakemonogatari is not all brilliant and ingenious in its unconventionality.\\n\r\nAs cleverly written and engaging as it is, the story can take a lot of strain on the viewer, as some of the conversations drag on for the length of an entire episode with no change of setting or inclusion of additional characters. Some of the jokes and gags get repetitive too.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the actual explanations and resolutions to the supernatural problems are incredibly tedious and uninteresting, and are spouted more or less text-book style by a particular character in a single scene towards the end of an arc. Whether the supernatural background of the series is actual Japanese spiritual mythology or just something that Nisioisin ( the author of the light novels that the series was based on ) made up all by himself is not important, as the explanations are there just to resolve the \u201cplot\u201c and conclude the arc, and it's probably the last thing the viewer is interested in.\\n\\n\r\nThe complete focus on the dialogue over the plot or deeper themes requires the show to field a satisfying cast of characters, and Bakemonogatari does achieve this, but only to an extent, for the aimless dialogue that permeates every pore of the story and the mini-arc format of the \u201cplot\u201d don't come without repercussions.\\n\r\nThe cast of Bakemonogatari is basically a harem ( one guy + a bunch of girls that he interacts with ), only with sex being replaced with the never-ending dialogue. Not that there\u2019s an absence of fanservice, but I\u2019ll talk about that later. \\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Koyomi Arararagi spends his days wandering aimlessly, not caring about the upcoming finals, picking his nose and minding his own business. That is, when he\u2019s not busy helping a bunch of girls with their weird problems brought on by various supernatural monsters and apparitions. Also, during his interactions with these girls he never misses an opportunity to take a peek at their breasts or panties or more, depending on what\u2019s on the menu. He\u2019s an OK character, interesting to watch as he switches between being a normal absent-minded teenager, to becoming an over-excited sod, to a creepy child-molester who gropes and fights a 10-years old girl for no adequately explored reason. And I\u2019m not even kidding.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is a bunch of archetypes; girls that serve as baits for different factions of the otaku community and can range from a tsundere, to a slightly nymphomaniac lesbian, to a neko-girl. They aren\u2019t cardboard cut-outs, though, and have as much personalities as their types allow them to develop, with the main star being Senjougahara Hitagi, the heroine of the first arc, the most recurring character of the cast ( apart from Arararagi, naturally ) and the fan favourite. \\n\r\nSenjougahara\u2019s sharp tongue and interesting personality make her by far the best character of the entire cast, and her interactions with Araragi make some of the greatest moments in the entire series. She\u2019s funny, she\u2019s sarcastic, and can come across as sweet, witty and as a crazy psycho-bitch in a space of two minutes. Though I have to say I was personally disappointed with the direction her character development takes over the course of the series, as she becomes more an more normal.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, again, and as previously stated, the avant-garde nature of the story takes its toll on the character development. The nonsensical content of the dialogue means that almost none of the characters comes across as being natural or realistic, except for maybe Araragi. The sheer aimlessness of the bullshit the character spew means the word \u201cpersonality\u201c cannot be used in describing character development in its conventional sense. The dialogue present in the series is not how people talk, not even when high, and therefore the characters aren't real, believable people. Not to mention that they are very underdeveloped considering the amount of dialogue exchanged between them \u2013 again, because of the content of their dialogue.\\n\r\nAnother problem with character development comes from the format of the story. As each arc is centred around a different girl, the characters from the previous ones get left behind in a routine manner, usually not to be heard or seen again, which severely limits the potential for their development. The exception to this is, apart from the protagonist, Senjougahara, whose appearance over the course of the series constantly steals the show every second she's on screen, which is in this case bad - both for the other characters as they lose the spotlight, but for the audience as well, as we want to see more of Senjougahara but the show won't let us.\\n\r\nThere's also one character who is merely a convenient plot-device with the sole purpose to resolve the supernatural cases at the end of each arc. He also drags the quality of the cast down.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the eccentric dialogue, the art style and cinematography of Bakemonogatari are very distinctive and different, however, they are every bit as mixed or \u201chit-or-miss\u201d as the aforementioned dialogue.\\n\r\nWhether it was because the series is based on a novel, or in order to save money they didn\u2019t have, Shaft added a strange feature to the visuals of Bakemonogatari - still, monochromatic images with some little text on them, which are flashed constantly over the course of the entire series. While they can appear at any given time, they are mostly used at the very beginning of each episode and in short pauses between the endless talking. Occasionally, these images hold a more substantial amount of text, but none of them last longer than a fraction of a second, which can irritate the viewer seeing as you don't know whether the text was crucial to the story, and have no time to read it as it goes. \\n\r\nThis, combined with the fact that during most conversations the camera switches angles every half a second ( probably in fear that you'll fall asleep from all the talking if it doesn't occupy your eyes *somehow* ), can make for a very tiresome and exhaustive viewing experience, and many a viewer was put off by this strange and seizure-inducing editing. \\n\r\nWhile on the subject of camera angles, I should mention one other aspect of Bakemonogatari that also stands apart from its more conventional counterparts, and that is the fanservice. Maybe in a yet another attempt to keep your attention amidst the endless stream of words, or because this series is just one big otaku party, the show goes way out of its way to position the camera in the most provocative angle possible when showing any of the female members of the cast. Such practice is nothing new for gratuitous anime series, but the nonchalant way in which it is carried out is what\u2019s distinctive about Bakemonogatari\u2019s fanservice. It\u2019s as if to say: \u201cOh, you find this image sexually suggestive? The angle is provocative? Huh. I didn\u2019t notice\u201d. Scenes of ( almost ) full female nudity come out of the blue so suddenly and unexpectedly you\u2019ll be just as taken a back as Araragi. Boobs and bottoms are flashed out while their owners don\u2019t seem to notice it at all or find their provocative behaviour strange or unusual in the slightest. Indeed, the fanservice of this particular kind is hard to find elsewhere.\\n\r\nAs for the art itself, I\u2019ll just briefly say that, while highly detailed and very colourful, it always felt a bit empty to me, particularly the outdoor scenes and settings.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, like the plot, is virtually non-existent, opening themes aside. This is completely understandable considering that 90% of the show is composed of dynamic and engaging dialogue \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want the music to distract you from the witty puns and references that are exchanged at the rate of over 9000 words per minute. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is therefore extremely minimalistic, rarely employing more than a single instrument per track and none of them being stand-alone numbers. It is also very quirky, utilising mostly electronic instruments and synthetic sounds to punctuate the dialogue. Music\u2019s role in the series is minimal and is completely subservient to the visuals and the character interaction, but it accomplishes its small supporting task adequately.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nNow, while I have sung many a song of praise for Bakemonogatari and its experimental and unconventional nature, there are still many people who will disagree with me, mostly because they didn\u2019t enjoy it. Likewise, the fans will probably disagree with me on issues of character development or visuals, saying that I\u2019m being picky and criticising the show with little basis or consideration. Both groups would be wrong about my opinion on the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of this review, I mentioned that Bakemonogatari was a test, an experiment that the studio Shaft used to learn lessons that eventually resulted in the creation of Madoka Magica. This observation and comparison is included in the review because Bakemonogatari is not a universally acclaimed series, despite its immense popularity \u2013 there is no shortage of anime fans calling it overrated or mediocre, and I\u2019d like to create a bridge between the two opposing views by offering a new perspective on its eccentricity.\\n\r\nBoth the fanatic admirers of the series and the... khm, \u201cless enthusiastic\u201d people, as well as the moderates between them seem to miss a point when thinking and talking about the series, and it is this oversight that results in people failing to give credit to Bakemonogatari where it\u2019s due, or giving the credit but for the wrong reasons. \\n\r\nThere was another term I used to describe this show - \u201cavant-garde\u201c, which means experimenting, and this is what Bakemonogatari ultimately is \u2013 an experiment, testing ground, and to properly appreciate it, you have to view it as such. \\n\r\nTo see and rate it not at its face value and judge it by the established rules of the medium, but as a work that toys with elements and pushes the envelope so that it can explore things better, find its own conclusions and lessons through this experimenting, so that latter something more meaningful can be created.\\n\r\nI'm writing this to show that Bakemonogatari, the experiment, would be somewhat less worthy without its successor, its higher purpose \u2013 Madoka Magica. Naturally, this view was impossible to hold for those who watched it when it first came out or over the next year or so, because Madoka Magica wasn't created yet, but I have the advantage of viewing it in retrospect and applying adequate perspective and needed context to review it in as objective light as possible. Yes, Bakemonogatari still manages to stand on its own, but with this perspective its artistic quality is considerably raised and the show can be viewed in a whole new light. This bold experiment with the traditional art styles and cinematography paved the way for Shaft and Shinbo to take an even greater risk than adapting a quirky and unusual light novel, and create a completely original anime creation, in which they used all that was best about Bakemonogatari's style and discarded the parts that \u201cmissed\u201d.\\n\r\nIt is in this way that I appreciate Bakemonogatari the most; not so much as an entertaining display of wit, sarcasm and humour, but as a work that pushes the envelope of artistic visual expression in an animated medium, and paves the way for greater works to come. It is much more interesting for me as a critic to observe how a director and a studio mature in their artistic expression and apply their experiences and lessons in their future works, than listening to a conversation about bugger all, regardless of how sarcastic and funny the main heroine is.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nTime for me to pass my final judgement on Bakemonogatari. Overhyped by its considerable cult of enthusiastic fans, and at the same time underestimated by the number of people who didn't manage to enjoy it due to its very quirky nature, Bakermonogatari is certainly unconventional, and I'd confidently put it in the company of such shows as the Excel Saga, FLCL and Lucky Star..\\n\r\nWhile the fans say it establishes a completely new genre of its own, I'd challenge that on the basis of Bakemonogatari having very little actual substance to even categorise it as any kind of a genre. A combination of different existing genres ( like supernatural mystery and harem ) makes it a post-modernist creation, while the nature of the writing and visuals earn it a title of an avant-garde work. It doesn't feature \u201camazing character development, thought-provoking themes... deep symbolism\u201c as the loyal followers claim; its artistic qualities lie elsewhere, but it still does possess many qualities. It's certainly not a show for everyone, and not a must-see, but it's nevertheless an important work that should be properly appreciated. Unfortunately, the complete lack of substance means I cannot rate it higher than 7,5/10.\\n",

            "content": "\"Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?\" ~ Senjougahara Hitagi\r\nI went into this anime with nothing but the expectations of an ecchi show that had a lot of dialogue, but I completely underestimated this show. Before watching this show, I heard it was a terrible show for newcomers, so I kept putting it off despite being interested in it. I'm not sure if that was necessarily a bad thing, but I do understand the reasoning for that warning. I'd also agree that if you are new to anime, or don't like subtitles, stay away from this show. Now, forthose of you are who are still interested, let's get onto the review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY~\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is pretty straight forward. It's about a guy named Koyomi Araragi that helps various girls seek help for their mythological and fantastical problems from a Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named Oshino Meme. Some of these problems may include having a traditional Japanese mythological being trapped inside of them. The story is split up into 2-5 episode arcs, each dedicated to the particular girl. Going through the anime, it was similar to a harem, but at the same time it wasn't. Each arc was very interesting and engaging. Some of the mythology doesn't translate well, but there are brief explanations. If you wish to know more, you can always look that up but it isn't necessary to understand the story. Overall, the storytelling is actually really interesting despite the Japanese Cultural references. Each arc is well done and concludes satisfactory. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART~\\n\r\nThis anime was done by Studio Shaft, known for their unique animation style in the popular \"Madoka Magica.\" If you've seen Madoka Magica, then you probably know to expect solid animation, and Bakemonogatari is no exception. It has a really unique style and includes flashing frames of dialogue (taken from the Light Novel of which it is based), a montage of quickly changing images of the setting and bright colors. All of these elements combined with fluid animation sequences makes the show very appealing to the eye (Of course, only when you aren't reading paragraphs of dialogue). It really shines with the few action scenes and the amazing backgrounds at night. I also like the inclusion of widescreen scenes (21:9 aspect ratio) that makes the show seem more like a modern film masterpiece. There were also times where i was able to take a screenshot and make it my wallpaper on my computer. It's very high quality and should be watched in 1080p or Blu-ray Quality to get the best experience. Overall, the art in the show is definitely amazing compared to other shows from this time. the only negative here is that it's hard to appreciate it when you're reading a lot of subtitles. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND~\\n\r\nWith a series with so much dialogue, the Voice actors in this series really brought their best. All of the roles were well casted and they did an excellent job conveying the characters emotions. As for the music, it was remarkable. This is the first time I have seen a show with an OST this good. All the songs were well placed and helped amplify the scene. The Openings for Bakemonogatari were equally good or better than the rest of the OST. Special mention to \"Staple Staple\" (Hitagi crab, OP1) and \"Sugar Sweet Nightmare\" (Tsubasa Cat, OP5) for being the standout openings in the series. Overall, the sound doesn't sacrifice any quality compared to the rest of the series and will not dissapoint. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS~\\n\r\nWith a show centered around character interactions, Bakemonogatari really shines here. All the characters are well written and have unique and distinct personalities and traits. For example, Koyomi Araragi has a single strand of hair standing up on his hair that is used to convey his reactions to the situation, instead of his face. This was well done in order to show extreme emotions without directly stating it. Each of the characters introduced are given equal screen time are given ample amount of time for development. Overall, the characters in this series are excellent and are well to allow for the lengthy dialogue sequences to develop them further. Some of the most meaningless conversations in the series give the characters depth and make them to seem like real people. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nNow for my bias to show. I really loved this anime, if it wasn't already apparent. I found Bakemonogatari to be really unique in what it was trying to do and I loved every second. Despite the lengthy conversations that would sometimes leave me bored, I found them realistic and well thought out. I also loved the exciting action sequences that provided an excellent change in pace for the show and always got me excited. This show provides a really interesting story about mythological creatures that cause issues for beautiful girls. As a fan of both, this was an enjoyable show to watch and provided a fresh look on anime as an art form.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL~\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a really unique show that excels in each of these categories. Because of this, it has become one of my favorite shows and left me immediately knowing that it is a masterpiece. Watching each episode was like watching a passionate writer pour his thoughts onto a page while an amazing soundtrack quietly played in the background. Bakemonogatari exceeded my expectations by quite a bit, and made me appreciate what the creators were doing. Bakemonogatari is a rare gem that should be appreciated by everyone at one point in their \"anime viewing career.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Right now, I'm afraid of losing you...\\n\\n\r\n Although my life hasn't been very fortunate until now, I'm glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune.\\n\r\n Because of that, I was able to fall for you.\\n\r\n So we'll definitely do something, but I want to wait just a bit.\\n\r\n So, right now, the last thing I can offer you...\\n\r\n Is this starry sky.\"\\n\r\n~Senjougahara Hitagi",

In these arcs, the main character, Araragi Koyomi solve a lot of sobrenatural problems, called \"oddities\", each one being unique, and somewhat a good representation of japanese myths.\r\nA good point I would like to call Monogatari for is their good explanation of all the sobrenatural events presented in the series, which are also valid for Bakemonogatari.\r\nAnother relevant thing aboutBakemonogatari is how they develop the characters and set up previous or incoming events on the series. The major example of that would be the Tsubasa Cat arc, which helps setting up Hanekawa's character for Nekomonogatari:Kuro and Shiro.\\n\r\nAs this show is mainly focused on dialogue, I would say that it isn't for people who are searching for an action show or are too impatient for story progress.\\n\r\nBut, if you want to start watching the Monogatari series, I highly recommend you start for this show and have fun.\\n\\n",

I admit, it's visually pleasing for the eyes for the most part. However, the way they laid out the story is just uncomfortably boring and LOOOONG. There are way to many pointless conversations and unnecessary fan service. The parts where he would freak out or become terrified, or however you look at it, were exaggerated. The fight scenes were short lived and either ridiculously comedic or just plain boring. The story sounds very interesting but the way they bring it out isn't worth my time. Ican't push myself to watch the others because of the fact that they are all the same. There is no real development from what I have read in summaries and I just don't care.

            "content": "I'll admit my bias right up front. This is my second favorite series (Second only to Welcome to the NHK), so I'm going to be very impartial in my views. However, I think I can come to a compromise with this review by stating that this show isn't for everyone. Thus, I'll keep it simple in \"what you should like\" and \"what might turn you off\".\r\nWhat you should like: \r\nFirst and foremost, you must like reading or listening to the dialogue. There is no way around this. The story can be at a very crucial moment where you feel tensions should be at their highest,and yet you'll have two characters bullshitting about definitions for shit that doesn't matter. If you don't like heavy dialogue, this series will turn you off very fast. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, while the series is generally regarded as beautiful, you will need to enjoy the art style as well. I've watched each season and arc of the different Monogatari series's. With the exception of the Kizumonogatari movies, there are no changes at all in art style. It's a very bright, colorful, and surreal style that draws attention to how Araragi perceives the world and also shows the \"isolation\" he feels besides those he cares about. The art is thematically relevant, and often you'll see Araragi and a classmate talking in what should be an obviously busy area with no one around. This is intentional as the idea of the series is that a \"story\" is being told, so background characters/people would not be brought up in the discussion. Liking this is relevant to a point in the next section, which I'll start off with.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat might turn you off: \\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't perceive the series this way at all, it's very easy to feel like Bakemonogatari is trying to be pretentious. It seems to be making fun by calling itself out on what it does, like it's making some witty comeback while winking at you. While it might seem this way, it's really just making fun of itself. If you don't like self-referencing/deprecating jokes in a series, it could be that you also just don't enjoy it's \"deconstruction\" tones. I know that word is kind of a meme at this point, however I've seen the words \"harem deconstruction\" used more than once for the Monogatari series. I'd be hard pressed to disagree, as often satire is the best form of flattery. Subsequently, true satire is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. \\n\\n\r\nAs a second point: to be honest the amount of fanservice in the series overall might turn you off. It's used almost as a juxtaposition where you'll have a bathing scene flashing before your eyes, yet really intense and thought-provoking dialogue going on simultaneously. The music generally aids in this endeavor by giving you feelings often counter to what the scene looks like. However, it can get gratuitous in later seasons and arcs. If this is something that you just can't stand on it's own, whether it serves a purpose or not, avoid this show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel I'm talking up my own ass, feel free to let me know. I thoroughly enjoy the depth and layers to this series, and as the seasons moved on my investment kept giving me greater returns.",

            "content": "Anime is an artistic medium. This is quite easy to forget, as the amount of battle shonen series, shojo romances, fanservice comedies and...other things all have a tendency to swamp anime fans' viewing habits.\r\nWhen anime tries to be this shining example of art, some people, not knowing any better, would label it as pretentious and other words to that effect.\r\nTruth be told, I like anime done this way, being all experimental with its visual appearance.\r\nNow let's get down to reviewing this beast. To begin with, the animation is honestly a marvel. I can easily say in terms pure quality of design, it rivals that ofNichijou and the Ghibli canon.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is our cast of characters. In Bakemonogatari, we're introduced to Koyomi Araragi and his not-quite-a-harem of troubled females. He's a decent lead character, likable in spades, even after you consider his quirks.\\n\\n\r\nThe not-quite-harem is interesting too, especially when you take into account that one girl (trust me, watch the first 2 episodes and you'll know who i mean) who is one of the most interesting anime characters i've ever come across.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also enjoyable, never being overly dramatic, but always catchy enough to stay in your head for quite a while. I will have to mention the various opening themes, as their lyrics provide an insight to each character.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I believe this is the type of thing anime really exists for. The insights to each character are well thought out, and the whole thing just feels satisfying at its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more to this series, and even though this chapter ends on a high note, you'll be back for more if you enjoyed it.",

In simple terms, the plot boils down to 'Normal people's everyday problems, personified into animistic-like tendencies'. The first couple of episode threw me off because things happen and are not explain like the existence of vampires, demons, devils, supernatural  phenomenons, and unusual powers   exc. They are just there(never explained why) and the characters seem to know what they are and assume the viewer are get it. Combined with Shaft's out of this world animation style and music, made bakemonogatari incoherent, and difficult to follow.The anime plays out in a way where the 15 episodes is chopped up into four arcs, and in each arc a certain charatcer is focused on by the main characters. Though if you can see past the funky animation and story-telling, you will experience comical, romantic, dramatic, and psychological feats of anime that bakemonogatari has offer.",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nOK first thoughts, Uh, what just happened? As the closing credits rolled on the last episode that was the exact thought I had. I felt like I had just been subjected to some sort of wild carnival ride after having had one too many corn-dogs! It was Intense! At the risk of possibly scaring off other viewers, this anime will require you to commit a much higher level of thought and attention, possibly over more than one viewing of an episode or even the entire series to get the most out of the show. I don\u2019t think most of the concepts presented are that difficultto grasp in and of themselves, rather it\u2019s the rapid fire delivery and or subtle meaning in a piece of dialog that will baffle or just blow right past a lot of folks. Oh yeah, and there is a lot of dialog. Even so I think this is one of those anime that is probably better in the original Japanese with subtitles.\\n\\n\r\nSub-categories\\n\r\nPlot/Story: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this series is, in a word, complex and as a result is simply not going to appeal to some. I watched this story for the first time about two years ago and then again several months ago but only recently decided to write a review after having a good \u201cthink\u201d about it. I can say that I found this show to be one of the most cerebral stories I have come across in recent years. And while the dialog is sometimes convoluted, for the most part I thought it was witty, humorous, however as stated above you may have to watch it more than once to get it if you happen to lose focus. As such I do not recommend trying to marathon this one unless you really like being confused. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 8 \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment of the characters starts out a little vague but as the story progresses you do get more and more of a sense of the motivations behind the actions of each person. The story manages to give you enough of an idea while maintaining a sense of mystery, though at times you may miss a clue and have to backtrack due to the ever present \u201cwait, what?!\u201d factor. In my opinion it is the sheer preponderance of dialogue that does this. Throw in a liberal amount of repartee, \u201cseemingly\u201d obtuse comments, and flat out silly remarks and you had better bring your \u201cA-game\u201d. For me though this actually helped with my focus, but then again I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m weird all my life and I\u2019m starting to believe it. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Sound track: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThough I did not at first realize it this anime has really good background music and sound efx, both of which set the tone for each scene and complement the action well. The musical accompaniment was very, I don\u2019t know, I guess minimal is the best description I can think of. There aren\u2019t any songs save for the opening and closing numbers, just short little musical \u201cpoems\u201d that perfectly capture the essence of each scene, enhancing it without being distracting.  I found the subtle but powerful sound work (both the efx and musical accompaniment) to be very good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art-work is top-notch and I think lives up to its hype without any reservations. In my opinion it\u2019s flat out gorgeous! That combined with the sound made this truly a pleasure to view. And I think that is another reason why this series may not appeal to some. It may be just too much of an assault on the senses for many to deal with while trying to absorb the basic story from the subtitles. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nI thought this was a great series, period. It\u2019s weird and quirky and funny and sad and more than a little thought provoking. I found it enjoyable on a lot more levels than many of the series I\u2019ve seen lately. I even liked the occasional bit of fanservice that popped up. I know I\u2019m going to get flak for this but to me it actually made sense in a lot of places whether it was just to titillate or to provoke or to give you some additional insight into a characters personality. Yeah I hear the bullshit coughs out there but consider this for an example, in the opening scene of \u201cHitagi Crab part two\u201d as we see Senj\u014dgahara showering in preparation for the exorcism later that evening there are random flashes of her nude form, at one point she even playfully smacks her butt cheek and there is what appears to be a shot of her nipple pressed on the glass of the shower. Now many will say \u201coh that wasn\u2019t needed\u201d but consider this, for someone who is as private and antagonistic as she has shown herself to be up to this point in the story the fact that she is comfortable enough to not only allow Araragi to be present in her very small apartment but while she is actually taking a shower, and that she chooses to relate a very personal story while she is in such a vulnerable state suggests to me that she is very comfortable with him. I think this is borne out by other instances of her confiding various facts and exhibiting other behaviors, some deliberate but many seemingly unconscious, that point to her innate comfort level with this boy who she really just met.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nAll of that having been said, please do not take any of the previous to mean that you should not give this one a go, quite the opposite. It's just that unlike a lot of other anime out there, you had better be prepared to really focus you when you cue it up, or it is liable to leave you in the dust. I think if you do that and don\u2019t go in with too many preconceived notions you should find it enjoyable.\\n",

The only difference is that Itoshiki is now no longer depressed and is a eager-to-help highschool student instead of a pessimistic teacher.\r\nSeriously though, it's as if someone just slapped a different sticker on SZS and said \"Hey! This is a new series that we've made!\". Of course it was easy to predict. Both series were made by the same studio, although in the case of Bakemonogatari aniplex was helping out too. But that doesn't change the fact that the overal feel is the same, the main character in this anime thinks and acts in practically the same wayas the main character in SZS. I'm sure that if you watch this anime first then you'll most likely enjoy it (since I enjoyed SZS) but for me this is nothing more than a repetition of something that has already been done in the past by the same bloody studio. It's like scraping off the logo off a BMW, repainting it and saying it's a Volkswagen. It's bound to fail in the worst imaginable way. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same, however Itoshiki is now called Araragi and the girls have gotten even weirder. Instead of sticking sticks in animal anuses they're now messing around with invisible crabs and twice-as-long-as-anaconda snakes. But the overall weirdness and epic love triangles and sexual innuendos are still there. However, instead of accidentaly rolling into a girl's bed, Itoshiki... ops sorry Araragi is now resorting to more agressive tactics. Say... like groping a 10 year old girl on a playground? \\n\\n\r\nArt is not similar. It's the SAME. Same weird censure here and there, same witty jokes written all over the fricking place and changing so rapidly you'd have to have the agility of a fly to read them, not to mention that an IQ of at least a thousand would help to actually understand them too (translation or not). \\n\\n\r\nUnlike in SZS, the sound in this series is so amazingly average I even failed to notice it at all. I thought that the whole series was actually silent, devoid of any kind of sounds whatsoever. I turned up the volume but all I could hear was the truck outside my window which came to collect the rubbish. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I seriously didn't get any. Bakemonogatari is just a poorer version of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. 5 points.\\n\\n\\n",

For those who like supernatural anime or anime with a great story this is a great anime.\r\nStory: The story in this anime/series has a very in depth story and it is told in depth little by little so the viewer will understand why things are happening. As you watch more you have those \"Oh I remember when they talked about this\" or \"Now I get why they act this way. This makes you want to watch more purelyfor the story.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Bakemonogatari uses a unique art style to tell the story of the anime. The characters look good and so do the backgrounds. They also use images between animation to show how characters are feeling and what is happening. If you don't understand what I mean just watch the first episode.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is interesting to say the least. It uses piano and some synths to tell how intense a situation is. The voice acting is also done well in this anime, although sometimes it is hard to tell what the characters are feeling just through the voice.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters of Bakemonogatari all have unique personalities with in-depth back stories. This makes you interested in getting to know that characters and such.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed Bakemonogari and think that if you haven't seen the Monogatari series you should give it a try. It is definitely a great watch. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an anime you have to go into where you can't just 'watch'. You've got to pay attention, and that's one of the things that makes it so endearing. The characters are well rounded, but still hold mystery, the art style is wonderful- switching between styles for either comedic, artistic, or referential effect, and the presentation of the material takes en-medias-res to its zenith. The biggest thing that could be called a negative, the quickly transitioning screens with pertinent information, is also mostly covered (in my opinion, a bit cheekily) by being an artistic statement (noting that the source material is a light novel,and that the information is a fleeting dalliance while maintaining it's importance). \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing you would think impossible, is that throughout the series, every single character is shown to be equally important in the mythos as a whole. Being referenced later based on the chronological order of the books, despite the fact that they may not have been covered or even mentioned. It was a wise choice to release Nisemonogatari as an animated movie last, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of light novels, but I was so intrigued by what happened on this spring break that I powered through the whole thing in a half a day. Think about that: this is a medium that forced me to experience it through an entirely different medium, and lost absolutely none of its appeal. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the last things that I like about the series is that it completely dehumanizes anyone who isn't an important character. Parents of the high school/junior high students are hardly acknowledged, even when playing large roles in their childs life. Passerby aren't drawn in so much as given an outline with a splash of color and a kanji. It shows how isolated the characters are in their own story, and how isolated the apparitions have made them. Even the Fire Sisters who do socialize and keep the peace, so to speak, are never shown doing so, and never bring it up in conversation beyond vaugities.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that conversations tend to take circuitous routes that none of the ages represented would establish, but at the same time, further add to the feeling that the characters live in a little bubble world away from us boring people. And really, a story about interesting people is what we're here for, not the boring world they can't interact with. If I was that interesting, I wouldn't want to interact with the normal world either.\\n\\n\r\nSo long story short: fantastic story building, story structure, ideal-yet flawed and human-characters, and a great experience overall.",

            "content": "God I love Shinbou Akiyuki and Nishio Ishin. The first one as a director, for the way he has to film sequences, the beauty of each scene, the vertigo sensation everytime, even in dialogs moments. And the second one as a writer, because he's an incredible author. Father of my favorite show ( Katanagatari ) his dialogs are unrealistic, funny and often stupid by the way. Maybe he's a genius who's criticizing the brand new anime community in placing lots of nonsense in his writtings, maybe he's just a moran, good at makes weebs production, I don't know. But what I know is that thesetwo guys really fit well together, do they ? Both of them are the fathers of what we're talking about, the well known Bakemonogatari, part of a long saga. So let's stop talking about them and focus on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell, before you guys say a thing, I want to warn you. First, as you can see in my introduction, my english is pretty terrible so sorry If my review is a bit approximative in term of language. Second, the grade I gave to, six, isn't a normal six. You see, I'm a bit \"strict\" and so this grade is maybe equivalent to a 8 or 7 in a \"normal\" list. Because yes, I love this show and It was a true experience.\\n\\n\r\nDisappointing me at the beginning, Bakemonogatari has finally charmed the stupid elitist I am. Like I said before, this is pretty stupid but this isn't bad stupidity and let me explain why you don't have to take that show at the first degree.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is, I think, a critical lampoon about the modern japanimation industry. Fast-paced action, fan-service, bland dialogs and scenes and I pass... there's clearly a lot of reccurents problems, and by the way of exageration, Nisio and Shinbou are not only trying to show us panties, boobs and ass, no, mostly deliver a message. \"Do you want some bitchies on your dick ?\", \"Was the 6728th last fight satisfying ?\", \"People are killed if they die ?\" and that kind of stuff I'm talking about. But at the end, I'm still sceptic about that way of process because It can just be a classical weebs show with his clich\u00e9s too. That's why I prefer to see Bakemonogatari as \"melting pot\" anime, where everyone can pull what he wants from, and there's no right thought. I'm not a big fan of ecchi nor hentai but it's still cool to watch because I can think what I want of.\\n\r\nBut hold it there, I'm not don yet. Lot's of people are yelling at the fans, spitting on the serie 'cause it's just a \"retarded weebs show\", \"pure nonsense\" or even \"stupid\" and yes it is, for the stupid part. The anime is just  a following of randomly generated-like sequences with stranges characters and strange story. So what ? I didn't see the point here. \\n\r\nThis anime is clearly crazy and I've already give my advice about why. Bakemonogatari is trying to get the f*ck out of the crowding average mass, get up to a higher level. It's dangerous, because tons of people hating that kind of stuff but for the ones who like it, this is heaven. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough talking of the \"sense\", it's time to talk about the anime in itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nWell ... the story is ... well.\\n\r\nIt surely be a pain in the ass to tell the entire plot so let me do a quick summary in few words.  Vampire lolicon guy saves a purple haired tsundere girl who doesn't weighs anything and then, a blond old man with an hawaiian jack try to exorcise a crab spirit out of her.\\n\r\nSo yeah kids, drugs are bad. When I was talking about strange story, It wasn't a joke for the god sake. But it's there, precisly there that I see Bakemonogatari as a special show. If it was normally structured, with normal filming, normal characters, normal dialogs, it probably would be bad. And why is it good then ? Because of Akiyuki. The way he has to realize is perfectly fiting with that kind of plot. Thanks to him, the anime reveals all his potencial. \\n\r\nAnyway, after the first weird encounter ( and severals unrealistic dialogs scenes later ) we get to met the others characters. I'm gonna talk about them now ( Savin' this for later ) but wow, my mind. Spirit haunting, curse, monsters, you got everything here. Every god damn story is good, great, fantastic ! And ( warning, you're entering the mediocre philosophical zone ) I'm thinking of these stories like some rapports of the person in the modern society. For exemple, in the second story, we're following the adventure of a \"lost snail\", a girl who can't get back to her home. And strangly, when the protagonist is with her, he can't get back too. Honestly, it could describe a type of mentality like \"You're gonna loose everythign if you stay with me\" or \"Some people needs to be alone\". That's what I'm talking about, morals. Morals about behavior in the society, morals about people who doesn't respect others and I think the main character is representing of the society and the girls are various morals like madness, sadness, jealousy and others type of feelings. \\n\r\nAnd maybe not, maybe it's just a stupid story with randomly generated plot, maybe it's just a fan-service endless hole, maybe. But you can see it as you want, no ?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nGod, this is gorgeous.\\n\r\nIf my eyes could cum, they would to.\\n\r\nFor a 2009 anime, the graphism is exceptional. The animation is fantastic, the art is fantastic, every god damn thing in these drawings are fantastic. The landscapes are orgasmic for the retina. That's why SHAFT is my favorite studio, you're always sure about the graphic quality, no shit Sherlock.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nThe OST is good, made by the guy who compose Haruhi, so yes.\\n\r\nAnd then, I didn't like any of the OP, badly.\\n\r\nBUT, I'm falling in love with the ending, it's absolutely awesome. And it's by- ow, supercell ... do they produce bad music sometimes ?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe best part, characters.\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is the best show for character development in my opinion.\\n\r\nArararararagi, the protagonist, is surely one of the best character of japanimation.\\n\r\nCharacter, character, character, character.\\n\r\nAnd each of the girls have their own personnality, their own way to react, to think, to do, they are not just copies of a classical archetype, no, they are cool.\\n\r\nFrom the cold tsundere to the athletic lesbian, passing by the annoying loli and the nymphomaniac childhood friend, all of those guys are really original.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nYeah, 8, because this is fun as hell.\\n\r\nIn the first and second episode, I wasn't sure about but when I see what could be done in a climax situation, gosh I started to love it. Bakemonogatari is a double or quits series, you're gonna love it or hate it, there's no medium.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nSo I'm giving a 6. You're gonna yell at me like \"Y A SIX IF YOU LOVE IT NIGG ?\". First, I already told you that a six is actually a good grade for me and after, because of the story. The plot isn't that good, yeah, and despite of all the good sides, I cannot stay deaf at all the defaults. It's an excellent anime but there's a way too much fan-service and nonsense, and even if it's made on purpose, it doesn't makes the thing good. But forget it, some great stuff here.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari. This is a series clearly targeted at those with more esoteric tastes, with intent at creating a cult following. Despite this, it has attracted a large general audience and strong critical acclaim. In this sense, I would declare it the \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 of anime, or something akin. With that in mind, I came into this series with high hopes and no expectations. I left very satisfied. Bakemonogatari is the definition of a stylistic triumph that drives with gorgeous directing, striking minimalism, and sharp dialogue. Many elements of the series are unique and run counter to conventional anime storytelling, but these elements congeal to forma fulfilling work that leaves the audience wondering \u2014 \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this done more often?\u201d. It's a solid series. I recommend it to anybody who into more art-house work and doesn't find themselves to be 'above' this level of perversion. I will continue the series for sure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Bakemonogatari is structured in by stringing together several small arcs. Every episode belongs to a chunk from 2 to 5 eps long where Araragi finds some kind of supernatural disturbance and has to unravel and solve the mystery behind it, much like Mushishi. Of course, this is barely the point of the series, but more like the vehicle in which the series travels by. Really, it is about Araragi, our protagonist, interacts with and develops relationships with his harem. Yeah, it's a harem anime. I don't know if that is a debate or not (I don't see why it would be), but it's a harem show. However, this is the first harem show that really impressed me, it managed to create more dynamic and tense relationships between our hero and his ladies some of the others (SAO) I've watched. There is one primary romance, Senjougahara, and many potential romances which are obvious 'temptations' for Araragi, and I find them pretty fun to watch. Beyond that, the show has a solid amount of mystery built up, and it builds slowly and inconspicuously. I like that. It does a great job as the first entry in the series; it holds on its own but also makes you wonder just what exactly happened during Spring Break or Golden Week. Each arc does its job well, is interesting standalone, and advances the relationships between the new and existing characters. Solid story. Solid start. Can't wait to see how it builds up. An interesting note is that, although you could definitely consider this a romance series, it has few drama elements. I would call the romance more suspenseful than dramatic, since all the women are so stingy and unpredictable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 10]\\n\\n\r\nThe most observable facet of Bakemonogatari that differentiates it from the pack, the art is defined by careful shot composition, quick cuts to innocuous shots from unusual angles, minimalism, sleek color palettes, experimental styles, and some pretty anatomically astounding necks. It performs all of these things really well, and there\u2019s potential for an essay on each of them. Let\u2019s first talk about why it works.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the quality here is strong. Shot composition and animation have some global criteria for being \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019, regardless of the context of the work as a whole. This series is on the \u2018good\u2019 side. But Bakemonogatari supports this style with the nature of its storytelling. Most of Bakemonogatari is focused on dialogue, almost entirely. Conventionally, this is something that can be troublesome to work around. But Bakemonogatari dialogue isn\u2019t normal dialogue. It is sharp. It stings and bites and intoxicates the audience. It has tempo. This is the heart of the series, and the visuals work around it. The dialogue is fast and chock-filled with content? Maybe we don\u2019t need so much attention to background characters and the hustle bustle of a city, it could overwhelm the audience. Let them focus on forms created by grand structures or endlessly repeating objects. Let the shots hit in how the characters react to the punchy dialogue, let Araragi sneak a glance at the girl\u2019s legs when he feels aroused. When tension gets higher, make the cut timings more erratic; it\u2019s great way to build even though nothing is physically happening. Use palettes that often shift in hue to guide the audience\u2019s mood. Use quick text panels to recenter the audience's view and allow them to more easily follow the focus of the quick cuts. There's a lot going on here. And it works really well. From a stylistic, directing perspective, Bakemonogatari floors many of its peers. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few more artistic points worth mentioning briefly. Bakemonogatari, despite its focus on dialogue, has great action scenes that feel punchy and kinematic. I find this to be a trend in anime these days: the series that focus less on action tend to make it better... or maybe just have more impact. Bakemonogatari is also inclined to switch up its style and incorporate neat and fresh ideas all the time. It executes well and does it in places where the tension is light, so it works. Good job!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 9]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is quite good, and it needs to be with the amount of dialogue going on. The tracks are sometimes annoying/repetitive, but sometimes they just perform wonderfully. The ambient sound design is fantastic. Many series either fail to take a proactive approach to sound design or make the attempt but execute on it quite poorly. Bakemonogatari makes it happen. That's all there is to it. The sound also has the benefit of being very focused: there is really no reason to use sound for anything other than the task at hand, since the world is hyper-focused on the characters and the settings are generally still and minimal. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 9]\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari comes with the benefit of running with a small cast. Hell, beyond the main cast of Araragi and the girls there are only a few others characters that ever appear on camera. Well, the perverse nature of these characters allows them to feel totally fresh and allow them to create strong tension in their relationships. Obvious standouts are Senjougahara and Hanekawa. But really you enjoy seeing every character.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a harem show, special attention has to be brought to how this show avoids the classic harem problem. The problem is that, often, the harem master has no discernable character traits, the girls that like him are lame and like him for no reason, and these qualities make the harem master be a great means of attachment for lonely teenage boys. Now, in essence, Bakemonogatari nearly follows the model. However, Araragi has an interesting and layered personality, even if it isn't necessarily conventionally attractive and he still manages to attract many women by being 'nice' to them. The main differentiating factor is that Araragi's perversions make his relationships with these girls all interesting. It isn't the case that he doesn't desire the women, but moreso the case that he has priorities, and will indulge in his perversions, but never crumble. Also, these girls are generally interesting, and their interest in Araragi is a little spicier and more developed than just 'Araragi is a nice, honorable dude, I like him', despite what Senjougahara might say. Perversion and sharpness allow Bakemonogatari to overcome many of the character issues that come with the harem package. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10]\\n\\n\r\nI could see some audience members who aren't into the writing or cinematography having a difficult time with this series. Much of the pull of the series is rooted in these attributes. However, I thought both were completely intoxicating. It feels like this is so much to learn from watching this series, which is something I love to be able to say. I am definitely pumped to continue watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 9]\\n\\n\r\nNothing more to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There were numerous scenes where characters were talking extensively in a still shot or where the full shot was motionless with minimal repetitive movements such as the movement of the characters' mouths. I also thought the random ecchi scenes were distracting and entirely unnecessary. I did not find this type of directing innovative and think the experimental directing and art style failed to entertain its audience because the viewers were stuck with experiencing an entirely 2 dimensional world.\\n\\n\r\nAlso as far as the characters go, I found Senjougahara to be super annoying.

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is beautiful, fun, and emotional. \r\nThe art design and animation direction are almost unparalleled in creativity and innovation. The only \"better\" looking anime that I can think of is Casshern Sins. You know how every anime, including action ones, consist mostly of characters standing around talking with one another? That's just the nature of manga, so it becomes awkward when translated into anime. Bakemonogatari takes these \"characters awkwardly standing around and talking\" scenes and fully embraces them. And, given Bakemonogatari was a adapted from a graphic novel, this is all the more impressive. There are epic dialogues and monologues all over the place aidedby massive flashing walls of text. Bakemonogatari manages to keep it from being boring by having extremely clever and dynamic cuts. All scenes are very uniquely crafted by some mad genius. It's kind of hard to explain, just watch the first episode to see what I mean by this. Not to mention, the budget and overall visual quality of the anime is huge. The character designs are intricate, the line work is precise, the color palette is creative, the attention to detail is impressive; all things that come with having a huge budget utilized by experienced artists. \\n\\n\r\nThe entertainment/enjoyment value of Bakemonogatari is also almost unparalleled, at least to me personally. The only anime I enjoyed more was Neon Genesis Evangelion, but that was for completely different reasons. Bakemonogatari appealed to me for its comedy and cute character designs *cough* the fan service *cough cough*... I found them very, um, tasteful. Maybe I'm just a pervert, but I really enjoyed that aspect of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the emotional side, Bakemonogatari appealed to me on a very personal level. Without getting too much into my personal life, I'm at a point where I spend a great deal thinking about love. Understanding that, the character of Senjougahara did... um... things for me? I can't think of how to put it, but her being so much like me and viewing love like me gave me a lot of inspiration. Her character in general appealed to me greatly because of that reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe 5 arc nature of Bakemonogatari was the most unappealing factor for me; that is, it is solely what brought down the score so much. As well crafted, directed, paced, written, developed, and finished as all 5 arcs were, I feel like I quite didn't get enough of each character. Especially my anime crush Senjougahara. Maybe this perception of Bakemonogatari will change as I watch more anime in the series and I will be able to look at it more as a base for the series. But as a standalone anime, this is how I feel.",

This could have been a great anime because of the overall idea but the execution seemed very lacking. The story is very long and drawn-out, and eventually bores the watcher with half-heartedly done characterization that forces itself into you. This animation style tried to be innovative, but all the episodes ended up turning into was frame-by-frame exposition that is illegible without pausing the video and lots of unnecessary dialogue that is easily forgotten. Many times during this anime have I seen dialogue run on for over halfan episode without having so much as a word that helps the plot move forward. However, despite the fact that this anime was poorly directed, the story eventually moved forward and gave itself some meaning, however drawn-out it might have been. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, the story and idea behind it was better than average.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was not terrible and was somewhere between mediocre and above-average.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was average compared to other anime.

            "content": "Note: This review covers all seasons of the series that have been released so far (Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari, Tsukimonogatari and Second Season).\r\nStory:\r\nWhile it might look like a fanservice-ladden harem series at first glance, Bakemonogatari actually feels like a perfect deconstruction of the genre to me. Despite the fact that characters spend a whole lot of time just talking to each other, the series manages to make these interactions really interesing and meaningful. Drama, comedy and even some titillating scenes manage to coexist and ease into each other in a very interesting and mostly organic way, and the show knows not to use overly sudden moodswings while it's portraying something serious. On the flip side, a couple of fanservice scenes might be a bit unsettling for some people (with a particularily infamous one standing out), but it never felt forced enough to make me hate the series for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that might be a bit confusing for some people is that the show tends to like using puns and references that might be lost to those who don't know enough about Japanese language and culture. Still, I feel like you can enjoy the series without that knowledge for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAnother stong point of the series, since the whole cast has really good chemistry with each other. They also happen to be interesting deconstructions of the tropes they personify, and are handled quite well. Besides the Araragi harem, the specialists were all really interesting as well, with Kaiki Deishu being one of the standout characters of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that it looks like most of the story was planned out in advance is also very important, since there're many things characters say and do that the audience only learns the true meaning of way later in the story, making rewatches worthwhile as well. Unlike shows that might thrive on the status quo, Bakemonogatari isn't afraid of moving forward with the plot and dealing with the consecuences, which is quite refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic:\\n\r\nShaft really got to shine here. Their abstract, artsy and sometimes downright bizzarre style fits Bakemonogatari perfectly, and lends even simple conversations and other action-light scenes lots of dynamism and character.\\n\\n\r\nThe music's quirky and sometimes erratic style also feels right at home with the fast-paced dialogues and abstract drawings. The way these three elements support each other without hogginge the spotlight is yet another strong point of the series, as they all work together to set the mood and tone of each scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs closing thoughts, I'd say Bakemonogatari's the perfect blend of a great story with an animation studio whose style matches it like a glove. I can't possibly recommend it enough, since it's easily one of my favorite anime series out of all the ones I've watched so far.",

            "content": "The anime follows Koyomi Araragi as he saves different girls from demons with the help of Meme Oshino, a homeless middle aged man, and develops a kind of harem on the way. The story of each girl is told in 3 or 4 episodes.\r\nWhat makes this anime so good is the characters and the dialogue especially between Araragi and, the first girl he saves and the queen of tsundere, Hitagi Senj\u014dgahara. Hitagi becomes the romantic interest for Araragi after he saves her but unlike most tsundere in anime she doesn't become all venerable instead she shows herself to be a strong and intelligent character whois more than his equal.l She becomes Araragi's girlfriend because she wants to be with him not because she depends on him which is usually the case in anime. It has to be said I have a weakness for any female character in anime which challenges and makes the main male protagonist suffer forcing them to be a man.\\n\\n\r\nIt has to be said the dialogue between all the characters is excellent. It is fast and intelligent and just when you begin to follow it the dialogue goes off in a tangent throwing you and Araragi off balance.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say any of the characters are unlikable and each one has a story although Tsubasa Hanekawa is a little boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very original and focuses mainly on where the characters are so there isn't any unnecessary detail.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say the story is anything original although there are some nice twists and there are a lot of puns which means if your not Japanese you will miss most of the humour.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't my best review but if you enjoy anime with intelligent dialogue this is one for you.",

Its a great suspense, and amazing cast of characters helps to tell the story.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is great, and oddly unique. Its episodes that run by parts relating to separate characters isn't the unique part, but the flow of the story is very real. Its a good, realistic flow of events that you wish you got in other anime.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is outstanding. It not top notch or the most amazing animation ever, but the animation fits the storyline. For me, the look is half the battle, and though animation doesn't tell the story, it plays a big part in the production as a whole. In this case, the art really helped keep me tuned into the story. I really have no complaints in the art section.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe anime could have done more with the soundtrack and all the noises, but i think the little soundtrack that they had in place fit the feeling of the anime. It wasnt overly happy, or overly sad, it was a playfully mysterious soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n The characters are all very diverse and i couldn't be happier. They all complement each other quite well. You've got the guy who never knows whats going on, but is reliable when the time call; the hard headed girl that doesnt wanna show much emotion, but does so only the one she loves; the playful and flirty friend who deep downs wants the protagonist dead but is playing around with him; the lovable little girl who likes to poke fun at people, and the childhood friend who has a crush on the guy. They all develop really well, especially Araragi. His growth is noticeable throughout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n Overall, it was a great watch. There couldn't be anything better then a uniquely plotted story with great flow, amazing animation, suspenseful music, likeable characters, and awesome outting.\\n\\n\r\nFaults:\\n\r\n The biggest, BIGGEST fault that made me stop watching this anime for a few months...\\n\r\nWAS THE FINAL EPISODES. \\n\r\nBecause they werent aired, you had to wait for them to come out online. But did they any time soon? no. The 13th and 14th did, but the 15th took a long time. So long, that i was able to finish 9 anime shows while i was waiting. By the time it came out and got subbed, i was forced to rewatch the anime just so i could understand what was going on at the end. It was ridiculous. I didnt mind watching it again, but to watch the whole thing ONLY to watch the last episode was a bother. Which is why i wont ever watch another anime again until it is fully done.",

            "content": "To begin with, Bakemonogatari and its' corresponding series' are not for everyone. The pacing of the series seems a bit scattered to begin with, the style in which the anime is done is original, but may also be frustratingly over-the-top in its' originality. However, that shouldn't stop someone from at least giving the show a try.\r\nAs far as story is concerned, the plot is, essentially, broken down into very brief arcs, with each 2-5 episodes (depending on the story) dealing with the protagonist's meetings with a girl housing a supernatural being. Every time a different girl's story begins, their name and the title of thecreature lets the viewer get an idea of what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique, with a blur of styles throughout every episode, a variety of colors, and shifting surroundings particular to whatever is being discussed, or whom is talking. While original, it can also be very tiring to keep up with the pace at which images and words are put on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nWith the soundtrack, it is well-done, and fits the show to a t, but it is not particularly moving. There are a few scenes in which it is very notable, but for the most part it is simply a background to the story.\\n\\n\r\nBecause there are so many characters in Bakemonogatari, and they are all explored in depth, it's wonderful to see them all unfold and interact. The girls all remain in the series after their introduction, leaving a small but tight cast of characters to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series overall, mostly because of the genre blend, the art, and mostly, the characters. The protagonist and the girls were all interesting to the point that it didn't feel like a traditional harem anime.",

It's art is gorgeous, but then again, this is Shaft, so what do you expect? xD I might add that despite the lack of moving around in this show, as most of the show is spent with people standing still talking to each other, this show has amazing animation when characters are moving around. Perhaps the best in any series I've ever seen. The music is very very good but very very repetitive, though the way the music goes and all the weirdconversations that take place in the show, it can help to be very erm...hypnotic? Still, wonderful music. The show focuses heavy on weird dialogue, and consequently you learn a lot about each of the characters, which really push this show forward. The main character is essentially a somewhat perverted mashochist (I think) who is dating a girl who is a sadist. (The perfect couple, can you imagine?) The main character loves to help people, however his perversions make his morality questionable at times. The sadist girl is very interesting, and a little creepy, as she is very dangerous. There are other characters who get focused on, most of which are interesting, so no worries if you have problems with characterization. This show doesn't have much of a storyline. It instead has multiple stories that span the whole series, each of which revolving around some strange supernatural event causing someone trouble. Still, they are very interesting and sometimes over-the-top, having very violent sudden events occur. Overall, I loved this show, but its not for everyone. It's subbed only, so that's a problem for dub fans. Plus, the price to buy the show is ridiculously expensive, a wopping 150 dollars. To make matters worse for some people, the show might appear dull due to the large amount of dialougue in ther show, not all of which is comprehensible. And finally, some people might be pushed away by the fanservice. Still, I love this show and highly recomended it- It's one of my favorites.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari (aka Ghost Story) is a 15 episode anime animated by studio Shaft and part of the Monogatari Series written by Nisio Isin. It was directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, who also directed Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and Nisekoi. It\u2019s no wonder that this anime is considered a masterpiece, both visually and story-wise, and I will attempt to explain why in this review. Truth be told, it has it's flaws, but they can be ignored. The main focus of the show are the story and character interactions.\r\nStory\r\nAs I said, Bakemonogatari is part of the Monogatari Series written by Nisio Isin. Its prequels are Kizumonogatari and Tsubasa Family,which you should read/see before you watch this even though Bakemonogatari was animated first. The plot revolves around Koyomi Araragi, an ex-vampire and his encounters with various oddities. It's divided into five arcs: Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, Suruga Monkey, Nadeko Snake and Tsubasa Cat. Each one features one female character, her story and the oddity that caused her problem. While the story itself is simply amazing, I have one problem with it. It assumes that you already know what happened in Kizumonogatari and just throws you in. That makes the start quite confusing and boring to people as it only adds to the struggle with the amount of text and flashy images on the screen. Each episode has over 400 lines of text in it, be it in images or conversations, which is absolutely mental. They tried to cram as much content as they could into this show. That doesn\u2019t make it bad though, it only makes it unique, and when you get used to the style, you\u2019ll find yourself loving the show. Each of the arcs has an amazing (and sad) story and Mayoi Snail stands way on top being the most heartwarming arc of them all. The main focus of the story is the pain that people experience during their life and how to overcome it, and the sub focus is the romantic relationship of Araragi and Senjougahara Hitagi.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets a 9/10 just because of the first episode and because it assumes that you already know the Damaged Goods arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe main objective of the animation style is to keep your focus on the screen and what\u2019s going on there. Having such an objective, you can kind of see why Akiyuki used so many flashy images and dodgy camera angles. The animation quality is simply amazing, you can literally see the pile of money that was spent on this show. While most of it consists of images of the environment and text screens, there are a few fight scenes. I must say that the fight scenes are NOT the main focus of this anime, so they mostly consist of Araragi talking his opponent\u2019s into submission. The character and camera movements are fluid. Shinbo tends to use different art styles while portraying emotions, which is quite attractive. One advice, do NOT try to eat while watching this anime. You will simply forget about the food and won\u2019t be able to keep your eyes of the screen. I often paused the video to catch up with the text displayed via images and dialogue. Also, this is not a show for those who suffer from epilepsy. Consider yourself warned.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation gets a 10/10 being an absolute masterpiece and artwork in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the show are characters and the way they interact. Each and every character you see in this show is more complex than a differential equation and as unique as stripes on a zebra. The depth of them simply amazes me.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start by introducing Araragi Koyomi, the main focus of the show. During spring break, he met a female vampire and chose to give his life to save hers. Shocked by his selflessness, the vampire lets him live and tries to help him become a human again. Long story cut short, things don\u2019t quite work out and Araragi becomes a vampire like human while Kissshot (the vampire) becomes an eight year old girl. Koyomi is the kind of guy who helps on impulse and prioritizes others instead of himself. His interactions with Senjougahara Hitagi, the girl he first saves are simply hilarious as she tends to tease him a lot. Koyomi, who started out as a \u201esexually frustrated kid\u201c develops into a caring and reliable boyfriend and friend.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Senjougahara Hitagi, the perfect mix between a sharp tongued psycho and sweet, caring girlfriend. She is the first woman Koyomi has ever loved. What makes her entertaining is her arrogant and masochistic nature and the way she treats Araragi. She often teases and patronizes him while making up for that by being the sweet loving girlfriend. She acts like that because she is afraid of getting hurt again. Her problem was caused by the wish to escape the burden of a destroyed family. She fell in love with Araragi because he was the first one to break her shield and drag her out of the darkness.\\n\\n\r\nOshino Meme, the laid back oddity hunter and Araragi's mentor. Meme is a man with a lanky physique, always wearing a pink aloha shirt left unbuttoned. He considers himself a neutral force, always trying to balance things out in the world. In the Kizumonogatari novel, he starts living in a cram school building and helps Araragi return to his human form. After that, he lives there with Shinobu Oshino (Kissshot) and assists Araragi in curing the girls affected by oddities.\\n\\n\r\nHachikuji Mayoi, a fifth-grade elementary school girl trying to reach the home of her mother. She is cheerful, energetic and inquisitive, makes a lot of spelling mistakes and has a habit of mispronouncing Koyomi's family name. On the other hand, she does not easily trust strangers, and will even fight back against them if they become too nosy. She lived with her father after her family broke apart. Because she was afraid of forgetting her mother, she decides to visit her. Araragi and Senjougahara help her achieve that goal. Gosh... talking about her without spoiling anything is hard...\\n\\n\r\nSuruga Kanbaru, star player of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from junior high school. She usually keeps her left hand covered with bandages to hide the oddity that\u2019s affecting it. Araragi describes her as erotic. She is a lesbian and a lolicon, often reads yaoi. Hidden from others, however, is her tendency to be jealous of others to the point of thinking about revenge.\\n\\n\r\nSengoku Nadeko is the childhood friend of Araragi's sister Tsukihi. She met Koyomi after a long time while trying to cure her oddity curse. She is quite shy and easily amused.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa Hanekawa, Koyomi's classmate and class representative. She is known at school as a model student. Her kindness hides the fact that she is under constantly under a lot of stress. That stress caused her oddity problem. Her story starts way at the beginning, in Kizumonogatari, as she helped Koyomi and saved his life. Koyomi is therefore bound to her, always looking after her in order to repay his debt. Oshino Meme finds her quite scary because of her kindness. The brighter someone shines, as he says, the greater the shadow within him.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I must thank Kousaki Satorou for creating these beautiful OST and SuperCell for creating that ending song.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc of the series has its own opening, featuring the girl in question. What i really like about that is that each song describes the personality of the girl in question. The openings are Staple Staple by Chiwa Saito, The Road Home by Emiri Katou, Ambivalent World by Miyuki Sawashiro, Renai Circulation by Kana Hanazawa and Sugar Sweet Nightmare by Yui Horie. The ending song Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari was composed by SuperCell, and is one of my favorite songs to day. Even standing alone, those songs are beautiful. I actually first heard the soundtrack and then watched the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack gets a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nNotes\\n\\n\r\nIn order to fully enjoy this anime I highly recommend that you first read the novel Kizumonogatari. It has about 260 pages and is currently online on baka-tsuki.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it in release or chronological order? \u2013 Well, I prefer the chronological order because it\u2019s easier to get used to the story and style that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe release order of the series is: Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari Black and Monogatari Series Second Season (the Kizumonogatari movie is not out yet)\\n\\n\r\nThe chronological order is: Kizumonogatari (the novel), Nekomonogatari (Black), Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari and Monogatari Series Second Season\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I would ask you to give me feedback on the review if you have disliked it. I find that quite important as it helps me become a better reviewer. Ty in advance\\n\\n\r\n\u200b",

            "content": "Hello there. It has been a while since I made a review so I decided why not write one on the anime Bakemonogatari. \r\nSTORY 8: \r\nThis is about a guy helping various girls with supernatural problems which is sort of a common plot. However, the way its executed is very good. It does come off as a little confusing so I recommend trying to pause and read the flash words in the beginning of each episode. They explain quite a bit actually. Don't give up on the first episode! At least try a few more even if it seems weird! You'll notice Bakemonogatari is somuch different from other animes, things can go from jokingly to depth within minutes. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8: \\n\r\nI think the art is fine really nothing too special but not bad enough where you are cringing at the sight of it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10:\\n\r\nFirst off let me say that its awesome that each character sings the opening themes throughout the series. I love it! This is part of why I give sound a 10. The other reason is the time and place they choose to play the music. You can notice that the characters opening song instrumental version plays in the background when something good is happening. As for the ending song, it won't make much sense to you until close to the end of the anime. Then it unravels beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9:\\n\r\nOf course the characters play a big part in this anime since most of the anime is made up of them talking, either meaningful or having fun with each other. The way they react to one another is amazing. I also like how things happen while they are talking (you will see what I mean when watching) its another reason this series is so different from others. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8: \\n\r\nI did pretty much enjoy Bakemonogatari, sometimes I got a little bored but I blame the stupid website I was using for messing up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\r\nI highly suggest watching this if you are tired of the same old things and want something that is different. Its not for everyone but it doesnt hurt to not give it a try!",

            "content": "SHAFT must have been very high when they created this anime.. It's full of weird stuff... Weird stuff that made me fall in love with the Monogatari series. Just keep doing what you're doing Shaft. It's what makes your company \"Shaft\". \r\n[Story]: (9.5/10)\r\nKoyomi Araragi is almost human again after briefly becoming a vampire. When Hitagi falls down the stairs into his arms, he discovers she weights almost nothing and offers her help from a middle-aged Hawaiian shirt man. Koyomi encounters different aberrations in a series of interconnected stories.\r\nI'm probably not the only one who thought this anime was very VERY weird when I first watcheda couple of episodes. It's not because of the SHAFT head tilts. Oh no, I've gotten used to the head tilts ever since Madoka but because of how everything was animated and the storytelling. It's kind of...unique but in a weird way. You really don't see this kind of stuff everyday in anime. For example, the classroom where Oshino usually hangs out or Kanbaru's room full of books. However, in a few episodes, I've gotten used to Monogatari's weird animation and storytelling so that's that. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is divided into 5 arcs and each arc features a female character who has a problem/situation they have to deal with. And this is where Ararararagi comes in. He helps the female characters solve their problem. You might be thinking that each arc is very dry and simple but they're not. Each arc has an interesting story and very-well written twist that explains why they're at that situation. For example, take a look at Hachikuji's arc. Hachikuji is lost and must find her way home. You think the story is that simple? Do you honestly think she's simply lost because she ran away or something and Araragi will just find her way home and happily every after? There's a reason why she's called the \"wandering\" snail. There's a reason why she's \"lost\". There's a dark story as to why she's lost and this is why I love the Bakemonogatari's writing and complex storyline. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue scenes are also handled very well and almost every line that comes out of the character's mouth serves a purpose in the story. In other words, this is not an anime for people who prefers action over dialogue scenes. While Bakemonogatari does have some action scenes, the show is bombarded with dialogues and you must listen to every word in order to understand the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show offers an excellent storyline, the show suffered from one issue. The pacing. I don't know if this is just me but the pacing was a bit too fast. For example, Senjougahara's arc only lasted for 2 episodes and Nadeko's arc also suffered the same fate. I really wish it could have been 3 episodes or more. I did watch Nisemonogatari before writing this review so I know how the pacing goes in Nise and it is a lot better. This is what prevented me from rating Bake a perfect 10. \\n\\n\r\nPutting the story and pacing aside, the show is packed with fanservice. I've known some people who hated or dropped the Monogatari series simply because of the fanservice. Some fanservice are light, some are funny and some might have taken it a bit too far. Me... I hate fanservice with a passion because it's unnecessary and it does not add anything to the story.  In Bakemonogatari, same thing applies here. However, the fanservice here is not that annoying and it doesn't affect the overall story. Some of them can be pretty funny like a third-year high schooler groping an elementary schooler. In case you didn't notice, I meant Aragi groping Hachihachiji. I can't believe I enjoyed this kind of fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I just love how Bakemonogatari mocks other romance anime shows but sometimes the shows falls into them itself and the show doesn't even mention that they just fell into that trap. Talk about irony. Why make fun of other romance anime shows out there if you're going to fall into one yourself?\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe show looks visually great and yadayada...I don't want to focus on the visuals of the show. I want to focus on the weird animation that Shaft animated. This weird animation contains SHAFT Head Tilts where the characters can tilt their head in an impossible 170 degree angle, the camera angles which are all over the place and often uses extreme close-ups, the fast flashing text that is impossible to read unless you look at it frame by frame, empty backgrounds and last but not least, the live-action scenes that somewhat adds creepiness to the show. I actually love it. It makes the show interesting to watch and it doesn't distract you from the story. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI was actually surprised when the show featured 5 Opening themes. For a 15 episode anime show, that's a lot. OP themes aside, the show features an excellent background theme and an awesome Orchestrated OP theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"staple stable\" by Chiwa Saito, \"Kaerimichi\" by Emiri Kauto, \"ambivalent world\" by Miyuki Sawashiro, \"Ren'ai Circulation\" by Kana Hanazawa, and \"Sugar Sweet Nightmare\" by Yui Horie\". The ED theme song is Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" by supercell. Out of the 5 OP theme songs, there has to be that 1 OP theme song that I love. Well, there's actually 3. The 1st, 2nd and 4th OP theme songs. I love the 1st OP theme song because of the singer's wonderful voice, I love the 2nd OP theme song because of its tragic lyrics, and I love the 4th OP theme song because it sounded almost like a rap song but in Japanese and also the singer's voice. The ED theme sounds great because of supercell but it sounded a lot..A LOT better at the end of Episode 12. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (9.3/10)\\n\r\nSo far, this is the only anime where none of the female characters annoyed the shit out of me. Even that loli elementary school girl didn't annoy me. In fact, her appearances just kept increasing the enjoyability of the show. What's her name again? That's right...Hachirojuki. The \"lost\" elementary school girl who keeps getting groped by Koyomi. Yea...you heard that right. A third-year high school student groping an elementary school girl. *sigh* Japan..\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi Araragi is the male lead of the show and he helps other people (99.9% of these people are female) solve their problem. Koyomi is 1/10 vampire meaning he has vampire abilities like regeneration and et cetera. Because of his regeneration, the anime loves to show us Araragi getting f*cked up in the worst ways possible. For example, his mouth getting stapled, a monkey aberration kicking him in his stomach and all other kind of violent action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other female characters as well. Firstly, there is Hitagi. The main girl of the series. She is intelligent and she is not afraid to say whatever she wants and feels to Araragi. Hitagi and Koyomi eventually starts dating later in the series and it does not feel like they're a couple at all. It feels like Hitagi is a yandere forcing Koyomi to date her and this is why I love their pairing. It just leads to funny-ass situations. Koyomi obviously loves her back not because he feels like he is threatened. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there's Mayoi Hachikugi. I already introduced her so I'm moving on to another character. Thirdly, there's Suruga Kanbaru. She's one year younger than Koyomi and has been friends with Senjougahara for god knows how long. She's a basketball player and she revealed her sexual orientation as a lesbian. Fourthly, there's Nadeko Sengouki. A green haired girl and she is Koyomi's little sister's best friend. Lastly, there's Hanekawa Tsubasa. She is a class president and a friend of Koyomi. \\n\\n\r\nThere are supporting characters as well. They didn't get a lot of screentime in Bakemonogatari but they will get a lot of screentime in Nisemonogatari and future Monogatari series. These supporting characters are Shinobu; a name given to her by Oshino and Koyomi's little sisters Karen and Tsukihi. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all these characters, my favourite character is Senjougahara and Mayoi Hachiguki. Hitagi is easily the best girl, nuff said. Her dialogues just cracks me up. Mayoi didn't really become my favourite character until Nise. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching a couple of episodes, I was planning to drop the series because I didn't really get why the fans were praising it. By the 4th or 5th episode, Man...was I hooked. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Bakemonogatari\" really nailed it when it comes to writing, storytelling and the characters. Not only is it clever but it's damn good. Believe the hype people. It is currently one of the best show that SHAFT has ever produced. I might change my mind once I watch all the Monogatari series. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nPros:                                                                                         \\n\r\n+Clever and Complex Storyline                                                  \\n\r\n+Great and Unique Animation\\n\r\n+Oustanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+None of the characters were annoying\\n\r\n+Best Girl: Senjougahara\\n\r\n+Great use of jokes\\n\r\n+Fanservice wasn't annoying\\n\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-Pacing is a bit too fast for Hitagi and Nadeko's arc",

            "content": "I heard from others about Bakemonogatari being \u2018boring\u2019 or \u2018too filled with talking\u2019 and at first had my doubts about watching it. But somehow it seemed to keep calling out to me to watch it\u2026and guess what? I\u2019m so glad that I listened. Where this anime shines is in it\u2019s delivery of the story, which really develops into romance for the 2 main characters, and the dialogue and even dark humor (and many funny innuendos) throughout the series. So you heard me say \u2018romance\u2019 and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably rolling your eyes, but I must say for someone who doesn\u2019t always get into things likethis it\u2019s the series flawless execution of nonchalantly throwing in the love element that makes this series cool\u2014never does it feel forced. Another thing that I loved is the unique artistic style, rich colors, and overall storytelling of Bakemonogatari. All of these blend together to create a storyline that actually has an underlying sense of realism (something found rather far and in-between in most anime today anyway). My only caveat about the series is how I so wished it lasted longer so that even more time could be given to look back at certain aspects of the main character\u2019s (Araragi) life. Other than that it was absolutely great.\\n\\n\r\nLet me be the first to put this out there, if all you\u2019re about (as an anime fan/viewer) is crazy, happy, action-action time\u2026then, well look elsewhere. Yes, it has some action, but not that much. If you want something that is sharp, witty, dark, and yet funny (in a mature way) really give this a try..",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is part of the monogatari series written by nisio isin. I believe that a lot of people heard about this show and so I wanted to share my honest opinion.\r\nWe begin the show with our hero Araragi koyomi. Although firstly he seems as your regular harem hero we discover very fast that he is a part vampire, which show us the supernatural element of the series.\r\nThe story in monogatari is focused on how Araragi help girls who encountered supernatural beings and add them to his harem. This formula gets repetitive and tiring very fast-He sees a girl in trouble, help her (because as usualour hero is very nice with high moral values) and add her to his harem. I got tired of this really fast and the ways to solve the problem, although sometimes original, wasn't very interesting. Except from one episode, the story was very weak (and this episode wasn't really connected to this story).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while the story is weak the main focus of this show is characters. It's very character driven and the real interest is the dialogue and the unique, fun conversations about basically nothing. Sometimes the show gets serious but quickly return to this silly tone, in a very natural way and good balance between them. The sad things is that in shows like that to have the maximum enjoyment from characters gags you need to get used to them, and bake only show you very little from them, so the real fun begins in the Sequels.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters the other strong point of this show is the art and visuals which I sure you all heard about. The fun, unique style of shaft, the pleasant character design and the general feeling are all enjoyable. The soundtrack is okay, I don't remember something that I really liked, but the openings are all nice and the great thing about them that each arc they change-so if you didn't liked one, you might like the others.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I will say that I expected too much from this show. I heard so many good things on it and how much \"deep\" and \"totally not about echii\" that was, but it was my mistake to listen I guess. Another thing that had major effect on my enjoyment was the main girl, and although the best episode in the show centered around her I still disliked her and the fact she got a lot of screen time bothered me. So if you look for a deep story with a large focus on plot-don't look this way. If you want to see something that is fun to watch with great dialogue, go watch now.",

            "content": "This is an unique anime, with good and outstanding sequels and prequels.\r\nI've dropped this series because it seemed to me far too strange. Then I came back to it a few weeks ago and, god, that was rewarding.\r\nBakemonogatari features the history of a half-vampire named Araragi Koyomi and his attempts to solve spiritual-related problems of girls who surround him, with help of a supernatural expert and a blonde little girl that'll amaze you.\r\nHISTORY: The most notable thing is, Bake could've been a simple harem anime: a kind-hearted boy with lots of stunning girls around him (every girl in Bake develops some kind of desire forAraragi), but the odds went otherwise. The storytelling is really unorthodox: there'll be flashs with texts and phrases which tells you a whole lot of things. You'll get used to them.\\n\r\nAnother thing is the Character Lens technique: Sometimes, what you'll see is the picturing of how the arc protagonist sees, feels and reacts. The author hints this on the first scene and while Araragi talks with Hanekawa: it's his POV. There's a considerable amount of fanservice, which is sometimes used to character-building. Really unorthodox, but you'll understand. Edit: Another thing: sometimes, in the series as a whole, the nudity scenes are so seamless into the episode that one can interpretate them as not being fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is dialogue-driven, be aware of this. Edit:Tons of normal people chit-chat with no link to the plot whatsoever which fleshes out the characters so much.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: HANDS DOWN FOR THE AWESOMENESS. Damn.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, Araragi, despite being a lolicon and a borderline paedophilic sometimes, is one of the most honored characters I've ever seen, whether it's his compromise on helping others or being loyal with (SPOILER).\\n\r\nSenjougahara and that purple hair of awe. Charismatic, harsh, seems really cold but is warm and beautiful when you get closer. Like a crab.\\n\r\nMayoi's description is a spoiler on its own, go and check it.\\n\r\nNadeko embodies the complex cute teen-kinky teen, and has a really gruesome problem envolving her.\\n\r\nKanbaru. Bissex, short-haired, straight-foward, exibitionist, fujoshi.\\n\r\nHanekawa. The most beautiful and good-willed with the harshest of struggles.\\n\r\nEach supernatural issue that they have resembles real problems: abandon, peter pan complex, jealousy and frustration supress, which fleshes out them on a beautiful way.\\n\r\nSOUND: Fits in in the dialogue, well done. Watch it and download the OST.\\n\r\nART: It's Shaft, expect nothing but good quality.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: No lies: this is not an anime for anime-beginners. The more you're into anime understanding, the more awesome this series becomes, Nevertheless, no-experts like myself found this series unique, and fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nHint: Nisemono is not as great as this one, while the second season will get you hooked. Go on and enjoy the ride!",

You are almost led to believe in a development that will most often be recognized immediately , just so that in the end, could see something totally different and gawk .\r\nThe characters are engaging . Make you become a fan of them . Araragi is spectacular . Intelligent (at least in thenovel hehe ) , perverted and a well known personality , but for some reason still so different from other protagonists...!\\n\\n\r\nShinobu is OH YEAH SO BADASS ! She says nothing throughout the course of Bakemonogatari , and still has the feel of \" My God , how important she is ! \" Her relationship with Araragi is perfect !\\n\\n\r\nHanekawa is simply stunning , and I 'm not even talking about  Gahara - san , because I know you know ... I might end up with a clip on the tongue.\\n\\n\r\nBut the charm of the whole novel is how simple things become so complicated , and how complicated things turn out to be so complex in a different point of view . What I mean is , point of view: If you look in a way is something , but looking from another is so ... so phenomenal...!\\n\\n\r\nWell , the adaptation was perfect . Seeing how it was presented .... cuts , closes... it was a good way to pass de text.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith amazing characters, plots merged in illusions and amazing ability to present something common in an amazing way, Monogatari won my heart. The Past Shared by Araragi and Shinobu ... The silence of Hanewaka, and the strange love that exists between our protagonist and Gahara-san ... with funny moments provided by Hachikuji and moe by Sengoku, with the exotic personality of Kanbaru .... with the surrounding mystery behind Oshino ... with it, this series has become my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for my poor english :)",

            "content": "Monster Story\r\nTimes Rewatched: 3\r\nEach of these 3 VERY different experiences I have with this anime has finally made me come to a conclusion once and for all.\r\nAs this was the first in the series it was kind of hard for me to wrap my head around what was happening at first. But after some thought I decided to return to this anime and rewatch it for my first time. After my first time it was very apparent that I had clearly missed the point of a lot of scenes, which prompted me to eventually continue in the series with a newfound light. Said newfound lightwas better understanding of film, which prompted my second rewatch. While I was watching it for a second time I had realized that I had yet again missed a lot that the show offered. Whether that be subtle audio, or very quick cuts in between shots. But it wasn't until my third viewing that something had struck me. I wouldn't be nearly has harsh or critical about other anime if it wasn't for this one.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] 8/10 - Just like Monogatari's original counterparts by Nisio Isin, it is split into short stories that surround usually around one character at a time. I will yet again let the synopsis do the job of explaining the plot but I will take the job of explaining why the plot is good and why the plot is bad. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off with why it is good. Pacing is fantastic, every story is around 2-5 episodes. Which is not a lot of time to acknowledge and develop a new character or event. Even though this anime kind of restricts itself like this; you never feel like you were left out of something in the story. Each story is unique and wonderful. Some are better than others but that can just be brushed off as preference.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the bad things. The dialogue is god awful sometimes. Sometimes it feels intentional, which is okay I guess? Tone and mood change constantly, this can be a good and a bad thing. Some may say that it's part of the anime's aesthetic but when compared to things father down the road like Monogatari: Second Season and Owarimonogatari it just seems like a negative thing. \\n\\n\r\n[Art] 9/10 - Each art style is unique and different from anime to anime, but there is something special about this one in particular especially after learning about what year this anime was released in! It's just very polished, while they don't fully flesh out and create other background characters. They instead use words or outlines to represent irrelevant characters which was an interesting choice. The world the characters are in doesn't feel empty due to it's amazingly detailed background and settings. Animation wise it's kind of stiff and pivotal which is not a bad thing. In fact it seems as if it was a design choice. Every character design is unique and interesting, each design also seems to compliment ones attitude but that is something for the character section of this review.\\n\\n\r\nVisual Storytelling. If not for the care and love put into the small yet significant things found in the background or even hidden in plain sight for the viewer to find it might not be as good. This is something that is continued for the rest of the series and plays a massive role in understanding characters, events and well the scenes themselves! The only negative is that it might take you a view rewatches to find them all...\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 8/10 - But before we get started on character I must give credit where credit is due. The music is fantastic! Usually... Most of the time the anime has great music choice for scenes but there was always at least one per arc that seemed a bit off. Like it didn't add to the tone/mood of the scene but also not breaking the viewers perception of said tone/mood. And if you are involved in the anime meme community you might recognize one of the openings. :)\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 7/10 - Onto the anime's weakest point... Now the character development really doesn't fit well with the short stories, as that is a very short amount of time to give a character an arc than finish it in a few episodes. This would be a lot better if the character arc didn't involve such large changes to the characters. Now don't get me wrong here I think the character development is good, but it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10 - I usually have fun watching anime whether what im watching is good or bad. But this one I can wholeheartedly say that I loved every single second of watching this. It has always been a joy no matter how many times I watch it. In fact during my third viewing I took a good friend of mine and sat her down to watch the series with me. We had a few laughs but the best parts would include the food for thought moments and the \"oh my god...\" moments. It was awesome to see her reaction to things while I simultaneously took a deeper look at the anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 8/10 - For the amount that im praising this you might be wondering why im not rating this a 10 out of 10. Because I believe that there is a very specific line in between 8 and 9 and 9 and 10. All of the stories are interesting and different in their own way. Characters change, and the art and sound is the cherry on top.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Yes, but let me tell you that it's not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIf today is your birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day everyone!",

            "content": "I attempted to watch Bakemonogatari for the first time almost a year ago, but stopped after the second episode. Sure, there was something charming in the art style\u2014mainly in the colors, lighting, and editing\u2014but stylistic choices alone wouldn't be enough to hold my attention.\r\nFigured I'd give it another go.\r\nMy major issue with the anime is admittedly a somewhat subjective one because I feel like it has to do with one of Bakemonogatari's stylistic decisions rather than its writing (more on this at the end). Bakemonogatari's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is its pacing. And this doesn't have to do with its writing because its pacingis highly stylized. The dialogue between Araragi and Senjougahara is usually downright brilliant and clever, but I always felt like I didn't have the time to fully absorb or appreciate the content before the show forced me to go elsewhere. Bakemonogatari seems to prioritize style over narrative depth, which can be both its strength and its weakness. It has a script that's delivered in a quick, back-and-forth fashion, likely to optimize the delivery of comedic gags, and the overarching structure of each episode reflects this cadence as well: a mystery or oddity is discovered, the oddity is fleshed out slightly, Araragi jokes around with the character of the arc, there is a moment of \"horror\" as Araragi comes to some realization, Araragi jokes around again with said character\u2014rinse and repeat. However, the comedic timing that some may praise the show for is one that I actually take issue with.\\n\\n\r\nThe gags in Bakemonogatari aren't quick one-liners, but smaller scenes in of themselves, and they serve as narrative interruptions, for better or for worse. At times the comedy is almost a nuisance, cutting into the intrigue and disrupting the mood, perhaps because the topic I was always more interested in was never the subject of the joke; I just didn't care enough to want to be interrupted in the first place and was almost always disappointed when I was. Once the comedic moment ends the show launches the viewer back into the mystery, but the moment has already been ruined.\\n\\n\r\nComedic timing aside, another one of Bakemonogatari's major flaws is how it paces its character arcs. New characters are introduced with promising arcs, before being relegated to existing solely for comedic gags or plot convenience. Oshino and Shinobu are additional examples of characters who are intriguing upon first glance but are never able to become satisfactory characters. We never get to the meat of who they are until Tsubasa Cat\u2014the final few episodes of the series\u2014despite that they were distractingly more interesting than the characters that the show *did* invest some of its time on. But even then, these aforementioned characters seem to matter only in their respective arcs before the show discarded them (except when it's convenient to bring them back for the sake of plot, but not character development). Even Araragi doesn't truly differentiate himself from a classic self-insert harem hero until later in the season. The only golden nugget is Senjougahara. She was the only character who had a satisfying arc, and the only one who didn't fall victim to Bakemonogatari's inconsistent and borderline spastic pacing.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the art is incredible, and the romance one of the strongest parts of the show. There's an artificiality to the art that suggests that the world of Bakemonogatari is some fascinating alternate dimension, while also dramatizing the mood in all the right places to make the experience of solving each mystery all the more entertaining. The art/animation of action scenes are extremely fluid, and somehow interrupting action sequences with intertitles of the character's thoughts actually makes the action more exciting and suspenseful (this is an example of when interruption of the narrative is a plus and is executed well). And I was pleasantly surprised that Araragi had a character arc at all, even though the pacing of his development was a little slow. His simple nature is challenged by both the dangerous situations he's put in and by the characters around him in an interesting and nuanced manner, even though I don't find his self-deprecating/masochistic mannerisms to be particularly original.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari also takes the time to explore \u201cedgy\u201d topics in an honest, mature manner that makes *sense*. Too many anime series cherrypick edgy struggles and stuff them into the show for the shock factor, or delve into the problem in a way that feels lazy, as if the writers didn\u2019t do their research and don\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re writing about. But with Bakemonogatari, it's different: one of its major strengths is in how it introduces and presents sensitive topics. However, it never adequately explores one topic before moving onto the next one\u2014which is yet another example of the way in which the series creates something promising, only to fail to deliver on that promise. In general, Bakemonogatari can be described as a show that teases the viewers with beautiful gems, before suddenly pulling them away to focus on something less dazzling. Again, this could be a stylistic choice that just doesn't mesh well with me. After all, to some this pacing could feel quirky and fresh and ironic, paralleling the show's own art style, while simply being part of what Bakemonogatari is trying to achieve on an aesthetic level.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nStory (7)\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nSound (7)\\n\r\nCharacter (6)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\r\nOverall (7)",

            "content": "Every other \"anime connoisseur\" on MAL seems to have a Monogatari profile picture or a monogatari series entry on their favorites list. Wanting to see what all the fuss was about, I gave Bake a whirl.\r\nStory:\r\nThe thing that annoys me the most about the monogatari series is how on one hand it tries to be deep and philosophical while on the other hand, panders to fans of a very base level of entertainment. As a result, it feels like a pretentious and disingenuous harem, instead of the cerebral and psychological supernatural romp into the human psyche like it tries to make itself out to be.\\n\\n\r\nExhibit A: It's filled to the brim with fetishized female characters, 40% of which are lolis. I love lolis, don't get me wrong, but I cringe whenever I stop to consider the audience that Bakemonogatari is pandering to: people who want to feel smart and deep but also want to be surrounded by cute and sexy (little) girls. It's like the writer wanted to write both a serious story and a light-hearted romcom story at the same time, and Bakemonogatari was born as an amalgamation of these two conflicting desires. To me, this combination doesn't work. \\n\\n\r\nExhibit B: Arararararagi is a low-key self-insert shounen protagonist. Sure, he's somewhat entertaining to watch, but once you take a step back you realize he's a predictable goody-two-shoes who constantly \"saves\" cute girls because he sees fit to do so. The show may try to make his motivations sound all grandiose, but if you boil them all down they're just generic happy-go-lucky bullshit that every other shounen protagonist has been spouting for the last decade or so. While I'm certainly not against helping out specifically female characters or anything, it gets really stale and the harem undertones really creep to the surface after he's saved the 5th female character in a row and she's fallen in love with him like the rest who came before her. People praise this series for \"subverting the tropes\" and \"elevating the harem genre to the next level\" but I ain't feeling jack shit.  The protagonist is fucking boring, the characters are unlikable (Senjougahara can go choke on a thumbtack), and the dialogue feels like it's overcompensating for something. \\n\\n\r\nWhile we're discussing the dialogue, the conversations are absurdly drawn-out to frankly obscene levels. It's great to have some witty banter between characters but sometimes the show just never knows when to stop. Hachikuji's arc was the worst offender out of all of them in terms of droning dialogue. There is no need for 10 minutes of constant discourse about trite subjects that go on tangents and loop back into itself a cow's intestines. Each of these conversations can be just as entertaining and meaningful in less than half the duration that they actually went on for. I don't know what Bakemonogatari is trying to do with the dialogue; I feel like it's trying waaaay too hard to compensate for the author's inability to express depth through any other means.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, my main problem with Bakemonogatari is that it feels incredibly wish-fulfillment, self-insert, and fetishized. Writing-wise, it's sound - profound, and sometimes moving, even. But in light of all the problems I've listed earlier, it feels incredibly disingenuous and pretentious, rather than playful and sophisticated. \\n\\n\r\nLet's take Natsume Yuujinchou as a parallel. They're both supernatural series that delves into the human psyche. However, Natsume Yuujinchou never tries to be something that it's not. It has genuine heart. Its characters are flawed but also feel human. It gently takes you by the hand, and leads you on a journey of love, friendship, and self-discovery. Bakemonogatari, on the other hand, waves its dick in your face, tries to woo you with its meta humor and philosophical drivel, introduces a cute girl, shows you her problems, sniffs her panties, then saves her like the damsel in distress that she is, then sniffs her panties again, then introduces another cute girl. Rinse and repeat. I get it dawg I get it. You're really deep, even though you're a creep. What's that? You're inviting me to be a creep along with you too? Nah man. Unlike you, I'm not that far up my own asshole yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGreat. Shaft's signature style is nothing to scoff and all of the girls' tits and asses are beautifully drawn, rendered and juxtaposed against the symbolic backdrops and rapid cuts. Art and animation-wise, you won't find anything like Bakemonogatari anywhere else. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually really good. The OPs and most of the EDs are a treat to listen to every time. Nadeko's ED song, Renai Circulation, is a god meme. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHachikuji is the sexiest female character to ever be designed by a carbon-based lifeform in the observable universe in the milky way galaxy in the solar system in planet earth in japan\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI fapped to Nadeko's bare ass with my left hand and read the unabridged version of Crime and Punishment with my right. Is this the Monogatari Effect? \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6/10 would be an intellectual pedophile again.",

Any veteran of Shaft\u2018s works (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Maria Holic, Hidamari Sketch) should be familiar with Shinbo\u2018s quirky and unique visual style, often relying on clever use of typography and colors to abstractly represent characters and situations. While this approach may seem slightly inappropriate for some other anime he\u2019s produced (and certainly, it often seems that Shinbo tries a little too hard to indiscriminately jam his visual style down viewers\u2019 throats), it fits perfectlywith Bakemonogatari. The original light novel, penned by Nishio Ishin, features rapid-fire dialogue and constant wordplay, the perfect environment for Shinbo to wreak visual havoc. The words coming out of characters\u2019 mouths and the text being displayed on screen are often two different interpretations of the same conversation. Bakemonogatari is a symphony of typography and color. Most visual elements are stripped down to their bare essentials: backgrounds are monochromatic, details are eschewed for simple geometric shapes, flashy animation is replaced by paper cutouts and black-and-white photographs. The show leaves much to the imagination of its viewers, and refrains from spoon-feeding viewers small morsels of plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast the simple minimalism of the background, the show\u2019s characters are exquisite. Visually, they are stunning. Elegant and colorful, they seem to glow \u2013 adding vibrance to the monochromatic and geometrical world around them. Their radiance indicates to the audience that they are Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nAnd indeed, they are. Senjogahara Hitagi, the heroine of the show, is stunning. Self-deprecating, witty and bitingly sarcastic, she is one of the most unique and memorable characters to come out of anime in recent years. The interplay between her and Araragi, the show\u2019s protagonist, is an absolute delight to watch. The show is theirs \u2013 in its purest form, Bakemonogatari is a love story between Araragi and Senjogahara. Their love is free of overly dramatic confessions and poorly made Valentine\u2019s Day chocolate. Much is left unsaid between them, which makes their relationship so much more compelling and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the show\u2019s five arcs explores a specific aspect of their relationship: contact, confession, injury, jealousy, infidelity. Superficially, Bakemonogatari seems like five separate stories about supernatural phenomena. Yet, beneath the surface, Araragi and Senjogahara\u2019s relationship always plays a role throughout the entirety of the series, and links the five unrelated stories together. Even when Senjogahara isn\u2019t on screen, her presence and influence upon Araragi can be felt. Their relationship is marked by a quiet, unbreakable bond of trust, forged and developed through shared trials and tribulations. Senjogahara begins the show a cold, bitter and angry girl, harboring murderous malevolence towards Araragi. Throughout the course of Bakemonogatari\u2018s story, she slowly warms to him, developing an unspoken confidence in him which eventually blossoms into an unconditional and passionate love. Her relationship with Araragi is marked by mutual benefit and reciprocity \u2013 unlike most anime heroines, Senjogahara never becomes a subservient doormat for Araragi to step on.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast in Bakemonogatari truly supports the main characters. They are many and varied: classmates, former lovers, childhood friends, strangers wandering the streets \u2013 but they all strengthen the story\u2019s main narrative. At the same time, Bakemonogatari\u2018s mysteries are filled with imagination and are compelling and solid short stories in their own right. The fast pace of action helps keep viewers engaged and interested in every new episode while Araragi and Senjogahara\u2019s romance is developed slowly, at a comfortable and realistic speed.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show\u2019s ending left much to be desired. It felt extremely underwhelming compared to the brilliance which marked the rest of the series. Much hand-waving went on during the final few episodes, and the final resolution to the last arc reeked of deus ex machina. Few things were explained, and the show wrapped up without much conclusion. After fourteen episodes of top-notch storytelling, it honestly felt like SHAFT decided to take it easy. Regrettably, the ending of Bakemonogatari is the only thing which separates this show from perfection.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Bakemonogatari is a tour de force of storytelling and visual style. The character development is sublime, and the main narrative is captivating. Undoubtedly one of the greatest series to come out of Japan in the last five years, Bakemonogatari will be remembered for years to come as an example of excellence in the the minds of thousands of fans.",

            "content": "~~~ENGLISH & ESPA\u00d1OL REVIEW~~~ [9,5/10]\r\nBakemonogatari is the origin of Monogatari, a series highly acclaimed by the most critical sectors, and start watching it is difficult to digest, but it is totally worth it. When you start to see the art of Bakemonogatari, the first thing you notice is the incredible quality of the art and direction it contains.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe art of Bakemonogatari is more than outstanding, since not only the shots and approaches they make are exceptional, they also use changes in the color palettes to express emotions or a better setting, and artistic techniques in the drawing/design of characters and environment to give moredepth to the world they build, always being visually pleasing, outstanding, and expressive with everything you want to express, from acting to each episode as if it were a real book to make more sense of the title or change the environment for better understand the characters and each facet of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Monogatari are totally three-dimensional, each part of the series and the direction focuses on understanding them and dusting off every part of them not only with what they say and their acting to the rhythm of their emotions and personalities, also with the direction and the environment to give a warm, cold, empty or crazy feeling of each character to also understand their emotions. Each character and act that they have has a cause, and their actions have a consequence, and this will help them to overcome and face their internal demons, but at no time they try to lie to themselves, or maybe yes... But unconsciously. Because of this, it is difficult to say that there is a 'protagonist' in Monogatari, because everyone can be protagonists or secondary characters.\\n\\n\r\nHistory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn relation to the above, the story is excellent, each story revolves around a character, and consists of unraveling each act and way of being of the character with magical realism that is constructed in a great way without seeming to overshadow or be too abrasive, and everything that happens has a good thread that is worked in detail. But the problems of these stories that form a great story that leads to a common plot goal that is 'Overcoming' becomes too dense and does not always have a good rhythm, even though in most of the time it does not happen, in a couple of story arcs it's like that. Continuing with the above, precisely the message of Monogatari is very important for the whole plot and is even inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very good, the songs have very good use and the mix of different types of songs are very good, this adds to the endings and openings that one is used for story arc to immerse the viewer better, but sometimes the songs are something without pain or glory, but sometimes they are very good.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is the beginning of Monogatari, and in my opinion the most dense series of the series of the entire franchise in the sense of rhythm and narrative, and this makes it sometimes difficult to capture all the symbolism, message and development that it entails, but it is excellent, it could be a series that is left alone in a good direction, but it is not, the address is a very well used resource for what the series wants to express, and you really get attached to each character. It is noted that the series was made with dedication, and despite its errors, it has too many remarkable aspects, being absolutely recommendable, besides that it parodies and criticizes correcting the mistakes that the current and actual anime usually commits. It is a pity that people mostly value Bakemonogatari and its successors for the art and good use of humor and fanservice, which instead of assessing how it is due to the message, plot and characters so outstanding that it has, but in turn indicates what complete that is.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari es el origen de Monogatari, una serie muy aclamada por los sectores mas cr\u00edticos, y empezar a verla es algo dif\u00edcil de digerir, pero vale totalmente la pena. Cuando uno empieza a ver el arte de Bakemonogatari, lo primero que uno nota es la incre\u00edble calidad del arte y direcci\u00f3n que contiene.\\n\\n\r\nArte: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEl arte de Bakemonogatari es mas que sobresaliente, ya que no solamente las tomas y enfoques que realizan es excepcional, tambi\u00e9n usan cambios en las paletas de colores para expresar emociones o una mejor ambientaci\u00f3n, y t\u00e9cnicas art\u00edsticas en el dibujo/dise\u00f1o de personajes y del entorno para darles mas profundidad a el mundo el cual construyen, siendo siempre agradable visualmente, sobresaliente, y expresivo con cada cosa que quiere expresar, desde actuar a cada episodio como si fuera un verdadero libro para darle mas sentido al t\u00editulo o cambiar el entorno para entender mejor a los personajes y cada faceta de ellos.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes de Monogatari son totalmente tridimensionales, cada parte de la serie y la direcci\u00f3n se enfoca en entenderlos y desempolvar cada parte de ellos no solamente con lo que dicen y su actuar al ritmo de sus emociones y personalidades, tambi\u00e9n lo hace con la direcci\u00f3n y el entorno para dar una sensaci\u00f3n calida, fr\u00eda, vac\u00eda o alocada de cada personaje para entender tambi\u00e9n sus emociones. Cada personaje y actuar que tiene tiene una causa, y sus acciones tienen una consecuencia, y esto los ayudar\u00e1 a superarse y enfrentar sus demonios internos, pero en ning\u00fan momento se tratan de mentir a s\u00ed mismos, o tal vez si... Pero inconscientemente. Por esto, es dif\u00edcil decir que hay un 'protagonista' en Monogatari, porque todos pueden ser protagonistas o personajes secundarios.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEn relaci\u00f3n a lo anterior, la historia es excelente, cada historia gira entorno a un personaje, y consiste en desentra\u00f1ar cada actuar y forma de ser del personaje con realismo m\u00e1gico que se construye de una gran manera sin que parezca opacar o ser demasiado abrasivo, y cada cosa que sucede posee un buen hilo conductor que se trabaja de forma detallada. Pero los problemas de estas historias que forman una gran historia que lleva a un objetivo de trama com\u00fan que es 'La Superaci\u00f3n' llega a ser demasiado denso y no lleva un buen ritmo siempre, a pesar de que en la mayor\u00eda del tiempo no pase, en un par de arcos argumentales es as\u00ed. Siguiendo con lo anterior, precisamente el mensaje de Monogatari es muy importante para toda la trama y es incluso inspirador.\\n\\n\r\nSonido: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido est\u00e1 muy bien, las canciones tienen muy buen uso y la mezcla de diferentes tipos de canciones quedan muy bien, esto a\u00f1ade a los endings y openings que se usa uno por arco argumental para inmersar mejor al espectador, pero a veces las canciones son algo sin pena ni gloria, pero a veces son muy buenas.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari es el inicio de Monogatari, y a mi parecer la serie mas densa de las series de toda la franquicia en el sentido de ritmo y narrativa, y esto hace que a veces sea dif\u00edcil captar todo el simbolismo, mensaje y desarrollo que conlleva, pero es excelente, podr\u00eda ser una serie que se quede solo en una buena direcci\u00f3n, pero no es as\u00ed, la direcci\u00f3n es un recurso muy bien utilizado para lo que la serie quiere expresar, y realmente te encari\u00f1as con cada personaje. Se nota que la serie fue hecha con dedicaci\u00f3n, y a pesar de sus errores, posee demasiados aspectos destacable, siendo absolutamente recomendable, adem\u00e1s de que parodia y critica corrigiendo los errores que suele cometer el anime actual. Es una pena que la gente mayormente valore a Bakemonogatari y sus sucesoras por el arte y el buen uso de humor y fanservice, que en vez de valorar como se debe al mensaje, trama y personajes tan sobresaliente que tiene, pero a su vez indica lo completa que es.\\n\\n\r\n9,5/10 = 9/10",

            "content": "IMPORTANT NOTE: If you wish to watch Bakemonogatari, it is on Crunchyroll, but only 12 out of the 15 episodes are available. The original TV run comprised of only 12 episodes and was actually quite conclusive in certain respects, but the remaining three episodes were released on the web over the following year. For those last three episodes, I recommend searching for them on Kissanime.to, or other anime streaming sites of the like nature. You will have to turn off AdBlock, so be mindful of popup ads, but it is worth it. Enjoy the review. \r\nAnyone who has studied film has probably heard of theFrench New Wave (La Nouvelle Vague), a movement of French filmmakers breaking off from traditional Hollywood filmmaking to produce their own, low budget, artistic works. The Nouvelle Vague was highlighted by films that compensated for their low budgets with inventive camerawork that changed a story could be conveyed through jump cuts and excessive environmental imagery. Characters would foreshadow events, break the fourth wall, and display a sentient knowledge of their existence as fictional characters, accompanied with extensive knowledge of the genre they inhabit. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is the animated equivalent of the French New Wave. It is an artistic overdose of beautiful imagery and metaphysical commentary and even having lacked the analytical mind to truly grasp the show\u2019s brilliance when I first watched it, I kept watching simply because it was so alien to me that I had to delve deeper. Bakemonogatari is the story of Koyomi Araragi, a young man living in a small, normal provincial town in Japan, but who\u2019s personal life is far from ordinary. Due to a dark series of events alluded to in the opening minutes of the first episode, Araragi is half vampire, a state upon which he was made by a powerful vampire who for reasons unknown to the audience, is now reduced to the form of a young girl, without the ability to speak. Her caretaker is Meme Oshino, a foreign man in a Hawaiian shirt with an encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural. Araragi is acquaintances with Oshino, as Araragi, as if cursed, tends to attract all manner of supernatural occurrences to him. \\n\\n\r\nOver the course of 15 episodes, Araragi encounters five young women who are in some way plagued by supernatural spirits and, being a good samaritan, works to try and save them from the apparitions plaguing them. The first girl, Hitagi Senjougahara, is plagued by an apparition that feeds on trauma in her family\u2019s past. The second, Mayoi Hachikuji, is a young girl on her way to her mother\u2019s house but due to some supernatural occurrence, is unable to make her way out of the city. Next is Suruga Kanbaru, Araragi\u2019s underclassman. After coming in contact with the cursed limb of a monkey, her arm is transformed into that of a beast. The arm will take control at times and make Kanbaru go on violent sprees against the main character. Next, we have Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of Araragi\u2019s younger sisters who\u2019s life is threatened by a snake-like apparition that leaves snakeskin marks along her body. Finally, there is Tsubasa Hanekawa, Araragi\u2019s best friend (and arguably best girl). Her apparition introduces a Jekyll and Hyde element to the story as she becomes a completely different person at night and a very violent person at that. The apparitions are seemingly random in symptom but all appear to the girls as animals. A crab, a snail, a monkey, a snake, and finally, a cat. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi is an interesting protagonist because he is always trying to help people and this is both his greatest strength and his main weakness. It is a weakness that is at the heart of Bakemonogatari\u2019s thematic hooks. Araragi wants to help these women and whether it is because of his admittedly childish sexual attraction or because of his innate kindness towards others, he goes through a shit ton of pain and agony and he is only able to survive torture after grueling torture because his vampiric abilities keep him from dying. This is a show about selflessness. It proposes that sometimes you cannot help everyone and that by succumbing to pain to help other people, you only make everyone else hurt. This is made more poignant by Araragi\u2019s relationship with Senjougahara, who slowly becomes more intimate with him throughout the series. This in turn further strengthens Araragi\u2019s struggle with whether or not to help people. \\n\\n\r\nThe three pillars of Bakemonogatari are visuals, dialogue, and characters. Before addressing the leading ladies, we have to discuss Meme Oshino and Shinobu, as their parts are significantly smaller than that of the rest of the cast in this first season. Oshino is as laid back as they come. He exists primarily to give advice to Araragi about the supernatural threats plaguing each of the girls. Much like Araragi, he wants to help, but his clients need to be willing to exert a significant amount of effort on their own end, as well as compensation. Shinobu, on the other hand, doesn't have a lot of development, but it is clear that she and Araragi have a past and that he feels like he owes her in a way. This in a way connects to his impulse to help people. As for the rest of the cast, the ladies of Bakemonogatari steal the show. Senjougahara is one of my favorite female characters. She is disarmingly commanding of attention, always saying exactly what she is thinking. She is sociopathic to a level only rivaled by that of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s portrayal of Sherlock. Her chemistry with Araragi leads to some of the most entertaining moments of the series. Similarily, Kanbaru has great chemistry with Araragi, but more because she is always challenging Araragi\u2019s sexuality, whereas Senjougahara is challenging Araragi\u2019s logic and at times, his decency. Hachikuji and Sengoku are both on the younger side, Hachikuji being 11 and Sengoku being 13. Hachikuji is energetic and playful, very confident in herself. Despite this, she can also be quite mature when listening to others\u2019 problems- especially Araragi\u2019s. In contrast, Sengoku is very shy and timid, with a naive crush on Araragi, to the point of addressing him the same formality as that of an elder brother.  \\n\r\nWhereas Hachikuji is deterred by Araragi\u2019s jokingly pedophilic impulses in response to her cuteness, Sengoku demands that sort of attention, making her both adorable, but at the same time robbing her of any true character. Thankfully this lack of character pandering to the lowest denominator is addressed in later seasons and if you aren\u2019t overly sensitive to this type of characterization, you will appreciate how adorable she is. Finally, there is Hanekawa. Tsubasa Hanekawa is a genius. She is deductive, insightful, and can see right through Araragi. I\u2019m not sure there has ever been a single lie that has slipped by her from Araragi. In addition, she is disarmingly humble. Araragi will tell her that she knows everything, and Hanekawa will respond- every time- with her trademark phrase, \u201cI don\u2019t know everything. I only know what I know.\u201d She is an angelic, bespectacled exposition machine that never ceases to have faith in her friends, and that makes her, like many of the characters in Monogatari, inherently awesome. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that for all the praise I give the show for its characters, there is plenty of fan service. Fan service is something that deters many people from watching anime. Now I\u2019m no woman, so I won\u2019t pretend to understand how a female viewer feels about the portrayal of characters. What I can do is ask \u201cdid the sexualization serve a purpose?\u201d Secondly, I can ask \u201cdid the sexualization make the character less respectable?\u201d Pertaining to the first question, I\u2019d say that there are only a few times when the fanservice served no purpose. As for the second question, the fanservice never resulted in me respecting the characters less. The sexualization was either meant as a joke, to illustrate some meta-commentary (arguably), or possibly the most relatable reason for me, because the artists just wanted to show off how beautiful their character designs are. \\n\\n\r\nStudio Shaft is infamous for creating visually striking shows despite low budgets. The entire Monogatari series is a modern art piece in motion. The environments are often populated by minimalistic structures. The focal points of shots are accentuated by the very good use of primary colors. Whenever an anime displays very experimental, unusual, or trippy animation, people call it \u201cpulling a Shaft\u201d, a tongue in cheek phrase referring to studios echoing the works of Studio shaft and there is a bizarre honor to that. Shaft has pioneered an animation style of its own, which itself was an homage to the French New Wave. I could make an entire post about all the things I absolutely love about Monogatari\u2019s visuals. And the best thing is that the show got even better over time. When the show aired on TV, there were some scenes that were not finished. But when the Blu-rays were released? It was phenomenal. However, good luck getting any entry in the Monogatari series for a reasonable price. Aniplex appears to derive pleasure from pilfering our wallets of over $100 just for 15 episodes because they decided to add a bunch of art books that still can\u2019t make that price make sense. \\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a beautiful collection of stories about helping out friends and lovers in need that is accentuated by masterful dialogue and a strong visual presence. It all culminates in an indulgent, thoughtful, and gratifying conclusion to a show that will draw in many with titillation, only to surprise you with pure art.",

To describe Bakemonogatari in one word, it would be unpolished. It's all there: amazing characters, witty dialogue, good story. But it all comes too unpolished to my tastes.\r\nThe story, while it has amazing moments (and characters), is unfortunately plagued by visual novel-like interactions, where Araragi just goes from one character to another, from one location to another, talking with characters and obtaining info. This making Bakemonogatari a rather tiring watch, as you haveepisodes where nothing happens, and you just have Araragi traveling around the city talking with his harem.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when it wants to get gud, it does get gud. My favorite episode of Bakemonogatari is for sure the last one: it is a perfect balance of dialogue and action, it has lots of dialogue but that's not just it, it has action, reveal and visual orgasm, the 20 minutes go by flying.\\n\\n\r\nNow for technical aspects! The art. While the art in Monogatari is surely creative and engaging to look at, it has several minor flaws (fixed on the BDs) and several OTHER AWFULLY BAD PROPORTION FLAWS, on later seasons, this is fixed and the art gets MUCH better, but on Bake, these flaws make it just impossible to give something other than 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are not really that good, it has some gems (ED, OP 1 and OP 4) and the background is nice (it's recognizeable and works to complement the scenes) but I feel like it could be replaced at any time and I woudn't miss it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Bakemonogatari a score of 7.5/10.",

            "content": "If you enjoy a story with a quirky style of witty references than Bakemonogatari is perfect for you. However, if this is your first monogatari series and you are watching it based on people telling you how good it was, then prepare to be confused. The monogatari series has an interesting take on oddities such as vampires, snakes etc. and is very familiar to the shinto religion which played a key role in asia's spiritual advancement. The art style is very bland, yet exquisitely beautiful (you'll see what I mean). This is actual one of the most well-drawn anime I have ever seen. As faras characters go the story is too deep to give them depth. The only character that possesses a sense of depth is Hanekawa and her ignored love. Overall I rate it as a good series, but this is boosted to a very good series by it's clever references and stunning visuals.",

            "content": "Okay, ill just go straight to the point. Bakemonogatari is an anime that breaks the NORM, actually it destroys the norm. Bakemonogatari is a show that is so nice to see because it is unique, showing a completely different perspective of anime.\r\nThe show consists of a few story arch that spawn as the protagonist life progresses. Meaning that our main character story and the story arch intertwine at key moments of the story. Without giving away much, the story is  and interesting. And will certainly be enjoyed by more critical anime viewers. This is a very dialogue driven story so don't expect any actionsegments at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is different, which is something one will notice right at the start. There is a big use of words especially at the beginning of each episode. Overall the art is something that I don't often see but it's absolutely effective.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic, each with their little problems. The way the characters converse with one another is enjoyable to hear and is a breath of fresh air from the majority of anime. Essentially character interactions can either be realistic or extremely strange. Which makes the show more interesting to watch. Characters are a key part of this series and you will get to understand why soon. \\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It's effective but not by conventional means. Bakemonogatari is definitely worth a watch for someone who wants something different.",

            "content": "If Quentin Tarantino ever decided to make an anime, odds are it would be very much like Bakemonogatari. Just like Pulp Fiction, Bakemonogatari mixes great characters and large chunks of well acted everyday-dialogue, with sudden bursts of ultra violence. A combination that is simply excellent.\r\nTruth be told, though, the story itself isn't all that great. It's arc-based (I'm not a fan of obvious arcs in general) and very harem like, as Koyomi Araragi soon rounds up his own ragtag team of beautiful school girl misfits of varying ages. They all have personal problems of a more supernatural nature, and Araragi is simply too considerate tolet them be.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari's brightest stars are its clear cut visuals and music, but also the way it simply refuses to use common storytelling techniques to deliver its narrative. The bright colors and the original camera work makes for a very interesting piece of viewing, and even though some dialogue drags on a bit too long, the series is still a joy to watch, frame to frame.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is simply a must watch for every anime fan. It's the closest thing to pure art I've seen on a screen for a long time.",

            "content": "It's a different experience, a static one I would say. Here you will experience words, conversations, long conversations. If you are a fan of pure action, don't watch, it's almost without it.\r\nWe meet Araragi-kun (Araragi being oh oh oh in japanese) which was recently attacked by a vampire, so now he is a vampire in in 1/8th, so then he meets a girl that weights 1 kilogram and keeps school equipment inside her body, and then he meets a snail girl, which would follow him everywhere.\r\nYES THAT IS BAKEMONOGATARI, A ghoststory.\r\nIt's really hard to describe what this anime represents. Im gonna try to do it,the best I can.\\n\r\nYou would hear simple conversations, they might last for half of a episode. Simple subjects are moved there. Those very conversations would act as snowballs, making a simple subject a big matter, turning it around so the point of the whole conversation would flip around, to be something else. It's crazy how writers wrote the script for it, they are geniuses.\\n\r\nBut if I was to explain the plot in a easy way. It's a exceptional story, of a group of young people being possesed by different \"beings\", which you metaphorically read as - problems.\\n\r\nIt's weird guys, it's just very weird.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nVibe makes this whole thing a good thing. It's a anime where they would use a lot of dialogues, meaning the voiceacting must be good. Well because listening to voices without good visual background is not as entertainting, they would throw some nice animations there.\\n\r\nFirst of all what you will experience is being overwhelmed. It will be difficult to comprehend what are they even talking about, to finally realize that it is simple. And that is the vibe, it's a big f-ing mystery. The characters and their development won't reveal anything, you will have to read through the lines and discover what exactly is going on.\\n\r\nIt's a game of metaphors. \\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nThey wanted to make the artstyle special. And yeah it is. I personally call it squarey, the people and props around have a certain square shape. it is weird, but makes good cooperation with everything else.\\n\r\nThe other thing I like about the art style is that they would change the color scheme based on who is the main person in the scene, more pink there you go it's there. More yellow, which Araragi-san uses, well here you go, red one? Oh yeah the other character uses it.\\n\r\nI also love how they would insanely use props in the series, putting a lot of them in one place, or not placing a single one. Background is truly a mystery in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nCan't really talk about music, it is faint, the main focus is on voiceacting. \\n\r\nVoiceacting had to be the main thing here, it is the most important element in the series. So yeah all of the voices are chose wisely, every single one of them had to sound original, and it had to be pleasant. I think they managed to do that.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nWell it's really hard to follow the story line in this anime. Especially when so much talking happens. But basically it's nice, yet very simple. Araragi would stumble upon various problems of other people, trying to help them with his knowledge, or knowledge of someone elses. That way he develops and makes new connections.\\n\r\nThere is also a good chunk of romance in it, a pretty nice one. I would call it weirdly-platonic.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nWell in conclusion, I recommend it to people that are into reflection, and maybe a chill out. It's a original concept with a lot of work put into it, good work to be honest. It's hard to comprehend, but fun.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/K5rtijZxUJg",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari  review\r\nBakemonogatari is the preparation stage where our  characters  make their debut  using a unique animation art style made by Shaft studio and the writing style of Nisio Isin for the plot and story.\r\nBakemonogatari is divided in many story arcs , each arc focuses on a different character  solving their problems symbolized by the \u201caberrations\u201d with the help of our main character Araragi and the masterfully use of the dialogue for the characterization and plot. Each arc is connected and contribute for the further development of the  relationship between Araragi and Senjougahara which is the main focus of theplot and story in Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari uses each subtle detail from the dialogue lines to evidentiate  the characters traits and speech habits. To make it more realistic for the viewer the anime uses a unique camera angle to portray each character\u2019s insight on the situation or the other person  during a conversation. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is the essence for the characterization and presentation of the characters in Bake.We have Senjougahara  the cynical and cruel tsundere who says harsh words to Araragi but caring for him deep in her heart. Araragi who is a typical generic male  character but his actions and influence on other characters contribute a lot for the story and plot. Taking his time to speak with each girl and understand their problems we found out more about his traits and background story. Bake gives importance to his minor characters and uses them for the plot and the characterization of the main characters Araragi and Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\nIn each arc , the anime manages to portray aspects from the human drama and human nature. For example the Hitagi crab and Lost Snail arc portrays the disconnected relationship between children and parents from our modern society, the linger of a child to be with his mother and the harsh law that forbids him. It signals a warning about the fraud of the cults and the consequences that lead in destroying families and the accidents involving children in our modern world.\\n\\n\r\nThe other arcs take a approach on the human mind and heart portraying jealousy ,hatred ,  struggle to find a place where you belong , responsibility ,love, fear, cowardness and finally the weakness inside our mind and heart. All is done with the help of the dialogue , art animation and symbolic animal  \u201caberrations\u201d specific for each character. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Bakemonogatari is just one piece of the puzzle that makes the greater image called Monogatari series .It manages to use his characters and plot to deliver a good play using subtle details and dialogue for characterization , fanservice for the viewer but also using it properly in the plot and story , good ost and unique art style. A harem with generic characters that have so much to offer for plot and story granting entertainment for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It really would, if it focused more on the cool story. \r\nIt's like a partial SoL where your typical NEET gets all the girls for no reason and all the main characters aside from the NEET are hot girls who fall in love with him. Even a lesbian at one point more or less. Like, really?\r\nIt also tries too hard to be artistic. It's full of text that disappears so fast you'd need to advance frame by frame to read it, weird art where for no reason the people will like, turn into food or something random. Not partof a mood or playful scene or anything, it'll just be random. Flashy annoying art, art that's hard to figure out what the hell is going on, etc.\\n\r\nOtherwise it has a very nice story to it... which you come into part way through and have to piece together what happened before then... and then it ends leaving you still wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth watching despite my harsh review, but it's nothing special. I recommend this for either people who like lots of fanservice lovey dovey stuff, and for anime fans that have watched all the good animes already.",

            "content": "-Spoilers ahead, you have been warned-\r\nThe Monogatari series is about a self proclaimed loner that in his own words \"has no friends\" named Koyomi Araragi. Araragi is a former vampire, to which is a category of \"Oddity\" in the series, but still has lingering side effects after being cured such as greatly increased healing and strength. In an ironic twist, Araragi finds himself surrounded by a large cast of girls. The Monogatari series IS a harem, with Araragi's growing relationships with the girls one of the main points sold along with the cast's working knowledge of the supernatural.\r\n Bakemonogatari is broken up into five characterarcs centered around a particular girl with each arc named after said girl: Hitagi Crab, Mayoi Snail, Suruga Monkey, Nadeko Snake and Tsubasa Cat in that order. The rest of the series follows this trend with only a few rare exceptions where the arc is named after Araragi, such as Koyomi Vamp. \\n\\n\r\nThe first girl introduced in Bakemonogatari is named Hitagi Senjougahara, who Araragi catches after she slips on a banana peel, yes seriously, and falls down a flight of spiraling stairs in their shared high school. He immediately finds out that she weighs next to nothing when he catches her. She proceeds to threaten him with a stapler to not tell anyone about her condition. After she walks off, he decides to run after her and offer her his help. He takes her to the very same specialist in Oddities that helped cure his own vampirism, Meme Oshino. After a fee of 100,000 yen, a bit of exposition and some praying to a minor god, the problem is solved and Senjougahara gets her weight back. \\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series is definitely not for everyone; the series is famous for being weird, and how much the characters like to talk. While both are true, if you enjoy witty dialogue and wordplay, you won't find any issue watching this series. I personally love the Monogatari series with one of my favorite characters ever, a sassy vampire loli obsessed with donuts named Shinobu, coming from Bakemonogatari. There are few action scenes, but the character interactions are what really make Bakemonogatari and the whole series going forward shine.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've watched a fair bit of the Monogatari series now, so I'm coming back to this to give it a review.\r\nFirst off, Bakemonogatari is the worst of the Monogatari series that I've watched. There's 3 episodes out of it that I like. Episodes 1&2, and 12. The rest of the episodes can die in a fire. Also, the last three episodes have to be hunted down or pirated or whatever. I'm so disinterested in that. So I dropped the series. I don't need to listen to more speeches from Lars Ulrich about how Napster is oppressing Metallica for one thing.\r\nOnce, as a child, I gotpoison ivy all over my body. I had horrible blisters all over my body. It was still a better experience than watching Bakemonogatari. My advice would be to watch the three episodes that I outlined. Then go to pornhub to find the rest of the Monogatari experience. Although, if you're into child porn, I'm going to distance myself from you, but that's what you can expect from this show in the relationship between the lead Koyomi Araragi and the youngest victim of his harem, Mayoi Hachikuji. I think she's like 11, or something, and every time Araragi sees her, he puts on his rape face and tries to molest her. That's a true story, by the way. I found that relationship to be in poor taste and offensive. Even the Japanese have to have boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nIf, however, you are the type that likes child porn and watching paint dry, then Bakemonogatari is the right show for you.",

I'm looking forward to what will come next as the anime has this unique atmosphere that made watching it quite enjoyable.\r\nThe anime started out confusing at first, there weren't really any clear storyline. You follow a boy who survived a vampire attack as he tried to solve supernatural problems of five girls on their own arc. The simplicity of the entire thing is a good thing, you see the characters develop and interact with each other in an interesting way. Comedy was prettyaverage, romance different from other anime and all in all, it was fun to see the characters. As the story was mainly dialogue-driven, it may not suit everyone. It's fast-paced and sometimes the dialogue was boring and unrelated to the point where your mind wanders of elsewhere. But when it was good, the dialogue is thought-provoking, giving off interesting information about the supernatural of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is backed by the abstract and surrealistic art style. The minimalistic feel suited Bakemonogatari. Animation was pretty fluid most of the time but it's really good at action scenes. There was a lot of symbolism used and for me, a lot of it was difficult to grasp but that's generally not a bad thing because the whole weirdness of it all did engage my brain. The sound in this anime didn't really stand out for me and it was not distracting. Voice acting of each characters was done well, suited to their personality. I enjoyed listening to the opening songs but the ending song takes the icing on the cake, especially after I found out the meaning behind supercell's beautiful song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakemonogatari was enjoyable to watch. The anime is unique to others and that's what captivated me as I watched each episode. The story was simple and you get to enjoy the characters more. Some parts did felt useless to watch which did kind of drag on. What was the strong point of this anime? Definitely the character interactions and development.",

            "content": "Ah, Bakemonogatari. An anime which I, in my first immersion into the world of Japanese animation, never really understood. I liked it, don't get me wrong, it was - and is - a super stylish anime that makes for great AMVs, but other than that I didn't really get it and the hype arround it. So while writing this review of my rewatch after a long ass time, I realised how amazing an anime it really is.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAt first Bakemonogatari seems to share some shounen-aspects; gorgeous and cute women surround a nice but average highschooler who helps them in one way or another. That's whenthe very interesting part kicks in. The main character, Araragi Koyomi, is part vampire (around 10%) and is well connected to some sort of spiritualist named Oshino Meme. Together, they help those girls with their own supernatural troubles. It still sounds pretty basic, but the way the story is told and narrated is interesting. Each of the parts of the story (titled, for example, Hitagi snail) is both an enclosed story and a part of the overarching story. The cool thing aboput the way the story is told is that characters of an already done story have an impact on later episodes or have single episodes focused on them even though their own tale is already told. I hope that makes sense. Also, the aforementioned harem effect never really kicks in which was, admittedly, a bit unexpected when I watched it the first time.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 20/20\\n\r\nPerfect scores. The artstyle is experimental and gorgeous to look at, especially the character designs are fantastic. I know that SHAFT got shafted (heh) a lot for the copious amount of detailled shots focused on a character's eyes or our mouth which reduced the need to animate a whole body or scene, but I loved that. I was quite amazed at how smoothly and realistic stuff like twitchy eyes or speaking mouths were animated. The colour palette used on the characters was also surprisingly subdued for an anime; no garish pink or icy blue hair, no over the top clothing. The worst offender in the \"this is not realistic!\" department was Shinobu with orange eyes and that weird helmet with goggles on top. \\n\r\nThe rest of the animation was minimalistic. a lot of simple colours and repeated patterns, for example the bike parking lot in front of Koyomi's high school. It also often is a weird mxi between what looks like to be 3D rendered, cut from white paper and actual photographies. In a couple of one word attributes, I'd describe Bakemonogatari's visuals as: daring, dazzling, bizarre, experimental (as noted above) and recognizable. The last one is especially true cause as far as I know, only the Monogatari-series looks like the Monogatari-series. \\n\r\nAs for the sound, it was just perfection. Kimi No Shiranai Monogatari, the series ending, is by FAR and away my favorite ending ever. Period. ESPECIALLY after Episode 11, I think (can't tell why cause I try to keep this spoiler free). Something Bakemonogatari also does is change the opening with each arc. Of those openings, I love both Staple Staple (the first) and Sugar Sweet Nightmare (the fifth) the most. Not only is it really good pop/poprock, the lyrics also fit the character arcs pretty well. OTher than that, the soundtrack is great at increasing or erasing the tension of a situation, spice up the comedy and whatnot. On to the last point about sound, the voice actors are equally amazing, their voices fit the characters to a T. Special mentions go to Yui Horie (Hanekawa) and Chiwa Saito (Senjougarhara; I already talked highly of her in my PMMM review). Art-and soundwise, Bakemonogatari is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\r\nMy only real criticism is that in a 15 episode anime, we have 7 prominent characters and Shinobu who is sorta there. That makes eight characters for a rather short show. Compared to Madoka, those eight characters don't really have the time to develop. That being said, I like every character cause all of their issues which weigh them down are sorta relatable, in a sense. Sure, stuff like Nadeko's small snake problem is supernatural, but the reason why she has that problem in the first place is very human and, to a degree, understandable. My favorite character, by the way, is Suruga. Her arc is pretty damn cool, her design is great, her VA is stellar and her personality is just great; I love characters who tease other characters just for the hell of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's even better than I remembered. I got absorbed and was never bored; there ususally is a point in each series where going gets tough for me before it becomes interesting again. Bakemonogatari just didn't. It was entertaining 100% of the time because of how non-standard it was. SHAFT really did a great job with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2/10 \\n\r\nI highly recommend it.",

            "content": "I'm still not too good at Reviews so feedback is appreciated. Anyways onto the review of my favorite season of one of my favorite anime series, the monogatari series.\r\nStory:\r\n*Read the synopsis for some info*\r\nNow that you've read it. Lets go a bit more in depth without spoiling anything. Araragi koyomi throughout the series attempts to help those around him and they usually have Supernatural maladies/ oddities that have formed from within them whether it be from feelings or events. Throughout the story not only do you explore araragi and him as a character but also senjougahara, hachikuji, kanbaru, Hanekawa, nadeko and their struggles which somepeople while watching may relate to a feel a strong connection to. I sure know i did.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series definitely has some of my favorite character designs that do make them stand out. Not only are the characters good to look at but as well as some subtle scenes and environment shots. Also hitagi crab sure was experimental with its art and i quite liked it. (Watch hitagi crab and you'll know what i mean)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI absolutely love Hiroshi kamiya's voice work and how great he delivers every line with araragi. With the comedy, to the great conversations. Hiroshi's voice is just perfect for araragi and how he is portrayed. I don't know much about the rest of the VA (I'm sorry lol) but they do an amazing job as well, i especially love senjougahara's VA. The rest of the cast is great too. Also the OP/END, and OST are good too\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBakemonogatari's strong suit for sure. The characters i stated earlier are all explored through each arc and developed really well to the point where you would want to actually be there an interact with them. It's also so great to see each character interact with each other whether it be banter or some serious conversation. Also each character has a unique quirk to them which makes you distinguish them, makes you get some references outside of the anime like \"sorry i stuttered\". Notoriously one of the most known of the series. I definitely think every character is fleshed out pretty well. And attention is put to them when needed which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't recommend this anime enough, just go watch it if you Haven't. It's a great place to start with the monogatari series. Now what's there to enjoy? So much from the characters, to the stories that are told within each character and their background and how the Supernatural events actually have occurred. Also it's so satisfying watching the Supernatural events be resolved/dealt with and how each character goes about it. In sum, go watch, you won't regret it and you'll hopefully experience the same love that i do for this series",

Naturally i went on my laptop and just checked it out. This being (as told) my first series of monogatari.\r\nBakemonogatari (as i would call it bake later on, bleh) was an experimental series as told by my friends. After watching it, I was confused. Not about the story but more of what they were experimenting with. But still, the anime is good. Not so good to give it a 10 but good enough to be enjoyable to even thosewho are new to the series like i am. \\n\\n\r\nI like how simple the concept of the story is (Typically I am a fan of implementation over concept). Just some dude helping people out with occult stuff. That's about it. This is what made the \"experimental series\" feel less out of beta and more of final testing. Where the series isn't a big pile of ideas just left there but a well thought out brainstorm. Implementation wise, it did well as to bring the story out. It had a blend of comedy, action and to my surprise, a touch of emotions. It never to me felt like it was bland. Oversimplistic, perhaps but definitely not too predictable and boring. The touch of key studio was most apparent, turning any hateful characters into a lovable person. Most apparent in episode 1 and 2 where it literally felt like a key series (specifically rewrite in a good way). \\n\\n\r\nHowever where things starts to go wrong was at the halfway point. It wasn't bad mind you, but it felt lacking. The magic of episode 1 and 2 left me hopeful that i would be hit by this emotional endings. That soon slowly washed off as most endings seem to lack the impact delivered. Episode 9 and 10 had endings that were at best average. I was even confused whether the person they were trying to save was saved even. It just felt half made. Episode 11 and onwards soon take off again as it delivered great impact endings, with a blend of nostalgia with great emotions. It felt real. \\n\\n\r\nAction in general was implemented well enough, great tense scenes, a bit bloody but not gore yet. However it did gave a typical hint of that \"useless protagonist\" where the protagonist will look like they're losing but then somehow flipped the table. Not too much of a deal as it was properly controlled.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue was plenty excessive but i didn't felt that it was boring. There's a lot of dialogue. Constant thoughts and questions being asked. Conversations felt realistically long most of the time. Hints of comedy were placed inside. Typical comedy that includes incest jokes, lolicon jokes and ample amounts of \"hell no!\" exaggeration. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this an 8 overall. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: Great benchmark set on the first few episodes but was led down by the somewhat mediocre middle. Rescued again by the ending.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt is where is discuss the most in depth to even the outline and surrounding colour and the word to summarize my thoughts is \"Danganrompa\" or \"Different\".\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't feel the need to create a typical realistic surrounding, just threw that off the window and gave us this really unique feel of semi realism semi minimalism kind of thing. Buildings sometimes look realistic enough, sometimes look like just white patches. Signboards are redundantly excessive and really the only way to explain it is either by watching it or just knowing how danganrompa looks like. Sometimes especially nearing the ending, i was given snippets of overly realistic images of arms, eyes and bodies. (Like not even drawing, just literally someone took a picture of their arm and just placed it there). This is where i can see the experimental part comes in as it blends together literally everything that makes it different from other series. Therefore i can't really grade colour accuracy as this literally just ignores that for the sake of standing out. But i say extremely well done. A bit overhanded on the nudity maybe? \\n\\n\r\nHigh action scenes were on par with most anime. Great if you don't pixel peep. It's fast paced, full of expression and matches the POV which i would go on about later. Pixel peeping gives the usual combination of softness in outlines along with some jagged mismatched lines. But then again you shouldn't be doing that in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing i like about the series is that it sometimes uses another character's voice over a different character. Like character A is speaking with character B's voice. It's definitely something that's rare. And it gives that sort of really strangely good effect. Especially in occult based series like this.\\n\\n\r\nPOVs are really well complimented by great details. First person POVs, the one I am constantly wishing every anime implemented it more, was really apparent here. It makes immersion super easy as it feels like I am taking to the person rather than a camera. The typical frame drops in slow pans are still apparent. I love some of the pans like a cinematic pan (typically a 360 pan) which makes background objects move but keeps the target stationary. That blended with the awesome cinematic effects, kudos for using appropriate filters and that 21:9 aspect ratio. More so the great blend of shakiness (making it feel like it was handheld) only makes it even more immersive. Every POV and panning effect was used appropriately and well handled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was decent, especially for 2009 though had the issue of it lacking certain facial features and making it look like makeup was put on. One particular area did well was the eye which had good detail, but highlighting the tear duct with great exaggeration was a plus for me. Character design overall felt cartoonish, average but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the basics of the art in bake was average. Maybe a 7. But what really stood out was in how it was experimented. Blending in realism and outlandish minimalism with massive hints of danganrompa. Pair that with great panning and POVs along with cinematic immersion, i feel that it wasn't a 10 but it was so good that i didn't mind the cartoonish design of characters. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAudio was great in general. Great emphasis of dialogue audio, maybe a bit too focused which sounded a bit too direct in the face kind but it's a typical issue. Clarity was great too, didn't felt like the male's voice was too muddy or the child's voice being too high pitched and squeaky. Immersion was a mixed thing as music background is one of the best i heard. Blending in various forms of music to create different moods. It complimented extremely well. Sound effects were a meh. I would love to hear some creaky staircase or gates, or some more reverb in an abandoned building. Open areas fair better with reverb as i can hear the slight echo of a snake being dissipated into the environment. Opening and closing was overall good but i was turned away by the second OP. Suddenly turning an occult opening into a lolicon's dream. Fortunately that was the only hiccup and all of the other songs follow suit the more typical expected approach. \\n\\n\r\n9 points as i feel most of the time really immersed into the scene, 1 point off for the usual hiccups and maybe the slight quibble over the lack of certain obvious sound effects.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was generally a bit too main character focused. Some characters who appeared more often generally have good character development, others just fell short of the main character, partly due to screen on time. However for the most part, the \"tragicness\" portrayed by the characters were strong. Variety of characters are rather typical, some being a bit unexpected. The typical \"mr helpful main character\", \"the cool bro that helps you out\" (extremely likeable), \"Tsundere asshole\", \"the nerdy girl who is really helpful\" and the bunch of little girls with excessive incest hints. The unexpected part is really how the story portrays each character when under this \"tragicness\",  making even that \"tsundere asshole\" i mentioned earlier seem pitiful and lovable or \"the nerdy girl\" that is often very nice look like a very desperate depressed emo. It all comes together. It didn't feel like they were constantly playing the same role but rather as part of the person with the other half being completely different and unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this a 9, personalities were excellent, character development was mixed, some characters didn't have the time to be fully developed for maximum impact.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime. My friends were right. It is enjoyable, reminiscence of what key would have delivered. (Note: I love key series animes) I never once felt the need to skip because it was too boring. The blend of unique art design, immersive sound, lovable characters and good punch in the endings makes for an anime that could have gotten a 10. The flaws like cartoonish character design, mediocre middle half, and a wish for more consistent development for all the characters loses that 1 point. It didn't feel like it was lacking, but there is definitely hope for what I'll watch next. Nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Seriously, why can't they pick a simpler name. What a mouthful.",

            "content": "This is a review of the Monogatari Series as a whole, and not just the 1st season.\r\nStory & tone: 10/10\r\nMonogatari Series storytelling and themes are abstract, and every individual person can interpret it differently. The base story is about our protagonist, Koyomi Araragi, helping girls with apparition related issues. Every apparition in the series is however a metaphor for themes regarding the characters psyche and themes surrounding them.\r\nMonogatari is also a parody show. It parodies everything, not only directly from other anime or western media, but also from actual art styles and genres. By doing this, the shows manage to keep a very varied tonethrough the entire anime, and it can change from comical to serious in an instant.\\n\r\nThe anime also got a lot of fanservice, but compared to most series out there, it actually implements it into the story and tone of the show. There is a lot of hidden messages and gags hidden throughout the series, so be sure to keep an eye out for them. While some things might seem irrelevant, it\u2019s very likely connected to the bigger picture.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the strongest point of Monogatari, and as explained earlier, their abbaritions are often metaphors for something deeper. I reveal what this is, because finding that out, is one of many joys with this anime.\\n\r\nThe characters are also multilayered and got lots of character development. If the characters seem one dimensional at any point in the series, there is usually a reason behind it. Because the characters depicted the way they are, it allows for all of them to be both funny and interesting at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nProduction value (animation & audio): 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is what attracted me to this series so quickly. Shaft has become very known for this style, but Monogatari is without a doubt, the one where it fits the most. For a series with so much dialogue, it manages to keep the viewer engaged through the entire series, by using unique art style and camera engles. The art style is also very abstract, and often parodies something else, or reference and enhance what\u2019s happening or what\u2019s to come.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is so good, that even the characters in the series state it out to you. This solid voice acting is one of many reasons, that the characters feel so alive and different. They also do a great job of depicting the emotions of the characters. \\n\r\nThe music varies a lot, depending on both the situations and the characters on screen. It always adds a lot to the feel of the show, and drags in the user and sets the tone for both funny and serious moments. The openings also change from arc to arc, depending on what character it\u2019s focusing on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s currently my favorite series of all time, and is widely loved, for good reasons. The fanservice may turn some viewers down, and it\u2019s not a series I would recommend new anime viewers. If you want a character driven anime and want a plot where you have to connect the dots yourself, this is the anime for you. \\n",

            "content": "I'll have to say one thing in advance, if you plan on watching this anime series, if you get the feeling of WTF is going on during the first few episodes and you can't read the random rapid words flashing across the screen, it's all fine. Those things are normal. Don't try to read the words,and just go with the flow, the series style you will get used to.\r\nNow this is only my personal opinion and whether you choose to think that I'm an idiot or not is up to you.\r\nStory: The only reason I gave the story less than an 8 is because theamount of time I found myself utterly confused and lost in the series. Other than that this series is very unique, presents some tasteful fan-service when needed, and keeps you interested with plot turns and twists. Many things are left unanswered when the series ends, which is also why I plan to watch the prequel and sequel. Ignoring the amount of time I spent asking questions and being confused it was still a good anime. The story doesn't have too much flow from time to time which I find as its main flaw, but as it progresses, it grows on you. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: They were both good and unique, I enjoyed watching the animation of the theme song, and the OST complimented the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Whoo boy, now this is a tough one, there were standard personalities in this slightly harem themed anime, yet each were different ones than I have seen and were presented in their own ways. The main character especially and his hair... (You'll understand the hair bit while watching the series). Oshino is probably my favorite character being the fact that his nicknames are pretty funny, and his general aura hat he reveals. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series may seem bad to some, but it is definitely worth checking out.",

This includes great composition, amazing colors, interesting slide-show concepts, interesting use of real life objects, etc. These are all molded together into a masterpiece known as \"Bakemonogatari.\"\r\n2: A fabulous story that would make any grown man shed tears. \r\n3: An actual love subplot that isn't complete shit. The interaction between the 2 characters, who i wont mention for spoiler reasons, was really unexpected, but worked out greatly, which you will understand shortly.\\n\\n\r\n4: A brilliant cast of characters that any intelligent person would not get bored with. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this show is how there may only be like 1 or 2 characters in each episode (sometimes more, obviously).  These character could be sitting on a bench, or walking through an empty city, just talking. A lot of people say that this is \"boring,\" but i say that those people have no flare for art and do not understand the importance of dialogue. The dialogue in Bakemonogatari is very witty and should be paid attention to as much as the beautiful art. It absolutely grinds me up when someone says \"that show is boring, i dropped it.\" Don't be one of those plebeians. Please!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, those are just some basic reasons as to why Bakemonogatari is a literature masterpiece, obviously there are many others, but you will have to tackle that MONSTER yourself.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari is a truly odd, endearing show. The story revolves around Araragi a teenage boy who during Golden Week turns into a vampire. He comes across Oshino who helps him overcome his oddity and thus the real story begins. Araragi meets and helps others who have oddities affecting their lives. My only real miff is that the airing of this series is screwy, with the last episode on hiatus and I'm waiting on pins & needles for it to air! Anyways...\r\nStory: 9/10- The story deals with a lot of Japanese folklore that isn't always represented in animes. But because of that, while watching they arenew, strange customs to be learned. For example, jealousy could enrage the monkey oddity or being lost could allow for the snail oddity to attach to someone and affect all that come into contact with that person. Sometimes, however it's not always explained the relevance of the oddities, hence the 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10- The way the animation is presented is awesome. The girls, though slender are not the stereotypical big busted, big eyed characters. Throughout each episode, flashes of light & messages are brought across the screen, almost like an inner dialogue of the characters & random bits of information being passed on to the viewer. It is abstract and unique. Even still, some scenes were extremely detailed while as other scenes were simple and clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10- The OP & ED music is catchy and odd in itself. The imagery is mixed with real life and kiddie like drawings that draw interest into watching the series. The voice actors are well placed. Depending on the scene, the music really enhances what the animator is trying to portray. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10- Each character is likable for what role they're trying to fit. Araragi is by far the most interesting character, though he does fall into the not smartest, harem role he still has a quick wit and helps all with semi-perverted thoughts. Shinobu is the only character that is really dealt with. The vampire who turned Araragi but needs to be near him. Other than that, not much is known about her. Oshino is a cool character as well. He's knowledgeable but stand-offish. He tells Araragi to steer clear of the oddities and that he won't always help, but he usually aids him in each case at least a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10- Great story, unique presentation, cool characters, quirky songs & music all around make it pretty excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10- Great series I would highly recommend, but only after it has all the episodes aired so that it's easier to watch!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari reminds me of Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. It uses the medium of harem, which often involves pedophilia (viva Humbert Humbert!), to delve into the psychology of its interesting characters, inundated by puns and wordplay. I have never seen such strange and compelling dialogues and characters. They are so markedly interesting that the overall experience of this show overshadows all of its faults. \r\nThe animation is not as fluid as Space Dandy's, but its conscious usage of PP slides and strange shots manage to salvage it. If I have a bone to pick, it would be the music. The opening and ending songs were okay,but the music throughout the actual animation was very uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nIf I have to summarize my review in two sentences, it would look like this: \\n\r\nBakemonogatari is a mind-trip, and its extensive wordplay will make you want to learn Japanese. It may not be everyone's cup of tea; but, if it is, then be prepared for a hell of a ride.",

Meme Oshino, a man living in a old building, helps him become a human again, but still, in the end, Koyomi gains some vampire powers. From there on, his life changes as he starts meeting people who also have problems with ghosts, spirits, gods, monsters, etc.\r\nAbout the story/anime itself, from 1 to 10, I would give a 9 only because of my own choice of not liking much seeing the idea of watching more than one subject in a anime. Even so,Bakemonogatari is organized and interesting. It makes you want to see more and more, even if one of the arcs finish because you never know what comes next. Somehow, there is also a connection between the many arcs in the series that doesn't make you lose your interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is wonderful, if not, perfect. The many scenes in various points of view and the well expressed characters' emotions are simply amazing. It's hard to find words, it just seems more and more close to the reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is indeed beautiful. I specially love how there are multiple openings for each character/arc. The sound if soft and nice, the lyrics just reflect the character's personality/thoughts. It just fits pretty well in this anime, in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may be sometimes misunderstand, but they all have a personality. It's not only shown the virtues of them, as well the defects. Their stories are really out of the ordinary and you may sometimes get easily tricked about a character's real personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I can only finish this review by saying: Watch Bakemonogatari. This will probably be one of the best animes for the next years since the story and the art themselves are just wonderful and amusing.",

            "content": "Well... watching this was challenging for me. Monogatari series is an excellent work and the adaptation is awesome. The style and visual narrative are fantastic, but my problems are the dialogues and some of the characters.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nThe structure of the story is fascinating. It's a sequence of short arcs that follow the development of one character each. Some arcs are more interesting than others, but overall all are great. And, in some way, all the arcs converge in a big story centered around Araragi, but where each character is the protagonist of their own story.\r\nArt/Style (10/10)\r\nThe animation is good, but it's the style and thevisual narrative that are impressive. Watching this show is a bizarre experience. The scenery changes are a little confusing. The places are unreal, but with a lot of details that complement the visual narrative. It's a very strange world that feels like home. This is the most outstanding element of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nA good style/animation is always complemented with a good soundtrack, and in the case of Bakemonogatari, the background music perfectly complements the scenes. The openings are very unique, each of them reflecting the arc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nIn this aspect, my review lost his perfect note. The characters are great, I'll admit, each having a well-defined personality. The voice actors do an excellent job in every line, but some characters can get annoying. The dialogues between some of these are very arrogant, too. It's as if the dialogues were made to bother you with endless turns and pseudo-reflexions.\\n\r\nI clarify that not all dialogues are like that. Some of them are remarkable and thought provoking. The references complement the lines perfectly. Yet, some characters and some lines can make the narrative very stressful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are only the beginning. Yes, the series is great, one of the best I have seen in years. But at the same time it's the most stresful show that I watched in years. I didn't enjoyed watching Bakemonogatari, even though I love almost all episodes. I would not watch this again, but I don't regret doing it.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects\\n\r\nMaybe it has too much fanservice for me, but it's a very well-done fanservice. It's not the common type of fanservice; not very explicit, but very erotical. Even so, I would prefer the show without any, as it's unnecessary for me.\\n\r\nThe meta humor is very well-done, too. The jokes are hilarious, even if some of them are confusing. I smiled a lot watching it.\\n\r\nAnd my favorite characters are Kanbaru and Mayoi. Their interventions being comical and reflexive respectively.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of the best series that you can watch now, but the references and the storyline are not meant for everyone. You may not like this series (as you can find it stressful, like me), but I recommend giving it a shot.",

            "content": "Story\r\nThis was my third attempt to watch Bakemonogatari and I\u2019m glad to announce that it does get better. In a world of fast paced anime, it can be hard to slow down and watch a show that spends fifteen minutes of a twenty-four minute episode in the back of a car. When I say that Bakemonogatari is slow, I mean it moves at a pace slower than molasses. Characters spend whole episodes sitting around and discussing thoughts, feelings, ideologies, and plot-centric things. For some, this can be too much, but I found that the series strange directing, cinematography, and surprisingly solid script all made forexcellent watching.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi Araragi is a vampire who spends the series meeting with a variety of strange girls who are afflicted by aberrations, animal spirits who react to the girls emotions. Five story arcs follow Koyomi\u2019s exploits as he tries to help the girls through their spirit possessions and lead them back to normal lives.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is, inevitably, a harem anime. But an intelligent harem anime that presents typical characters in very different ways and the romance in a strange and interesting enough way to keep you watching and stay refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nReasonably, the series has some weaker arcs (*cough* Snake *cough*) but they all balance out in the end and I didn\u2019t find one that ever felt completely generic. There is a love triangle later on that did detract a bit, but Hanekawa is too damn cute to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the slow pace, the dialogue comes at breakneck speed. Most of it doesn\u2019t matter, but a lot of it is hilarious and some heartwarming. The romance between Koyomi and Senjougahara is\u2026interesting to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good, different, and presented strangely enough to make any of the genericism feel fresh and fun.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe most unique feature of Bakemonogatari is its\u2019 animation. While characters can sometimes look silly, they\u2019re overall very distinctive looking, as are the beautiful environments that can be hypnotizing at points. The series is chock full of visual humor and metaphor, which bulks the title up even more. It also cuts in with cue cards and quotes from the light novels, which help give a better perspective on dialogue or character\u2019s inner thoughts. This can make the show really heavy if you\u2019re unable to pause. Thankfully, none of the cards are necessary to the plot so if you are unable to pause, you\u2019re not missing too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nPretty good music overall with an emphasis on character, especially the unique openings for each story arc. The ending songs aren\u2019t too bad and the music during the show is good. As far as voices go, Black Hanekawa has the cutest voice ever. No lie.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nDespite the seemingly generic cast, Bakemonogatari, as I\u2019ve said, makes them fresh and interesting through the use of spirits and also, through lots and lots of talking. Koyomi is an alright character; he\u2019s just that boring lead that we\u2019ve all gotten used to. He\u2019s a vampire, a pervert, and can\u2019t do any wrong. Well, except for beat the shit out of a nine year old and then fondle her in the creepiest and most sadistic part of the entire series. It\u2019s sad that the most sexually and physically assaulted character in the show is a fucking loli.\\n\\n\r\nHis female companions are a little more exciting, and in the interest of following along with popular reviewing, I\u2019m going to play Best Girl, because this series is nothing more than a Best Girl game.\\n\\n\r\nBEST GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\n6. Shinobu Oshino- Shinobu doesn\u2019t have enough character to even count her in the Best Girl game for this season. I understand she becomes the best girl later or something, but this season doesn\u2019t give you much reason to love her.\\n\\n\r\n5. Nadeko Sengoku- Here is the \u201cnot really your little sister so it\u2019s okay to fuck her\u201d character that, in the end, is the least compelling girl of them all. Her character is pretty much nothing more than a love for Koyomi that lasts way longer than it should and a willingness to be perverted that is a little too much to handle.\\n\\n\r\n4. Mayoi Hachikuji- The obligatory loli. She\u2019s cute and all that but really doesn\u2019t offer much in the character department. The only reason you feel for her is because of how creepy and abusive Koyomi is to her.\\n\\n\r\n3. Hitagi Senjougahara- A tsundere of the highest degree. She\u2019s abusive, strange, and ultimately a great character. Her worst features are mostly how she borders on yandere at some points. But overall, her development with Koyomi is good and I can see that their relationship could become much stronger as the series continues.\\n\\n\r\n2. Suruga Kanbaru- Despite having a hairy demon\u2019s arm and being a completely perverted lesbian, Suruga is absolutely hilarious and adorable. Her story arc also contains an intestine swinging scene that is beyond awesome. Aside from that, she\u2019s athletic and into yaoi. She\u2019s pretty freaking awesome, but not as awesome as\u2026\\n\\n\r\n1. Tsubasa Hanekawa- Even before I found out she was a cat girl I loved her. She\u2019s so sweet and innocent with her silly catch phrase, \u201cI just know what I know\u201d. And then you find out she\u2019s a ridiculously hot cat girl with a ridiculously cute lisp who is madly in love with Koyomi. She\u2019s basically two extremes of complete adorable in one and I love her for it. She is, officially, the best girl of Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you can sit through the first few episodes and get used to the plodding pace and dialogue-heavy scenes, you\u2019ll be hooked. The intelligent script, unique style, and great use of comedy all add up to a hefty package with enough merits to keep you watching well into the night. Bakemonogatari definitely has some problems, but it\u2019s an overall great example of how to make a unique, stylish, and memorable harem anime.",

It is not for everyone; nonetheless, any veteran anime watcher should have heard about the Monogatari series. \r\n   The story starts of slow and takes a different approach on everything you know about supernatural anime. Our MC Arararararararararararararararagi brandishes a pen rather than a sword(even though there's a sword...) for the direction of his problem solving, which gives the watcher-reader a more in-depth comprehension on the situation. The show implements a large amount of metaphors and fast pop-upsto keep you interested while slowly progressing through the conflicts. 7/10, because it is very hard to get into but very worth it. \\n\\n\r\n   Shaft's art and sound is the best. By taking out the background characters, you focus on the conversions easier. The music is fitting for each scene and I have no complaints in these catagories.  10/10\\n\\n\r\n   The characters drive the show. If you don't find Koyomi interesting than the show may not be for you (different POV's are taken the the second season, however). Each girl is likeable and they're interesting in their own right. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   I did not enjoy the series for the first few arcs, and its a pain to watch multiple in order (until you're engulfed in the brilliance).\\n\\n\r\n   Overall, 84/100, a great show that is a welcome change to other supernatural shows and definately worth it for any seasoned anime watchers.",

To be honest in the first season (being this one, well at least this is the first one that came out :P) You won't get answers to your questions but if you decide to join in on the epic story that is the monogatarie series you will with time find answers to your questions. The anime gotmultiples seasons all talking about different ''chapters'' but are all linked by the characters. Later on you will understand how certain things are important even if they didn't look like they would be. There is also movies containing more information about the ''before'' of the story. This series will also intruce you to multiple characters that in my opinion are all great. The different style of the anime is easy to find, its different in its way of showing you things and its making you slowly but surely understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end i found that the monogatarie series is probably one of my favorite series of all time.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nBakemonogatari is really a curious anime. It is a dialogue driven anime, which may put off some viewers but I especially enjoyed this aspect.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe concept of this anime is strange, but not in a bad way. Unlike most animes, Bakemonogatari delivers content mostly through the exchanges between the characters. Being an atmospheric anime, the plot seemed confusing at first glance. However, the plot soon picks up and I was kept interested. As expected, the general pace is slow but works well with the art to create a tense mood. Although minuscule, a complaint would be that the arcs felt disjointed.\r\nArt 9/10\r\nThe artwas most certainly unconventional. SHAFT worked with walls of text, real life snippets, unique camera angles and abstract art to end up with something that would fit in perfectly at a contemporary art house. A rather sombre palette of colours were used in the background, creating a striking contrast with the playful colours of the foreground.The end product is a slightly pretentious yet fascinating animation which served well to capture the attention of the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI admire the fact that every arc had its own opening theme, which was a nice touch. The background music complemented the art well and provided a means to heighten the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were developed well and in a natural way. Through the course of this anime, we see the relationships between characters progress. Bakemonogatari does well to distinctly draw out the character traits of each character. The character designs were fresh and unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI was kept engaged by the captivating art and the suspenseful nature of this series. At times the pace was a little slow for my liking but I still enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is considerably subjective. I think it is important to experience an episode or two before coming to a conclusion on this anime. I would recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "Well, I'm hooked. And this is only the beginning.\r\nFirst of all, mad props to the visual style. Shaft went all-out on this. The very medium feels like it's aggressively weird, and it fits the content of the story so perfectly that it's hard to hate it, even though avant-garde styles tend to rub me the wrong way personally.\r\nAurally, the show is a delight. Each OP, of which there are a whopping five spread out over 15 episodes, is powerful and revealing. Big ups to Nadeko's \"Greed Circulation\" which is probably the best one of the bunch, with the fluffy upbeat tune and imagery hiding thepoisonous words in the lyrics, foreshadowing the truly terrifying girl underneath the cute demeanor. The ending song is also wonderful, tying into an extremely touching scene toward the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast, littered with all-stars like Kana Hanazawa and Chiwa Saitou, put forth a stunning performance from start to finish. From Hitagi's blunt seriousness to Suruga's genki girl fighting spirit to Koyomi's reluctant diligence in helping others, everyone puts up fantastic performances. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Bakemonogatari spring to life, none moreso than Hitagi Senjougahara, who seems less like a manga character and more like an actual, real-life person. Traumatized without being overdramatic. Serious but not boring. Lovable but very decidedly not moe. She's the star of the show, a standout in a series full of great characters, and steals the scene nearly every time she enters the frame.\\n\\n\r\nStorywise, well...this is only the first season. It's meant to show you how this group of oddity-fighting comrades came together, and it does so in a fashion that keeps you engaged even if it is rather formulaic. Outside of Koyomi's own interactions, and Suruga's ties to Hitagi, the girls don't get much chance to interact with each other through the 15-episode run, which is something to look forward to in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc of the story focuses on a different character, and the oddity making their lives miserable. What do you do when a crab made of spirit steals your weight? What do you do when your left hand has suddenly become a grotesque monkey's paw? These are the problems that Koyomi has to deal with, and they're tackled in a novel way: talking and planning, not direct fighting, is more often than not the way to take these supernatural forces down, and despite that the show never bores. The guys at work at Shaft never fail to excite with visual metaphors and haunting imagery to keep up the pacing even during even the most lengthy of dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi's inner monologues are the main source of exposition throughout. They are alternatively humorous, insightful, cutting, and sometimes a little risque. Still, he's what makes this machine tick, and despite his obvious faults as a human being, he's still very much a sympathetic and dare I say awesome character. You want him to succeed in spite of his flaws, and that's what every protagonist should be.\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints outside of the inherent limitations of translating a work that places a serious premium on beautiful wordplay from its original language to English. And I can't fault the work for that. The translators have done all they can, but some things are inevitably lost in translation if you don't have something of an ear for Japanese. Still, that shouldn't keep anyone from checking out one of the best, most intellectual and yet emotionally charged stories I've seen in the anime world.",

            "content": "Literary mediums being used as something to just make you forget about your life is nothing uncommon. You just want to get sucked up into these worlds, hoping for some solution to just appear right in front of you. I know, because I've felt that way many times. However, watching the Monogatari series makes it clear that such a miracle is few and far between and hammers home one point: the only person who can ever truly save you is yourself. This is my first review on this site and, as such, I'd like to talk about a series that is just one of thoseworks that resonated with me strongly. This is going to be a review of the entire franchise. While the arcs obviously differ in quality, it is also apparent that the basic execution of the show stays the same for the most part (though there is only so much you can do stylistically to rectify arcs purely intended for fanservice *cough* Nisemonogatari *cough*).  \\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe premise of the Monogatari franchise is simple; 1/10th vampire Koyomi Araragi is tasked with helping those experiencing problems with supernatural entities known as aberrations. The initial episodes allude us to his past before he was turned into a vampire. These episodes however, can feel slow and uninteresting, as the lack of context will most likely confuse a first time viewer. This can mean that it has great rewatch value though, since you may want to revisit the subtle hints they display as soon you see the surprises the show has in store. That being said, Monogatari is a character-driven narrative. If you're looking for a gripping or engaging plot, this is not going to be for you. A majority of the emotional scenes come from a character's personal decision and resolution. There are certain bits of comedic or out of topic dialogue, but they never do anything more than to flesh out a character's perspective or worldview. Internal conflict takes center stage here. We see the character's struggles with the aberration, how it escalated to that point, and their initial approach to it.  Even the external conflict is used as a device to give further exposition to a character's internal conflict, usually Koyomi's. Overall, it is a decent premise and there aren't any illogical events as far as anyone's concerned (as illogical as you can get in-universe anyway). Conflicts are resolved realistically and help further a character's progression. \\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nBeing character-driven, Monogatari's narrative entirely depends on its characters. While not perfect, its characterization of the main cast is some of the best I've seen in the medium. I'll go through three central characters: Koyomi, Hitagi Senjougahara, and Tsubasa Hanekawa in detail.\\n\\n\r\nKoyomi Araragi - Koyomi, at first glance, seems like your typical anime protagonist. He has special powers in the form of being part-vampire, is incredibly nice, and girls like him because of it. However, underneath those traits lies a more guilty and cynical side to him, as he constantly judges himself as a useless person undeserving of what is given to him. He constantly sacrifices himself for others as a result. He believes himself to be unimportant and chooses to put others over him, making him seem like a false hero.He is without a doubt one of my favorite leads in all of anime and his character arcs just highlight why he feels guilty about these things excellently.\\n\\n\r\nHitagi Senjougahara - At first glance, Hitagi comes off as just another tsundere with an abrasive tongue. She is helped by our protagonist and begins to open up to and develop feelings towards him. If that sounds one-dimensional as fuck, I can agree with you. But what makes her an amazing character is the exposition given to us in her arc, Hitagi Crab. She also seems aware of Koyomi's lack of care for his own well-being, as she tries her best to return the favor for him helping her. In doing so, we learn three things about her character: her playful nature, her intuition (for noticing Koyomi's complex), and her pride.\\n\\n\r\nTsubasa Hanekawa - Hanekawa is an interesting subversion of your perfect student council president. She's nice, smart, and beautiful. Koyomi himself states that she is the most perfect woman you will ever meet. Like Koyomi though, there is a lot more to her persona than what meets the eye. She actually faces a lot of pressure from maintaining her image. However, she's never let out all this pent-out frustration, and instead manifests into an aberration known as Black Hanekawa, her alter-ego which voices out the real Hanekawa's stress and frustration and often goes to extreme lengths on order to remove the source of it. Her character arc is another one of the best parts in Monogatari, as she must learn to accept her faults and internal problems in order to truly grow as a person.\\n\r\nThis would be an easy 10 if some characters didn't get the shaft (no pun intended) and instead had their stories turned into character arcs for our leads, but I digress. Such an approach would've made certain side characters more than just their external behavior, but considering that they rarely appear, I suppose it is better this way.This would be too long if I gave more character descriptions, so I'll just say my other favorites include Kaiki Deishuu, Ougi Oshino, and Nadeko Sengoku.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nEver since Akiyuki Shinbou came into SHAFT, they have molded their identity as a studio in his image. I am no animation student, so I cannot discuss his choices in full detail, but I would like to say the Monogatari Series tries to be good in a different way. Tatsuya Oishi, one of Shinbou's proteges, gave Monogatari the aspects that made Shinbou's previous works so weirdly endearing and turned it up to 11. From the action cards, shading, shot composition, shift between animation styles, Monogatari, at the very least, looks memorable in how it tries to be different. There are also subtle visual metaphors that I cannot mention as they are considered spoiler territory, but try to mind how each scene is constructed with regards to the perspective of each character. This is best showcased in Monogatari Series: Second Season. Not everyone will like this animation style, but this is definitely something that appeals to my tastes.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThis is a purely subjective part of the review. In my opinion, the majority of the OP's are memorable and are animated fantastically, while the ED's are less so (though Kimino Shiranai Monogatari in Ep. 12 was just on-point and was an amazing conclusion to one if not the best episode in the franchise). As for the background music, I don't recall anything of note other than Kaiki Deishuu's theme. As for the actual sounds themselves, I can't really comment since I'm not adept at technical audio aspects such as sound mixing or sound design. The most I can say is that each episode sounds fine and don't feel grating to my ears. \\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI'll keep this really short, since none of you should (rightfully so) care about my personal enjoyment. Yeah, you can probably tell from my profile picture, my username, and my MAL profile that I just absolutely love this show. The wordplay and dialogue is hilarious, and the characters are endearing and memorable. The really weird art style added a lot to my experience. \\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10 \\n\r\nI know this isn't a series for everyone, but if anything in this write-up interested you even remotely, then please go ahead and check it out. If for nothing else, the animation style will stand out as something different from your average show.",

            "content": "Reviewing Bakemonogatari is like critiquing a piece of art. It is subjective to anyone who watches it. So, for your information, those who dislike long dialogues, complicated plot lines, extremely confusing timelines and somewhat weird fan service, please proceed to the nearest exit... Are they all gone? Okay lets go.\r\nStory 8/10: \r\nBakemonogatari is divided into 5 rather unique and different arcs, with different girls with supernatural beings and tones. Starting with a strong opening arc with Senjougahara, until the last arc with Hanekawa. Majority of the story revolves around Araragi trying to find a \"Happy ending\" for all of the girls he encountered throughoutthe series. Through conversations, arguments and debates the story moves forward in a rather slow but steady phase that leads up to the conclusion of each arc. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nI would say that Bakemonogatari was spot on in this category. The play of colors in the environment, designs of each and different character, fluid animation and sometimes poking fun of anime art style from different eras for their comedic tone, and just as I said from the beginning, Bakemonogatari is an art. As I watched the anime, I felt that some of the scenes can actually be displayed in an art museum for everyone to see. In short, it is great art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: \\n\r\nThe soundtracks in this anime are, should I say, timing base. From a mysterious tone during some confrontation moments to comedic tone during the random and carefully placed comedy segment. It pulls you in and heightens your anticipation for what is about to come. \\n\r\nHowever, the most important thing in this anime is their voice acting. I would proclaim now that without topnotch voice actors/actresses, this anime would be so tedious that no one will ever finish it. Their voices gave the different characters first impactful impressions, Senjougahara with her somewhat monotone, sarcastic and mellow voice, Araragi with his confident and playful tone, Kanbaru with her boyish with a hint of perversion and so on. \\n\r\nThe OP in this anime can also give some insight into the main character with each and every arc have their own OP. That said 4th OP Ranai Circulation became somewhat of a phenomenon for both anime and non-anime communities which, I would say, deserves a round of applause. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: \\n\r\nBoy! this is going to be fun. To sum up quickly, all of the characters in this series have their own unique characteristics, designs, and backstories that open up an ever expanding story line. Our main character, Araragi Koyomi, with our main heroin, Senjougahara Hitagi are like magnets. At first their attraction might seem forced to some and weird for the others. But as the story goes on we can see them understanding their differences and help each other through thick and thin. \\n\r\nMy personal favorite interaction between the two is always the time that Senjougahara intentionally makes fun of Araragi to extract that comedic duo vibe and made me laugh out loud like a maniac or during the time when they were just alone and had a heart-to-heart conversation. It can really warm up your heart and made them more relatable. With that being said, all other 4 different girls in different arc also have weird and interesting interactions with Araragi especially when it comes to Hachikuji. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nAs a reviewer of Bakemonogatari who went into the series blind with no context whatsoever. I would say this out loud. This anime is not for everyone. It\u2019s not for heavy fan service lovers and also not for non-complicating plot line lovers. Some of the dialogues go really fast that sometimes I needed to rewatch it again for me to understand it. As a foreigner who doesn\u2019t speak Japanese, some of the word plays are also lost in translation. But after all of this I really do enjoy this anime and would definitely recommend it to anyone out there who would want to try out something different for a change. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: \\n\r\nOverall this is a solid anime and I would compare this to a bowl of spaghetti. When you eat the newly cooked spaghetti it is good and delicious but sooner or later you will get full of it put it away as a leftover. Later on, you will then ponder \"maybe I should eat that spaghetti again\". You went to the fridge, take out the bowl and even without reheating you eat the spaghetti. Then you realize how wonderful and delicious it is. You might not agree with me and find it disgusting but this principle can also apply to this anime. Some might like it, others might not. You be the judge. I strongly recommend you to watch this. I give this anime a big thumbs up. \\n\r\nThank you for reading this long review. I will eat my spaghetti now\\n\r\nFresh26564-was here",
