            "content": "You're probably aware of the fact this anime is gettin' pretty low scores and most of the people who review it keep complaining about same stuff. No coherent plot, weak character development, rushed storytelling, blah blah blah. \r\nWell, well. That's all cool and stuff, but why don't we show the other side of the coin, too. By the way, I'm a guy, straight and all. K is manly stuff, k. (fakken pun)\r\nStory: 9 Simply put, this story is great. It's not the most original story of all times, but it isn't a complete cliche either, as many would like you to believe. \r\nSee, the thingabout K is that it sells a really TRAGIC, DARK, DEEP and SOUR story of betrayal, friendship, and sacrifice, in a shiny package so that the general audience would be satisfied with 'hot' bishies, tits and cool animation, while some people, like myself, can still enjoy it for what it really is. \\n\r\nI won't say anything else about the story's content, since you can clearly see it in the series description.\\n\\n\r\nPeople complain about not knowing what is the sword of Damocles, or where the King's power come from and what not. Those same people give Evangelion a score of 10 even though it's full of randomly chosen cool sounding terms from Bible and what not. Compared to Eva's sea of dead scrolls and Lance of Longinus, K's sword of Damocles is much more relevant to the story and actually serves as a foreshadowing to the show's overly dark culmination. \\n\\n\r\nDo note however, that the pacing in the beginning is rather weak, which is completely understandable considering the character cast and time frame in which the story had to be presented. Pacing improves in the next half of the show, leading to ones of the most epic scenes of this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 One word, gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 Outstanding, fits the mood perfectly, and overly improves the viewer's enjoyment. Not much else to say, except that this series has one of the greatest ED songs in last few years, not counting Fate/Zero's endings, of course. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 100000\\n\\n\r\nLook, don't trust people who'll tell you that this show has weak character development or that the characters are generic. Considering that K has only 13 episodes, and it's cast is freakin' huge, the characters are pretty much the soul of this show. Their interactions, personalities, lives and motives, ability to make you both laugh and cry, all that makes them pretty much the most memorable characters I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\r\nK's characters are not the fanart you see on Pixiv and Zerochan. They may look gorgeous, perfect, flawless and shallow, but actually, they're just flawed, tragic and ultimately human reflections of us all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10  Obviously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\\n\r\nGet mad all you want, but K gets a pure 10 from me. This anime is not what it looks like at the first glance. It's not what you think it looks like under it's shiny package either. It's a tragic tale of a group of people who share a bond thicker than blood, a bond that will eventually lead them into becoming more human than humanity itself. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "K can be best described as a poorly baked cake covered with an excessive amount of icing. One can look at this cake and view it to be extremely succulent and sweet on the exterior, but after tasting it, one may find dissatisfaction from cake's lack of quality. Just like this cake, K attempts to attract viewers with its beautiful visuals and flashy soundtrack like icing, but the poor quality of an inconsistent story that felt rushed can dispel the exterior beauty and leave viewers sick to the stomach.\r\nUpon viewing K for the first time, it is hard to disagree that it looks beautiful. Kperfectly portrays the gorgeous aesthetics of an urban city landscape with tall majestic skyscrapers, bustling pedestrians in every street, and an abundance of detail in every nook and cranny. To add to K's beauty, is the addition of a very refreshing and versatile soundtrack that perfectly captures the emotions of each scene. The music in K includes a large range; from soft melodic piano pieces, to intense electronic beats and mellow hip-hop. The music is implemented in a very sophisticated manner and never feels out of place or repetitive. This wonderful combination of visual and audio appeal reinforces the sense of beauty of K.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough K looks beautiful, one must be cautious of its beauty. The beautiful appeal of K is only icing on the cake and the actual quality of the cake itself may be a different story. K's biggest drawback would be the attempts to implement a wide cast of characters. Since K revolves around the theme of gang rivalry and leadership, the multiple characters from the different clans carry a large focus within the story and although this can be very exciting, the attempts have gone to waste due to the short time given in the space of thirteen episodes and lack of definition. The many characters are given many scenes such as flash backs or fan-service that attempt to reinforce their personalities and shine them in a likable manner. This is possibly the strongest element about K, but this turns out messy as many characters that are given lots of screen time hold no significance in the story whatsoever, leaving the story to be rushed and full of holes to fit the span of thirteen episodes. K gives side characters a chance to shine, but these efforts leave viewers wondering why these pointless characters are given so much screen time when the time itself could have been used to improve the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, K is extremely comparable to a cake. Too much time and effort was spent on trying to sweeten the cake, but the limited amount of time has left it undercooked. One may think that this cake is a failure, but in absolute truth, it is not. An undercooked cake is not ruined and can still be enjoyed, this is very similar to the essence of K as it all comes down to one's sweet tooth. Although the story of K felt rushed and messy, the character interactions and personalities truly sweetened this anime and the excessive amount of icing on this cake can also add to the appeal. If you're interested in an anime that not only looks and sounds beautiful, but goes in-depth of exploring different character relationships and personalities, this anime is for you. However, if you're looking for an anime with a consistent and well written storyline, you should look elsewhere.",

            "content": "First review coming up, K?! (pun intended)\r\nStory: 9\r\nAt its core, K is a story about finding the identity of a murderer and its implications in an ongoing war between superpowered clans.  Elements of sci-fi, fantasy and mystery are combined to make for a very appealing package.  In my opinion, the first few episodes don't really explain much, but they leave enough questions unanswered to make you keep coming back for more.  I suppose it may be to give the viewer the same feeling that the protagonist Yashiro would get from having his daily life changed so suddenly.  However, the story reallypicks up in the latter half and overall was simply very exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\r\nThe animation for K is absolutely amazing.  GoHands really impressed this time.  The backgrounds are highly detailed and the setting allows for some beautiful shots of the city and the island.  Reflections and lighting are done expertly, even if at times it looked a little too bright.  I also really like the character designs in K - everyone looks great and the SCEPTER4 uniforms are a notable highlight.  Additionally, the OP and ED sequences are highly stylised and great to watch, meshing well with the songs chosen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nK has fantastic music - among the best I've heard for a while.  There are many great tracks and they are used well to enhance the feelings of the scenes.  Some of my personal favourites are the main theme, which was also used in one of the PVs; and the ED song, performed by Neko's seiyuu.  I think having the character songs play in the background for the next episode previews was a particularly nice touch.  The voice acting was top notch, with plenty of big names such as Sugita Tomokazu and Ono Daisuke, to mention a few.  Across the board, they really succeeded in bringing out the characters' personalities and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in K are one of the main driving forces of the series.  Much of the plot revolves around Yashiro, who at first appears to be just another happy-go-lucky high school student thrown into the midst of a gang war he knows nothing about.  Kuroh is more tough and composed, and his seriousness is a nice contrast to Yashiro's carefree personality.  K also presents us with an interesting dynamic between the Blue and Red Kings - they fight on opposing sides, but seem to be more than just simply enemies.  The only possible flaw I found was that Neko's character didn't really get enough elaboration; it almost seemed like she was just included because her powers were needed for the story.  The focus moves between the various sides so we get to see events unfold from several perspectives.  The characters do develop well throughout the show, with some interesting revelations, though due to the 13-episode length, some may find that not everyone got fully fleshed out.  However, the manga prequels make up for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nK was a very enjoyable series.  There weren't as many fight scenes as I would have liked, but every time I did see some action it just looked incredibly cool.  Whilst the premise may not be entirely unique, K had more than enough flair, intriguing story and compelling characters to keep me hooked until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nFor me, K was an amazing series that just got better and better with every episode I watched.  If you like supernatural action with an interesting identity mystery attached - you should definitely watch K.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!  Please give feedback if you found it helpful ;)",

            "content": "Art and Animation: 9\r\nI'll start out by writing about the positive aspects of this anime, which is obviously the art and animation quality. Fantastic fluidity to motions. Very active scenes and active bodies. The color usage is bold and nothing to overlook, however, I did start to find the experimental color gradient to be a little bit of an eyesore at times. Yet, at other times it was definitely effective in setting the mood. The characters were cleanly drawn with slim, delicate figures. Smaller details such as clothing design and the cityscape are fun. \r\nCharacter: 6\r\nThe show is similar to Durarara! in that it incorporatesa medley of characters in a crowded city with some magical powers sprinkled in. When I saw the plethora of characters, I didn't expect to get a character driven story. And it wasn't. Unlike Durarara!, which was given 24 eps to tell its story, K-Project only got 13. The characters weren't given enough time to truly shine individually, but that is not to say that they weren't able to shine in conjunction with other characters. The relationships between Shiro and Kuroh, Mikoto and Reisi, and Misaki and Fushimi were good enough to add a little complexity to the characters and story. But the number of characters did leave me a bit overwhelmed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of the soundtrack, OP, or ED. But I can't say the music was bad. It was average for an anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the part that explains why this anime failed. The story, in short, is too messy and poorly developed. Even though it's supposed to be a mystery about Shiro trying to understand his identity and amnesia, I found myself more drawn to the gang war between the red and blue teams. Yet, that part of the story was never fully developed enough and left me in the dark as to why they were fighting so much. Part of the mythology of the anime revolves around the colors and the powers that come with them. I would have liked to get a crash course on the history and involvement of these powers in their reality. When the mystery is revealed, the resolution is unsatisfying. You couldn't get a strong feel as to why the main antagonist is the way he is, because they spent so little time developing him. There are many subplots, which would have been okay, except that this is a 13 episode anime. Most of the subplots were let to ease to an end instead of approached and dealt with properly. This left me feeling a bit bereft and questioning the whole point of building this whole maze of story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI got bored with it halfway through but kept going because it's not bad enough for me to drop. It took me a while to complete it because I got involved with other animes. Despite the incredible visuals, the poorly written story and flat characters failed to enthuse me. The cluttered storyline and mythology kept me confused most of the time as I was trying to play keep up with all the little subplots and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad anime, but it is an example of an anime trying to take on too much at the same time and failing miserably. I would say that maybe if it was given 24 or more episodes, it might have been able to rescue itself. But its biggest flaw was trying to fit a 24 eps story into 13 eps.",

            "content": "Beautiful art and appealing soundtracks. You're probably thinking, \"This will be amazing!\", right? Well it isn't. There are many flaws and factors that drags K down from being a well done anime to a below average one.\r\nLet us start with a close look at the story. Our hero, Isana Yashiro, goes on an errand one day and is suddenly attacked by a group of men on the streets. It is later revealed that he is blamed for a murder that he does not remember committing. An interesting plot with a decent bit of potential behind it.\r\nEverything is fine until we realize the plot comes toa complete standstill. After many questions and events are raised, we come to the mid-way point of K. That is when it becomes apparent that the anime is not going anywhere. As this dreadful standstill is happening, more and more questions arise every episode. Plot twists are added as an attempt to make everything more bearable, but it just adds to the confusion. To remedy this situation, the creators tried to cram all of the answers in to the last few episodes. The result was a rushed ending with plot holes left floating around everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the story, i'd have to say it was a complete mess that was painful to watch. The creators wanted to make the anime more interesting and unique by continuously adding elements to their plot, but they ended up dropping the ball big time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are supposed to have vibrant characteristics and at least seem somewhat realistic. That is because to get the most enjoyment out of a story, we must be able to connect and feel with the characters. I was not able to do that with anyone in K.\\n\\n\r\nAs an attempt to make the characters seem as cool as possible, they were all given silent and complex personalities. We get no insight into what the characters are actually thinking, and the minimal dialog is of little help as well. They are so unnatural and impossible to figure out. Most of them are like emotionless statues that just talk occasionally for the sake of being alive. There is also a severe lack of character growth and development that destroys any chances left of connecting with the characters.The creators tried too hard and ultimately made the characters too complex and just plain uninteresting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the storytelling in K was horrid, the visuals and music were of the highest grade. The BGMs had a nice ring to them, and the surreal backgrounds had my eyes glued to the screen for every second of every episode. Character animations and fight scenes were extremely detailed to the point where i have nothing but praise for them.Since it would be annoying to listen to me ramble on about the art, i will just leave it at that. All you need to know is that i thought it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my eyes and ears were indeed very entertained with K, my brain was moaning from boredom and distress for a significant portion of the time. My enjoyment was greatly derailed by the plot and characters. Good art and music was the only thing that kept me going.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i have no choice really but to condemn this anime. It was simply uninteresting and poorly done. Perhaps they focused too much on how it looked and totally forgot to write a story until the last minute. Either way, i would only recommend watching this if you are very curious about it.",

            "content": "I love K! I love it for the fact that the series seems almost like watching rainbows without an actual way of expressing itself at first, especially regarding its artwork. It's almost like the directors are indirectly saying, \u201clet's throw some cool animation and shit and get the audience to watch this!\" Sure, there is a plot but it's just way too slow. I'm not exaggerating here but K is a series that just doesn't work out right at all. For those of you reading this, you might agree and some of you might not. Anyways, let's begin shall we?\r\nLet's start by asking ourselves...what is\u201cK\u201d? \\n\\n\r\nWell, K is an original series that began airing in the Fall of 2012. It's animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki. He is also responsible for some of the character designs for the series. The series apparently also has manga adaptations with a prequel known as K: Memory of Red. Well, anyways, the series is quite mysterious...\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, what the hell does \u201cK\u201d actually stand for? \\n\\n\r\nSome of the titles of the episodes suggest things such as \u201cKnight\u201d, \u201cKitten\u201d, \u201cKill\u201d, \u201cKey\u201d, Karma\u201d, etc. I often wonder why it's like this. Sure the titles might give off some hints. Example: episode 2 titled Kitten is dedicated to Neko-chan who is..a cat or kitten. However, most of them are rather vague and leaves it to the viewers' imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, what the hell. Are the directors serious here? No, that's not even a serious question because the story of K is a joke, one that's not entertaining at all. We begin the first episode with Shiro apparently framed for murder. From there on and out, the series becomes a sort of cat-and-mouse scenario where he gets hunted down. But then, there are the side episodes and occasionally flash backs involving other characters. I have to say that this does NOT work out right. It's like trying to cook a dish without the proper ingredients.\\n\\n\r\nThink of it this way. You want to make a pizza. You have the dough, the ingredients, the oven, etc. Then, when the time comes to make it, the pizza turns into shit because it's mixed in the wrong way. K is no different to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOh but that's not all. K also tries too damn hard. It resorts to using some plot twists and thriller like sequences but it doesn't work. Why? The series' scriptwriting is just awful. The plot is revealed but what is the main purpose of it? I almost feel like nothing when I'm watching this series. It's slow with a capital S. S for shit in the storyline department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nAlmost, all the characters in my opinion lacks something or has qualities that are cliched, generic, and not done right. Let's take a look at our three main protagonists starting with the kid who has been on the run from the very beginning:\\n\\n\r\n*Yashiro \"Shiro\" Isana \u2013 he is the happy and outgoing guy of the series. He often makes jokes but at the same time is quite respectable to his peers and classmates. There is a big secret about this character but we don't find that out till nearly the very end. \\n\\n\r\n*Kuroh \"Black Dog, Kuro\" Yatogami \u2013 this guy even has a side story dedicated to him. Talk about being on the spotlight! But anyways, Kuroh is pretty much the opposite of Shiro. A few words that can describe him are \u201cquiet, mysterious, haughty, caring, loyal, and courageous\u201d. Yet at the same time, he lacks a personality. Seriously, he doesn't have much of a personality at all except when he interacts with the two main protagonists. \\n\\n\r\n*Neko \u2013 Oh who am I kidding here, this is probably one of the reason why more than 80% of the demographic are watching the series. Neko is a very energetic young girl with a curious personality like a cat. Curiosity killed the cat? Neko actually brings that expression to reality in a few times when she acts before she thinks. She's got a million dollar body but a 2-cent brain. She doesn't like to wear clothes and often times or not, clings onto her beloved \u201cShiro\u201d as she likes to call him. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters seems to play roles only in action rather than in the actual story, the one that moves ridiculously slow. The Red King and Blue King clashes in the latter half of the series but once again, it's cliched with the usual egoistic talk and dragged monotone speeches. The righteousness from the Blue King also seems ironic since he wishes to protect the students yet his group is responsible for the danger of their lives in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 8\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I admit it. The artwork of the series is amazing. It's like you're in a dream where everything is colorful and presented in a way that is at cinema level. The blue aura backgrounds and the characters' outfit designs makes them look like bosses and gives off that cool feeling which is one of the positives of the series. It is no doubt that the artwork and visuals represents the highlight of the series. Pretty cool designs I'd say even though some of the clothing doesn't look too original. Yes, I'm looking at you, Full Metal Alchemist and Tegami Bachi.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack/Music: 7\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not up to the art standards, the soundtrack of the series is well presented. Some of the OST are pleasant to listen to whether it's a dramatic, action, or emotional scene. The opening song , \"King\u201d, by angela is also well performed where it depicts a montage of the main as well as the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song though is just a slap in the face. We see..well, mostly Neko wearing almost nothing as she doesn't like to wear clothes making suggestive poses. It's just pure fan-service and nothing more. Once again, it tries to use its visuals to do the talking rather than expressing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series deserves a \u201c5\u201d. The story is so damn slow and the characters give generic a whole new meaning. Luckily, the soundtrack and artwork makes up for this. Yet, at many stances, I feel that K isn't doing a right job of progressing its episodes. Although the plot eventually reveals itself, it shouldn't make an excuse to make the audience wait. Now, I'm not saying this series is the worst garbage ever created. If you enjoyed the series, then do what makes you happy. However, K did not live up to its expectations. At first, I thought I was watching some good bullshit from K but that doesn't seem to be the case now. K is just bullshit and I can't recommend this to anyone. \\n",

            "content": "K is a weird action anime with relatively high production values. It follows the story of a young boy named Shiro who murdered some random guy who was pretty much a big deal except Shiro didn't kill him because he has an alibi, but everyone thinks he killed him until they get to know his alibi but then Shiro remembers he did kill him or something but he didn't because he has an alibi. The story still makes sense very much, at least if we compare the story to the characters action's which frankly reminds headless chickens. \r\nThe characters of this series run all overthe place slapping other's shit because they simply can. Which is obviously just cool because the characters are such awesome, awe-inspiring badasses who don't need any logic whatsoever during their shit. While that would be somewhat true and something to appreciate in some series, K does it completely.. awkwardly. You see K's main element is not action like everyone falsely assumed - it's on the genres so duh - but it's main elements are actually bishonen, neko, fanservice aand.. wait for it... shonen ai. You can check this from ANN if my way of putting it doesn't seem trustworthy. These themes do not make it by any means awesome, but what it manages to create is an overwhelming amount of gayness. I'm not a homophobic, but I have no reason to appreciate a series which is relying on a fujoshi fanbase and other people with the weirdest fetishes. Pretty sure Japan appreciates this, though. \\n\\n\r\nK is also ripping off Durarara, even the character design of Izumo Kusanagi is a direct copy of Shizuo. What they also seem to be following closely is the awful pacing. Nothing happens beyond fanservice and some random slapping. If something else actually happens then that something is simply said nothing. Let me give an example of what this \"nothing\" is and how the characters make sense. Some \"bad guy\" appears to Shiro's house, tries to kill him but ends up chasing Shiro around the town. Then suddenly magically we are back to Shiro's house and all of the characters lie on the floor because they are exhausted. Then this so called bad guy does what? Well makes them some dinner and they eat of course. Approved? lolno. During all of this there is some cat-neko-girl-thing being there with Shiro without any real reason, lying there naked most of the time, making weird noises and expression which someone would call cute or sexy. As tasty as it might sound it is actually just.. meh. \\n\\n\r\nAfter mocking K this much you might be thinking why I'm still bothering to watch this series. I didn't found any of this too annoying since I stopped taking the series seriously in the beginning, but what I really liked was the animation, which is rather cool and original. On a first impression it seemed like a fresh air and something you don't see every day in anime, making the series worth of watching from my part even though I already found it bad. Bad but entertaining. But then K failed completely from that part as well. On episode 5 great fight scenes happened and oh boy, the word lameness got a new meaning. Describing that scene with mere words and trying to convey the dull it has to offer is without a doubt more time consuming than the execution of that scene was. So instead of going in depth with this I'm just going to say this; if you, my dear reader, consider two-colored light to be the most fuckawesome thing ever, then this shit just might fly for you. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do we got? K failed with characters, story and animation. The fanservice is meh and on top of that it's aimed for fujoshi. This series is simply hard one to enjoy, certainly doesn't seem like it is even trying. On a bottom line - K isn't 'k.",

            "content": "Story: 1/10\r\nI've never watched an anime with a more pathetic story. I think I find the Cockroach girl anime more appealing than this one. The story line feels like the creators decided to pull all their favorite aspects out of all the anime they've ever liked and put it into one. There is a weak reference to \"deep\" connections between these 7 gangs in the anime, but this story is following the main character, Shiro and his cat that turns into a sexy girl randomly. The blue gang is a vigilante police group and one of the members, Kuro, believes that Shiro committed a murderbased on this shady cell phone video of Shiro or someone who appears to look like him, committing the crime, and Kuro decides to follow Shiro around at school and become a \"transfer student\" and cook for Shiro and his cat like he has no real duties. The story line is absolutely horrid and there is nothing great about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime contains the most beautiful art I've seen in a lot of anime, but that is the only thing going for it. I am continuing this anime based on the art alone.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, the art began to decrease in quality. The group probably spent all of their budget on the first episode and everything else went to horribleness. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story line, the characters are pathetic. They are not unique in any way and there is no character depth at all. I feel no emotions or sympathy for any of them. The main character, Shiro, seems to be this aloof high school kid who appears to have some dark side or schizophrenic tendency, but also doesn't seem to have much care. The cat/girl turns into a human randomly, she has two different colored eyes, and does \"cute\" things. (I think she is a rip of Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, but not as enjoyable). The red gang seems to be a collection of \"tough, cool guys\" plus some strange gothic lolita girl. There hasn't been much on the red gang yet for me to make inferences on them. The vigilante police blue gang includes Kuro, the guy who carries around swords and follows around the main character while the main character tries to prove his innocence. He's boring and one dimensional and seems to be a rip of Jin from Samurai Champloo, and he carries around a weird briefcase filled with cooking utensils. There is a woman in the blue gang, who is dressed in this outfit where her butt hangs out but apparently works in this professional setting. She seems like a rip of Hawkeye from Full Metal Alchemist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy it because its fun to make fun of.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime that will ever make a mark. It in general, just sucks. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy watching characters stare at each other for long periods of time, fight scenes eliminated, important parts of the story not even animated (the blimp crash scene), and characters having \"deep\" connections and conversations with each other which are never explained, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "I've got news for GoHands. You can polish a turd, make it really pretty, flashy, and cool...but it still doesn't defeat the fact that it's still a turd. \r\nK Project might be the biggest letdown of an anime I've seen all year. It has some of the best OSTs I've heard in a series this year. The animation is gorgeous and the art direction in the first episode had a setup for a series that was going to be epic. So what the hell happened? To put it bluntly, how did such a captivating series become such an epic pile of crap?\r\nSimply put, the storywas all over the place and it all begins with the setup. The plot resolves Isana Yashiro who is falsely accused of killing a clansman of the Red King. He is hunted down by Yatogami Kuroh, the servant of the former Colorless King, HOMRA, the clansman of the Red King and SCEPTER4, the clansman of the Blue King. Isana is befriended by Yatogami in the process as well as a strange girl/cat named Neko, who we find out is a Strain. Together, they try and solve the mystery behind Yashiro's mistaken identity for a killer who claims to be the Colorless King, as well as find out his connection to the Silver King. Everybody got that? Good...because I sure as hell didn't. For one, who or what are the Kings? The series briefly describes them as seven people with special powers. When they release their power, an object appears in the sky called the Sword of Damocles. So what the hell is the Sword of Damocles? Gooooood question...because the series doesn't explain that either. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a clash between the Red and Blue clans during the early stages of this series because Munakata Reishi, the Blue King feels that another disaster will befall them because Mikoto Suoh's (The Red King) Sword of Damocles is in rough shape due to overusing his power. We get very little explanation or back story about the dangers of a king maintaining their Sword of Damocles so it is just another minor plot point that falls to the wayside due to poor development.\\n\\n\r\nI found the ONLY thing this story did well in both explanation and in storytelling was the reveal of Adolph K. Weismann, the Silver King. Weismann was just about the only character that got any sort of development, albeit still not enough in the grand scheme of things. We learn that the Silver King is also known as the Immortal King...yet, we don't get an explanation as to WHY he's immortal. Or at the very least, the series doesn't do a very good job of explaining that detail. We also find out that there are 7 Kings in total, but it's unexplained who these Kings are, where they came from, and why they have these powers as well as why they can pass their powers down to clansman. \\n\\n\r\nThat leads me to my next point, this story just didn't develop it's characters...any of them. Apparently according to the plot, we should be invested in the battle between the Reds and the Blues. The conflict between Suoh and Munakata. Okay, can you at least tell us WHY? There are times when I wonder, is this story about Yashiro, or is it about Suoh? Or how about Yatogami Kuroh? We learn that he was a servant for the former Colorless King, Ichigen Miwa. And? That's it...for being the what would become best friend of the lead character for this series, we learn next to nothing about him...and don't get me started on this mess that is Yashiro's character. The explanation and back story behind his character is so fragmented and confusing that even when the series is completely said and done, I still don't know ANYTHING about his character. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it felt like the producers tried to tackle way too many issues in a 13 episode series. What it resulted in was a lot unresolved plot points and loosely knitted character development that fell apart at the seams because there were far too many characters to even try and develop. GoHands should've realized (and I use this analogy a lot) that sometimes, less is more. Give us a narrowed down, detailed look at each set of characters or clans. Give us a better explanation/back story to who or what the Kings are. This series MIGHT have worked in a 26 episode set...and I say that loosely. They still might not have been able to tie up all the loose ends in 26 episodes. All-in-all, considering the production budget behind this series, there was a lot to be desired by the time it was all said and done.",

I mean, some of these people are trying to be deep about it and writing like a critic, but a lot of it is just a guise for their own taste in Anime. If they state something that they don't like, well that' just cause they don't like it.\r\nANYWAYS, I just finished up episode 8 of this series, went straight from 1-8 although I probably shouldn't have. So i'm pretty hooked.\r\nTrying to go no spoiler here:\r\nThe story is alright it has plenty of generic points but, if you abstract thingsyou know, everything has generic points, doesn't mean they are the same thing. It seems out main antagonist has lost his memory about a important event and he's trying to find out what happened. People have special powers and the origin of which has already been revealed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, absolutely fantastic. Crisp at many times often with sort of way-ward colory splashy overlays which I find very appealing to my senses.\\n\\n\r\nSound nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are super generic (again in abstract terms). We got the happy-go-lucky protagonist, his clueless female friend, aloof ally, etc. What really keeps me going is that so far I haven't really seen an antagonist per se... (avoiding spoilers here!)\\n\r\nIt's pretty conflicting to note who is and who is not the antagonist especially if you read the manga back story; so as far as characters go I think that's a pretty neat thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8, it's appealing to me.\\n\r\nMy overall is my enjoyment, so again 8.\\n\\n",

            "content": "K-Project\r\n1st Review and a Long One\r\n*Please take the time to read/skim through it. Don\u2019t just judge by the score I give the anime! If you hate my review, please explain why. \r\n         The autumn season of 2012 was an entertaining one. The season brought new light and a breath of fresh air to the anime industry. Of all the anime there is to talk about, K is one of the most talks about anime to date.  It might be though to the fact that the PVs carry ton of promise for the project bringing in hugeamounts of hype and a start of a new fandom.  Sadly, K collapse under its own weight with ton of criticism toward its poor story and plot progression.  Creating a huge divide among the anime community with one side being the haters while the other side the fans. I\u2019m categorized under the fans but K indeed has flaws that should be taking account. \\n\\n\r\n    All in all K is a project underworked.  For GoRa\u2019s 1st anime project, I found it be a massive success.  And I will explain why:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]\\n\\n\r\nThe story at the beginning: Tatura is murder in an incident putting Yashiro, the main protagonist, into a chaotic battle between the Kings and clans regarding who killed Tatura. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is indeed the biggest problem of K by far.  It is important to note that K\u2019s story is not action oriented given by the few scenes of action nor is it a mystery because you\u2019re not meant to solve it.  K\u2019s story is a mix of different elements but these elements is what makes its story collapse.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever seen an anime produce by Nakanishi Go, you might be able to pin out the problems the plot has. K suffers from poor plot progression.  The anime wants to explore all the different elements but sadly with only 13 episodes it isn\u2019t possible. The 1st 3 episodes focus on explaining the world of K. Episodes 4-9 focus on the bonds and tensions between characters. Last 4 focus on brining all characters together for the big finale. \\n\\n\r\nAsking little questions is the key to enjoying K or then your negatives will ruin your positives. If questions do arise, then don\u2019t be afraid to ask the community has ton of excellent theories is quite accurate.   \\n\\n\r\nYet, the plot manages to be quite interesting at times.  The story is filled with interesting moments and twists that you sometimes wonder if the story is the main focus. And it isn\u2019t! The main focus is in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]\\n\\n\r\nThere is lot of things to say about K and its huge cast of characters. I don\u2019t hate any of the characters.  They all perform their roles masterfully with their voice actors truly capturing the personality of the characters. So why did I give it only 1 MAL point?  Not all of the characters are given the proper screen time they deserve. \\n\\n\r\nThe main trio [Yashiro, Neko, & Kuroh] represent the power to have close bonds with each other. Mikoto and Reishi are the Kings with huge hearts toward their clan who journey a solitary road.  And there is Yata and Fushimi two close friends/rivals that can never be separated by faith [no yaoi here]. K is all about bonds but what about the other characters?\\n\\n\r\nThere are more obvious bonds within K but the screen time is given more to these parings more than anything else.  I personally wanted to see more of Ana as she manages to be the most questionable character regarding what she means to Mikoto. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ever happen to Izumo? Given a role of a typical leader! \\n\\n\r\nThe classmates were interesting and wish they had more time on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nRikio!!!! He means something to Yata but what? The poor old Gold King\u2026.. not even given the proper time to be on screen for being the Gold King.\\n\\n\r\n\tHopefully these problems will be fixed for the next season because these bonds were unique to K making the characters memorable in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  (+) [2 MAL POINTS]\\n\r\n\tThe biggest positive of K is its Art, and that is something we all can agree with. Animation quality of K can just not be described with words. It\u2019s just plain beautiful to look at.  GoHands really knows how to bring quality to the next level. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing a similar art style that can be found in the Mardock Scramble series, K uses a smart blend of gradients to bring out the colors of the characters and the setting. It even helps create a realistic shine on objects that shine depending on the lighting. Ton of detail is pack in every frame with the brief scenes of CG being forgiven as this is animation at its best. With only one major screw up being with the Bell Tower Explosion scene [rather not explain as it was horrific to watch]. Action scenes are well drawn out fill with the flashing colors of the physic powers even though they are quite short.\\n\\n\r\n\tK broke new ground in the anime industry showing how TV animation can reach the quality of the movies. Setting the bar high to what future TV animation can look like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (+) [2 MAL Points]\\n\r\n\tSoundtrack of K\u2026.. memorable!!!! For Endo Mikio\u2019s 1st time in the anime industry, he manages to capture the urban feel of the city and emotions of the characters. You know a soundtrack is going to be excellent when the 1st track, title \u201cSuoh Mikoto\u201d, comes blazing in with the beat and intensity of the pain to describe Mikoto\u2019s character. This helps creates stage for K when the opening credits were done rolling as we enter the world that is K. And there are more tracks I wish I could describe but in the end their no real way to describe the emotions and feelings you get from each track.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OP and ED songs, they do their job well but aren\u2019t as memorable as the soundtrack. Then again my taste of music is quite different when it comes to OP and ED so sadly I can't go in depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (+) [2 MAL POINTS]\\n\\n\r\nK is an anime that isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. The fun of K comes from the bonds of characters within the beautiful world that is the anime. I personally had a blast with the anime. Even though it has flaws, K manages to not be an utter failure of this season. In fact my memories of K will stay in tack as K\u2019s charms can appeal to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nEither it is for the animation, soundtrack, characters, or the story, K has something for everyone. For the 1st project of GoRa, it is a massive success that can be use to make the project better than it was before. I\u2019m looking forward to what GoRa can bring to the table in the anime industry with its future K relating projects.  If you\u2019re someone like me who is going to watch the 2nd season, I recommend reading the manga prequels and watching K in a new positive light.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will but my review to a close to the most memorable anime of the year for me. Enjoyment of the anime is different for everyone. I'm here saying that you should watch it but of course this anime will not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "K, let me start by saying that although this series wasn't close to becoming a masterpiece, it is not nearly as bad as alot of viewers are making it out to be with scores such as 3's/4's. However i can see why many people didn't like this anime.\r\nPlot: Im not going to bore you all with giving a summary of the plot, as im assuming you have at least some knowledge of the show if you are reading this review. 'K' had so much potential, however like many recent shows airing, the plot was neglected due to the high demand of having pretty visuals andcatchy songs that will attract in viewers. The story line wasn't bad at all, it was simply lacking more attention from the creators. I felt as though the entire plot was rushed, resulting in many questions that were left un-answered. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: There's really not much to say about these two components of the show. Both were fantastically done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development was fairly bland and poorly done. I noticed that alot of the main characters didn't have any development or references about their past. I don't know what i was expecting, but it wasn't what i got.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an okay show. Give it a try and if you don't like it in the first few episodes, give it up. Because it doesn't get better as the show goes on. It's one of those shows that you will hate, love, or you will be neutral with it because lets be honest. You all have nothing else to waste your time with. (that's why you are reading this review).\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I wonder if people want to be original from the get go or just take  concepts from different shows, throw them all in a pot and hope something good comes out.  Project K is a classic example of people who have to much to do and not enough resources to do it with.\r\nSTORY 4/10\r\nFrom the first episode we have been given the basic outline of each character, their goals and where each of them stand in terms of ranking. It doesn't help the viewer that episode one starts in the middle of the plot, tracks back and then pushes forward.  \r\nItsets up a very clever way of telling the story by throwing all these problems and situations at the viewer in hopes it will make it all clear by episode 13. Depending on how far you read into the plot and the characters motives you may get a completely different answer.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this show is what (in my case) makes it memorable. It sets a brilliant landscape for the show from the city to the wastelands, the technology such as the robots have all been detailed to the millimeter. You can probably watch this show and adore it based on the art alone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10\\n\r\nI was sort of conflicted with the OST, while the music was very good it felt like the tracks were played in the wrong moments. The opening theme didn't fit the style of the opening and the main piano piece was very overplayed, it almost felt like one long music video for that one song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 4/10 \\n\r\nAs I've read in some other Project K reviews people say that the characters were too 'under developed' for me this wasn't quite true. From episode one it was like the characters were just to distant from the plot, not giving much of a story away. I'm not sure if this is a result of the makers wanting them to seem more mysterious or setting up something for season 2 but I couldn't feel sad or pained for a character I barely knew.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad anime. I enjoyed it, the art was amazing, the soundtrack was good, characters were likable. I give credit to the producers who were able to squeeze all these different plot points in to just 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 6/10\\n\r\nI think Project K had to much to live up to before it even aired, with the story telling style of Baccano! and overall plot feel of No.6 this anime is enjoyable and that's all you really need. Not much to think about or keep up with (Unless you're one of those 'deeper meaning' people).\\n\r\nIf you can stand the amount of fan service it gives girls to ship him with him then I recommend this show as just a bit of eye candy for people who like quality art with simple-to-follow plot.",

            "content": "This show had a good start, the first episode showed the best of what this show could ever offer. Cool characters, beautiful art, nice introduction to the plot and setting. As I watched subsequent episodes however, I started to realise the story was progressing from nowhere to little at all.\r\nThe story could have been something interesting. The first episode presented many interesting characters, and the plot was good enough that it could have gone somewhere interesting as it progressed. Sadly, this progression had gone almost nowhere after three episodes, and many characters took a turn for the worse. They're shallow at their best, and completelyobsolete and irrelevant at the worst. The majority only appearing to serve as fan service to female and male viewers. Which is another point I need to make about this show. It's shallow. To be perfectly honest it seems a lot like someone wanted to create a show purely just for those people that like shipping characters and letting their own imaginations get in. It's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's like porn without anything explicit (Excluding Neko, her entire existence in this show is purely sex appeal), and they didn't forget to include a terrible plot line either.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the art, it really is beautiful, but it also feels like it's like that for the reasons stated above. Although the scenery is just amazing to look at, and the animation is superb too. It'd be a perfectly fair reason to watch K just to witness what the animation has to offer, although I personally think the first episode covers pretty much everything there is to see, particularly since I noticed a few scenes reused in subsequent episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell to summarise, if you don't mind shallow characters and slow story progression which may or may not lead anywhere coupled with beautiful animation and fan service, feel free to check this out, but just be mindful that there are definitely better things out there than what K has to offer.",

            "content": "Do you know one of those anime that despite not having anything outstanding to it, still end up making you watch it until the middle of the night and go tell all your friends about how great it is the next day? Yeah, K is one of those\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nK story is set in a busy, futuristic city that underneath its grandeur lies supernatural forces and dangerous gangs. Much like Durarara!!, the show has multiple story lines that end up intersecting each other in the end. Now, if this is the first time something like this was done, I would really had enjoyed it much more.But if you are a big fan of Durarara!! like I am, you would be very distracted by how many similarities these two shows have. However, that did not stop me from liking the story of K. From the intense tale of the chase for a murder case suspect to the story of the psychic power wielding gangs, K has a pretty interesting plot. Just like Durarara!! though, there are some points that you might have to read between the lines a little, but for me, that is a lot better than having the plot spoon fed to me by the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt is perhaps K's strongest point. When I was a kid, I always imagined I had awesome psychic powers and I would look like a total badass if it weren't for this thing called reality. But when watching K, I feel like my imaginative world  came to life. Intense battle scenes, awesome psychic fields, cool character designs, etc. you name it, K has them all. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Nujabes even a tiny little bit, I think you would like K soundtrack a lot. Filled with suave urban style tracks, K's BGM fits the show's setting like a glove. Of course, it is not Samurai Champloo, but the music does grow on you and on many occasions add to the atmosphere seamlessly, making K a very appealing experience to your senses of sight and sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a show where even the side characters make you relate to them so much you could be their best friend, K might seem a bit lacking. However, for the type of anime that it is, it doesn't need to have those kinds of characters. Instead K makes up for this by having several solid leads, while adding in some character archetypes that we all know and love like the Spectacled Badass, the Sadist, the Kindhearted Gang Leader, the Ice Queen, etc. and does that take out any enjoyment? Absolutely not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, K is not an outstanding anime. I've seen others shows that have used the elements that it has before and done it better. However, by combining these aspects together and multiplying that with smooth music and animation, K ends up being a very fun ride at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow those of you who are into more serious shows and expect only the best of story and character development might say that this show is not worth its score, and that is entirely understandable. However, for just sheer appeal to the senses, K is still a very enjoyable show. It does not try to be overly serious and it does not need to be. So go grab some popcorn and maybe even a friend, because K is a show worthy of the title King in its category (well, there are better shows of course but I just wanted to make that joke.)\\n",

            "content": "K is by no means a masterpiece but at the same time it isn't as bad as some people are making out to be. I personally think that K completed the plot its based around its own little world pretty well. \r\nIsana Yashiro is a soft and an adolescent teenager who lives on his own and is always active with his friends around the campus. However he soon finds himself chased down by the infamous gang named \"HOMRA\" who are the clansmen for the Red King. In the anime, seven kings or rulers are portrayed who have their own persona and supernatural powers. From theimpeccable Silver King, to the inferior Colorless King, the series focuses mostly on the Red King and the Blue King. So after the murder of one of the members of the HOMRA gang namely of \"Totsuka Tatara\", a video tape is left behind which point out the seemingly innocent Isana Yashiro as the culprit. It also happens to be that Isana Yashiro isn't quite as the person he seems to be, as he has little to no memory of his own past. K follows the story of the Red King and the HOMRA members seeking their revenge of the murder of one of their members, to the Blue King and their clansmen trying to stop the inevitable battle that will shake the order among the seven kings and to reveal the true identity of Shiro aka Isana Yashiro. \\n\\n\r\nK has quite an unique blend of characters, with Kuroh Yatagami, the student of the former Colorless King who is in the search for the person who is to become the next Colorless King, and to reach a decision whether the new Colorless King is worthy enough of the throne. He also has the job given by his former master as to decide whether the new Colorless King is good or evil, and if he's the former, Kuroh is to slay him right there. Coming to a decision that Shiro is the new Colorless King from the video tape that surfaced featuring Shiro shooting Totsuka Tatara, Shiro now has to explain that he's innocent. Shiro is shown as a silly yet simple and also a very mysterious character who is in search of what truly is he, along with Neko, a cat which possesses some magical powers. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the beautiful melody tones inserted into each episodes and a good voice acting work done, K tops the sound aspect very well. Angela is an extremely talented singer and it's evident from the lovely opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nGoHands has a reputation for creating a beautiful piece of art and K adds to that reputation. K is a burst of attractive colors and a ravishing artsyle that truly makes K a masterpiece when you talk about the artwork. It's one of best anime around in recent times if you consider the art of it, and for the same reason I can't stop but wonder why the studio has made very less anime's of the same type. Personally I really enjoyed K and I'll say that it's worth giving a watch. The story is well brought together which makes for a good watch and a nice ending. \\n",

            "content": "'Set in a world where history has taken a slightly different course from the one we're familiar with, K follows the story of a young boy whose life is caught in a psychic war between seven kings'\r\nStory: 4 \r\nWhere to begin, first we start with the protagonist which is a student that goes by the name of Yashiro Isana, a normal student who attends school at first glance however that is not the case. Yashiro Isana is attacked by a group of suspicious men because Yashiro is suspected of killing one of the groups comrades, however to no memory of Yashiro. This is the catalystof the following events to come. Story wise we are left confused as the story starts to unfold later on the show and not much explanation is given early on. I can interpret this by the writers trying to replicate that same sense of helplessness and confusion that Yashiro is a victim of. When watching the show progress towards its end you would hope that stories and mysteries will unfold, however this is not the case 2/3 of the show we still do not know the full extent of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads on to the criticism of the plot. With the story left to be fully explained towards the end of the series this means that story pacing feels unnatural and rushed towards the end as it feels the show is trying to tie up lose ends with what little screen time they have. I felt as watching the show I didn't care for the story as much because it wouldn't give me time to soak up story. With so many cool concepts for the show the 13 episodes did not do the show justice as there was room for the writer to build upon.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nOne section of the show that cant be criticised is the Art. Its visually stimulating, the way in which some scenes look almost real with what I can imagine are real life rendered images used as backgrounds for some sequences of the show, its as the anime world invaded reality. The colours of the anime are vibrant and bright which makes for a pleasant watching experience. Character models and attention to detail on characters are of high quality which adds a more authentic touch. Animations where also fairly good as most scenes where carefully planned out from a detailed standpoint. Compared to other shows such as bleach and Naruto that has a bad habit of recycled animation and static character models, K animates the show to a fairly high degree. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime is also noticeably good. Voice acting is great across every character with characters such as Mikito, giving me goosebumps whenever he talks. As for selection of music its fair to say that the music choice they use is some of the best I've heard regardless that there wasn't many music selection as I would have liked there to be, meaning that music was sometimes recycled A lot but that's just me being picky. Overall the sound quality of music and voice actors they did use made the show a bit more pleasurable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nLinking back to the original argument I made under the Story section with the story being to short and rushed this unfortunately carries over to the character development which I find there is generally none of. With Such powerful characters displayed from the very start of the show, its as if it almost intentionally sets up for these characters to develop and show a different side to the very linear personalities. The writer tries to compensate for this by giving us flashback sequences here and there, however this is not enough to fully immerse us with the characters on display. Furthermore some characters who play an integral part in the anime are introduced with no background story making these characters remain a mystery and for viewers to question the purpose of said characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nFor me personally I enjoyed the show at times but was left disappointed by the plot holes and the lack of details that I look for in an anime. The concept of the show was a unique one that I really loved but again was left disappointed on how the plot was lacklustre.The art made me really appreciate the show as at times it felt I was viewing a visual masterpiece with the amazing art direction is was going for. Overall it was a decent way to bide the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nTo conclude I wouldn't recommend this show for any newcomer to anime not to say its a bad show but just because there are many other shows that perfect most categories I covered. However for someone who has seen most mainstream anime I would encourage you to watch it as the Art is some of the best you will see for any show. Finally with a Movie that is a direct sequel to the anime announced for release in 2014 there is still hope that they are able to tie all lose ends and build on characters to leave a lasting memory of the show. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw pictures and trailers for K, I though:\r\n\"Man this looks promising!\"\r\nAnd so the first episode started off with an amazing instrumental hip hop track, some cool looking dudes and a cute loli... and this weird blue filter...\r\nWell after a couple of episodes full of nonsense later I found myself baffled how anyone could even understand what this show was about.\r\nWell needless to say, this show made as much sense as a monocycle riding monkey on a plane.\r\nLet's just get to it.\r\nFirst the good:\r\nAnimation 8/10\r\nThis show looks damn fucking amazing it would have earned a 9/10 but that damn ugly blue filter ruinedit for me to be honest.\\n\r\nI mean look at it it's fluid as hell, the fighting scenes are fabulous. I was impressed. The only thing it kinda felt short was sometimes when they used boring stills ineffective and some background looked okay but not great (but sometimes they also did).\\n\r\nAnother gripe I had with the character designs. I like if they are individualized but they were a bit too Bi-Shounen for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe other great thing about this show was the great OST. A mixture of instrumental Hip hop and Electronica. Really cool and my first favorite OST of the season (others came to that list later).\\n\r\nThe Voiceactors were okay but because the characters were so poor and 1dimensional they couldn't shine and non stood out.\\n\r\nThe opening was horrendous and the ending forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the bad Parts:\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThat this convoluted piece of garbage even got 3/10 is a miracle.\\n\r\nBut I have my reasons for that.\\n\r\nBesides the ending the plot made no sense. had no sense of pacing, was complex for complexity sake and even in the end wasn't clear. I would say the premise was okay but since it never really got explained it was just a huge mess.\\n\r\nAt least because of the nonsensical story it never felt as if there was anything that wasn't important or like a filler, and some battles where cool so the episodes could be exciting and here and there was a cliffhanger or WOW effect but still in light of a stupid plot felt short.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's me and I just didn't \"get it\", but then it was the animes fault. I \"got\" Lain, and if this crap is deeper than Lain I think I kill myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAt least everyone seemed to have a reasonable motivation for what they did.\\n\r\nBut else there was no development, nor did any character make sense. Everything felt artificial.\\n\r\nLikable was only the cute Loli for being a cute Loli. Yeah that's it. \\n\r\nWorst-Cast-Ever.\\n\\n\r\nValue 2/10\\n\r\nIf you have no Idea what I mean by this, go to my Profile, check \"new rating system\" and read about Value. I think it's a very good point to make for every show.\\n\r\nBut I will include it's parts for this review\\n\r\nRewatchability - only to see if it makes more sense. But please no thanks not again.\\n\r\nSentimental - It was a particular bad anime with the most messy plot I've ever seen. It sure stands out to me. It was also the first really nonsensical anime I've ever seen. I give creds for that.\\n\r\nHistorical - Non this show will be forgotten, didn't do anything groundbreaking or influential. At least I hope it doesn't influence other shows to be this bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy it for the music and amazing animations.\\n\r\nAnd I hoped it would become clear.\\n\r\nBut after finishing it, it only was this really bad anime that I finished with wasted animation and soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : BAD do not watch, of just for the fighting scenes but I have some gifs for that if you'd like to seem them.",

            "content": "Project K. What can I say? I have mixed feelings about it; more importantly it is a typical sad case of great concept ruined by terrible execution. Here's why.\r\nLets put the story aside for a while, and talk about the concept. The concept for Project K is arguably fresh and creative. I won't call it particularly innovative but it does wonderfully so combine elements of sci-fi and fantasy. Seven Kings and their vassals endorsed by that special power, street gangs, military-like organizations and a high school and an inevitable evil mastermind behind all the events. It's a bit of everything and I suppose that's whyit is non-standard. With proper attention to each and every bit of that we would have probably received a truly memorable anime. And here's where Project K fails hard. Being only 13 episodes long it does nothing to process those ingredients into an edible dish. We never as much learn about the origin of power that is inherent to kings or how they received it. Is it magic? Is it science and technology? Who are other kings? What is factual peculiarity of their power? What is the story behind the crater thing? etc. Same pretty much goes to every other plotline and character.\\n\\n\r\nPlot itself is somewhat messy. We've got a mysterious murder and gangs who are going after the culprit who is in turn the main protagonist who suffers from amnesia who later discovers kings/vassals/magic and the actual murderer. Seems like a very action packed anime huh? Well it isn't. Good 2/3 of it we are having character interactions and chases which have very little to do with actual plot and hence the very gist of it is unveiled during final eps. Such uneven pacing keeps you hooked only during very first and very last episodes, becoming rather annoying in the middle. Most plotlines go nowhere and a lot of things are left unexplained, such as who's Neko, where's slate, past of certain characters. It just doesn't fall in place. That being said, amnesia is an awful plot-device.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Now art is one of the few strong points that K has. Animation is smooth and beautiful featuring great camera angles and spectacular special effects. The art itself imitates a cross-processed film which makes it look bright and optimistic, easy on the eye. The character design is hit and miss. Some are nicely designed with a distinguished look, the others are your typical janes and joes you'd find in any anime. Overall, it's a visual eye-candy although the quality declines towards the end of series.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Another strong point. The soundtrack is crispy with some lovely piano arrangements, if a little repetitive. I have nothing much to say about OP and ED, they are both quite decent, but not the kind of songs that would stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are poorly fleshed out and present nothing original. We have typical personality-less school mob. We have an odd main hero who acts somewhat like Haru from Tsuritama. We have Neko who is in a sense a cardboard copy of Shiro (Deadman Wonderland), and we have Kuro (a lovechild of Kanda x Sebastian). In fact we have a ton of characters which are implied to have had interesting ties to each other in the past and present, but sadly it is never fully unfolded in the anime. It's not to say that characters are annoying or boring from the start, not at all. What I imply is, with the length of anime, it just seems unreasonable to put such a crowd in and toss hints about their complex history. If it was 26 eps long, that would be fine. Alas, it is not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's easy to watch. Project K is that kind of anime that is perfectly watchable if you turn your brain off and just relax. It's not the best anime ever, nor it is the worst one. If you are looking for something other than just swords and mecha, this is probably a good choice.",

            "content": "You're probably aware of the fact this anime is gettin' pretty low scores and most of the people who review it keep complaining about same stuff. No coherent plot, weak character development, rushed storytelling, blah blah blah. \r\nWell, well. That's all cool and stuff, but why don't we show the other side of the coin, too. By the way, I'm a guy, straight and all. K is manly stuff, k. (fakken pun)\r\nStory: 9 Simply put, this story is great. It's not the most original story of all times, but it isn't a complete cliche either, as many would like you to believe. \r\nSee, the thingabout K is that it sells a really TRAGIC, DARK, DEEP and SOUR story of betrayal, friendship, and sacrifice, in a shiny package so that the general audience would be satisfied with 'hot' bishies, tits and cool animation, while some people, like myself, can still enjoy it for what it really is. \\n\r\nI won't say anything else about the story's content, since you can clearly see it in the series description.\\n\\n\r\nPeople complain about not knowing what is the sword of Damocles, or where the King's power come from and what not. Those same people give Evangelion a score of 10 even though it's full of randomly chosen cool sounding terms from Bible and what not. Compared to Eva's sea of dead scrolls and Lance of Longinus, K's sword of Damocles is much more relevant to the story and actually serves as a foreshadowing to the show's overly dark culmination. \\n\\n\r\nDo note however, that the pacing in the beginning is rather weak, which is completely understandable considering the character cast and time frame in which the story had to be presented. Pacing improves in the next half of the show, leading to ones of the most epic scenes of this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 One word, gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 Outstanding, fits the mood perfectly, and overly improves the viewer's enjoyment. Not much else to say, except that this series has one of the greatest ED songs in last few years, not counting Fate/Zero's endings, of course. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 100000\\n\\n\r\nLook, don't trust people who'll tell you that this show has weak character development or that the characters are generic. Considering that K has only 13 episodes, and it's cast is freakin' huge, the characters are pretty much the soul of this show. Their interactions, personalities, lives and motives, ability to make you both laugh and cry, all that makes them pretty much the most memorable characters I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\r\nK's characters are not the fanart you see on Pixiv and Zerochan. They may look gorgeous, perfect, flawless and shallow, but actually, they're just flawed, tragic and ultimately human reflections of us all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10  Obviously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\\n\r\nGet mad all you want, but K gets a pure 10 from me. This anime is not what it looks like at the first glance. It's not what you think it looks like under it's shiny package either. It's a tragic tale of a group of people who share a bond thicker than blood, a bond that will eventually lead them into becoming more human than humanity itself. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "K can be best described as a poorly baked cake covered with an excessive amount of icing. One can look at this cake and view it to be extremely succulent and sweet on the exterior, but after tasting it, one may find dissatisfaction from cake's lack of quality. Just like this cake, K attempts to attract viewers with its beautiful visuals and flashy soundtrack like icing, but the poor quality of an inconsistent story that felt rushed can dispel the exterior beauty and leave viewers sick to the stomach.\r\nUpon viewing K for the first time, it is hard to disagree that it looks beautiful. Kperfectly portrays the gorgeous aesthetics of an urban city landscape with tall majestic skyscrapers, bustling pedestrians in every street, and an abundance of detail in every nook and cranny. To add to K's beauty, is the addition of a very refreshing and versatile soundtrack that perfectly captures the emotions of each scene. The music in K includes a large range; from soft melodic piano pieces, to intense electronic beats and mellow hip-hop. The music is implemented in a very sophisticated manner and never feels out of place or repetitive. This wonderful combination of visual and audio appeal reinforces the sense of beauty of K.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough K looks beautiful, one must be cautious of its beauty. The beautiful appeal of K is only icing on the cake and the actual quality of the cake itself may be a different story. K's biggest drawback would be the attempts to implement a wide cast of characters. Since K revolves around the theme of gang rivalry and leadership, the multiple characters from the different clans carry a large focus within the story and although this can be very exciting, the attempts have gone to waste due to the short time given in the space of thirteen episodes and lack of definition. The many characters are given many scenes such as flash backs or fan-service that attempt to reinforce their personalities and shine them in a likable manner. This is possibly the strongest element about K, but this turns out messy as many characters that are given lots of screen time hold no significance in the story whatsoever, leaving the story to be rushed and full of holes to fit the span of thirteen episodes. K gives side characters a chance to shine, but these efforts leave viewers wondering why these pointless characters are given so much screen time when the time itself could have been used to improve the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, K is extremely comparable to a cake. Too much time and effort was spent on trying to sweeten the cake, but the limited amount of time has left it undercooked. One may think that this cake is a failure, but in absolute truth, it is not. An undercooked cake is not ruined and can still be enjoyed, this is very similar to the essence of K as it all comes down to one's sweet tooth. Although the story of K felt rushed and messy, the character interactions and personalities truly sweetened this anime and the excessive amount of icing on this cake can also add to the appeal. If you're interested in an anime that not only looks and sounds beautiful, but goes in-depth of exploring different character relationships and personalities, this anime is for you. However, if you're looking for an anime with a consistent and well written storyline, you should look elsewhere.",

            "content": "First review coming up, K?! (pun intended)\r\nStory: 9\r\nAt its core, K is a story about finding the identity of a murderer and its implications in an ongoing war between superpowered clans.  Elements of sci-fi, fantasy and mystery are combined to make for a very appealing package.  In my opinion, the first few episodes don't really explain much, but they leave enough questions unanswered to make you keep coming back for more.  I suppose it may be to give the viewer the same feeling that the protagonist Yashiro would get from having his daily life changed so suddenly.  However, the story reallypicks up in the latter half and overall was simply very exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\r\nThe animation for K is absolutely amazing.  GoHands really impressed this time.  The backgrounds are highly detailed and the setting allows for some beautiful shots of the city and the island.  Reflections and lighting are done expertly, even if at times it looked a little too bright.  I also really like the character designs in K - everyone looks great and the SCEPTER4 uniforms are a notable highlight.  Additionally, the OP and ED sequences are highly stylised and great to watch, meshing well with the songs chosen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nK has fantastic music - among the best I've heard for a while.  There are many great tracks and they are used well to enhance the feelings of the scenes.  Some of my personal favourites are the main theme, which was also used in one of the PVs; and the ED song, performed by Neko's seiyuu.  I think having the character songs play in the background for the next episode previews was a particularly nice touch.  The voice acting was top notch, with plenty of big names such as Sugita Tomokazu and Ono Daisuke, to mention a few.  Across the board, they really succeeded in bringing out the characters' personalities and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters in K are one of the main driving forces of the series.  Much of the plot revolves around Yashiro, who at first appears to be just another happy-go-lucky high school student thrown into the midst of a gang war he knows nothing about.  Kuroh is more tough and composed, and his seriousness is a nice contrast to Yashiro's carefree personality.  K also presents us with an interesting dynamic between the Blue and Red Kings - they fight on opposing sides, but seem to be more than just simply enemies.  The only possible flaw I found was that Neko's character didn't really get enough elaboration; it almost seemed like she was just included because her powers were needed for the story.  The focus moves between the various sides so we get to see events unfold from several perspectives.  The characters do develop well throughout the show, with some interesting revelations, though due to the 13-episode length, some may find that not everyone got fully fleshed out.  However, the manga prequels make up for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nK was a very enjoyable series.  There weren't as many fight scenes as I would have liked, but every time I did see some action it just looked incredibly cool.  Whilst the premise may not be entirely unique, K had more than enough flair, intriguing story and compelling characters to keep me hooked until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nFor me, K was an amazing series that just got better and better with every episode I watched.  If you like supernatural action with an interesting identity mystery attached - you should definitely watch K.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!  Please give feedback if you found it helpful ;)",

            "content": "Art and Animation: 9\r\nI'll start out by writing about the positive aspects of this anime, which is obviously the art and animation quality. Fantastic fluidity to motions. Very active scenes and active bodies. The color usage is bold and nothing to overlook, however, I did start to find the experimental color gradient to be a little bit of an eyesore at times. Yet, at other times it was definitely effective in setting the mood. The characters were cleanly drawn with slim, delicate figures. Smaller details such as clothing design and the cityscape are fun. \r\nCharacter: 6\r\nThe show is similar to Durarara! in that it incorporatesa medley of characters in a crowded city with some magical powers sprinkled in. When I saw the plethora of characters, I didn't expect to get a character driven story. And it wasn't. Unlike Durarara!, which was given 24 eps to tell its story, K-Project only got 13. The characters weren't given enough time to truly shine individually, but that is not to say that they weren't able to shine in conjunction with other characters. The relationships between Shiro and Kuroh, Mikoto and Reisi, and Misaki and Fushimi were good enough to add a little complexity to the characters and story. But the number of characters did leave me a bit overwhelmed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of the soundtrack, OP, or ED. But I can't say the music was bad. It was average for an anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the part that explains why this anime failed. The story, in short, is too messy and poorly developed. Even though it's supposed to be a mystery about Shiro trying to understand his identity and amnesia, I found myself more drawn to the gang war between the red and blue teams. Yet, that part of the story was never fully developed enough and left me in the dark as to why they were fighting so much. Part of the mythology of the anime revolves around the colors and the powers that come with them. I would have liked to get a crash course on the history and involvement of these powers in their reality. When the mystery is revealed, the resolution is unsatisfying. You couldn't get a strong feel as to why the main antagonist is the way he is, because they spent so little time developing him. There are many subplots, which would have been okay, except that this is a 13 episode anime. Most of the subplots were let to ease to an end instead of approached and dealt with properly. This left me feeling a bit bereft and questioning the whole point of building this whole maze of story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI got bored with it halfway through but kept going because it's not bad enough for me to drop. It took me a while to complete it because I got involved with other animes. Despite the incredible visuals, the poorly written story and flat characters failed to enthuse me. The cluttered storyline and mythology kept me confused most of the time as I was trying to play keep up with all the little subplots and characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad anime, but it is an example of an anime trying to take on too much at the same time and failing miserably. I would say that maybe if it was given 24 or more episodes, it might have been able to rescue itself. But its biggest flaw was trying to fit a 24 eps story into 13 eps.",

            "content": "Beautiful art and appealing soundtracks. You're probably thinking, \"This will be amazing!\", right? Well it isn't. There are many flaws and factors that drags K down from being a well done anime to a below average one.\r\nLet us start with a close look at the story. Our hero, Isana Yashiro, goes on an errand one day and is suddenly attacked by a group of men on the streets. It is later revealed that he is blamed for a murder that he does not remember committing. An interesting plot with a decent bit of potential behind it.\r\nEverything is fine until we realize the plot comes toa complete standstill. After many questions and events are raised, we come to the mid-way point of K. That is when it becomes apparent that the anime is not going anywhere. As this dreadful standstill is happening, more and more questions arise every episode. Plot twists are added as an attempt to make everything more bearable, but it just adds to the confusion. To remedy this situation, the creators tried to cram all of the answers in to the last few episodes. The result was a rushed ending with plot holes left floating around everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the story, i'd have to say it was a complete mess that was painful to watch. The creators wanted to make the anime more interesting and unique by continuously adding elements to their plot, but they ended up dropping the ball big time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are supposed to have vibrant characteristics and at least seem somewhat realistic. That is because to get the most enjoyment out of a story, we must be able to connect and feel with the characters. I was not able to do that with anyone in K.\\n\\n\r\nAs an attempt to make the characters seem as cool as possible, they were all given silent and complex personalities. We get no insight into what the characters are actually thinking, and the minimal dialog is of little help as well. They are so unnatural and impossible to figure out. Most of them are like emotionless statues that just talk occasionally for the sake of being alive. There is also a severe lack of character growth and development that destroys any chances left of connecting with the characters.The creators tried too hard and ultimately made the characters too complex and just plain uninteresting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the storytelling in K was horrid, the visuals and music were of the highest grade. The BGMs had a nice ring to them, and the surreal backgrounds had my eyes glued to the screen for every second of every episode. Character animations and fight scenes were extremely detailed to the point where i have nothing but praise for them.Since it would be annoying to listen to me ramble on about the art, i will just leave it at that. All you need to know is that i thought it was very good.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my eyes and ears were indeed very entertained with K, my brain was moaning from boredom and distress for a significant portion of the time. My enjoyment was greatly derailed by the plot and characters. Good art and music was the only thing that kept me going.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i have no choice really but to condemn this anime. It was simply uninteresting and poorly done. Perhaps they focused too much on how it looked and totally forgot to write a story until the last minute. Either way, i would only recommend watching this if you are very curious about it.",

            "content": "I love K! I love it for the fact that the series seems almost like watching rainbows without an actual way of expressing itself at first, especially regarding its artwork. It's almost like the directors are indirectly saying, \u201clet's throw some cool animation and shit and get the audience to watch this!\" Sure, there is a plot but it's just way too slow. I'm not exaggerating here but K is a series that just doesn't work out right at all. For those of you reading this, you might agree and some of you might not. Anyways, let's begin shall we?\r\nLet's start by asking ourselves...what is\u201cK\u201d? \\n\\n\r\nWell, K is an original series that began airing in the Fall of 2012. It's animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki. He is also responsible for some of the character designs for the series. The series apparently also has manga adaptations with a prequel known as K: Memory of Red. Well, anyways, the series is quite mysterious...\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, what the hell does \u201cK\u201d actually stand for? \\n\\n\r\nSome of the titles of the episodes suggest things such as \u201cKnight\u201d, \u201cKitten\u201d, \u201cKill\u201d, \u201cKey\u201d, Karma\u201d, etc. I often wonder why it's like this. Sure the titles might give off some hints. Example: episode 2 titled Kitten is dedicated to Neko-chan who is..a cat or kitten. However, most of them are rather vague and leaves it to the viewers' imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, what the hell. Are the directors serious here? No, that's not even a serious question because the story of K is a joke, one that's not entertaining at all. We begin the first episode with Shiro apparently framed for murder. From there on and out, the series becomes a sort of cat-and-mouse scenario where he gets hunted down. But then, there are the side episodes and occasionally flash backs involving other characters. I have to say that this does NOT work out right. It's like trying to cook a dish without the proper ingredients.\\n\\n\r\nThink of it this way. You want to make a pizza. You have the dough, the ingredients, the oven, etc. Then, when the time comes to make it, the pizza turns into shit because it's mixed in the wrong way. K is no different to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOh but that's not all. K also tries too damn hard. It resorts to using some plot twists and thriller like sequences but it doesn't work. Why? The series' scriptwriting is just awful. The plot is revealed but what is the main purpose of it? I almost feel like nothing when I'm watching this series. It's slow with a capital S. S for shit in the storyline department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\\n\r\nAlmost, all the characters in my opinion lacks something or has qualities that are cliched, generic, and not done right. Let's take a look at our three main protagonists starting with the kid who has been on the run from the very beginning:\\n\\n\r\n*Yashiro \"Shiro\" Isana \u2013 he is the happy and outgoing guy of the series. He often makes jokes but at the same time is quite respectable to his peers and classmates. There is a big secret about this character but we don't find that out till nearly the very end. \\n\\n\r\n*Kuroh \"Black Dog, Kuro\" Yatogami \u2013 this guy even has a side story dedicated to him. Talk about being on the spotlight! But anyways, Kuroh is pretty much the opposite of Shiro. A few words that can describe him are \u201cquiet, mysterious, haughty, caring, loyal, and courageous\u201d. Yet at the same time, he lacks a personality. Seriously, he doesn't have much of a personality at all except when he interacts with the two main protagonists. \\n\\n\r\n*Neko \u2013 Oh who am I kidding here, this is probably one of the reason why more than 80% of the demographic are watching the series. Neko is a very energetic young girl with a curious personality like a cat. Curiosity killed the cat? Neko actually brings that expression to reality in a few times when she acts before she thinks. She's got a million dollar body but a 2-cent brain. She doesn't like to wear clothes and often times or not, clings onto her beloved \u201cShiro\u201d as she likes to call him. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters seems to play roles only in action rather than in the actual story, the one that moves ridiculously slow. The Red King and Blue King clashes in the latter half of the series but once again, it's cliched with the usual egoistic talk and dragged monotone speeches. The righteousness from the Blue King also seems ironic since he wishes to protect the students yet his group is responsible for the danger of their lives in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 8\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I admit it. The artwork of the series is amazing. It's like you're in a dream where everything is colorful and presented in a way that is at cinema level. The blue aura backgrounds and the characters' outfit designs makes them look like bosses and gives off that cool feeling which is one of the positives of the series. It is no doubt that the artwork and visuals represents the highlight of the series. Pretty cool designs I'd say even though some of the clothing doesn't look too original. Yes, I'm looking at you, Full Metal Alchemist and Tegami Bachi.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack/Music: 7\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not up to the art standards, the soundtrack of the series is well presented. Some of the OST are pleasant to listen to whether it's a dramatic, action, or emotional scene. The opening song , \"King\u201d, by angela is also well performed where it depicts a montage of the main as well as the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song though is just a slap in the face. We see..well, mostly Neko wearing almost nothing as she doesn't like to wear clothes making suggestive poses. It's just pure fan-service and nothing more. Once again, it tries to use its visuals to do the talking rather than expressing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series deserves a \u201c5\u201d. The story is so damn slow and the characters give generic a whole new meaning. Luckily, the soundtrack and artwork makes up for this. Yet, at many stances, I feel that K isn't doing a right job of progressing its episodes. Although the plot eventually reveals itself, it shouldn't make an excuse to make the audience wait. Now, I'm not saying this series is the worst garbage ever created. If you enjoyed the series, then do what makes you happy. However, K did not live up to its expectations. At first, I thought I was watching some good bullshit from K but that doesn't seem to be the case now. K is just bullshit and I can't recommend this to anyone. \\n",

            "content": "K is a weird action anime with relatively high production values. It follows the story of a young boy named Shiro who murdered some random guy who was pretty much a big deal except Shiro didn't kill him because he has an alibi, but everyone thinks he killed him until they get to know his alibi but then Shiro remembers he did kill him or something but he didn't because he has an alibi. The story still makes sense very much, at least if we compare the story to the characters action's which frankly reminds headless chickens. \r\nThe characters of this series run all overthe place slapping other's shit because they simply can. Which is obviously just cool because the characters are such awesome, awe-inspiring badasses who don't need any logic whatsoever during their shit. While that would be somewhat true and something to appreciate in some series, K does it completely.. awkwardly. You see K's main element is not action like everyone falsely assumed - it's on the genres so duh - but it's main elements are actually bishonen, neko, fanservice aand.. wait for it... shonen ai. You can check this from ANN if my way of putting it doesn't seem trustworthy. These themes do not make it by any means awesome, but what it manages to create is an overwhelming amount of gayness. I'm not a homophobic, but I have no reason to appreciate a series which is relying on a fujoshi fanbase and other people with the weirdest fetishes. Pretty sure Japan appreciates this, though. \\n\\n\r\nK is also ripping off Durarara, even the character design of Izumo Kusanagi is a direct copy of Shizuo. What they also seem to be following closely is the awful pacing. Nothing happens beyond fanservice and some random slapping. If something else actually happens then that something is simply said nothing. Let me give an example of what this \"nothing\" is and how the characters make sense. Some \"bad guy\" appears to Shiro's house, tries to kill him but ends up chasing Shiro around the town. Then suddenly magically we are back to Shiro's house and all of the characters lie on the floor because they are exhausted. Then this so called bad guy does what? Well makes them some dinner and they eat of course. Approved? lolno. During all of this there is some cat-neko-girl-thing being there with Shiro without any real reason, lying there naked most of the time, making weird noises and expression which someone would call cute or sexy. As tasty as it might sound it is actually just.. meh. \\n\\n\r\nAfter mocking K this much you might be thinking why I'm still bothering to watch this series. I didn't found any of this too annoying since I stopped taking the series seriously in the beginning, but what I really liked was the animation, which is rather cool and original. On a first impression it seemed like a fresh air and something you don't see every day in anime, making the series worth of watching from my part even though I already found it bad. Bad but entertaining. But then K failed completely from that part as well. On episode 5 great fight scenes happened and oh boy, the word lameness got a new meaning. Describing that scene with mere words and trying to convey the dull it has to offer is without a doubt more time consuming than the execution of that scene was. So instead of going in depth with this I'm just going to say this; if you, my dear reader, consider two-colored light to be the most fuckawesome thing ever, then this shit just might fly for you. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do we got? K failed with characters, story and animation. The fanservice is meh and on top of that it's aimed for fujoshi. This series is simply hard one to enjoy, certainly doesn't seem like it is even trying. On a bottom line - K isn't 'k.",

            "content": "Story: 1/10\r\nI've never watched an anime with a more pathetic story. I think I find the Cockroach girl anime more appealing than this one. The story line feels like the creators decided to pull all their favorite aspects out of all the anime they've ever liked and put it into one. There is a weak reference to \"deep\" connections between these 7 gangs in the anime, but this story is following the main character, Shiro and his cat that turns into a sexy girl randomly. The blue gang is a vigilante police group and one of the members, Kuro, believes that Shiro committed a murderbased on this shady cell phone video of Shiro or someone who appears to look like him, committing the crime, and Kuro decides to follow Shiro around at school and become a \"transfer student\" and cook for Shiro and his cat like he has no real duties. The story line is absolutely horrid and there is nothing great about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime contains the most beautiful art I've seen in a lot of anime, but that is the only thing going for it. I am continuing this anime based on the art alone.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, the art began to decrease in quality. The group probably spent all of their budget on the first episode and everything else went to horribleness. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt sounds fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story line, the characters are pathetic. They are not unique in any way and there is no character depth at all. I feel no emotions or sympathy for any of them. The main character, Shiro, seems to be this aloof high school kid who appears to have some dark side or schizophrenic tendency, but also doesn't seem to have much care. The cat/girl turns into a human randomly, she has two different colored eyes, and does \"cute\" things. (I think she is a rip of Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, but not as enjoyable). The red gang seems to be a collection of \"tough, cool guys\" plus some strange gothic lolita girl. There hasn't been much on the red gang yet for me to make inferences on them. The vigilante police blue gang includes Kuro, the guy who carries around swords and follows around the main character while the main character tries to prove his innocence. He's boring and one dimensional and seems to be a rip of Jin from Samurai Champloo, and he carries around a weird briefcase filled with cooking utensils. There is a woman in the blue gang, who is dressed in this outfit where her butt hangs out but apparently works in this professional setting. She seems like a rip of Hawkeye from Full Metal Alchemist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy it because its fun to make fun of.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an anime that will ever make a mark. It in general, just sucks. \\n\\n\r\nUpdate: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy watching characters stare at each other for long periods of time, fight scenes eliminated, important parts of the story not even animated (the blimp crash scene), and characters having \"deep\" connections and conversations with each other which are never explained, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "I've got news for GoHands. You can polish a turd, make it really pretty, flashy, and cool...but it still doesn't defeat the fact that it's still a turd. \r\nK Project might be the biggest letdown of an anime I've seen all year. It has some of the best OSTs I've heard in a series this year. The animation is gorgeous and the art direction in the first episode had a setup for a series that was going to be epic. So what the hell happened? To put it bluntly, how did such a captivating series become such an epic pile of crap?\r\nSimply put, the storywas all over the place and it all begins with the setup. The plot resolves Isana Yashiro who is falsely accused of killing a clansman of the Red King. He is hunted down by Yatogami Kuroh, the servant of the former Colorless King, HOMRA, the clansman of the Red King and SCEPTER4, the clansman of the Blue King. Isana is befriended by Yatogami in the process as well as a strange girl/cat named Neko, who we find out is a Strain. Together, they try and solve the mystery behind Yashiro's mistaken identity for a killer who claims to be the Colorless King, as well as find out his connection to the Silver King. Everybody got that? Good...because I sure as hell didn't. For one, who or what are the Kings? The series briefly describes them as seven people with special powers. When they release their power, an object appears in the sky called the Sword of Damocles. So what the hell is the Sword of Damocles? Gooooood question...because the series doesn't explain that either. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a clash between the Red and Blue clans during the early stages of this series because Munakata Reishi, the Blue King feels that another disaster will befall them because Mikoto Suoh's (The Red King) Sword of Damocles is in rough shape due to overusing his power. We get very little explanation or back story about the dangers of a king maintaining their Sword of Damocles so it is just another minor plot point that falls to the wayside due to poor development.\\n\\n\r\nI found the ONLY thing this story did well in both explanation and in storytelling was the reveal of Adolph K. Weismann, the Silver King. Weismann was just about the only character that got any sort of development, albeit still not enough in the grand scheme of things. We learn that the Silver King is also known as the Immortal King...yet, we don't get an explanation as to WHY he's immortal. Or at the very least, the series doesn't do a very good job of explaining that detail. We also find out that there are 7 Kings in total, but it's unexplained who these Kings are, where they came from, and why they have these powers as well as why they can pass their powers down to clansman. \\n\\n\r\nThat leads me to my next point, this story just didn't develop it's characters...any of them. Apparently according to the plot, we should be invested in the battle between the Reds and the Blues. The conflict between Suoh and Munakata. Okay, can you at least tell us WHY? There are times when I wonder, is this story about Yashiro, or is it about Suoh? Or how about Yatogami Kuroh? We learn that he was a servant for the former Colorless King, Ichigen Miwa. And? That's it...for being the what would become best friend of the lead character for this series, we learn next to nothing about him...and don't get me started on this mess that is Yashiro's character. The explanation and back story behind his character is so fragmented and confusing that even when the series is completely said and done, I still don't know ANYTHING about his character. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it felt like the producers tried to tackle way too many issues in a 13 episode series. What it resulted in was a lot unresolved plot points and loosely knitted character development that fell apart at the seams because there were far too many characters to even try and develop. GoHands should've realized (and I use this analogy a lot) that sometimes, less is more. Give us a narrowed down, detailed look at each set of characters or clans. Give us a better explanation/back story to who or what the Kings are. This series MIGHT have worked in a 26 episode set...and I say that loosely. They still might not have been able to tie up all the loose ends in 26 episodes. All-in-all, considering the production budget behind this series, there was a lot to be desired by the time it was all said and done.",

            "content": "For those wondering about \"Low Ratings\" or \"Low Scores\" it's because everyone has their opinions. I mean, some of these people are trying to be deep about it and writing like a critic, but a lot of it is just a guise for their own taste in Anime. If they state something that they don't like, well that' just cause they don't like it.\r\nANYWAYS, I just finished up episode 8 of this series, went straight from 1-8 although I probably shouldn't have. So i'm pretty hooked.\r\nTrying to go no spoiler here:\r\nThe story is alright it has plenty of generic points but, if you abstract thingsyou know, everything has generic points, doesn't mean they are the same thing. It seems out main antagonist has lost his memory about a important event and he's trying to find out what happened. People have special powers and the origin of which has already been revealed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, absolutely fantastic. Crisp at many times often with sort of way-ward colory splashy overlays which I find very appealing to my senses.\\n\\n\r\nSound nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are super generic (again in abstract terms). We got the happy-go-lucky protagonist, his clueless female friend, aloof ally, etc. What really keeps me going is that so far I haven't really seen an antagonist per se... (avoiding spoilers here!)\\n\r\nIt's pretty conflicting to note who is and who is not the antagonist especially if you read the manga back story; so as far as characters go I think that's a pretty neat thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8, it's appealing to me.\\n\r\nMy overall is my enjoyment, so again 8.\\n\\n",

            "content": "K-Project\r\n1st Review and a Long One\r\n*Please take the time to read/skim through it. Don\u2019t just judge by the score I give the anime! If you hate my review, please explain why. \r\n         The autumn season of 2012 was an entertaining one. The season brought new light and a breath of fresh air to the anime industry. Of all the anime there is to talk about, K is one of the most talks about anime to date.  It might be though to the fact that the PVs carry ton of promise for the project bringing in hugeamounts of hype and a start of a new fandom.  Sadly, K collapse under its own weight with ton of criticism toward its poor story and plot progression.  Creating a huge divide among the anime community with one side being the haters while the other side the fans. I\u2019m categorized under the fans but K indeed has flaws that should be taking account. \\n\\n\r\n    All in all K is a project underworked.  For GoRa\u2019s 1st anime project, I found it be a massive success.  And I will explain why:\\n\\n\r\nStory:  (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]\\n\\n\r\nThe story at the beginning: Tatura is murder in an incident putting Yashiro, the main protagonist, into a chaotic battle between the Kings and clans regarding who killed Tatura. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is indeed the biggest problem of K by far.  It is important to note that K\u2019s story is not action oriented given by the few scenes of action nor is it a mystery because you\u2019re not meant to solve it.  K\u2019s story is a mix of different elements but these elements is what makes its story collapse.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever seen an anime produce by Nakanishi Go, you might be able to pin out the problems the plot has. K suffers from poor plot progression.  The anime wants to explore all the different elements but sadly with only 13 episodes it isn\u2019t possible. The 1st 3 episodes focus on explaining the world of K. Episodes 4-9 focus on the bonds and tensions between characters. Last 4 focus on brining all characters together for the big finale. \\n\\n\r\nAsking little questions is the key to enjoying K or then your negatives will ruin your positives. If questions do arise, then don\u2019t be afraid to ask the community has ton of excellent theories is quite accurate.   \\n\\n\r\nYet, the plot manages to be quite interesting at times.  The story is filled with interesting moments and twists that you sometimes wonder if the story is the main focus. And it isn\u2019t! The main focus is in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (+/-) [1 MAL POINT]\\n\\n\r\nThere is lot of things to say about K and its huge cast of characters. I don\u2019t hate any of the characters.  They all perform their roles masterfully with their voice actors truly capturing the personality of the characters. So why did I give it only 1 MAL point?  Not all of the characters are given the proper screen time they deserve. \\n\\n\r\nThe main trio [Yashiro, Neko, & Kuroh] represent the power to have close bonds with each other. Mikoto and Reishi are the Kings with huge hearts toward their clan who journey a solitary road.  And there is Yata and Fushimi two close friends/rivals that can never be separated by faith [no yaoi here]. K is all about bonds but what about the other characters?\\n\\n\r\nThere are more obvious bonds within K but the screen time is given more to these parings more than anything else.  I personally wanted to see more of Ana as she manages to be the most questionable character regarding what she means to Mikoto. \\n\\n\r\nWhat ever happen to Izumo? Given a role of a typical leader! \\n\\n\r\nThe classmates were interesting and wish they had more time on screen.  \\n\\n\r\nRikio!!!! He means something to Yata but what? The poor old Gold King\u2026.. not even given the proper time to be on screen for being the Gold King.\\n\\n\r\n\tHopefully these problems will be fixed for the next season because these bonds were unique to K making the characters memorable in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nArt:  (+) [2 MAL POINTS]\\n\r\n\tThe biggest positive of K is its Art, and that is something we all can agree with. Animation quality of K can just not be described with words. It\u2019s just plain beautiful to look at.  GoHands really knows how to bring quality to the next level. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing a similar art style that can be found in the Mardock Scramble series, K uses a smart blend of gradients to bring out the colors of the characters and the setting. It even helps create a realistic shine on objects that shine depending on the lighting. Ton of detail is pack in every frame with the brief scenes of CG being forgiven as this is animation at its best. With only one major screw up being with the Bell Tower Explosion scene [rather not explain as it was horrific to watch]. Action scenes are well drawn out fill with the flashing colors of the physic powers even though they are quite short.\\n\\n\r\n\tK broke new ground in the anime industry showing how TV animation can reach the quality of the movies. Setting the bar high to what future TV animation can look like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (+) [2 MAL Points]\\n\r\n\tSoundtrack of K\u2026.. memorable!!!! For Endo Mikio\u2019s 1st time in the anime industry, he manages to capture the urban feel of the city and emotions of the characters. You know a soundtrack is going to be excellent when the 1st track, title \u201cSuoh Mikoto\u201d, comes blazing in with the beat and intensity of the pain to describe Mikoto\u2019s character. This helps creates stage for K when the opening credits were done rolling as we enter the world that is K. And there are more tracks I wish I could describe but in the end their no real way to describe the emotions and feelings you get from each track.\\n\\n\r\nFor the OP and ED songs, they do their job well but aren\u2019t as memorable as the soundtrack. Then again my taste of music is quite different when it comes to OP and ED so sadly I can't go in depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (+) [2 MAL POINTS]\\n\\n\r\nK is an anime that isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. The fun of K comes from the bonds of characters within the beautiful world that is the anime. I personally had a blast with the anime. Even though it has flaws, K manages to not be an utter failure of this season. In fact my memories of K will stay in tack as K\u2019s charms can appeal to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nEither it is for the animation, soundtrack, characters, or the story, K has something for everyone. For the 1st project of GoRa, it is a massive success that can be use to make the project better than it was before. I\u2019m looking forward to what GoRa can bring to the table in the anime industry with its future K relating projects.  If you\u2019re someone like me who is going to watch the 2nd season, I recommend reading the manga prequels and watching K in a new positive light.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will but my review to a close to the most memorable anime of the year for me. Enjoyment of the anime is different for everyone. I'm here saying that you should watch it but of course this anime will not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "K, let me start by saying that although this series wasn't close to becoming a masterpiece, it is not nearly as bad as alot of viewers are making it out to be with scores such as 3's/4's. However i can see why many people didn't like this anime.\r\nPlot: Im not going to bore you all with giving a summary of the plot, as im assuming you have at least some knowledge of the show if you are reading this review. 'K' had so much potential, however like many recent shows airing, the plot was neglected due to the high demand of having pretty visuals andcatchy songs that will attract in viewers. The story line wasn't bad at all, it was simply lacking more attention from the creators. I felt as though the entire plot was rushed, resulting in many questions that were left un-answered. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: There's really not much to say about these two components of the show. Both were fantastically done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development was fairly bland and poorly done. I noticed that alot of the main characters didn't have any development or references about their past. I don't know what i was expecting, but it wasn't what i got.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was an okay show. Give it a try and if you don't like it in the first few episodes, give it up. Because it doesn't get better as the show goes on. It's one of those shows that you will hate, love, or you will be neutral with it because lets be honest. You all have nothing else to waste your time with. (that's why you are reading this review).\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I wonder if people want to be original from the get go or just take  concepts from different shows, throw them all in a pot and hope something good comes out.  Project K is a classic example of people who have to much to do and not enough resources to do it with.\r\nSTORY 4/10\r\nFrom the first episode we have been given the basic outline of each character, their goals and where each of them stand in terms of ranking. It doesn't help the viewer that episode one starts in the middle of the plot, tracks back and then pushes forward.  \r\nItsets up a very clever way of telling the story by throwing all these problems and situations at the viewer in hopes it will make it all clear by episode 13. Depending on how far you read into the plot and the characters motives you may get a completely different answer.\\n\\n\r\nART 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this show is what (in my case) makes it memorable. It sets a brilliant landscape for the show from the city to the wastelands, the technology such as the robots have all been detailed to the millimeter. You can probably watch this show and adore it based on the art alone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10\\n\r\nI was sort of conflicted with the OST, while the music was very good it felt like the tracks were played in the wrong moments. The opening theme didn't fit the style of the opening and the main piano piece was very overplayed, it almost felt like one long music video for that one song.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 4/10 \\n\r\nAs I've read in some other Project K reviews people say that the characters were too 'under developed' for me this wasn't quite true. From episode one it was like the characters were just to distant from the plot, not giving much of a story away. I'm not sure if this is a result of the makers wanting them to seem more mysterious or setting up something for season 2 but I couldn't feel sad or pained for a character I barely knew.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad anime. I enjoyed it, the art was amazing, the soundtrack was good, characters were likable. I give credit to the producers who were able to squeeze all these different plot points in to just 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 6/10\\n\r\nI think Project K had to much to live up to before it even aired, with the story telling style of Baccano! and overall plot feel of No.6 this anime is enjoyable and that's all you really need. Not much to think about or keep up with (Unless you're one of those 'deeper meaning' people).\\n\r\nIf you can stand the amount of fan service it gives girls to ship him with him then I recommend this show as just a bit of eye candy for people who like quality art with simple-to-follow plot.",

            "content": "This show had a good start, the first episode showed the best of what this show could ever offer. Cool characters, beautiful art, nice introduction to the plot and setting. As I watched subsequent episodes however, I started to realise the story was progressing from nowhere to little at all.\r\nThe story could have been something interesting. The first episode presented many interesting characters, and the plot was good enough that it could have gone somewhere interesting as it progressed. Sadly, this progression had gone almost nowhere after three episodes, and many characters took a turn for the worse. They're shallow at their best, and completelyobsolete and irrelevant at the worst. The majority only appearing to serve as fan service to female and male viewers. Which is another point I need to make about this show. It's shallow. To be perfectly honest it seems a lot like someone wanted to create a show purely just for those people that like shipping characters and letting their own imaginations get in. It's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's like porn without anything explicit (Excluding Neko, her entire existence in this show is purely sex appeal), and they didn't forget to include a terrible plot line either.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the art, it really is beautiful, but it also feels like it's like that for the reasons stated above. Although the scenery is just amazing to look at, and the animation is superb too. It'd be a perfectly fair reason to watch K just to witness what the animation has to offer, although I personally think the first episode covers pretty much everything there is to see, particularly since I noticed a few scenes reused in subsequent episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell to summarise, if you don't mind shallow characters and slow story progression which may or may not lead anywhere coupled with beautiful animation and fan service, feel free to check this out, but just be mindful that there are definitely better things out there than what K has to offer.",

            "content": "Do you know one of those anime that despite not having anything outstanding to it, still end up making you watch it until the middle of the night and go tell all your friends about how great it is the next day? Yeah, K is one of those\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nK story is set in a busy, futuristic city that underneath its grandeur lies supernatural forces and dangerous gangs. Much like Durarara!!, the show has multiple story lines that end up intersecting each other in the end. Now, if this is the first time something like this was done, I would really had enjoyed it much more.But if you are a big fan of Durarara!! like I am, you would be very distracted by how many similarities these two shows have. However, that did not stop me from liking the story of K. From the intense tale of the chase for a murder case suspect to the story of the psychic power wielding gangs, K has a pretty interesting plot. Just like Durarara!! though, there are some points that you might have to read between the lines a little, but for me, that is a lot better than having the plot spoon fed to me by the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt is perhaps K's strongest point. When I was a kid, I always imagined I had awesome psychic powers and I would look like a total badass if it weren't for this thing called reality. But when watching K, I feel like my imaginative world  came to life. Intense battle scenes, awesome psychic fields, cool character designs, etc. you name it, K has them all. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Nujabes even a tiny little bit, I think you would like K soundtrack a lot. Filled with suave urban style tracks, K's BGM fits the show's setting like a glove. Of course, it is not Samurai Champloo, but the music does grow on you and on many occasions add to the atmosphere seamlessly, making K a very appealing experience to your senses of sight and sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a show where even the side characters make you relate to them so much you could be their best friend, K might seem a bit lacking. However, for the type of anime that it is, it doesn't need to have those kinds of characters. Instead K makes up for this by having several solid leads, while adding in some character archetypes that we all know and love like the Spectacled Badass, the Sadist, the Kindhearted Gang Leader, the Ice Queen, etc. and does that take out any enjoyment? Absolutely not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, K is not an outstanding anime. I've seen others shows that have used the elements that it has before and done it better. However, by combining these aspects together and multiplying that with smooth music and animation, K ends up being a very fun ride at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow those of you who are into more serious shows and expect only the best of story and character development might say that this show is not worth its score, and that is entirely understandable. However, for just sheer appeal to the senses, K is still a very enjoyable show. It does not try to be overly serious and it does not need to be. So go grab some popcorn and maybe even a friend, because K is a show worthy of the title King in its category (well, there are better shows of course but I just wanted to make that joke.)\\n",

            "content": "K is by no means a masterpiece but at the same time it isn't as bad as some people are making out to be. I personally think that K completed the plot its based around its own little world pretty well. \r\nIsana Yashiro is a soft and an adolescent teenager who lives on his own and is always active with his friends around the campus. However he soon finds himself chased down by the infamous gang named \"HOMRA\" who are the clansmen for the Red King. In the anime, seven kings or rulers are portrayed who have their own persona and supernatural powers. From theimpeccable Silver King, to the inferior Colorless King, the series focuses mostly on the Red King and the Blue King. So after the murder of one of the members of the HOMRA gang namely of \"Totsuka Tatara\", a video tape is left behind which point out the seemingly innocent Isana Yashiro as the culprit. It also happens to be that Isana Yashiro isn't quite as the person he seems to be, as he has little to no memory of his own past. K follows the story of the Red King and the HOMRA members seeking their revenge of the murder of one of their members, to the Blue King and their clansmen trying to stop the inevitable battle that will shake the order among the seven kings and to reveal the true identity of Shiro aka Isana Yashiro. \\n\\n\r\nK has quite an unique blend of characters, with Kuroh Yatagami, the student of the former Colorless King who is in the search for the person who is to become the next Colorless King, and to reach a decision whether the new Colorless King is worthy enough of the throne. He also has the job given by his former master as to decide whether the new Colorless King is good or evil, and if he's the former, Kuroh is to slay him right there. Coming to a decision that Shiro is the new Colorless King from the video tape that surfaced featuring Shiro shooting Totsuka Tatara, Shiro now has to explain that he's innocent. Shiro is shown as a silly yet simple and also a very mysterious character who is in search of what truly is he, along with Neko, a cat which possesses some magical powers. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the beautiful melody tones inserted into each episodes and a good voice acting work done, K tops the sound aspect very well. Angela is an extremely talented singer and it's evident from the lovely opening theme. \\n\\n\r\nGoHands has a reputation for creating a beautiful piece of art and K adds to that reputation. K is a burst of attractive colors and a ravishing artsyle that truly makes K a masterpiece when you talk about the artwork. It's one of best anime around in recent times if you consider the art of it, and for the same reason I can't stop but wonder why the studio has made very less anime's of the same type. Personally I really enjoyed K and I'll say that it's worth giving a watch. The story is well brought together which makes for a good watch and a nice ending. \\n",

            "content": "'Set in a world where history has taken a slightly different course from the one we're familiar with, K follows the story of a young boy whose life is caught in a psychic war between seven kings'\r\nStory: 4 \r\nWhere to begin, first we start with the protagonist which is a student that goes by the name of Yashiro Isana, a normal student who attends school at first glance however that is not the case. Yashiro Isana is attacked by a group of suspicious men because Yashiro is suspected of killing one of the groups comrades, however to no memory of Yashiro. This is the catalystof the following events to come. Story wise we are left confused as the story starts to unfold later on the show and not much explanation is given early on. I can interpret this by the writers trying to replicate that same sense of helplessness and confusion that Yashiro is a victim of. When watching the show progress towards its end you would hope that stories and mysteries will unfold, however this is not the case 2/3 of the show we still do not know the full extent of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads on to the criticism of the plot. With the story left to be fully explained towards the end of the series this means that story pacing feels unnatural and rushed towards the end as it feels the show is trying to tie up lose ends with what little screen time they have. I felt as watching the show I didn't care for the story as much because it wouldn't give me time to soak up story. With so many cool concepts for the show the 13 episodes did not do the show justice as there was room for the writer to build upon.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nOne section of the show that cant be criticised is the Art. Its visually stimulating, the way in which some scenes look almost real with what I can imagine are real life rendered images used as backgrounds for some sequences of the show, its as the anime world invaded reality. The colours of the anime are vibrant and bright which makes for a pleasant watching experience. Character models and attention to detail on characters are of high quality which adds a more authentic touch. Animations where also fairly good as most scenes where carefully planned out from a detailed standpoint. Compared to other shows such as bleach and Naruto that has a bad habit of recycled animation and static character models, K animates the show to a fairly high degree. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime is also noticeably good. Voice acting is great across every character with characters such as Mikito, giving me goosebumps whenever he talks. As for selection of music its fair to say that the music choice they use is some of the best I've heard regardless that there wasn't many music selection as I would have liked there to be, meaning that music was sometimes recycled A lot but that's just me being picky. Overall the sound quality of music and voice actors they did use made the show a bit more pleasurable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nLinking back to the original argument I made under the Story section with the story being to short and rushed this unfortunately carries over to the character development which I find there is generally none of. With Such powerful characters displayed from the very start of the show, its as if it almost intentionally sets up for these characters to develop and show a different side to the very linear personalities. The writer tries to compensate for this by giving us flashback sequences here and there, however this is not enough to fully immerse us with the characters on display. Furthermore some characters who play an integral part in the anime are introduced with no background story making these characters remain a mystery and for viewers to question the purpose of said characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nFor me personally I enjoyed the show at times but was left disappointed by the plot holes and the lack of details that I look for in an anime. The concept of the show was a unique one that I really loved but again was left disappointed on how the plot was lacklustre.The art made me really appreciate the show as at times it felt I was viewing a visual masterpiece with the amazing art direction is was going for. Overall it was a decent way to bide the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nTo conclude I wouldn't recommend this show for any newcomer to anime not to say its a bad show but just because there are many other shows that perfect most categories I covered. However for someone who has seen most mainstream anime I would encourage you to watch it as the Art is some of the best you will see for any show. Finally with a Movie that is a direct sequel to the anime announced for release in 2014 there is still hope that they are able to tie all lose ends and build on characters to leave a lasting memory of the show. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw pictures and trailers for K, I though:\r\n\"Man this looks promising!\"\r\nAnd so the first episode started off with an amazing instrumental hip hop track, some cool looking dudes and a cute loli... and this weird blue filter...\r\nWell after a couple of episodes full of nonsense later I found myself baffled how anyone could even understand what this show was about.\r\nWell needless to say, this show made as much sense as a monocycle riding monkey on a plane.\r\nLet's just get to it.\r\nFirst the good:\r\nAnimation 8/10\r\nThis show looks damn fucking amazing it would have earned a 9/10 but that damn ugly blue filter ruinedit for me to be honest.\\n\r\nI mean look at it it's fluid as hell, the fighting scenes are fabulous. I was impressed. The only thing it kinda felt short was sometimes when they used boring stills ineffective and some background looked okay but not great (but sometimes they also did).\\n\r\nAnother gripe I had with the character designs. I like if they are individualized but they were a bit too Bi-Shounen for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe other great thing about this show was the great OST. A mixture of instrumental Hip hop and Electronica. Really cool and my first favorite OST of the season (others came to that list later).\\n\r\nThe Voiceactors were okay but because the characters were so poor and 1dimensional they couldn't shine and non stood out.\\n\r\nThe opening was horrendous and the ending forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the bad Parts:\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThat this convoluted piece of garbage even got 3/10 is a miracle.\\n\r\nBut I have my reasons for that.\\n\r\nBesides the ending the plot made no sense. had no sense of pacing, was complex for complexity sake and even in the end wasn't clear. I would say the premise was okay but since it never really got explained it was just a huge mess.\\n\r\nAt least because of the nonsensical story it never felt as if there was anything that wasn't important or like a filler, and some battles where cool so the episodes could be exciting and here and there was a cliffhanger or WOW effect but still in light of a stupid plot felt short.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's me and I just didn't \"get it\", but then it was the animes fault. I \"got\" Lain, and if this crap is deeper than Lain I think I kill myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAt least everyone seemed to have a reasonable motivation for what they did.\\n\r\nBut else there was no development, nor did any character make sense. Everything felt artificial.\\n\r\nLikable was only the cute Loli for being a cute Loli. Yeah that's it. \\n\r\nWorst-Cast-Ever.\\n\\n\r\nValue 2/10\\n\r\nIf you have no Idea what I mean by this, go to my Profile, check \"new rating system\" and read about Value. I think it's a very good point to make for every show.\\n\r\nBut I will include it's parts for this review\\n\r\nRewatchability - only to see if it makes more sense. But please no thanks not again.\\n\r\nSentimental - It was a particular bad anime with the most messy plot I've ever seen. It sure stands out to me. It was also the first really nonsensical anime I've ever seen. I give creds for that.\\n\r\nHistorical - Non this show will be forgotten, didn't do anything groundbreaking or influential. At least I hope it doesn't influence other shows to be this bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy it for the music and amazing animations.\\n\r\nAnd I hoped it would become clear.\\n\r\nBut after finishing it, it only was this really bad anime that I finished with wasted animation and soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : BAD do not watch, of just for the fighting scenes but I have some gifs for that if you'd like to seem them.",

            "content": "Project K. What can I say? I have mixed feelings about it; more importantly it is a typical sad case of great concept ruined by terrible execution. Here's why.\r\nLets put the story aside for a while, and talk about the concept. The concept for Project K is arguably fresh and creative. I won't call it particularly innovative but it does wonderfully so combine elements of sci-fi and fantasy. Seven Kings and their vassals endorsed by that special power, street gangs, military-like organizations and a high school and an inevitable evil mastermind behind all the events. It's a bit of everything and I suppose that's whyit is non-standard. With proper attention to each and every bit of that we would have probably received a truly memorable anime. And here's where Project K fails hard. Being only 13 episodes long it does nothing to process those ingredients into an edible dish. We never as much learn about the origin of power that is inherent to kings or how they received it. Is it magic? Is it science and technology? Who are other kings? What is factual peculiarity of their power? What is the story behind the crater thing? etc. Same pretty much goes to every other plotline and character.\\n\\n\r\nPlot itself is somewhat messy. We've got a mysterious murder and gangs who are going after the culprit who is in turn the main protagonist who suffers from amnesia who later discovers kings/vassals/magic and the actual murderer. Seems like a very action packed anime huh? Well it isn't. Good 2/3 of it we are having character interactions and chases which have very little to do with actual plot and hence the very gist of it is unveiled during final eps. Such uneven pacing keeps you hooked only during very first and very last episodes, becoming rather annoying in the middle. Most plotlines go nowhere and a lot of things are left unexplained, such as who's Neko, where's slate, past of certain characters. It just doesn't fall in place. That being said, amnesia is an awful plot-device.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Now art is one of the few strong points that K has. Animation is smooth and beautiful featuring great camera angles and spectacular special effects. The art itself imitates a cross-processed film which makes it look bright and optimistic, easy on the eye. The character design is hit and miss. Some are nicely designed with a distinguished look, the others are your typical janes and joes you'd find in any anime. Overall, it's a visual eye-candy although the quality declines towards the end of series.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Another strong point. The soundtrack is crispy with some lovely piano arrangements, if a little repetitive. I have nothing much to say about OP and ED, they are both quite decent, but not the kind of songs that would stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are poorly fleshed out and present nothing original. We have typical personality-less school mob. We have an odd main hero who acts somewhat like Haru from Tsuritama. We have Neko who is in a sense a cardboard copy of Shiro (Deadman Wonderland), and we have Kuro (a lovechild of Kanda x Sebastian). In fact we have a ton of characters which are implied to have had interesting ties to each other in the past and present, but sadly it is never fully unfolded in the anime. It's not to say that characters are annoying or boring from the start, not at all. What I imply is, with the length of anime, it just seems unreasonable to put such a crowd in and toss hints about their complex history. If it was 26 eps long, that would be fine. Alas, it is not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's easy to watch. Project K is that kind of anime that is perfectly watchable if you turn your brain off and just relax. It's not the best anime ever, nor it is the worst one. If you are looking for something other than just swords and mecha, this is probably a good choice.",

            "content": "Name of the series- K project\r\nSynopsis- K is set in a busy, futuristic city where underneath its grandeur lies supernatural forces and dangerous gangs. At its core, it is a story about finding the identity of a murderer and its implications in an ongoing war between superpowered clans and the 'Kings' who are at the helm of great power. The storyline follows a student, Isana Yashiro who follows a seemingly normal life and is brought into the middle of the psychic gang war, suspected to be the said murderer.\r\nNumber of episodes- 13\r\nGenre- Sci-fi, fantasy, action, mystery\r\nOpinion About the Anime-\r\nArt&Animation:(9.5/10) One thing that can't be deniedabout this anime is the impeccable art that has been put into play. The sceneries (backgrounds) are very colourful and the 'futuristic' nature of the city is drawn with utter perfection to the point where nothing seems out of place. People do complain about the blue screentone, but I for one completely adore it. As for the characters, they look geat, amazing even, totally bi-shounen The fight scenes- however few- were amazing to watch and the movements were as fluid as it gets. It is in no doubt one of those shows that draws you in just with their trailers. My word, the first few trailers were awesome. \\n\r\nSounds: (7/10) The opening was kind of weird when I first heard it but in time I learned to like it more or less. The OSTs were good but sometimes they felt overused in places that really didn't require songs. The songs I liked with conviction were Tatara's 'circle of friends' and this other hip-hop electronica thing.They had a star-studded seiyuu cast and the voice acting per say was really good. \\n\r\nCharacters: (6/10) If you look at the characters art-wise they are flawless, I mean, I could fangirl any number of them with looks alone. Although it did bother me that sometimes Seri seemed to have no nose, Neko's haircolour oscillated from pink to peach and Yashiro's skin ended up the same colour as his hair in some frames. However it was probably because of the plotline and the seemingly weak co-ordination but most of the characters seemed hollow and half-baked to me. Like there is potential but it wasn't harnessed in ways I might have liked... Personally, I don't get the 'point' why a few characters even existed- just saying.\\n\r\nStory- (4.5/10) The story, as in the 'murdering' part and the justification were all fine and great. But throughout the story something just seems 'off'. People say it's because K only had 13 episodes and they were too 'rushed' to fit it all in. But seriously, if I remember right there were some pointlessly 'drawn out' parts that could have been avoided entirely. And of course not to mention that the series itself doesn\u2019t provide much form of closure- covering that up with the excuse of releasing a second season which turns out to be a (not yet released) movie instead. It remains to be seen where that would lead to.\\n\r\nOverall- (5/10)\\n\r\nIn short, to me K is nothing more than eyecandy and fanservice- a haven for the BL community and priceless reference for background and 'fight choreography' buffs. One could enjoy it by appreciating the art and action alone. But if you're looking for something with a story that has a particular 'point' to it, or something that leaves you satisfied saying \"Boy, that was good.\" This series is not for you. I had to learn that the hard way.",

It's so superb. The animation is so smooth. The fight scenes are awesome (although few). The art is so detailed. The colors are vibrant (but sometimes annoyingly too much). Character Designs are good. They fit each character's personalities. It really is a feast for the eyes.\r\nSOUND\r\nSoundtrack was pretty good. OP & ED are thumbs up. Voice acting was well done. There's nothing much tocomplain about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nHaving so many characters to feature, most of them are left untouched, which is bad. There will be a sequel, which might improve this, but in this season, there's little to no character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nWhen you speak about the concept, it's got huge potential. The problem with it is that the execution was badly done. The series will leave you with a big \"HUH?\" as it is so confusing. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for animes with great art so even though the story's not that good, I fairly enjoyed it just because of the art and the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest that people who are finding an anime excelling in art and soundtrack to watch this as it is a huge treat but I also suggest that you have little to no expectations at all regarding the story as you will be heavily disappointed by it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

There's a lot of people complaining that details in the world aren't explained, but that's because they don't bother to do research, there IS a manga that serves as a prequel to this. Also, I for one enjoy mystery, and figure that things will work out in the end. SPOILER ALERT: Plot Twist.\r\nIts art is simply amazing, much better than just about every anime I've seen so far.\r\nIts characters are distinguishable, they have their own unique personalities with actualdepth to them. Its more than just fighting and fighting, as evident when Seri visits Izumo at the Homura headquarters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have only seen 3 episodes of K and btw this is my first review, so please stop read this if you find it annoying and really bad just stop, and if you mind, tell me why it is so bad so I can improve and not write crap again. \r\nThis anime seems to have a lot of potential, mainly due to its unique and amazing art, especially the opening. I could take a random screenshot from the opening and use it as desktop wallpaper without any problems, because it is so well made. Apart from the opening the actual episodes also has some reallygood art, moving people and an environment that actually could be a possible future Japan. The thing that I find most amazing is the small details, and finesses the different cool looking gadgets they have. The music I sometimes can find unfitting, and the beats in the background can sometimes be a bit disturbing, but those beats are usually well placed and the soundtrack is better average.\\n\\n\r\nThe place that the story is set in is a very realistic future of Japan, even though the place where they are in is an alternative world. From what I have seen so far, this story is about different fractions in a city, and their war, something that is interesting. The story has lots of potentials, and could easily bloom out, but I am afraid that it probably won\u2019t, because this story seems a bit too complicated. After three episodes I find a lot of things especially characters confusing, because I still don\u2019t have the slightest idea why they are there and what role they have. The humor is something that this anime does not lack. I find the main character amusing and sometimes hilarious, for example (small spoiler) a guy comes to murder him and the following day they end up eating breakfast together.\\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be tons of different characters, and if you see to your left under the information, there are only going to be 13 episodes. The character introductions so far has been average, and is nothing that really stands out, but it works out well. You can easily tell apart from most of the different characters, but because there are so many and it is a problem remembering all of them. There are two characters that are really similar to each other, and I think I have mistaken one with another a couple of times already. But otherwise each character seems to have a unique personality,appearance and ability.\\n\\n\r\nJust like most anime this one seems to also have a \u201cfan service\u201d character, just like Inori form Guily Crown, but now the anime industry has taken one step further, and this character, who is called Neko (cat in Japanese). She goes around naked, is really random, and whose purpose in life is to please the young adult males. I find this really sad and irritating, because she doesn\u2019t really fit in the picture of the story so far, and seriously people grow up. Is it really that fun to see naked women run around that has very little to do with the story? There is something called internet and people can just go there to google \u201cnaked women\u201d if people are so desperate.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this anime has some flaws and things that might ruin it in the future, I am willing to take the risk to be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nSo summary time:\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 some really amazing art\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 because there will be flaws and there are some flaws\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10 not the best but good\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 find them well done, but too many and still have difficulties to tell some apart even after 3 episodes\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor: 8/10 some really good scene are present in this anime\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 because this anime has lots of potentials to become a 9/10 but the possibility for it to drop down to 5/10 is not small because it is very story based, so each episode must be somewhat meaningful.\\n",

            "content": "For me, K, although flawed, did present a very enjoyable and stuck-to-the-screen experience. The overall concept was decent, but presenting it was mediocre, partially due to time constraints (I would imagine).\r\nStory - 5.\r\nAlthough the concept of the anime was an intriguing one, the execution was not so well done. A lot of times I was confused by what was happening, with no real explanation afterward. The overall story I understand, however little things are left unsaid - anything about the kings really, their origin, very little is actually said about powers, how and why different people have them, and so on. It left me witha gazillion questions and very few answers. The ending is also a cliffhanger....sort of...which is always annoying if it is not followed up.\\n\r\nDespite some plot holes and unexplained phenomena (like the whole Strain thing - why do we only meet one? And why is she entirely unexplained?) I did enjoy watching K, for reasons I will state below.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10.\\n\r\nYeah one of the things everyone seems to agree on it that K's art and animation really is stunning. The animation was smoothly executed, the character designs were relatively interesting and the art style consistent. The colour palette was varied and really helped develop a certain feel in a lot of scenes, especially the fight/action scenes - lots of bright colours to add to the excitement. The little details were not few and far between either - almost everything was detailed, which really made a believable environment.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.\\n\r\nThe sound quality for K was noticeably high, the voice actors did a sterling job and really set the scene for the anime in general. Honourable mentions to Mikoto and Fushimi's actors, both of which executed a brilliant and believable performance to their characters.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the OP, it seemed relatively fitting to the theme of the anime, however the ED didn't really stick for me. I didn't like nor dislike it.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the sound was the same piano riff/theme was used throughout the series, I don't think there was many deviations for it, mostly for a reveal or the lead up to an epic moment. It didn't annoy me, it was just noticeable and maybe a wider range of background music would have set the scene a little better.\\n\r\nFinally the in-world noises were executed fine too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6.\\n\r\nSince the story is so confusing at times and seems to leave most questions without answers, the characters weren't too easy to really relate to for me, although I developed a soft spot for Shiro.\\n\r\nI think where characters probably worked best in K is with their interactions with one another - they almost all have ties with each other and interact in different ways, which really made the anime for me. You were always wondering what their true relationship is and how it will change over the course of the anime.\\n\r\nOf course, being so short, you don't get much time to really connect to the characters whilst you're trying to figure out what's going on around them, but for me an at least passable job was done portraying what they wanted to portray. I've seen blander and more personality-less characters than K, that's for certain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, K was an engrossing and thrilling ride for me. I really had no idea what to expect (as the synopsis didn't give away a lot) but I wasn't disappointed (until the ending). It may not be a really deep engaging story but the action scenes are really a spectacle to behold, I'm glad I watched it for the art alone! Although there wasn't much character development or real..substance to each character, they stood best when interacting with one another, which really kept the show moving for me. And the mysteries surrounding each. Which were decently executed, but I feel like if they'd had more time to give you a little more information on the characters and the world in general it may have been easier to connect.\\n\r\nI digress.\\n\r\nOverall a very enjoyable anime to watch, especially for those who appreciate excellent art and animation - just don't expect a fully solved puzzle at the end of your journey.",

            "content": "To begin, I would like to point out how amazing the art and animation is in K. It is very pleasant to look at, and (most of the time) the animation is seamless. Also, the soundtrack is above average, and I really enjoyed the opening and ending themes especially. Now, let's get into the problems I had with the show.\r\nK spent a ton of time on world building, only to end up not actually using most of the stuff they spent time explaining. In the early episodes they talk about how there are 7 kings, and the colorless king, but only the red, blue, gold,and silver king actually appear in the anime; on top of that only the red and blue clansmen appear in the anime. So why have 7 kings?\\n\\n\r\nAlso they explain that Neko is a strain that has special powers, which I thought was a really cool concept. But she was the only one (or the only one to appear in the anime at least) so what was the point? It seems like her only real purpose was to make Shiro and Kuro really OP for no reason. It would have been interesting to see if there was another strain like her on an opposing side with a different ability, and make the battles more interesting or something. I don't know, just my thoughts on her. \\n\\n\r\nK is also guilty of using what we call big \"no-nos\" in story telling. The one that K is most famous for abusing is giving tons of exposition to the audience, using characters that would have no reason to be discussing the information; it is just a really lazy way to convey information to the audience. They do this MANY times; one such example of this is in one of the very last episodes when the blue king and the red king are talking about the \"swords\" of each king (the big ass ones that float in the sky) and how it shows their true form or how they are on the inside; basically when a king is weak their sword looks all weak and broken and vice versa. They spend roughly 4 minutes talking about this when obviously (being kings) they would already know this information, so why are they talking about it? Why are they wasting so much screen time discussing things that they clearly already know? It would have been much better to explain stuff like this to Shiro because he didn't really know anything that was going on, so there would be a reason to explain it to him.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, one thing that I really didn't get was their weapons. Why are they using swords if this takes place in the future? And the fact that the red clansmen use baseball bats and lead pipes and such implies that the weapon doesn't really affect their strength, but they use they powers to augment their weapon to make it strong. So why use weapons at all if they are just using their powers to augment them anyway? Why not just use their powers alone to fight (and actually, the red king does only use his powers to fight, and is the only character to do so).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very bland and generic for the most part; none of them really stood out as a unique character particularly. I didn't find any characters super unlikable or just plain bad per say, but there are no characters in K that really stand out as something I have never seen before. Part of this may be attributed to K trying to use so many characters to accomplish so little. They didn't need as many characters as they had to tell the story they wanted to tell, and if they had opted for using less characters, they may have had enough time to really develop them and fully flesh them out.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't hate K, nor did I think it was a \"bad\" anime. I just thought it was one of those anime like Guilty Crown where all of their budget went into the art/animation/sound and not into the characters/story. I thought it was pretty average, probably wouldn't recommend to a friend, as there are many anime that do much more in the same amount of episodes (or less).",

            "content": "This is my second time reviewing K. Why? Because my first review wasn't good enough to protect it.  \r\nFirst off, I will be writing some spoilers about the characters, especially Mikoto and Shiro. If you have not watched K, don't read the second half of my review. I won't review the plot, simply because I believe all plots should revolve around the characters and never the other way around. With a lot of mystery and action series, you are basically watching a puppet show with forced actions and personalities onto the characters just to keep the plot engaging. This will never work for me.Never. \\n\\n\r\nK is different in that the plot is built around the characters. This is easily done in a slice of life series, but for a short action, fantasy, and mystery story, this is extremely hard. You have to build the characters the same time you build up the plot. This seems pretty easy in theory, but in reality, to prevent the plot from taking over the characters is a pretty hard task in a limited amount of time. The creators have to constantly keep in mind this cheesy idea: the \u201csoul\u201d of each character that tells them where they want to go. \\n\\n\r\nHere comes the spoilers on the characters. I will focus on two only because others involve around them.\\n\r\n1. Mikoto. Yes, Mikoto. He isn't the main character, and no, I did not put him in the first place because he is my favorite. In fact, I dislike him. However, he is the most important character in K nonetheless. He is the foil, and actually I haven't seen in a long time this kind of fascinating foil. He is the foil that never truly interacted with the protagonist, Shiro, but it makes me excited just to think about them together. Oh, I should stop here for a second and comment something about the yaoi suggestions. I'm a fujoshi. But I'm not a fujoshi who drools over every boy love story. For example, I did not like Kuroshitsuji no matter how much I liked the boy and his butler. The beyond reasonable plot and cheap character development ruined it for me. Now back to K, if you are a person who is extremely sensitive to boy love suggestions, then K might not be a show for you. But truthfully K has very little boy love suggestions. \\n\r\nNow seriously back to Mikoto. Mikoto is the kind of tragic hero who is lost in his resolution from the beginning to the end. I wouldn't say he did what he did out of revenge. Of course, revenge is a part of it, but Mikoto is a much more complicated person. Let's say, if Johan Liebert from Monster and Kuroro from HxH sit at one extreme end and Luffy from One Piece sits on the other extreme end, Mikoto is the person in the middle. I don't like him exactly because he is in the middle, but that's just my personal taste. Mikoto could not abandon his sadness and anger and become monsters like Johan and Kuroro, and he also could not change the negative energies into positive forces like Luffy can. From the very beginning, he is already like a time bomb, both literally and abstractly speaking. Glass-kun tries to stop the bomb from killing himself and others around him. That's Glass-kun's role in the whole series, so essentially, Glass-kun is the foil to Mikoto. I won't get into other characters around them, but each major follower of Mikoto has his unique personality. Despite the differences in their personality, they still followed Mikoto till the end(except for that one particular person with his psycho voice. he is still interesting, don't get me wrong). So what made Mikoto so attractive for them? I think it's Mikoto's vulnerability that turned into strength for others, but not for himself unfortunately. And no, I don't mean they feel superior standing beside a more sensitive and vulnerable person that suffers alone. It's because they could feel the warmth from the fire he burns, so like Tatara said, Mikoto's power protects people, and his followers feel it. This whole set-up is symbolically consistent with Mikoto being the red king that wields fire that is a potential source of warmth and Glass-kun being the blue king that's cold in appearance but calms the fire when it goes wild.\\n\\n\r\n2.  Next is about Shiro. Personally, he is my favorite, along with Kuroh and Neko. I won't reveal his real identity here, but honestly, whoever Isana Yashiro is, Shiro is Shiro. That's why I like him the most. His warmth, unlike Mikoto's, doesn't come from self-sacrificial burning, but from his smiles. Shiro is a playful character that smiles a lot, even in dangerous and sad situation. His unfitting smiles are not satirical, unlike most people's when they want to feign confidence. Shiro is a person who believes in people around him and allows others to believe in him. His foil Mikoto can also do this, but again, they do it differently. That's why I feel so excited about this setup between Shiro and Mikoto. In appearance, Mikoto is a dying person while Shiro is an immortal, but they suffer the same loneliness. Mikoto self-sacrifices while Shiro smiles but they do it for the same reason. Kuroh and Neko are essential for the development of Shiro as a character. They are there so that Shiro has someone to smile at, especially when he smiles out of sadness. The clich\u00e9 way of putting those three would be, they complete each other. Unfortunately for Mikoto, the person who completes him died. Their fate consequently changed because of this development. I feel in a way, Shiro and Mikoto switched their places in many respects.The most obvious one is  Mikoto who had a special friend ends up losing that person while Shiro who had no one gains kuroh and neko. This situational switch triggered much of the character development.\\n\r\nIn summary, K is a story about gaining and losing important people around us, and also learning from them about ourselves. I think it carries a very beautiful message. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand where K is confusing, how K is superficial, and why it deserves the low ratings and harsh reviews. From my point of view, I saw great characters and witnessed their stories. It's been so long since I can write so much on anime characters. Mikoto and Shiro are so well planned out characters, and I promise you, even if you have already watched K and deemed it not good, give the characters and their roles, even their power, more thoughts. You'll end up finding a lot of interesting surprises. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first found K was going to air in the Fall 2012 anime season, I was immediately curious because at the time practically nothing was known about it. The development team had been astonishingly tight-lipped about the series and few trailers that they had released made the series seem promising. When the first episode aired I was immediately enraptured by the gorgeous visuals, animation, and jazzy and modern soundtrack intertwined with classical nuances. From what I could see, there wasn't much not to like about this show; the universe itself seemed interesting and the diversity of characters was also certainly a draw. As aheterosexual male, I didn't even mind the slight hinting at BL, I mean, I got through No. 6 with few problems so this show couldn't be much worse with Shion and Nezumi #2, right?\\n\\n\r\nI guess the first thing I should cover is what everybody can literally and clearly see, the art and animation. The art and animation of K are stunning. The characters and the city-scape is all look really good and the nuances they add are interesting such as the bending of space when Kuroh uses his \u201chand\u201d ability (I see what you did there GoHands) to launch himself away from the Howling Flame, aka Homura, or the crazy effects of Neko's powers. However, despite how good it may look there are some minor flaws that I noticed. In the first episode- yes the first episode- there was one instance where the bartender character spoke English but his lips weren't synced properly. Seriously, GoHands? You messed up on lip syncing in the first episode. Is a couple fixed frames really too hard? I've watched five different releases of the first episode and they all have the same problem so I'm fairly confident that it's not just me. There are also other times where limbs were stretched and positioned in strange and almost inhuman angles while the battles are going on but those aren't as noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nNext is what you can clearly hear, the music and voice acting. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, K has a jazzy and modern-sounding soundtrack that is intertwined with some classical nuances. Most of the time it has a nice, relaxing feel with a heavy emphasis on piano but there are other times where it picks up slightly, especially in battles. Unfortunately, the music never reaches to the ranks of something epic-sounding, it may sound cool and fitting but it never really got me pumped up for a battle or particular scene. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's bad, I can respect the composer's decision to keep the tone so mellow all the time; it's just a stylistic choice, nothing more. Speaking of stylistic choices, the one thing that K does well with its music is with the absence of it; yes, silence. Well, some may be wondering why that's so important in music and the thing is: a lack of sound is sometimes much more profound in a piece of music than the intricacies in the music itself. Some moments are simply best to leave silent than to have music playing throughout the entire scene, leave the sound effects to do the \u201ctalking\u201d for themselves. And finally, speaking of talking and as with most of the Japanese voice acting, the voice acting in K is top-notch with each seiyuu fitting the role they are put into well; nothing  much to complain about here. I actually found the cleaning robots to be randomly entertaining with their deep voices and samurai-esque sayings.\\n\\n\r\nI guess that's enough of talking about the good stuff for now, on to the bad stuff- namely the characters. Besides the fact that the characters are forgettable, generic, and just good at being present, it seems as if they pulled people from everywhere and just piled them into K. Kuroh and Shiro (I wonder why they're named that? *sarcasm*) look a lot like Nezumi and Shion from No. 6, Yata looks like a typical skater-punk or like Beat from The World Ends With You, Neko is the cat-girl (go figure), and Seri the typical buxom anime blonde, just to name a few. There are a lot of characters in K, for example: literally every single character in Scepter 4 , the blue group, has a name that they call out when they pull out their swords for battle (innuendo). The problem with having such a large cast is that not very many characters receive development and this is one of the points where K suffers the most. There are few relationships that you really get to understand, namely Yata and Fushimi, the Silver King and the Gold King, and Neko and Shiro. These make you go: \u201cOh, okay that's why they're like that. Now what about the other characters?\u201d The problem is there is no real explanation for any other relationships other than Kuroh's relationship with his Master and Suoh Mikoto's relationship with some of his fellow Howling Flame members and they also skim his relationship with the leader of Scepter 4, Munakata Reishi. By far though, Neko is the most dynamic character, almost making up for all the other emotions all the other characters lack. The rest of the characters are flat (in a literal sense), essentially remaining the same for the entire series, Shiro included.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the next thing, the story. With a series such as K, one would expect there to be significant storytelling unlike in a high school comedy series that just involves a bunch of high school students talking about nothing important and doing nothing important. This is another of the points where K fails utterly. There is an absolute lack of any substantial story. Yes, there is plot, however, there is no real story-telling. A plot is an event- a fact. A story is what interweaves these plot points together and gives them meaning so that they are interesting to the audience. \u201cI went to the store\u201d is an example of plot; [i]Beowulf[/i] is an example of a story. The premise was a classic whodunit murder case which, if handled the right way, could have made a decent story. Instead, they decided to gather the viewpoints from the three different sects- blue, red, and black/white- and put them together to attempt to make a coherent story but it all amounted to nothing. The only part where there is a flicker of story is at the end where they tried to connect the dots.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there are no real motivations shown, especially as to why the Reds and Blues are really fighting and why the main bad-guy, who has no name, only a title, did what he did other than making the audience assume that they did it because they felt like it. In that sense, K is the epitome of the opposite of dramatic irony, also known as the unreliable narrator (more specifically a mix of the Clown and the Lair archetypes) wherein the characters themselves often know much more about the universe and situation than the audience does. Any explanation that is directed at the audience is vague and the further questions that are brought up by the answer are ignored completely, forcing the audience to just sit there and accept what's going on without question. Oh, so there are things called Strains, what are they and how do they get their powers? There are giant, floating super-swords called the Swords of Damocles (I appreciate the nod to folklore there) and they grant powers to people. How do they float and give people powers? Where did the Swords of Damocles come from? What are the units that constitute a single increase to the Weismann level? Okay, maybe that last one was a bit much to ask for but nonetheless, none of the above questions were answered in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I ask why people think K is so great they can't come up with anything other than mentioning how beautiful the visuals and animation are or that they like certain characters. For example, I asked one of my friends who thoroughly enjoys K and thinks it's great to explain the story to me in a clean and concise sentence and he cannot give me an acceptable answer. When I tell him things like \u201cYeah, in K, this guy gets stabbed and now he can speak German\u201d he gives me the strangest of looks. K seemed like it was trying to please everybody using beautiful visuals and animation, using well-known seiyuu, adding in a lot of bishounen males for fangirls to fantasize about, fawn over, and argue over their own \u201cone true pair\u201d, putting in two (count them, two) curvaceous women, one a cat-girl who's a barely-clad or naked at all times, with random fanservice for male fans, and adding mystery with intense action- sprinkling in some mediocre comedy while it was at it. In the end, it all became a jumbled mess. Much like a temptress, K lures you in with her beauty and soothing voice and rewards you with fleeting sensations of pleasure for seeking her attention but, in the end, she leaves you hollow and wondering if it was all worth it- wondering what really attracted you to her in the first place. Similarly, the more I watched K, the more I questioned why I was still watching it, other than to just get it out of the way. The more I watched K, the more I came to realize that it's just a bedazzled pile of crap that plays cool music; no matter how great it may look or how good it sounds, a pile of crap will always be a pile of crap. With a sequel already announced and in the making, I can only hope that the second season makes up for all the flaws that plagued the first.\\n\\n\r\n6 out of 10",

            "content": "Starting from the first few minutes of this series I thought I was in for a real treat; Gorgeous art and what seemed to be bad ass characters that could hopefully back up a potentially good plot. It's a shame to say that though it is not by any means a terrible anime, K left me disappointed. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story in my opinion had the potential to be good yet was poorly executed. It starts off with what seems to be a conflict between 2 gangs then switches over to a young, easy going high schooler who turns out to be the actual main character.The first 4 episodes halted plot progression. It pretty much turned from a serious series regarding the conflict between 2 gangs into a slice of life comedy with some eechi thrown in as Shiro, Kuro, and Neko go about their life in a school setting.\\n\\n\r\nThings do start to pick up by the 5th episode but by then almost half of the series is already wasted. What happens next is that the main plot actually speeds up in the second half where random equations are thrown into the plot. The main story quickly starts building up, episode by episode then you get a finale that really doesn't feel like anything special.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of the series. I can't think of any other series from the top of my head that compares to the animation and art style of K.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part it was decent enough. Enjoyed the opening and ending songs. I found that the music used during the episodes seemed a bit repetitive though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nA few characters get development with even flash backs to round them out. However, most are left in the dust. Characters like Anna and the female Lieutenant of the blues are never truly explained or fleshed out. I never really felt any attachment to any of the characters throughout the series which is extremely  rare. I just found it odd that a character who is no longer alive in the present story's timeline got more revealed about them than characters who are actually still alive in the present. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDecent show to kill some time even if it's just to marvel at the art and animation as I found myself doing. I may find myself re-watching a few cool action scenes but that's about it. Hopefully the 2 sequels for this series help flesh out the characters and plot a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall K is a show that had potential to be a lot greater than it actually is. it's a good example that beautiful art is not everything and you need proper character development and better ways to reveal the plot of the story to truly stand out from the other thousands of anime out there.",

            "content": "Project K...what can i say. The creators really let me down on this one. They pulled the classic anime bait-and-switch technique. Where they make the first episode so awesome that you just know this is going to be the best anime ever...and then they switch it with a horrible drawn-out, teasing anime. You keep thinking, \"omg next episode is going to be sick!!!\" but no...it won't. K actually had 2-4(maybe 4) decent episodes, credit mainly give to the artwork and ost. \r\nI think the main reason K was so bad was because of all it had to work with. Near perfect art, mesmerizing ost, greatplot to start with, yet they still somehow found a way to trash it. For one, the main character was the least interesting person on the show. In fact his group was the least interesting group in the show. 2 of the 3 or 4 best episodes we're episodes they were absent in. Second, the fight scenes were a total let down, mainly full of colorful power-ups and unexplained abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads us to the third point: Project K explains 35.678% of the storyline and motives behind nearly all the characters. No one knows how a Kings are chosen, what is the extent of their powers, why certain characters are the way they are, nothing. \\n\\n\r\nSummary: K is like a legendary warrior, wielding a legendary blade, during a legendary war, and somehow he still can't manage to save the day. If you are new to anime, by all means, watch it. But if you're a seasoned anime watcher, and need more than cliches in your life, watch the first episode and walk away. Finish the story in your mind, what ever you think about, i'm sure it will be better than what the creators wrote",

It looked fun, intriguing, and even though there was plenty of fanservice, I felt like I was one of the fan it serviced, and didn't exactly mind. Now, however, I'm at a point where I doubt the story is in any way salvagable. \r\nThe main problems of this anime are the plot and the characters. Personally I feel there is nothing wrong with fanservice as long it isn't the only thing sustaining the anime. But \"K\" just feels really, really empty. The characters feel like premade shells for fanfiction and doujinshi,and again, I *love* fanfiction and doujinshi, but the basis for them needs to be a little more solid than \"K\" is. The story is convoluted and very oddly paced; I am still not entirely sure what the main point of the plot is and why those kings even exist. There are too many things that are unexplained, and unless the storytelling does a complete 360 in the last couple of episodes I can't imagine this will end in a way I'll find satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nLike most people have said, it looks great and has some really good seiyuu, so watching it isn't a complete waste of time. Maybe if you don't expect too much of it it's alright. I'm just disappointed because it had a lot of potential, but wasted pretty much all of it.",

            "content": "It's funny, MAL doesn't have a \"Not Helpful\" button to flag a review. So when I tried to dig in the possible features of such link, it was instantly classified as \"Helpful\" by me, the complete opposite of what I was looking for. Without any way to undo this action I thought I better write this to make clear that no, I don't think why this visually gorgeous, broken down mess of a series is supposed to be \"appealing\". So here I go:\r\nThe story is so unfocused, and the exposition is all over the place because, between wanting to tell the past via flashbacks, ortelling the present via dialogs more boring than watching a peanut go out of its shell, the writers slip through both sides, improving the chance for the viewer to just not care about it. Because it's hard to know what the hell are they trying to tell in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt is incredibly good, no doubt about it, however a personal gripe is the use of stock footage. You will notice an attack position and sequences used more than one time. This is some Sailor Moon level stuff right here. It makes the animation look as corny and worthless that it makes you think, if the people invested so much in the visual details, why didnt they use it to avoid things like that? Or better yet, why not hire actual, competent writers instead of throwing all the money to the dumpster to focus only on looks, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself has its charm, with interesting and atmospheric tunes, so it's the best aspect of this series to me. The OP as well as EDs are pure, generic, run of the mill anisong stuff though, so there's that. Lots of people might like them, I prefer a little more variety in my music, so obviously I don't.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we come to the lowest point in this series: the characters. Seriously, they're as flat as the floor the voice actors seemed to have stepped in. Even the mics the VAs used to record seem to have more personality than those. Either that or they're so annoying you only wished they were dead by the next episode. We have people portrayed by the series with some characteristic trait, yet when these characters get into the action they seem to flop all this buildup by acting as generic and aloof as possible. A complete waste of plot. Another gripe is that, with a cast that big and only 13 episodes, most of the supporting characters end up being only cannon fodder or background filler, which completely defeats the purpose of having a cast of such size. You could take some of them out and wouldn't even make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, and how I always say: Mediocrity never looked so beautiful as here, and adequacy is as flat as it gets. K, in concept, tries too hard to be the next Baccano/Durarara while failing miserably in its execution. A good setting which goes to waste, a story that seems interesting but is told in a piss-poor manner, and characters so worthless that they end up killing any little interest I could have in them. Not exactly the best look for a series which tries to be turned into a full-fledged franchise, and goes out of its way to do so with a huge amount of material. The bottom line is, people don't care enough for this anime to blow up, and given its flaws, maybe it's for the better.",

            "content": "After reading some of the reviews on this anime, I decided to throw out my two cents, that being that it's being judged a bit too harshly for trying to be eye-catching and whatnot, but when you look into the anime a bit more, you'll find that there is no previous source for it, i.e. a light novel or manga. With that, it's already at a disadvantage to other popular animes like To Aru, who have a significant fanbase already started, so the success of it can't be as accurately gauged pre-airing. While the story shown so far is nothing to gawk at, it doeshave a ton of potential to be interesting. There are interesting characters, well-placed Soundtracks, and great animation. So, as far as I can tell, the minimal story progression can be explained by the need to establish a following and make sure that continuing through with this anime wouldn't be hazardous in a business sense. While I, like many others, would like to see more of the story with this in the first season, I don't think it's enough to qualify this as a sub-par anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think watching this anime would be well worth your time if you can wait for further plot development in a potential (and in my opinion, likely) sequel.",

            "content": "\"K\" or \"K-Project\" is a 2012 action anime which follows the events of...well, to be truthful it's pretty difficult to really explain a basic synopsis, and that's only one of the problems with the show. First off though i'll talk about some of the good things. Now don't get me wrong, K is not a bad show...it has potential, it just fails to execute its story properly and falls pretty flat. However, the animation itself is incredible. The directing is very good as well, the show uses nice shots and angles, and the view point sometimes has a green or blue hue to the shot,so it gives the show a unique look. The  aesthetic of the semi futuristic Japan is very nice, and everything from buildings to alleyways have great detail and design. The character designs for the most part are pretty good as well. The show also features a fantastic soundtrack, while i'm not too crazy for the Intro and outro, the score fits the tone of the show very well and all the songs are beautiful. Sadly though that's all the praise I can give K. The show starts off and three episodes in neither me or my friend (who dropped the show after 5 episodes) knew what was going on. Nothing is explained to you or implied anywhere so you're sitting there watching all this random shit happen without an understanding of the world they're in or what they're doing. Thankfully things become clear later on, however there are still some things that left me confused. If it weren't for the last two or three episodes I would have given the show a 4/10. Out of a large ensemble of characters there are maybe five max that are likeable, and I only started caring for the protagonist on the second to last episode which says something. Throughout the show you don't know what's going on so you can't appreciate any of the fights or the character interaction. And sometimes the show was just flat out boring, aside from episode 6 the middle episodes felt very slow and uneventful. Though the show is very flawed it still has potential. Somewhat likeable characters and an interesting premise with some good episodes near the end of the run I won't rule out watching season 2. However if you're looking for something GOOD to watch you can go elsewhere.",

            "content": "When I, by accident, found out about a series called 'K', I was intrigued by the name right away. After all, how much series are there that have a name of one letter long?\r\nAfter watching the first episode, I was hooked.\r\n==SETTING(spoiler-free)==\r\n'K' takes place in some metropolitan city in the near future: There are a lots of gadgets and interactive smartphones with three-dimensional interfaces. But this is only the backdrop for a story about multiple rivaling groups of supernatural people that fight eachother.\r\nIsana Yashiro, a guy with white-ish hair and the ability to act strange but always find a way out of tough situations, is themain character. A video is found where a person that looks like him killed one of the people from the Red Clan. This is the reason that he is suddently targeted by a lot of people, without him actually knowing what's going on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor now, I won't give them all the points. It's not entirely clear yet in what direction the plot will take us, and this might change my score later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n==ART==\\n\r\nBeautiful. The way the characters are shaded reminds me a little of Durarara, but the art is much more gorgeous than that anime. Shingo Suzuki, who directs K, is also the man who made all the character designs. This can be seen, as the characters seem to blend in the story perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe environment is also drawn beautifully. I love the way they've handled the reflection of the sunlight, for instance. The same goes for the battlesc\u00e9nes. The special effects and CG blend in in the environment so well that it all forms one combined story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n==CHARACTERS==\\n\r\nThe characters seem to be extremely diverse. This is both reflected in their designs as well as in the way they act. I am really eager to learn their respective stories.\\n\\n\r\nOf course it's too early to talk about things like Character Development, but one thing is for sure: They do have characters in here which act differently from any known metatype I know of.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, again, it's too soon to make a final judgement, I give the characters:\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n==SOUND==\\n\r\nThis is marvelous. Both the intro and the outro themes sound great, and are of the rare kind of OP/ED that I don't skip. The actual background music is so well made that you will not notice it being there until you actually listen for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound effects, all there is to say is that I have yet to hear something that sounds unnatural.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n==ENJOYMENT==\\n\r\nThis is a great series to watch. It's not as dark as similar series like \"Darker than Black\"(quite literally), which might be a good point as it might be suitable for a bigger audience. I love the colorful cast and the all the schemes that many characters try to perform. \\n\\n\r\nThis simply is my kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n==OVERALL==\\n\r\nI love this anime so far. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes psychologic anime or supernatural/superhero series, as well as anyone in general, for I believe this to be an anime that many people will enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n\r\nfor now. Might be changed when there are more episodes out.\\n\\n",

            "content": "While some found the first episode of K to be the \"best\" and gave them false expectations for the anime, I thought it was the most confusing for me and I didn't have huge expectations after seeing it. However, I feel that overall the anime wasn't too bad after I reached the later episodes, and I did enjoy it.\r\nI became very skeptical towards the story after watching the first 3 episodes, and I almost dropped it after thinking that the plot was no good. I felt that some scenes were too ridiculous and lacked logic. Why would the newly introduced character who wanted to killthe lead suddenly sit down to have dinner with him due to being tired? It made no sense to me. I think the creators wanted to create a happy atmosphere to contrast with the later episodes and changes the characters were going to face, but it was executed in a way that felt a little awkward. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, at around episode 6 things started to become more interesting as the real plot finally started to unfold, and from then on the story was rather decent. I feel that a fatal flaw for K was the first few episodes that felt like empty filler. They caused many people to become confused as well as skeptical for the rest of the season. If that flaw in K was fixed and unnecessary scenes and complications to the plot were cut out, this would have been a pretty good anime with a plot that suited 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending to me made sense, and has been foreshadowed since the beginning. The ending wrapped everything up and I felt it was well done in terms of what SHOULD have happened due to the foreshadowing, did.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization was lacking as the cast was rather large but not enough was shown about each of them, only snippets here and there. The main character Isana felt more endearing to me than the rest of them as he got the most screen time. I felt some characters had a lot of potential to become very memorable, but they were not developed enough. For example, Misaki has been a favorite among fans and I can definitely see why. However, they did not show enough about his personality aside from being a tough skater with a soft interior. Well, what else? Nothing much deeper about him was presented, and why he adored Mikoto so much aside from being the leader. The cast of characters each have interesting personalities though, I just always felt like I wanted them to take it to a deeper level for some of the main characters such as Mikoto.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite nice, the characters all had rather delicate features and the music to me was very good. The opening track in episode 1 as the screen went across the city and Homra was simply awesome and classy. Animation was a little choppy at times, but the lighting and the blinking animations were beautiful to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw in this anime would be the way the story was presented. The very core and story that K was trying to show wasn't bad, but the presentation definitely needed trimming. The first few episodes were too messy, but the second half was much better. Overall, a decent anime.  Nothing revolutionary but still entertained me enough to keep watching.",

            "content": "For anyone who read my previous anime review, I apologize. It was my doing for writing such an unprofessional and misleading review on such a great anime such as K. Let\u2019s start over and hopefully this one will be much better. \uf04a\r\nOkay, I must admit that I came into \u201cK\u201d with low expectations. It hadn\u2019t gotten noticeably good ratings before and wasn\u2019t very popular when it came out because of all the fuss over other premiering anime shows at that same time such as \u201cMagi\u201d and \u201cBakuman\u201d which received excellent reviews and recognition; therefore it was hard for \u201cK\u201d to stand out from their shadows.Also, my sister (17 YO) had previously watched the anime not a few months ago, telling me that it wasn\u2019t worth watching. I decided to challenge this statement and witness the anime for myself, for I saw it on my recommendations list b/c of its reported similarity to one of my personal favorites, \u201cDurarara,\u201d and read the plot summary for myself that was provided by . Surprisingly enough, I decided to add it to my \u201cPlan to Watch\u201d List, coming back to it not a few days ago.\\n\\n\r\n I decided to watch the first episode. It didn\u2019t have a very strong start, which may also contribute to its lack of popularity and good reviews, but I didn\u2019t let that phase me and continued to watch the show. I realized after about 5 episodes in, the show captivated me and I couldn\u2019t stop watching it. Even after the weakness and confusing nature of the first few episodes, it soon proved to have great development, both in character and plot. Eventually, when I reached the end, I witnessed one of the greatest finales, in my opinion, in anime history. Please sit and read quietly while I explain this well-deserved 10 that this anime happened to receive. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this anime is a focus on many different viewpoints of different anime characters that somehow creatively make up one giant, amazing, unexpected puzzle that is finished at the very end of this anime. The main protagonist is a seemingly normal high school boy named Isana Yashiro, or \u201cShiro\u201d that somehow gets involved with a murder case that took place on the rooftop of a bar. The murder victim unfortunately was one of a psychic clan known as \u201cHOMRA\u201d led by the violent short-fused red king, Suoh Mikoto. Unfortunately for him, the killer (who was captured on video) looks a lot like Shiro even though he doesn\u2019t remember doing such a thing. With the help of his \u201cguardian\u201d Yatogami Kuroh, and \u201cNeko\u201d (I have yet to find her significance to the story), they try to get to the bottom of this framing without starting a psychic war between the seven kings. A well thought out plot, yes? There are indeed a lot of elements to the plot, and that\u2019s why the beginning seemed so confusing and weak at first. And Indeed, the anime is very similar to DRRR. Some of the characters look similar to those in DRRR, also, the colored clan idea is a very similar, personalized element to the use of Color gangs in DRRR. Also, I find that both protagonists have very unusual and unexpected secrets that are revealed later on, which I won\u2019t give away. The fact that all of the elements are summed up perfectly and fit together like a puzzle really adds to the plot. On many occasions, I experienced an \u201cOh my Gosh, That makes sense!\u201d Moment in my head. I loved that. There were just certain occasions, especially at the beginning, when it seemed like all of the detail and elements ended up confusing and overwhelming me, leading to discomfort in some plot areas. Also, many good points were also brought up with the fact that there are noticeable holes in the plot and a lot of excess information was left out. I noticed this of course. On many occasions I would've like to learn a little more about the Silver, Blue and Red Kings; I would've also desired a little more history behind the Sources of their power, the 7 Swords of Damocles. This was obviously an issue mainly because of the span of the anime. If it lasted for 26 episodes instead of 13, I believe that K would earn 10 points in Story. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, instead the story gets a 7\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis seems very opinioned, I\u2019m sorry. But I love color. I love the idea behind color and their hidden meanings and themes. I believe that all of the colors incorporated in the plot and art style really added to the deeper meaning beneath the surface. Red marked the \u201cViolent\u201d clan. Blue marked the \u201cReasonable and Cool\u201d Clan, and Gold and Silver marked the \u201cTop Dog Clans\u201d that were most powerful. These colors that were incorporated in the characters and hidden themes really added to the complex tones of all the elements in the story. The complexity and character of each little color, from personality, to mood, to comparison, (such as black and white) had a great impact. Also, I found the fight scenes, especially with use of the mix of psychic abilities, quite pretty and well designed. There was great movement and perfect camera angles in the action scenes of the anime and that was a really great aspect of the anime that just boosted the whole watching experience. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nwhen dealing with sound of an anime, people just look at the anime openings and endings; and while in K, both were very nice, the real highlights in sound for the anime were definitely the Character Themes and transitional OST tracks. All of the themes for each character fit them so well that it\u2019s uncanny. You can listen to a theme song and have the ability to guess which character it fits they are made so well. Also, the OST tracks, you can tell that a lot of work went into making them just right for each scene. There are songs, such as my favorite, \u201cRequiem of Red\u201d that add so much emotion to the perfect scene to an already awesome ending. One of the best. Sound also refers to the voice acting, and I must say, I watched subbed and the casting was amazing. My favorite voice of course was the slurred heavy voice of Mikoto Suoh, played by Tsura Kenjirou. It wasn\u2019t just him though, the other voice actors fit so well, whether their virtue was innocence, or pride, or cockiness. Everything worked. \uf04a\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nIf there was to be a main flaw with this anime, it would have to be with the characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I fell in love with almost every single character in the anime, even with the ones I was supposed to hate, haha. It just seemed like every single character had their own personal piece of the puzzle and specific role to play, if it was to add to the pride theme of the anime, or to the comic relief, or to the innocence theme, all of the characters had a role that fit the plot perfectly. I just felt that there were some superfluous characters that I had trouble trying to find their main role, such as Neko. She is cat and has psychic abilities, yes; and she DOES help Shiro and Kuroh on many occasions, but I feel that her role was mainly fanservice and gaining views and that just took away from the anime itself. There are many other characters that I feel this confliction with as well even though many of the characters\u2019 designs and personalities really clicked with me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you find me, and ask me what my favorite anime I\u2019ve ever watched is, I would most definitely say \u201cK.\u201d And this is why: There are so many elements and themes that really captivate you as you continue to journey through this anime. From characters to plot, to sound, I guarantee you will enjoy this anime. If you dropped it after a few episodes, Pick it up and watch it again, because you will be missing out on a lot. Everything fit together in this show and I loved how it all worked out in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest you watch this, and I guarantee that you will enjoy it. Unfortunately this anime hasn\u2019t gotten the publicity it deserves and that\u2019s because people aren\u2019t expecting it to be great. That\u2019s how I was. But if you take the time to watch around 6-7 episodes, I guarantee you won\u2019t regret it. You\u2019re missing way too much if you skip out on this anime. Give it a chance. There are some plot holes that take away from the anime, but overall I liked it and of you average all of my scores, they come out as a 9, even though I would've loved to give it a 10 :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "K, also known as, The K-Project, is a show produced by a no name studio that goes by the name GoHands. They have produced nothing but mediocrities prior to this show, which I wouldn't consider to be a god-scend, but far from \"Shit\" or \"below average\"\r\nArt & Animation - 9/10\r\nI honestly don't even think I need to explain this one. The show looks gorgeous, easily the best looking show that I've ever seen (YES, I HAVE SEEN THE FATE SERIES). The colors are very outlandish, the animation is very fluid, and the shots, OH MY GOD THE SHOTS!\r\nSadly past episode 4, I can't recall 1single perspective shot. But the perspective shots through the first part of the series were really cool, and helped to immerse me into the world. Don't really have to explain anything here. Even the CGI vehicles looked fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy lord this show sounds phenomenal. With the exception of a few voice actors, the dub is absolutely fantastic. Characters have strong emotion, and while some lines sound cheesy, nothing sounds out of place. The OST is fantastic. Only once can I recall the OST not fitting the mood of the show, and that was during the second episode's fight scene between Kuro and Yata. The soundtrack is a mixture of techno, pop, rap, and ambience, all which sound very unique, and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to split the story section up into two parts, because this show is exactly like Shingeki no Bahamut in terms of how the downhill slide occurs.\\n\\n\r\nPart 1 (Episodes 1 - 7)\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very fun. Fight scenes are very sparse, and the show is just...FUN XD The show starts with our main hero, Yashiro Isana, being supposedly framed for the murder of one of a rival gang, the Red Clan (AKA. HOMRA). While being pursued by them, Yashiro is also threatened to be killed by a man who goes by the name of Kuro, the Black Dog. Eventually, Kuro finds his chill, and remembers that he is to judge Yashiro, as he is to be the next leader of the colorless clan. (Sounds like Durarara, huh?:lol:).\\n\\n\r\nThe first 4 episodes are just action, a little bit of world building, and dumb fun. Yashiro is trying to solve the mystery while living with his cat who has now transformed into a human, and Kuro. These episodes are the highlight of the show, as it never takes itself seriously. It's just action with very entertaining character interactions. These first 4 episodes also throw out alot of mysteries, that are explained in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2 (Episode 8-13)\\n\\n\r\nJust like Bahamut, the second half of K takes itself waaaay too seriously, and ends up becoming very confusing and incomprehensible. Tons of science dialogue and info-dumping is thrown out, which makes scenes very hard to understand. I actually had to go to a wiki at the end of the series due to being so baffled. I understood the gist of stuff, but not the explanations.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is very controversial, but because I started this show on 5.10.15 and ended it on 5.17.15, the movie is available to me, and soon the second season will be available for me as well, starting in October in 2015. The movie picks off from where the show ends, leaving me nothing to complain about at this time. However, this does not excuse the execution of the ending. A death was very anticlimactic is what I'll say. As soon as the character walks in, they're killed 3 seconds later. But to put it simply, the show dives heavily into a type of plot which revolves around the relationships of many characters, but sadly none of those characters can be fully expanded on due to time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I would like to talk about is the structure. Just like Baccano, K will often bring up questions, and then connect everything else later. It also has a story which is told from 3 main perspectives. There's the Red Clan, the Blue Clan aka. the police (of sorts, kek), and Yashiro and crew. The show does a great job of bringing things together, but never fully explores things that it tries to connect. The pacing also feels rushed trough flashbacks, once again, due to the lack of episodes, which is probably the biggest flaw concerning the issue.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think Studio GoHands thought that K-Project would be successful, so instead of throwing out a fleshed out show, what we got was a ton of good ideas, that never get fully explored, or dived into. The story isn't too bad overall, but it becomes too serious for its own good, and as a result, goes from an above average, fun show, to a messy, below average battle shounen of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in K all have a great sense of personality. There's the hot-headed Yata, who is very likeable for his sheer loyalty to the Red Clan's leader, Mikoto. The kings just seem so bad-ass, and the main cast of characters are very likeable. HOWEVER, no character develops, and by no, I mean not even 1. Sure these characters are easy to care for, but without any development due to their actions, the actions seem useless. I'd have to say the best character in the show was by far Mikoto, however he was never really explored. He seems to have had a dark past, but that's never explained of course, DUE TO STUPID EPISODE CONSTRAINTS! JESUS, WHY COULDN'T THIS BE 25 EPISODES!? XD\\n\\n\r\nAhem, back to Mikoto, yeah...right...\\n\\n\r\nMikoto is the only character that seems to have a motivation. He and the blue king, Reishi Munakata. It is often stated that the two have had been friends previously, but as I've said time and time again in this review, the relationships was never explained. More great potential, wasted. Just like Izaya and Shizuo from Durarara!!, these 2 characters really made the show special; but unlike Durarara!! which gave us a backstory on its rivalry, The K-Project leaves the characters' backstory a mystery. Hopefully, this is all explained in season 2, however it won't be anywhere near as relevant or as impactful as it would be in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall fun characters, but they have no depth, motivations, or development...of course beyond Mikoto and Reishi.\\n\\n\r\nValue - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a ton of people say that no one will remember this series; but the animation alone is very much enough to make this series remembered for years to come. However, in terms of rewatch value, this show has little to none. There isn't a ton of fighting despite the amazing budget given to the show, meaning that you can't just go back and watch the series for the fights without lounging through the exposition once again. If you're able to do that however, props to you, but I personally don't plan on rewatching this series anytime soon. Rather, I'll just search up the fights on YouTube.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show...until it began to expose its own flaws to a far greater degree than I would've ever imagined that it would. Even then however, I still enjoyed the show, enough that I would recommend it to anyone, just because of how bad-ass everything was :smile:\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 6.33/10\\n\\n\r\nK is a very fun and entertaining show, the struggles once it gets to episode 8, as you realize that they wasted too much time on attempting to connect you to the characters, rather than actually delving into their stories. The presentation is the best that I've seen in anime, period. The characters are very fun and bad-ass, but overall lack depth or development.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend K to anyone looking for an action series, or people that are looking forward to something good in the fall, as this is receiving a second season then. I hope you found this review helpful",

            "content": "K is a pretty decent anime series. It has a lot going for it, but it really falls short in a lot of areas as well. It is an easy watch, and it's never boring, but it could have been a lot better. Overall it is worth watching, and I recommend it to fans of superpower anime series.\r\nI'll start with art and animation. The artwork is very well done in K. In fact, the art was a high point. It's too bad the animation wasn't consistently good as well. There were scenes that were animated brilliantly, but they only made it even more clear whenthey cut corners in other scenes. The cheap and rushed animation that littered this series is one of it's lowest points in my opinion. Art and animation are really a double edged sword in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWith a spotty visual delivery, K also has a spotty audio presentation as well. The voice acting was at times very monotonous and droning, and then there were other times that it was emotional and engaging. The monotonous voice acting was poorly complimented with music that was just as inconsistent. There were scores that worked very well, and then there were other times that the music was almost laughable. A few times I expected a late night soft porn to start but it would only be a scene where they entered a building. It definitely affected the \"enjoyment\" factor of this story. Thankfully, it has some memorable music at times, so this wasn't a super low point for the series.\\n\\n\r\nI would have to say that even most of the characters were mediocre as well. There were a couple that were fairly charismatic, and that helped a lot. I think there should have been better focus in the storytelling on some of the more charismatic characters. I don't think they spent enough time on the good personalities, but they did spend some time with acceptable development over all.\\n\\n\r\nI saved the story for last because it is the high point of this anime series. The story was interesting enough to keep my attention all the way through. There is a major twist towards the end, and there is also a cliffhanger of an ending. It's not a bad cliffhanger, but they have announced a sequel, so hopefully they do something interesting with that as well. The story leaves you guessing, but it does leave a lot of questions that should have been answered along the way. Honestly I think the story was simply acceptable until about episode 6 or 7. After that it was really well done. I would say that it's even better when you know the twist and watch it a second time. The slower moments would be more exciting with the extra knowledge. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I didn't love this series, but I did like it. It's worth watching, and it has a lot of potential. It's short at 13 episodes, and there is still more to come. I would say it's a solid 7 in my book",

            "content": "**WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS**\r\nOkay, so before you read on I must tell you that this is my first review, so if it seems unprofessional or is full of spelling errors, that is the reason.\r\nI have seen many different opinions for \"K\" ranging from very bad or almost unwatchable, to very good or a must-see. I myself have very much enjoyed \"K\" so far but more for the animation and sound than anything else.\r\nAnimation and Sound - The animation in \"K\" is rather unique amongst anime, with its high contrast colours, beautiful backdrops and great fight scenes. This may be because I haven't seenmany different anime types, but I have not seen an animation style at all similar to that within \"K\". This, combined with the music played throughout, give the clear message that this anime is not set in modern times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters within \"K\" are its main downfall, with each character being rather stereotypical anime character types - the unfortunate main character with a secret or unknown past (Isana Yashiro), the main ally of the protagonist who dislikes him at first (Kuroh), the useless, unintelligent but attractive female ally picked up later in the story (Neko), the main antagonist who seems ruthless and acts almost without emotion (Mikoto Suoh), ect. All stereotypes without a single original character amongst them and barely any character development. There is also the problem of having too many characters and not enough episodes to properly introduce them and explore their pasts. Remember, I'm not saying the characters are unlikable, but just stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nStory - The story of \"K\" is also rather disappointing, with attempted plot twists that you could see coming from a mile away, character decisions that either make no sense or are unexplained, and an all-round very rushed feel to it. If there were more episodes to the series, say 24 instead of 13, I'm sure that the story would be better and less confusing, but its lack of original ideas would still be a huge letdown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rather enjoyed \"K\" despite its bad storyline and mediocre characters, as the animation and sound are almost enough to provide the enjoyment that isn't provided by the former. This is an anime that isn't for everybody, but there's always the chance that you might enjoy it so go ahead and give it a watch. You never know.",

            "content": "So I understand not liking it but some of these reviews make it sound worse than it is. \r\nLet's start with what it did well. It is rather pretty and frankly, the world is fun and interesting. I would love to see more of the world because there are definitely some other things that can be done. It was really good and for that alone, I fun watching it. \r\nThe story was a bit much especially towards the end (not the actual ending that was a great way to end it though, it was just the last few parts). It kept doing twists and theyweren't all that bad but again after a certain point, the twists went from interesting reveals that furthered the mystery to reveals that were there just to rush the story ahead when it didn't earn it. The reveals they showed towards the end while not necessarily bad were definitely premature. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fine but nothing amazing. Some say they were all the same (loner silent badasses) and while I understand that criticism I think there are enough different types of characters that it isn't fair to say that. It is mostly the kings who are like that and that is sort of commented on and makes sense for what they are going with. Now what can't be forgiven is that they don't develop at all. I can't think of an example of a character being developed and some really needed to be developed further to make the characters better. They should have fleshed them out more at the very least. They have really interesting characters with good concepts but for them to work in the story and to make the good concepts into good characters we need them to be fleshed out and they weren't which was disappointing \\n\\n\r\nI think someone said it best that this is a 24 episode series that got 13 episodes. The plot needed more time and so did the characters. Plus the world was interesting enough and a lot of it was left hinted at and unexplored that it would have been entertaining. It had a lot of potential and it developed that potential further but it just never paid off.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I had fun watching it and if you are interested in this and you want something fun with some good potential to watch then this is for you. If you're in the mood for something serious and better developed then stay away. \\n\\n",

            "content": "At a glance, K would appear to be a light-hearted super-power action series. However, that is the main flaw of the 1st season. K's 1st season is very much focused on the mystery of ''Who is the main character?'', but the opening episodes failed to set the tone for the main plot, instead moving the story around in circles. While clues were given for the mystery, the failure to set the tone would make the viewer NOT look for said clues, and instead focus on the pretty animation. It is a pity, too. The mystery itself is rather good, and makes sense. To fully enjoythe story of K, one must be patient as the story only becomes clear after half of the season. If you are not the patient type, this anime is definitely not for you. \\n\\n\r\nAs the focus was not on the setting, there was also the unsatisfactory feeling left by the rather poor explanation of the setting. Why is the white haired girl so different? Why do these people has powers? Why is Neko such a strange existence? How does the King gives the powers? Many questions were not explained, and from the series' point of view, it might not be hard to see why. This is a series that instead forces its viewers to infer from what is shown, and to actively seek out the other mediums that are about to be released. As a standalone 13 episode, the setting doesn't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe many colour factions also means that K has a huge cast of characters. While characters were given distinct personalities, the 13 episode length also meant that there wasn't enough time to develop any of them. This is especially true for the Red and Blue factions. Merely a glimpse of their relationship were shown. Clear evidence that the 1st season of K is just a jump start to other mediums. The manga and light novels cover the story for the Red and Blue factions. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, while the story itself is rather flawed in the way it was presented, the anime has its redeeming points. The animation of K looks good. Although i do not particularly like the choice of using an overly shiny colour palette. EVERYTHING on screen literally shines. Even the CGs that are present are made even more obvious because of the shine. This is ,however, just personal preference. To some the shiny colour palette may instead serve to make it look prettier.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are to watch K, be mindful that K is more than just a 13 episode anime. It is a series that requires you to read the manga and light novels if you want\\n\r\nto know more. Considering that there are still colour factions not shown AND a second season, it is probably safe to say that K will try to expand its universe and far as possible. Otherwise, K's 1st season as a standalone would just be eye-candy, with a mystery that doesn't hit until clearer signs were shown.",

But its so weird that my curiosity got the better of me and I watched the next episode. Then, I realized that it's weird in a good sense. It makes us want to watch more, and every episode reveals a bit more about the main plot. Overall, it's really interesting and if you get past the  first 10 minutes, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy it. :D",

            "content": "K PROJECT:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nNot too ambitious to be train wreck, but still ends up being mediocrity material with insane visuals and music. Does anyone noticed the singer said Hentai? It looks like a fail, but not the Titanic collapsing in the iceberg.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nGeneric main who only stands out because of he's natural white hair, suddenly get majority involved in a massive clan war against the Red Team, and The Blue Team because of some misunderstood revenge scheme which ends up being rather dum at the end... He also lives in some semi-sci-fi setting where magic and weird supernatural stuff apparently exist for no narrative reason.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nFirst of, the worldbuilding was utter shait in this show, we have resemblances of how these clans people who hold such mysterious powers, who can apparently? Make red fire? Or apparently having bursting energy from Your fists means Your attacks are stronger? Seriously, does anyone notice how vague the supernatural aspect of this show was? It could've been a decent handicap to just explain these mysterious looking powers covered by LSD visuals. Heck! They never even shown the green clan as if I don\u2019t care, and no one cares.\\n\\n\r\nAll what I remember from the whole mystery aspect of the show since I didn\u2019t even noticed when I read reviews for this, is that it always seemed so silly and stupid like how they keep Neko, the show whore, a complete mystery until we see on what seems to be a lazy written moment near the climax as an excuse for us to care for a badly written fan service character, or the \u201cEpic\u201d reveal of the villain looking like wolf sperm that rams into Your mouth not your arse *laughs* Overall, having the \u201cmystery\u201d slapped onto Wikipedia makes me feel as if the show was less of a mystery and more of a lame story with silly aspects thrown in that clearly need tweaking.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, there does seem to be a lack of tension in this show, because the characters truly feel like a bunch of simplistic Archetypes, they feel overall stale and don't develop at all in the duration of the show. It always seemed that all what they ever wanted was just to do there vengeance work and be done with it. The support cast who don't really take a larger role in this project are also pretty bland, like how the protagonists love interest was never given any depth or explanation and it all feels like she's a plot device character that the show kind of teases that there's a relationship going on here. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service is surprisingly quite taint in this one, rather its just some cat lady showing her big jugs off, and how she never wore any clothes yet they still covered the nipples, but whatever. The cast is forgettable anyway like the quiet girl, the angry guy- wait, in fact, most of the damn side cast are barely explored at all for You to even grasp the personality properly, like this supporting unit from the red clan just helping out as if he was just helping out or the big boobed secretary from the blue team who is just serious and has a crush on the leader. Overall, I was mostly appealed from their designs and the effort from each man hour for them to make up all of this fine art.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also seems to create tension like how it tries to attempt to have one large over arching mystery that tries to make itslef look epic, but it all just felt like an excuse for a mystery aspect rather than making it legit. There were also episodes that were nothing but pure filler, and made itself look like a waste of time. Addressing the whole \u201cGerman\u201d aspect of the show, it does make it look flashier and more unique on paper, but it always seemed like another excuse for the writers to add some quirky detail that barely adds up to anything. Heck, they even called one of the plot device characters Adolf, as if it was a rule of cool.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters suck, story was badly handled and everyone just seemed to be a lame stoner. What else is there to say? All what I remember for the narrative was sperm wolfy here, and a few character quirks.\\n\\n\r\nConsequently, do I even remember anything else that redeemed good except for druggie visuals and music? The show has potential to be a decent mystery show with supernatural aspects, but it always seemed to me that mystery shows always seemed difficult to pull off, and by the way, what\u2019s with the title guys? K? What You mean K meaning kittens? I don't really get the title here, and it just seemed there as a quirky marketing tool than anything particular.\\n\\n\r\nOBVIOUS FACT that the Animation does remind me of NGNL, with all the LSD visual jazz, but does it ever further emphasise the tone and atmosphere of the show? No. It felt like they simply chucked it in there for everyone to awe at. But its still damn great, and I really like the bonus points given for this mediocrity for having a lack of CGI fight scenes and just emphasise more of it on the backgrounds. Everything has such a fine gloss and shine to it, You see the effort and style GoHands put their man efforts into, and the character designs all feel well designed and thought out, sure I see lazy ones, yet most of the designs always had some fine charm added to them. Sure, it makes them far from ordinary people, but its damn high quality, so how would I care too much about that? The action scenes also have some pretty damn great choreography, though I admit that the Clan War episode does seem cheap by just using images, but I can imagine such a budget if they had to animate so many damn bodies.\\n\\n\r\nSound still retains a fine use of all the mainstream instruments with company just flinging money at. The opening is one of my favourites, and it gets me really hyped to watch such a bad show, with those really beautiful visuals the choreography and even the visual effects! As someone who watched the dub, it wasn\u2019t anything epic, it just felt like another Funimation dub so its just good. Except for that, there\u2019s really not a great deal to say about visuals and music since all what I can say is for You to just look at some pretty visuals...\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nWhat else is there to say? Seriously. The reason why this is a mediocrity was because of the visuals and music. Its a show that You just really need to shut that mind down, and just live in LSD... This show does seem be quite underrated to a certain extent, so its not going to be something that will really leave an impact.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 For useless cast.\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 Strangely forgettable and bad story.\\n\r\n8/10 \u2013 LSD visuals are amazing. PERIOD.\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 All of Your mainstream music with a damn good budget. (0.5 added for the OP)\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 I prefer narrative over visuals to enjoy fiction...\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 5/10 (seems obvious enough...)",

            "content": "To start off, I must first say that I personally believe that K-Project is a lovely anime, although there is no doubt in my mind that it is underdeveloped. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story in K-Project revolves around Yashiro Isana (Shiro) who appears to be a regular student in High School, and is accused of being a murderer. This drags him into the mess that is a war between clans; the story focuses on the Blue and Red clans, and these are two that most directly affect Shiro's story. The story overall is probably the most underdeveloped part of the anime, in my opinion. The viewer discoversa bit about the history of the creation of the Seven Kings (and therefore by association, their clans), we are never truly given a deeper view into the world that K-Project takes place in. There is much general information that isn't provided, and while it adds to the mystery, it also can be irritating. However, while the plot seems reasonably mediocre at first, the end does contain a number of plot twists and new ideas that I think puts K-Project at a 6 rather than a 5 in rating for story. Overall, I have to say that while the idea that this anime is built upon really is quite unique and has it's own twists and turn, many aspects that contribute to the story of K-Project are briefly touched upon and do not pull the viewer into the story's world, simply because the viewer is quite clueless most of time. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe Art in K-Project is simply fabulous. The detail, colors and style is probably one of the key things that set K-project apart from most other animes. The backgrounds are in full detail and color. Even people in crowds in the backgrounds have developed looks - There are no \"grey shadows\" in this anime. Also, light plays a large part in K-project; the glow of the clan members as they fight, the natural sunlight, and the screens of monitors are all done in a very unique way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI watched K-project in the English Dubbed version, so I cannot speak for those who watch it in Japanese. I think the voice actors did a lovely job. The voices suit the characters, and they match up with the animation. The music/soundtrack choice is well chosen. The music really sets the tone and mood for each scene, and really enhanced the whole experience. I think the music and art styles worked very well together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe relationships between characters is also something that can be viewed as much underdeveloped. We see character interaction that leads to very complex relationships, but none of that complexity is expanded upon aside from reaffirming the same surface idea over and over. The individual Characters, however, are very well done in my opinion. No character is one-sided. The characters' personalities and traits contribute much to the anime as a whole, and while we don't see much Character development of those other than Yashiro, their scenes/stories cannot be described as flat and boring. This is a time when the cluelessness of the viewer works to the anime's benefit - Although we don't see character growth in many of the cast, we are still learning about them as a person throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed watching K-Project. There is no doubt about it. I even recommended it to a couple of my friends as well. I loved many of the Characters and the way they were presented. I wish we, the viewers, could have gotten more about the character's relationships with one another and the overall history of the K-project world. However, I liked pretty much everything that was already presented - I just wish there was more! The plot was a little bland, as I tend to gravitate towards anime where the plot twists never end, but I think it was an original idea (or at least, an original take on an idea) and one that seemed quite promising.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI couldn't get enough of the art and music - I personally think they are the most spectacular parts of the anime and have really pushed the limits. The plot is a little dull, although the ending episodes have enough twists in it that I can call K-project \"underdeveloped\", rather than \"simple and dull\" as I would otherwise. In hindsight, I view K-project as more of a prequel type anime, although it wasn't intended to be one. I have, and would recommend this anime to others. It's absolutely lovely, but don't expect to detailed plots with lots of plot twists throughout.\\n\\n",

It didn't really seem like anyone really cared about Homura or Scepter 4 besides the people already belonging to or related to those groups. The who concept of colors and kings also seemed to be passed over. Is it public knowledge cause it didn't really seem like it? But if that's not the case then how can people find kings and become clansmen? And why would they really want to? The characterdesigns are awesome but the characters are kind of flat. It's as if they all were just hanging around until recent events sent them all into motion. The art really is gorgeous though. But man, the plot lets you down. Not in the beginning though. The plot keeps you engaged but at the same kind of like \"Uhh, what?\". Then it's just reveal, reveal, reveal.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's worth watching because I enjoyed watching it enough to watch to the end but the end was not really satisfying. Would I watch it again? Yeah. Would I recommend it? Probably not.",

            "content": "I was so hyper when I first found out about K. I found some gifs on tumblr and then automatically proceeded to youtube to check the trailers and google to find out as much as possible. I was expecting a boom. And oh boy, it was a boom.\nI will say that I am a definite supporter and fan of K. I know that there have been mixed opinions on it, and I understand everyone's point of view, but I'm here to deliver my own impression.\nStory: 9/10\nAt first (and during the most of the series duration) we DON'T REALLY KNOW what the plot is. We jsuthave a bunch of cool characters running around, trying to catch Shiro who supposedly killed a member of Homra (the Red's) and that's about it. As the story progresses, we see how the groups are connected, how they work, who are the Kings and why are they essential and we see how it deepens. I must admit though, the fact that the master plot was revealed in the last 2 or 3 episodes did make me wanna break my screen at some point. Somewhere around ep 7, you still have no idea what's going on and you start to wonder if there is an actual plot or are they just thinking on their feet. But until the end it delivers, and it delivers very nicely. It was the boom that I was expecting, but in a different way. The story itself is interesting, if you can bare with the plot-holes (it's how it usually goes with original anime projects). That's why I give it a 9 out of 10, since it could have been done better, with less confusion.\\n\nArt: 10/10\\n\nIt is outstanding. As the animation progresses we can see that anime get more and more beautiful art, but K really does it at this part. Everything is so beautifully drawn, the character design is almost flawless (I still have a problem with a few anatomy things - like Seri's boobs for starters) and the colors are nice and flowing, enjoyable for the eye. Some would say that there too many flashy sequences or that there are too many blues. Although I agree with that, it was what made the anime more appealing to me, rather than something that was annoying.\\n\nSound: 10/10\\n\nNot much to say about it, we all have ears. Actually I could write about it for ages, as much as about everything else, but I wasn't too focused on the sound. I did notice how well it fitted the scenes, the OP and ED had me hooked from the start and I still listen to them regularly. Something else I noticed,  when the OST was released I heard a few character songs on yt, and I was amazed. So it's another plus for the sound department. The voice-acting (it falls into this and character I guess) was done perfectly and I actually didn't have a problem of music interfering with the voices while watching. As someone who watched the majority of episodes in raw first and then with sub, it is a big big plus. I'll leave it at that.\\n\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\nI give them a 9 out of 10 just because it is a short anime, so it is not possible to give enough screen time for every character to develop fully. It's not like we have a ton of episodes like Naruto and Bleach where we can see the development of even the minor characters, but it was still something missing while I was watching. When it comes to this type of anime, there should be a few main characters and then add as much as you want of the side ones. With K, you get mains, semi-mains and side characters, but they all get almost the same amount of screen time (excluding Shiro and Kuro). It was kinda hard to follow at some point, when you had so little info about how they were all connected - there was just not enough time to show us how they evolved through the series. Another part that was missing for me was the link between Misaki and Fushimi. I loved the love/hate realtionship they've got (and believe me, I'm trying not to put this in my yaoi basket in this review), but what agitated me was that we never found out how close they actually were, how they acted while they were friends and exactly how did stuff happen. We got a few flashy flashbacks, a lot of yelling by Yata and laughing by Fushimi and that was about it. We were only give the bad side of their relationship. I hope they fix that in the 2nd season. \\n\nVoice actors:\\n\nI have to put this here, because I am a crazy big fan of seiyuus and in this anime, the first two things that drew me were the art and the seiyuu cast. I have to start with Mamoru Miyano, who is just freakishly amazing - I've loved him since the first time I watched Death Note, then in Soul Eater and now here... He showed us yet again how he can transform his voice - I was literally crying while he was maniacally laughing at Misaki. \\n\nThen we have Ono Daisuke, another one of my favorites. Sebastian for starters, and looking at Kuroh's character you'd say that he always gets that kind of roles. I've watched him in a bunch of other animes and he can do it all. This is just something that he is particularly good at. And his voice always gives me chills.\\n\nThe other Daisuke, Namikawa - he was quite a surprise. I didn't know his voice from other anime, or at least didn't recognize it, but his voice was rather appealing and it fitted his character well. I heard a lot of people saying that he was not cut out for this kind of role, but in the end you can see that he can manage with the boyish voice as well with the deep and commanding one.\\n\nWe see a lot of other very famous voice actors, Tsuda - who was Seto in Yu-Gi-Oh and more surprisingly Nathan - Fire Emblem in Tiger&amp;Bunny, Sawashiro Miyuki (whose voice is the only one I CAN'T stand in this anime for some reason), Horie Yuki and another favorite Fukuyama Jun. At first I thought that this type of character was not good for his voice, since he usually plays the flamboyant characters, but it was lovely to hear him like this. \\n\nThe enjoyment was a 9, although I'm still somewhere between 9 and 10. I really loved it, but at some moments it annoyed me so much so I have mixed feelings about it.\\n\nSo the overall is 9, although in my heart it's 10.\\n\nThe anime has a perfect mixture of fantasy, magic, technology, mystery and action, with a slight turn on romance. It also has a BUNCH of hot male characters which leaves our yaoi fangirls' minds to wreak havoc. Overall, it's a good anime, with so many different positive points, it would be a shame not to watch it.\\n\nI'm sorry if I bored you to death, but if you actually read this until the end, you have a cookie from me. *gives a cookie*",

It's like durarara in a way in a way set in a futuristic world. The story was really well wrapped up in 13 episodes although some things remained unexplained due to it's short episode number maybe because it makes way for the movie and the upcoming second season (can't wait). The art well it was more than amazing. Studio GoHands did an excellent job bringing us K's world. I can't explain how beautiful the animation was you must see it yourselves. Also thisanime had an excellent voice acting. About the opening/ending well I wasn't a real fun on any of them but they weren't bad. Especially the opening was pretty good just a little bit off my tastes. But overall, this anime had very good OST's and music in general. Because of it's seemingly high budget the anime has some first-class voice actors (Mamoru Miyano and Jun Fukuyama are just two of the names) and all of them do their job excellently. The character department of this anime was kinda week in my opinion. Even though there is a very good (although kinda rushed in some of them) character development in most of the characters when this anime ended I didn't identify with any of its characters. I didn't hate anyone but I also didn't love anyone too. They were all interesting but nothing out of the ordinary.  In conclusion K was a pretty enjoyable anime that I definitely enjoyed from the first episode until it's ending. I am glad I didn't let all the negative comments discourage me from watching it. A must watch for me and an amazing ride.",

            "content": "K is probably one of the most screwed up anime you will ever watch, somehow you think it's going to suck after watching the first few episodes... But like eating too much halloween candy you end up watching it all anyway.\r\nThe problem with K is the lousy way the story was told. K could easily have been done better, so what attracts the viewer to K is the fanservice.  Neko the cat girl, the flashy fight scenes and the high production values for art and animation tend to be the main attraction in K.  It's pure superficial style but that superficial style ispretty good when it happens.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I would give K a 6 but it gets bumped to 7 just because the last episodes pull everything together so well.  What ended up being mostly a mediocre anime with an annoying main character and awesome side characters is salvaged by the last few episodes.  A lot of plot threads all happen to be revealed and then get solved in quick succession like they are coming out of a machine gun towards the last third.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story behind K was told better the anime could have been something really great, after watching the last episodes you'll be left neither satisfied or dissatisfied.",

            "content": "This show is something Im mixed on ,it has potential and it kind of used it. It was a bit of a disappointment though I did enjoy it. \r\nStory~ 6 \r\nThe story has good ideas and used them a bit ,some are fleahed out, most arent ,and a few arent explained well.Episodes 6 to 8 are plot stuffing due to this anime at the time of writing this 13 episodes.There is a second season that is going to air in the fall and I hope they fix this issue because it is what made me put it on hold and I would of dropped itif I didnt buy the complete set which Im glad I did because the episodes 9 to 13 are great and my favorites because explanations were being explained at a good pace,everyone in the cast is gathering,and the ending is one of my favorites. Why couldn't we get more episodes like that,I would love it more if K had those episodes. The beginning of the show was fun to watch too seeing the main 3 (Isana,Kurou,and Neko) interact and trying to figure out the mystery at hand. But there are a ton of issues. There are plot holes,fleshing out elements of there world,at times dragged out dialogue (episode 7 was the biggest offender of dragged out dialogue) ,and just not enough time for the story. But that doesn't mean it wasn't fun or did some explanation. But this had potential to be something and while it was it wasnt what I expected to be. But I did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters ~6.5\\n\r\nThe first three characters who are Isana,Kurou,and Neko are great. They have a great bond,personalities,develop nicely(mainly Kuroh) ,and balance each other. The rest I have some gripes with. Mikoto dosent get enough screen time ,hell most of the characters in Homra as I recall dont get too much expect for Yata to an extant.Then almost everyone in Scepter 4 is either bland,very jerky,or both minus  Seri.Development is far and inbetween with most of the cast. Are main 3 at least dose get development and bits and pieces for some side though its not alot. The saving grace for the cast is relationships,there bonds feel strong and with emotions. Im glad they had this because a cast needs these and this made me enjoy the show a bit more. Overall while most of cast is decent minus the main 3 cast there is plenty of gripes I have with them.\\n\r\nArt and animation~ 10\\n\r\nThe animation is beautiful and consistent,some of the best Ive seen. Facial expressions are noticeable,characters designs are crisp,back grounds look greatly,and the color palette looks really good. Overall ,its one of the better things in the show.\\n\r\nSound ~7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack overall was good. It dose have some noticeable songs and are good to listen to with or without the show. Op and ed are nicely done and are on my favorites list. Though are some meh tracks and a couple songs I dont think fit the show but overall it is a nice soundtrack.\\n\r\nOverall ~7/10\\n\r\nDespite ups and downs it is a good show. If your a mystery fan,like pretty animation and art,and a srrong trio of characters pick this up and give it a watch otherwise I think you should watch something else.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime to me is basically the epitome of \"good, but not great\". \r\nThe art style and animation were nice-looking, but not exactly what anyone would call 'groundbreaking visuals'. The opening/ending and OSTs were nice enough and helped carry the mood of the anime, but I wouldn't listen to them as stand-alone music. The plot was interesting and enjoyable enough, but again, did not exactly stand out. Etc., etc. Basically, it was a fun enough ride to not consider a waste of time. I'm just not going to fondly regard it as a masterpiece anytime soon. \r\nOn to the stuff I liked. I liked theidea of the country basically being run by different factions that are ruled by superpowered \"Kings\". It was a concept I'd like to have seen more of, honestly. Some of the characters were also very fun to watch, especially with how our main character didn't project the same aura of blandness that a lot of other shounen protagonists emanate like crazy. I like the secrecy of his character, his friendly charisma and willingness to glibly lie out of situations. It's charming, in a way. \\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace for me was the relationships and interactions between characters. Seeing the devotion some of the characters have towards other characters can be pretty heart-wrenching. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't particularly dislike any particular aspect of this anime; I'd just find it a little lacking in intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I gave it a 6/10. I'd give it a watch if you're looking for something to do, just don't expect anything spectacular.",

            "content": "When I saw the letter K on the list of anime coming out this autumn 2012 season, I was curious. I'll be frank, the animation in the trailers are very appealing. Trailer being what they are, they do not tell you... What is K ? Forget the Shiny Animation and I'll try do to a review without falling in the path of the fan-boys/girls or the haters route. \r\nWhat is K ? K is an anime and a Manga. Both are fairly news and I had never heard of the Manga before the Anime came out. I do not really get the title of K.Why K ? It's not as simple as understanding why Naruto is called Naruto. The letter K does come out as the first letter of each episode's title and about the various themes you can find in the anime. \\n\r\nThe animation of this show is... beast. I'll admit it. I have nothing to say. Probably the best animation this season and year. It was very pretty. I'll also add that the soundtrack were top notch. The OP was decent and the ending... well, seeing a main character naked all the ED isn't really my thing and doesn't suit the show at all.\\n\\n\r\n1. STORY :: What the Hell is going on and where is this going ?\\n\r\nIn the universe of K, there's seven 'kings' given particular power. Soon enough we are introduced to the Blue King and the Red King but, later in the show, you will get to see more of them. The Kings give some of their Power to their clansmen and make their little 'team' and do their things with their clan. Homra (Red King) is similar to a Street Gang while Scepter 4 (Blue King) resemble more some kind of police... -ish. The Story begin with the Main Character, Shiro. While doing an errand, he is attacked by some people he doesn't know and learn (He sees a video of it) that he killed one of their clansman/friend. He doesn't remember any of this and try to find proof of his innocence... and/or fix this mess somehow.\\n\\n\r\nIn itself, the story isn't that bad. Some part might feel similar to Durarara!! but, it's not such a bad thing. Personally, I liked the mysteries about this murder and this is what made me watch more of it at first as the mystery regarding this event would clear up little by little. Kings giving Power to their clansmen is something I had never come across before, it's pretty interesting and it is giving the feeling that we will come across some pretty nice fighting scene between different Kings and their Clans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pacing end up being annoying very quickly. Usually, people would complain that the pacing of a show is too quick near the end. Rushed. In the case of K, it was the contrary. The First few episodes had a good pacing. Not too Fast. Not too Slow. Everything was slowing getting in place and then, it goes from 'Good' to 'FUCKING SLOW'. I watched episode where I'm pretty sure 50% of it was useless. This is mostly dude to this show trying to do so many thing at the same time but, I will get on this topic in a few. With all this slow pacing, sometimes, you really start to wonder where is this going anyway since this seems to be going no where at all. I wouldn't say the ending had no point. There was one. The Story itself was solved. The conflit started with the video of Shiro killing a member of Homra and THIS was solved at the end. Yes, it was. Linking the way it was solved or Hating it is up to you tho !\\n\\n\\n\r\n2. CHARACTERS :: Who the Hell are those guys ?\\n\r\nExactly... Who are they ? This is one question that is left unanswer and this is also the reason why the story failed. What K tried to do tho, is giving up one main goal to achieve and then putting many character around it with different issues.... I'm one of those thinking something like:  the 'Story' is similar to a background. It is true in this particular case where the 'Story' is a pretext and you just thrown in a lot of characters and they will build your story. I believe this is where K failed. Yes, the 'Pretext' is solved but some many little 'Stories' making the big one were left unsolved. We were left with our Hunger. I feel like there was much more to solve.\\n\\n\r\nI can name a lot of characters I wished I had the chance to understand and know more. The only one we got the chance to understand a little was Shiro and it was sloppy. I think I understand and know what the fuck is Sasuke in Naruto doing more than Shiro! What the hell... ? I can tell right away this is wrong, ahah. The whole show, they gave screen time to Yata Misaki and Fushimi. They even gave screen time to flashback about them. I mean, they made me care for this duo of friend/foe but, nothing was solved after all. Yeah... Nothing. Can anyone explain to me the purpose of this last flashback in episode 13 ? Except for the Fangirls, tho. Still wondering.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't feel any 'affection' for any characters in this show at all. I had interest. I did. A lot. Characters dying ? Alright! Bring it on! ...since I don't really know them anyway. Who haven't seen Clannad and cried for Nagisa ? We knew Nagisa and Tomoya very well and liked them Otherwise, no tears would have been waste on it.  \\n\\n\r\n3. ENJOYMENT :: Why should I care ?\\n\r\nThis is the most subjective part of anything. Enjoyment is subjective. I might like Roller coaster and maybe you don't. We all have different tastes and our enjoyment might be influence by things we like. The 'Why should I care' is personal to everyone. This part is pretty interesting when we're talking about K tho. This is the part where everyone goes : \\n\\n\r\n''K tries to be so many thing at the same time !''\\n\\n\r\nDo you like Ecchi ? Do you like Mysteries ? Do you like Moe ? Do you like Shounen ? Do you like Shonen-Ai ? Do you like Panties shot ? Do you like Boobs ?... Either way, whatever you like, you'll find it in K ! Isn't that cool ?... Not really. If I want to watch boobs, I'll watch Highschool DxD or whatever. Being too many things makes you get a lot more viewer probably. That might be true a first. If you liked Shonen-Ai, you enjoyed the Shiro blushing in first episode and enjoyed the Love/Hate relationship between many Red and Blue members. If you liked Moe, you enjoyed Anna being a cute all the time. If you liked Panties shot, you liked Kukuri. If you liked Mysteries, you liked the murder incident and trying to guess who really is Shiro, like myself. If you liked Shounen, you liked the fighting scene. If you liked Boobs, you liked Seri. There's no end to this !\\n\\n\r\nbut if you liked Shounen, you were probably annoyed at the Love/Hate relationship. If you liked Shonen-Ai, I dunno but maybe the Panties and Boobs weren't that interesting. It works either way.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't enjoy K. Everything is part of the enjoyment and there was decent thing in K but nothing will make me remember K in a few months and this will probably become another anime in my List I don't even remember what it was about.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to be good at too many thing usually doesn't let you shine in one...",

            "content": "K can be a dread to describe for some anime fans.\r\nSome will describe it as a droll series which takes forever to pick up. Others will describe it as an artistic masterpiece that constantly builds suspense.\r\nHowever, I've noticed that most won't describe it for what it really is: intricate. In fact, I noticed that the story tends to fly over some people because of that intricacy. What starts off as a \"whodunit\" story takes off as a suspenseful action drama. The twists and turns are pretty nice and even shocking.\r\nK contains a well-written story. In the beginning, it strings you along with random events, seeminglypointless. As things progress, the series even stops the fast-paced storyline to explain any plotholes they might have in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the series is hit after hit. The story picks up pace at a proper level and the characters start to show their true colors. You even fall in love with a character that wasn't even introduced into the story.\\n\\n\r\nTo add to the story, the art is absolutely stunning. It's a spectacle when action hits. At times, you even see the foggy breathe of an exhale and it even looks good. Even if you don't agree with the story being good, the art could be enough to make you a regular viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is just another spectacle. The series features a lot of original songs that are just seamless in sound. They don't come off as wrong and I've even found myself listening to the songs out-of-context plenty of times. To add, the final song of the series will just crush your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters start off as mysterious. As the series goes on, you change your view of a lot of them. However, something that people can't deny is the balance of personalities. The teams and the people in them are organized almost perfectly. There's also the inability to call any of the major characters plain or one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the enjoyment of this series is strictly subjective. For some, it's a beauty to behold. For others, it's a sweet-sounding symphony. For few, like myself, they story is something not seen in a while. It is crafted beautifully. It's not perfect by some standards, but I can't find anything wrong with the flow of the story myself. To add, I couldn't spot any plotholes and if there were any, they weren't strong enough to detract me from watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth a watch. It's definitely worth a watch.",

I don't even understand what the anime is going on after watching the whole series. \r\nthere have like 7 kings or 6 or whatever, fighting against each other. But I don't even know how the kings are formed or how they become the king... \"K\" only show us a tiny amount of information about the kings or their BG, but instead of the plot, there have a lot of fan services and normal random crap. Like Neko the cat, she have big boobs and a kinda interesting personality, but however, we don't knowwhy she turn into a human from a cat... so many mystery things in this anime. IMO, if this anime want to be a masterpiece, it must have like at least 24 episodes, a half year anime, just showing the details and BG info. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is a very well-done anime which have high-cost put into the graphics, special effects..etc. AND this is the only reason why i decided to watch this anime to the end, if this anime don't have those wonderful arts, i will be probably dropped this anime from episode 3-4 or so.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 Normal\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPoor character designs.

            "content": "Bueno, let's get down to business of doing my review, I've finished watching this anime about 2 weeks ago, at first the story is pretty much elaborate and often confusing. But the surprise here is that if one is to dropped this too early then he'll be missing a lot about this anime and it looks like director Suzuki Shingo made it that way which is a very good move. The art of this anime is somewhat too fancy at least for the blues and for the student of Ashinaka High School, now I like the way Seri Awashima was drawn she kinda fit asthis fighting bitch that every fighter would fantasize especially when it looks like that she's going commando. The character's on the other hand are a bit complex as well,  who would have think that both the colorless king and the silver king are in Yashiro Isana and Kuroh Yatogami whose power is far superior that the king's clansman but is unable to take out a king himself, there is this Neko chiquita who is aso called \"Strain\" if one can't follow up as to the development of this anime she'll be very confusing. You might say that the enjoyment in this anime has to do as to how the audience piece together the plot of this anime as well as the role of the character's. I would not advise this anime to someone whose perception is shallow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for this anime's category:\\n\\n\r\nStory- Good 7\\n\r\nCo'z it  really depend as to how one pieces this anime together that counts.\\n\r\nArt-Fair 6\\n\r\nCo'z for the most part everything about this anime's art was too fancy, but I can give credit for them HOMRA bros and for Seri's hotness.\\n\r\nCharacters- Fair 6\\n\r\nThought the characters did put up a good performance their role can be confusing.\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall- Good 7\\n\r\nOnce one pieces together the contents of this anime one would feel a certain achievement in being about to get this anime, so if a season 2 does come around then it all good.\\n\\n\r\nNo Blood, No Bone, No Ash.........................ARIBA!!!!! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story - 7/10\r\nPeople definitely aren't lying when they say that K has a lot of cliches and predictable elements to its story. But that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The last few episodes alone were enough to bump the story from a 5 or a 6 up to at least a 7 in my opinion. Predictable, sure - but still enjoyable.\r\nArt/Animation - 9.5/10\r\nHonestly, the art is beautiful, enough to really warrant watching this even if just for that reason. However heavy usage of distracting filters and noticeably reused animations keep this from getting a full 10 in my opinion.\r\nSound - 9/10\r\nNot much to say aboutthis, the music was great if a tad less memorable than some - though the opening and ending themes are both excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nMany of the characters are very fleshed out and well developed, and many of them were able to evoke a lot of emotions from me (namely the main two characters.) However just as many seemed to fall flat. This anime just didn't seem to have enough time in its short 13 episode run to develop as many characters as it really seemed to try to. It left with more questions than answers for many of the characters that I get the feeling the audience was supposed to love. However, the main characters are very well fleshed out and Shiro will probably remain one of my favorite characters from any anime for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nThis seems like an anime for which the enjoyment level will only go up upon each subsequent rewatch. Having only seen it once so far however, I would say I still enjoyed it quite a bit, even though it was a bit of a confusing ride. Definitely planning to rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nWorth a watch for sure. Especially considering it's only 13 episodes (though I am definitely looking forward to the movie.)",

I really wasn't looking for something to blow my mind away, but I had certain expectations.\r\nThe Story: The anime managed to keep me interested till the last moment because of the suspense regarding the identity of the main character. Well, it wraps the story up in the last episode in a mildly curious way, but the entire execution of the plot dragged the story out so much that the ending, no matter how decent it was \"supposed\" to be, just made me want to punch a hole in the wall.\r\nCharacters: Youhave one neko-woman who managed the annoy the living daylights out of me, a samurai wannabe whose character was the only tolerable one, A few \"Kings\" whose characters are are laughably recycled and uninspiring, a clairvoyant Loli chick, A couple of idiotic sidekicks who try to be gangsta and the list of cliches go on. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was new and lively- one of the reasons why I stuck through to the end. I finally realised how good animation can make you sit through the worst of stories. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I was left feeling like I fell for one big clickbait, by the end.",

I Have just watched K S1 \r\nand it was awesome . Strictly I would give it 9.3 .In 1 word I would say this show is 'PERFECT' in every aspect ( that I want )\\n\\n\r\nSee Guys You must have been hearing that the Plot is not good but that is totally wrong the plot is Great and thrilling . Art is super and I bet u know that already . \\n\r\nMusic is Kewl and Characters and Animation is Perfect . \\n\r\nThe story is a little bit rushy  but that make it even more Great . \\n\\n\r\nIn this 13 episodes you can enjoy to the fullest . \\n\r\nThe point is that a 26 + episode anime is expected to be great. \\n\r\nso If the story is rushing there is NO PROBLEM at all , it will just make the show thrilling .\\n\\n\r\nI watched this Season in 1 go\\n\\n\r\nSo the Story is complex and that makes it even more great . A guy is suspected by a gang to be the killer of their team member and the guy don't know about it . So he tries to know about the situation .\\n\\n\r\nIt have a great Action and great sound . \\n\\n\r\nA little spoiler summary\\n\\n\r\nThere is gang called HOMRA and they have a loving clansmen who was just killed by a high school kid . In this anime it is told that there a king who rule the country , like red king , blue king etc . That high school kid claims to be colorless kid in the video { a video was made by the clansmen in which he died} . then by a accident he loses his memory . The clansmen of the previous colorless king came and tries to find about the realty , he should kill or follow his in basis of is he good or bad . this story runs pretty smoothly and different secrets unfolds . this is just a main plot , on the other hand there is continuous fights between red king clansmen and blue king clansmen. As other kings join the story it becomes more fun .\\n\\n\r\nOverall my rating is 9.3 for this show but as it is very strict marking I give this show 10 on Mal",

One would think the characters were atually actors and the visuals during the battles were outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacers:In my opinion the main disadvantage of this anime is that the main protagonist Yashiro is not a cool guy at all. He often drifts away with his mind and up the time he changes into the silver king he is somewhat gay. On the contrary the blue and the red king as well as some of their subordinates are completed characters that anyone would like and the fact that on the second half of the series they become more main characters improves the character domain of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:The enjoyment was pretty good because i liked the battles and the schemes in order to capture Yashiro.The end was also very strong,sentimentally, and dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the points above I would give the overall score of 7 to this anime. Tell me what you think. :)",

            "content": "K, to me, was the biggest disappointment of the 2012 fall anime lineup. It just did not live to my expectations - maybe it was set too high, maybe not - but in the end, I just couldn't enjoy this anime.\r\nArt = 10: I love the art style of this anime, especially in the beginning - the colours and animation was so vibrant. The quality dropped a little bit later on but it was still so good. I really enjoyed the use of pastel like colours in a utopian future, a start difference from others (like PSYCHO PASS).\r\nSound = 8: I love the use ofjazz in this anime, and the music choices were subtle and compliments the art style. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it didn't have the \"OOMPH\" factor and maybe it could've been better used at some of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters = 6: I liked most of the characters except for the protagonist, but maybe I'm biased against weak, aloof type protagonist - he was too airy for my taste. My main critique though is that this anime had, what I like to call, the \"Bleach Syndrome\" (too much characters, not enough character development). Kudos on the Red King though, even though this guy barely spoke, he had the most character and depth in comparison to the rest.\\n\\n\r\nStory = 4: I think the story broke this anime for me. It had so much potential yet it chose a somewhat safe and generic route, I had this anime totally figured out by the 3rd episode. The pacing was all wonky, it felt like they tried to squish in a 24 episode anime into 13. There was no tension in the story, no sense of urgency - not because I thought the protagonist could handle anything thrown at it - more so that there was some sort of deus ex machina element in place (which there was) and the way the story was being told.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, once I saw the last episode - there was a bitter feeling in my mouth. Even though I saw the last episode, I tuned out of this anime a long time ago - I stayed to watch because maybe in the end, I was going to get blown away but I wasn't. It sucked me in with the first episode but the drawn out pacing and inconsistent elements placed in the anime really took me out of the immersion and the enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I'm still going to watch season 2 just to see if they don't royally mess up that one.",

            "content": "The best way for me to describe the anime called K is exceptionally unexceptional. It begins in a fascinating and intriguing way, but it really does not lead to anything the audience has not already seen a hundred times before. Amnesia? Check. Moe-girl(s)? Check. Supernatural Abilities? Check. I guess the best parts about K are the score and the animation itself. The movement of the characters is always smooth and crisp. Watching K with 1080P resolution is a real joy. It is just a real shame the story and characters themselves are dull and lack any real luster. \r\nWhat I liked about K is itsboldness. It tries very hard and excels at looking cool. The characters fighting each other, the flames, smoke, and effects are all very nice to look at. I can really appreciate the time it took to animate this series. Most, if not all, of the characters talk in a over dramatic voice, you that deep, raspy voice? Yeah. That one. It does feature some pretty funny moments featuring the character called \u201cNeko\u201d, but they are few and do not make K a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. The best part of the story is the history lesson we are given half way through the series. So that should be somewhat telling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did not like about K is the plot. It is slow, like molasses slow. Even though K is thirteen episodes long, everything seemed to take forever to happen. A lot of talking happened, with little to no forward movement. Maybe others will disagree with me on this point, but to me, there were whole episodes where nothing dramatic happened. For a thirteen run series, that just cannot be allowed to happen. A lot of the story centers around the Shiro-kun. A young lad suffering from amnesia. Who is he? What has he done? Can he prove his innocence? Kind of stuff. The story is also heavily centered around people with supernatural abilities, but the reason for why exactly they have the abilities is never given. May be this will be explained better in the second series (gulp), but if they only produced this one, then the audience would just be left with their own conjecture, and that is not good.\\n\\n\r\nWho is K for? I suppose any one who enjoys watching the new stuff, like me. It also should appeal to those who like light fantasy to mid-weight fantasy in their anime. Although I suspect that the second series will be much heavier on the the fantastical elements. It is a lighthearted anime that is dressed up to look like some kind of heavy, high concept epic. But really, all you have is a child dressed in his dad's tuxedo. All the flash, but none of the cash. I thought K would have been something I would really like, but it turned out to be just another anime on my list. \\n\\n",

Keeping you in the dark and maintaining an aura of mystery. Information was given in bite-sized pieces - enough to keep you going and understand what it was that was going on.\r\nIt hid behind the shadows of curiosity, however when the time came to step into the light - K faltered.\r\nAfter that inital veil of mystery is lifted, K shows it's true self with it's bloated storyline and characterarcs - all underdeveloped and unnecessary, not to mention barely resolved. They introduce so many arcs all at once that it just leaves you confused and distracted, and when they do try to resolve it, it's either so rushed that it will just fly past you or makes no sense whatsoever. The saddest part is that there are some storylines and character arcs that seems promising.\\n\\n\r\nI think the real problem is that they just didn't have enough episodes to work with, not enough to tell and develop this grand story - which is definitely a shame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nRating - 2\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the characters are underdeveloped as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series tries to be an ensemble cast, switching from one group of characters to another, which didn't really give them sufficient time to develop and flesh-out each one intricately.\\n\\n\r\nTheir sad attempt of character development is just giving them weird quirks, but weird quirks is not equal to character development, they just ended up seeming more outlandish and two-dimmension that they already are.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no one is given the opportunity to show lovable traits. \\n\\n\r\nI failed to be invested in the characters and in turn failed to care about their issues and problems. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nRating - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that K really has going for it is its art.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are gorgeous, the character design is quite attractive, the action sequences are very well animated and the color is manipulated well to reflect the mood of the scenes - too bad the sound flushed it down the toilet\\n\\n\r\nand on that subject-\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nRating - 1\\n\\n\r\nI was first commending it for not using stock anime background music but K bit my ass and forced me to take back what I said.\\n\\n\r\nI'd rather much have the the stock anime background music than what K offered. On their own they're pretty good, but the problem lies within the integration to scenes.\\n\\n\r\nDuring an action scene where you'd expect an upbeat tune to keep you riled up and on your toes, K gives you a...ballad?\\n\\n\r\nOne would think that it might seem innovative and unique, offering a different experience, but no - it was completely unecessary and served no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said - the action sequence is animated well, but with the ballad it came with made it seem slow and boring.\\n\\n\r\nThere was not enough energy with the bg music, making the whole anime more bland and hollow.\\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu's performances were forgetable and the same goes for the OP and ED (both of which had atrocious animations).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nRating - 2\\n\\n\r\nAside from the art and animation, there was nothing I really truly enjoyed with K. There wasn't enough interesting and amusing character interactions to keep me going, no interesting storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what mindset you should have to enjoy K. Maybe if you have time to kill and want to appreciate some gorgeous visuals then sure - be my guest. But like I said before, there is nothing fullfilling about this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nRating - 3\\n\\n\r\nK was something that seemed so promising with it's interesting concept and batch of characters, but it just failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nIt's rushed, the pacing is awful, the atmosphere is nonexistent and the characters are all underdeveloped..\\n\\n\r\nThere is no pay-off to the build-up - which frustrated me most and the world building and principles isn't established as well as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nHowever I mostly blame all these to the limited ammount of episodes they had to work with. I feel that with more on their belt they could've told the story better - but what can you do this is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nHere's to a chance that perhaps Return of Kings will be better.",

            "content": "Love it hate it.. Lets review it... \r\n(Story)\r\nOkay so K started out really well the first episode was amazing.. \"serious fangirl candy\"  Hot bishies, Action, talking trash cans, and a cat girl... All the trimmings for a hit anime.. (if you ask me).. but it soon was obvious this anime was going to take its sweet time going.... (anywhere) .. Some eps just felt like fillers.. And were all over the place. It took a true anime fan to decode the storyline.. There were just so many charcters to keep up with.. But the story toward the last 4 eps redeemedits self in my eyes and if anything made a decent plot.. so I give it a 7/10... Im being generous by the way\\n\\n\r\n(Art) \\n\\n\r\nWell damn thats were 3/4 the budget went so its was impressive.. Some of the scences like when mikoto powered up looked the same as previous eps.. But Ill over look that and give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\\n\r\nWell im into the jazzy music they randomnly play.. It seem kinda like a tom and jerry type thing everynow and then but oh well, the seiyuus were amazing though especiall Kukuris...  God that girl has range.. so a 8/10 there as well..\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell the show didnt have time to go indepth with any of the charcters really so they came off a lil generic... but still loveable... So a 7/10\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIm the type that can appreciate something for what it is and what it isnt... I mean.. Alot of people put alot of high expectations in this series.. They thought is was going to be the best thing since sliced bread... But like most expectations they fall short.. As for me i set the bar very low.. Im talking (sands of destructions low)  So i wasnt dissappointed and could enjoy the talking cat girl randomnly doing crap and wasting episode time... And didnt care that the story line was all over the place... \\n\\n\\n\r\n(Overall) \\n\\n\r\nWell i enjoyed it i like the whole 7 kings concept.. Its pretty interesting.. Just needed more episodes.. more time to explain things an go into back stories.. The powers.. the people the art all amazing .. But its kinda annoying that the kill off main characters.. so I was just Like Wtf.. at the end... I took a nap after i watched it then rewatched it... And it had the same ending so.. I guess there going with that.. so i assume there living it at a perpetual cliff hanger to have alot of view for season two.. Which is confirmed.. Through the slow but interesting plot.. randomn, scences hints at BL only to be proven untrue the next ep.. I kinda liked the anime and will buy it once it comes to the states.. so Go ahead.. Watch it..  \\n\r\nif you dont.. you missed something worth the time put in...  7/10",

            "content": "I dove into this series, interest piqued by the art, without knowing it was going to be a mere thirteen episodes long. Perhaps that's why I was somewhat disappointed by the end.\r\nIt seems that I'm not the only one left underwhelmed by the plot. There was a lot of stuff left unexplained, even elementary things like the identities of some of the characters. I have no problem with the technical side of things, e.g., how the heck the Swords of Damocles actually work, how do you determine who will be the next king, etc. I'm fine with not knowing that. What really makes me sadis that the relationships between the characters are never fully explored, and the story is never clearly explained. After watching it, I felt that I still barely had an idea of what was going on. The questions I had in my head that'd accumulated the more I watched were never actually answered. Perhaps they could've traded in a few of the gratuitous fanservice scenes for some solid plot development.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the characters were wonderful. So many different archetypes were represented in this series and we got a (very) brief glimpse into their minds, seeing the unfolding of the events from many different points of view. It could be my personal bias, but the only character I could not stand was Neko. Again, it would have been nice to see more development of the relationships between characters, and development of the characters themselves. They start off with their flawed personalities and worldviews, go through all this stuff, and the majority end up more or less unchanged. For the audience to embark on this journey with these characters, it is somewhat disappointing that the characters don't progress/attempt to progress in any major way.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I cannot criticise is the art/animation. It was a real treat for the eyes - the character designs, the clean art style were really refreshing. Oh, and the OST (minus the ED, again probably just due to my bias against Neko) and the voice acting were also amazing. I can't fault Ono Daisuke in any way. Nope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about this series. The characters were really loveable and the art was fantastic, but the plot barely did them any justice. There was so much potential in this story, I was sad to see it end before anything had really begun. By the final episode I was a sobbing wreck, not only because of the nature of the ending itself but because the story was setting itself up so well, only to be cut short. I really hope some day this will be remade with more episodes in order to leave room for some plot/character development! It might be too much to hope for, but a girl can dream, right?",

            "content": "When it comes to most media in today\u2019s world, the \u201crule of cool\u201d is often used in either movies, TV, music, books or especially animation. In this special case, anime can have the rule of cool (for instance, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo), that is, if the show is rightfully done where you can recommend it to every one you know, but you can\u2019t make that your only priority or as most people would just call it something that tried and failed, even if you got high production values.\r\nYashiro Isana has lived a relatively ordinary, simple life. He lives in the technologically-advanced Shizume City and attendsAshinaka High School, a notable high school that is located on an island just outside the areas. Yashiro is friendly with everyone. Nothing ever seems wrong about him, except perhaps his habit of forgetting where his school-issued PDA is. However, nothing normal has been happening since the recent murder of Tatara Totsuka, prominent member of the infamous HOMRA. No one knows who exactly killed him but the man responsible bears an uncanny, identical appearance to Yashiro. Seeking vengeance, the Red Clansmen of HOMRA set out to get Yashiro and kill him. Everyone suspects that Yashiro is the murderer. Isana Yashiro was not the person who killed Tatara Totsuka but yet another mysterious character is pulling the strings behind the curtains, a person which is quite dangerous and powerful.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I have never been so confused about reviewing an anime, especially one that has a very simple storyline of a high school kid being accused of murdering a well-known clansman from a very dangerous group and for the time being, I actually did like the plotline and I felt like it didn\u2019t feel rushed during that plotline. I didn\u2019t feel like they completely went too quick with that, but I feel like they went too quick about most of the kingdoms and their characters. I felt like we could\u2019ve gotten more stories from the HOMRA group, as most of those characters and their stories did seem interesting, but that phase didn\u2019t last. Scepter 4, I can say less about because it\u2019s mostly 3 members of the group that are more prominent (the others are just members no one gives a shit about) and there\u2019s the fact that one was a former member of HOMRA and has a rivalry with another HOMRA member. I think the biggest problem about the plotline is that there wasn\u2019t enough episodes to fill most info on these characters. Maybe the light novels and manga did that better, but it still doesn\u2019t mean it left me underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters for the most part, I\u2019m at 50/50 on them.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Shiro, Kuroh, and Neko: Shiro is our main protagonist and he is a trickster for the most part as the show starts and I did felt a little progression when it came to him solving the crime of being framed for murder and he didn\u2019t really get on my nerves. Kuro is the atypical stoic badass with a sword and while most people thought of him as his credibility as one with weaken once he joins Kuro and Neko, to me, he was more of a better character. Yeah, I like my stoic badasses now and then but at least, he does get comedic at a few times and it may seem like breaking character to you, but it\u2019s more of having a personality to me. Neko\u2026..is honestly annoying the whole time, basically she\u2019s very devoted to Shiro and is mostly there for the fan service otaku crowd as she\u2019s a catgirl\u2026.not a girl dressed as a cat, a cat that can change into a girl\u2026.did I mention she has huge breasts? *gets a slap from random female* Ow.\\n\\n\r\nThe HOMRA group is basically some gang archetype characters with some uniqueness in them. Mikoto Suoh aka The Red King is the tough and most powerful leader of the group; Izumo Kusanagi is the one member that keeps everything under control and the level-headed one. Misaka Yata is the passionate, very violent and headstrong member of the team, especially when he really wants to hunt down whoever killed Tatara Totsuka (one of the first members of HOMRA and also the weakest); Rikio Kamamoto as in the blonde-haired guy who wears sunglasses and eats\u2026; and there\u2019s Anna Kushina, the youngest and only female member of the gang\u2026because badasses needs a loli on his side.\\n\\n\r\nThen the Scepter 4 group, as I said, has only 3 members that are more prominent than the rest. Reisi Munakata aka The Blue King is the calm yet elegant character, the polar opposite of The Red King and wants to keep things in order. Seri Awashima is (of course) the lone female member of the group, nicknamed The Heartless Woman (or \u201cTundra Woman\u201d in the Japanese version) and\u2026.well, that\u2019s it. She\u2019s the second-in-command and I found nothing that interesting about her, except that she loves red bean paste so much. However, Saruhiko Fushimi is probably more interesting to me as he was a former member of HOMRA and has a long rivalry with Yata since he left there and he basically didn\u2019t give a shit about leaving them, calling them a childish gang of thugs and gangsters but he seemed more of a regretting asshole of a character throughout.\\n\r\nI could mention the other characters like some of the classmates (Kukuri Yukizome, Shiro\u2019s friend) but they aren\u2019t really that of much importance in the plot, so I\u2019m going to move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is quite the visual and shows a lot of their high production value and the art does look gorgeous. The studio behind this is GoHands, and they are relatively a newer studio as the only well-known works I know from them are the Mardock Scramble movies and as of recently, Coppelion, and while it looks beautiful, I wish they tone down some of the blue filter they got. I admit blue is my favorite color (hell, my nickname or my updated nickname is Blue Hybrid) but sometimes it can be irritating at a few times and that also goes to their future projects (i.e. Coppelion).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, this is one of those times where I like more of the score then the opening and ending themes as they really didn\u2019t feel like they belong in the show. I would say the ending theme to the last episode fits better and this is nothing against the opening theme \u201cKINGS\u201d by Angela as I did like that song, it\u2019s just should\u2019ve been used in a different anime. Now the score does have some appeal as when the first episode began, I was really immersed into the music, preferably to the themes of Mikoto, Yata, and Reisi.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the English dub, which aired on Neon Alley, brought to you by Studiopolis and Viz Media and this is much an all-star cast, despite the show being a non-union dub, and for the most part it is pretty standard in being a good dub. This year, Matthew Mercer still continues to impress me as a voice actor with stuff like Fate/Zero even with schlock with Iron Man: Rise of Technovore, his role as Kuroh was great. Ben Diskin, a voice actor who I first recognize watching Codename: Kids Next Door, has gotten good range over the years and him as Yata is acceptable but the one VA that I really thought was excellent is Todd Haberkorn as Izumo. That smoothness and calm demeanor in his voice made me not even notice he was in the anime and honestly, that move to L.A. has helped in get more diverse roles (with some exception). As for the others, Sam Riegel as Shiro was okay, Patrick Seitz as Reisi is plenty good, Johnny Yong Bosch as Fushimi is what I expected from him. Tara Platt, Carrie Savage, Grant George are well-acted and last while I do not like Neko as a character, I had no problem with Stephanie Sheh voicing her but I will say if I had to choose between her as Kuro in Blue Exorcist or Neko in K, I choose the former.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: So did I like K? Well, I do to an extent but it\u2019s not exactly I would recommend to most people. Some people may have gotten confused over the entire run and some did get it from the get-go. I\u2019m the in-between guy where I get most of the plot but somehow miss something in the leeway that requires a rewatch (which I did do a few times) and I don\u2019t do that often when reviewing anime. So with K, it\u2019s in the middle of the road for me.",

            "content": "No blood, no bone, no ash--as well as no plot, no character development, and no denouement. \r\n Story 5/10: \r\nThe synopsis is vague enough so that one is goaded into believing that K is a dynamic, thrilling series with an airtight storyline. Not so. K is crunched into a short timeframe, cutting character development and cohesion, which are vital to a series' success. What transpires as the series \"progresses\" often leaves you lost, wondering why, how, and where certain repercussions came from. \r\nGaping plot holes and unanswered question remain. With the fanservice, unnecessarily long conversations, and filler-like material eating up precious airtime, I found thatnone my questions and speculations--basic ones, at that--were ever addressed. Rather than waste time on fanservice, the directors could've focused on lacing the fundamental ideas within the series. \\n\\n\r\nK had a lot going for it-- a cool plot, lots of characters, shipping material, friendships across enemy lines (for the most part), more. All it needed was more time within the story and more episodes.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nIt could go either way here. You've got the carefree \"I don't know what the hell I'm doing teehee\" protagonist, his serious tough-guy type sidekick, and the useless (annoying) chick who forgoes clothes for fanservice. Then you've got the HOMRA thugs and the meddlers of Scepter 4. All in all: they're generic on the surface, yes. \\n\\n\r\nBut upon closer inspection, the characters have certain habits that are left to interpretation. For example, Munakata, the upstanding, righteous, loner-type Blue King--who shamelessly invades personal space and delivers unnecessarily hard beatings to those weaker than him. Not exactly something you'd expect from another character who also fits the dutiful leader archetype. Another example, Misaki, a foul mouthed, hot blooded ruthless young man who we see struggle with girls, and, more surprisingly, in tears numerous times. Again, not quite what you'd expect from someone so brazen and cocky. Like I said, regarding their personalities, it could go either way. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding character development, which lowers my opinion of the series-- what character development? Everyone seemed to just \"be\" there. The lack of character development may be attributed to the story, which was crammed into a very short time frame. No character has a chance to learn and understand in those few days during which the story takes place. If the story had been stretched out over a longer time period, in turn yielding more episodes, there would have been enough time for characters to grow, develop, and make sense of their situation. This issue, however, points to driving problems of the plot and timeframe.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: A bit too \"shiny\" at times, but crisp and clear, with rich colors. Take note of the backgrounds, sky, and glimmering dust motes--beautiful.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: A catchy, pretty memorable OST.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\r\nI continued watching because I wanted to find out what happened and have my longstanding curiosities answered or explained. I'll admit, I too found myself dazzled by the animation. \\n\r\nK's huge potential drew me in. Sadly, K ended up a tragic case of a cool idea ruined by poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nHigh hopes that they'll get it right in the sequel.",

I am glad that I continued with it because I liked this anime a lot!\r\nStory: 8 - It was confusing at the beginning. I actually had trouble grasping where it was headed to. After the first half, it got better and the story began to unfold. Simple though it may be, I don't have any complaints. Kings vs Kings and Subordinates vs Subordinates. Ending was unexpectedly poignant.\r\nArt: 9 - Like I said,animation was awesome. I loved the colors, the scenes, the hair, the eyes and the movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - OP theme was better than the ED theme. BGM was alright too. OP was a little haunting but fast-paced. ED had a sad tone to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 - I just wish that they gave more depth to the characters. With 13 episodes, there is no room for growth for the others and it is a little frustrating. I wanted to know more about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and My Overall Score: 8 - I always base my thoughts/opinion about an anime after the last episode. The reason for my score is that for me the anime was able to redeem itself from the slow start. It also left me wanting more. It might not be perfect but I don't think it deserves the crap it's getting.\\n\\n\r\nNo Blood! No Bone! No Ash! I will be looking forward to the second season! :)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "K is a very confused series. The title implies that the producers were lazy in their naming, yet the animation is breathtakingly detailed. There's more bishounen guys than many a shoujo series, yet there's also a cat girl who shows up naked in your face all the time. The show is supposedly an original piece, yet it borrows heavily from other works. So what is K? Other than being a letter in a character's name, I'm not sure what the title implies. Regardless, the series is about a dude who has apparently committed a murder. He now must prove his innocence while avoiding an insurmountableopposition, his only hope being that there are multiple parties after him with differing goals. The series takes place in an alternative modern world where supernatural \"kings\" somehow have a political and economic control over Japan without the general populace knowing about it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile K is potentially a very deep series, way too many of the details are kept from the viewer, and important details are repeatedly kept until far too late in the series. K is not a series that hooks you on the plot, despite the interesting-sounding plot synopsis; this is mostly because the protagonist is an enigma who really isn't worth deciphering. Really, if it wasn't for the painstakingly-detailed animation and interesting technology in this parallel universe, I wouldn't have made it through this series. If you're looking for good action and outstanding animation, you'll be wowed by this series. If you're looking for a coherent plot or character development, I cannot recommend this one. There's supposedly a sequel for this series, maybe it may one day redeem it to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAbsolutely stunning. Expect excellent lighting, shadows, coloring, and detail everywhere. The file size alone per episode should give you an indication of the production quality- a rarity to find something with almost UFOTable levels of detail and lighting. Character-wise you have a fairly large cast, most of whom are easily identifiable. Most of the guys are drawn in a bishounen style yet I'm pretty sure this is not targeted as a shojo. The only real downside to the animation is the depth of character expression. Perhaps the protagonist is supposed to be hard to figure out, but seriously sometimes you just can't tell what anyone's thinking/feeling. There's a significant amount of CGI usage though it isn't as bothersome as in other series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is primarily an action series so you'll have quite a few battles, some of which have really nice choreography in addition to magical attacks/effects. When each of the kings fights, a huge CGI sword appears over them in the sky, signifying something that is never really explained. Expect a fair amount of blood and death. As for ecchi, you have a cat girl whose hair strategically covers certain body parts- but who is otherwise naked for quite a few scenes. This isn't an ecchi heavy series otherwise as supposedly the mood is medium-heavy.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nK's high production quality continues to shine in the audio department. The show opens with an Engrish song that makes no sense lyric wise and melody wise. However, it redeems itself with a superb ED sung by none other than Neko herself. It further redeems itself with a unique sounding BGM with some nice melodies, giving the series a cool and crisp feel to complement the shiny blue/green animation.\\n\\n\r\nK also has a lot of high-powered VAs as well. Daisuke Ono takes a primary role, and a lot of big VAs join him as supporting characters. Unfortunately, character development is something the producers overlooked so a lot of the talent is wasted. We even have Mamoru Miyano voicing a sadist, but with so little character background they could have used anyone!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhat starts as a confusing, wtf show with lots of fighting and confusion ends up resolving with a really confusing wtf conclusion. There's just one central plot line with many flashbacks throughout. The series keeps progressing the central plot while giving you teasers about the past until finally, at the conclusion, everything is explained. And by everything, I mean nothing. Virtually 99% of the important background on characters and events is inexplicably left out. While this may work for a horror/psychological thriller, it totally doesn't make sense here and really ruins any expectations of a good score from me. There are two primary ways that a series can convince me to stay interested storywise- either have a strong character cast that I grow attached to or a cohesive and/or interesting plotline. This series lacks both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYou have a lot of characters to deal with in this series. There are students at the school, gang members in team red, cop wannabees in team blue, random ad hoc supporting characters for our confused protagonist, and an assortment of other kings. And to be honest, most of them are completely irrelevant to the plot. For instance, you have a loli girl who can magically move red spheres and predict where people are. Other than catering to loli-lovers, she has no role in the story whatsoever. Remove her and the overall plot would be virtually untouched. This same litmus test applies to a dozen of the \"supporting\" cast.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing on our protagonist, he's a confused dude who acts nonchalant all the time despite having to constantly run for life. You eventually learn a bit about who he is but not really anything significant enough to relate to him. He's supported by a cat girl and a tsundere Daisuke Ono, who both have virtually no explication whatsoever. They're basically there to save Yashiro's ass when he gets into trouble.\\n\\n\r\nSo you have a lot of characters with interesting traits but virtually no development or viewer attachment. Relationships are likewise vaguely defined but never challenged or utilized. My displeasure at the characterization is practically equivalent to my enjoyment at the show's visuals.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nIn the end, K is barely an O-K series. It can be considered valuable from an artistic point of view with entertaining visuals and fight sequences. However, I abhor series with poor character usage, and this is a striking example of such. A pity that a series with so much style ended up with so little soul.",

            "content": "After reading the other reviews to K, I just felt like I had to clear up some misunderstandings. Why? Because I think after reading the other reviews, people won't even watch K, which would be a shame.\r\nLet's start with the things I agree with, which is, actually, just one thing: the story. I will admit that the story is not really good and a bit rushed, but it's easy to follow and it IS a story, not like in other animes in which you can sometimes find 9 episodes without the story even mentioned. In K, the story goes on in every episode. While thereshould've been more episodes to explain in more detail and give some more backstories, there'll be a second season and I have the hope that maybe they'll explain something there.\\n\r\nTime to move on. The art, which I really really liked. The drawing is good and pretty detailed and the animations are also well made. That's why I liked the fights. To be honest, other than that, I thought that the fights were a bit boring since nothing much happened. But for me, a person who pays more attention to the characters, this wasn't much of a problem.\\n\r\nI can't say much regarding the sound. Throughout the anime, I thought that it fit in well. Also, even though I liked the opening, it could've been better. But it WAS good.\\n\r\nDespite us not getting that much information (as I said, looking forward to the second season) I really liked the characters. I also think the interactions between the characters were good. Not that it is of any interest, but I want to say that Yata is my favorite character. I really want him and Fushimi to make up.\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment an eight, not really because of the story but because of the art, the characters and, probably, the sound. I know that everyone has their own opinion, but I recommend the anime. I was really sad when it ended and I'm looking forward to the second season to get some more interactions between the characters and some more backstories. And maybe they'll find the missing story somewhere. ^-^",

            "content": "K was an anime that I honestly expected to like, but I was severely let down. In my opinion, it had great potential, but the story and characters weren't well-developed and were simply disappointing.\r\nI'm going to start with the things I liked about the show. First of all, I loved the art style and the scenery, the character design was also very much to my liking. The music was excellent and it perfectly fit the scenes. I have seen many people praise the artwork and music, but I do have a complaint regarding the artwork - the characters' faces lacked expressions. There were many sceneswhere the characters, instead of looking shocked, just looked a bit surprised. I do think they could've worked on the expressions more, but other than that, I have no complaints.\\n\r\nMoving on to things I didn't like. First and foremost - the very first episode. We are introduced to way too many characters at once and are given no time to connect with any of them. The story isn't even properly explained until the third episode. I think that this could've all been fixed if the show had around 25 episodes instead of only 13. That way, we would've had enough time to get to know the characters and the story would've been explained a lot better. Another big problem is that the characters have barely any personality, which makes it very difficult to connect with them and care about them. The main character is just your stereotypical protagonist: nice, funny and outgoing. He doesn't even get enough screentime with all these other characters around, so that's pretty much all we know about his personality. This brings me back to the problem I mentioned earlier - Too. Many. Characters. You can't have 15-20 important characters in a 13 episode anime. Having a lot of side characters is okay, but having so many characters that serve a purpose in the plot is quite overwhelming. Again, this would've been fixed if the anime was longer. The story was an interesting idea, but poorly executed. We don't even get introduced to all the kings during the first season, which I found very disappointing. The plot twists would've been much more shocking if - you guessed it - the show had more episodes.\\n\r\nOverall, I expected more from this anime and I'm sad that it couldn't have been longer and better developed, because it truly had great potential and could've become one of my favorite anime series.",

            "content": "(maybe spoilers depends on how you see it XD)\r\nthe anime draws me right in with only a promotion video, with that fantastic art style and that broad ranged of characters, it simply made it the most interesting anime I have seen in a good while. but as you can see the rating is pretty low and I have no idea why that happens and don't really want to dig them out, I personally enjoyed the entire series from start to finish, even with some cliched characters some might say or rushed story some others might claim, I didn't quite catch all that but only thoughtthis was a wonderful anime for all who would throw all those 'critics' attitude out and simply drown themselves in some nice bit of superpower and fights between the Kings.\\n\\n\r\nstory - 9/10: I just like the story a lot, it was not that rushed for me, you simply just need learn every detail and link them together. the story structure itself is probably well-known by most anime fans, taking place in the present then gradually flashback to the mysterious past of the main character later on. also, apart from the MC, there are couples of other stories going on from other characters but ultimately all end in the same spot. the story was well written but true it does have some holes unexplained like where were kings chosen and how did the sword show up? but anyway the story is nowhere close to finishing for there are still like 2 kings who never even showed up, so I'm pretty looking forward to that. (also, the ending was pretty unexpected but awesome)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10: the art as I have explained earlier was really enjoyable to watch, the landscape and character drawing were done magnificently. so I have nothing really to say.\\n\\n\r\nsound - 10/10: soundtrack throughout the anime was beautiful where each scene has its own particular soundtrack that never seems to be out of place but adds to its emotion credit each scene provides if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 7/10: the character was nice but that was it, all character has its own unique personality but there was not much development throughout the entire anime maybe except the MC. each character seems too stubborn to change or show anything out of their own self which seems a bit too solid or stiff for any human but since this is a fiction so I guess its still fine.\\n\\n\r\noverall, I think this anime is really underrated and I recommend this to every action fan out there who enjoyed fate war or any action animes that involve different personalities and powers and also the main character who is secretly the most op guy in the entire anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ah yes, K, aka \"when the title sums up the anime\". \r\nI decided to watch this show on a whim because some people I respect the opinions of, said it was good. -25 Reputation with the FinalNwo fraction, you got that?\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is basically nonexistent. You get a gist of the conflict and rivalry between clans and their leaders, but the show doesn't elaborate on it apart from the final episodes. Everything just felt like a huge, dragged out prequel to an actual story which we might get in the upcoming season, but I sure as hell doubt that we'll reach a conclusion, good ornot, anytime soon. This is a shame, since K features some interesting and possibly deep characters, therefore a bigger episode count would have been much healthier for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is, as much as I usually hate to admit it, the best part of the show. In most anime, side characters seem far more interesting to me. I'd watch a pure 12 episode slice of life comedy of these characters and it would be better than what I got, because it was entertaining me more than the stupid conflicts and predictable reveals that felt more like the author's way out of a misery he got himself into, rather than tastefully used plot twists. Because what do you do when you can't reach a conclusion? You just kill off an important character and expect people to care enough to look over the bad things. Unfortunately that didn't work. Again, the amount of episodes were at fault here. Otherwise we'd probably get much more content and substance to the character. The characters' motivations weren't clear, and the ending wasn't more than a huge copout with plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nMost content is just randomly thrown in and the scene cuts don't fit together at all, which makes the plot feel all over the place. Which it is, let's be honest here. It's a chaotic compilation of slice of life, comedy, and fights, all in 5 minutes of one episode. To be fair, it has a distinct style, I give K that one. It felt fresh and unique, which is always a good thing to see after so many anime with rather \"normal\" designs. The characters each had their own distinguishable look and the clans had decent uniform styles. I was a big fan of the colored effects combined with the black & white main animation.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is decent. Can't really say more because I rate soundtracks based on personal taste only.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: \\n\\n\r\nK is absolutely terrible at what it tries to be, but is good in rather unimportant departments, which kept me at bay, otherwise I'd have dropped it. While the show does have interesting characters and a decent design, it's never making use of the right things, which, in fact, just sucks.",

This anime unfortunately does not keep up the good pace it has started with until the end. As what others have said, this anime had too little time to do too many things. It was very underdeveloped. Contrary to what I've just said, this anime got a hold of me and I never once thought todrop it. It's very inconsistent, but if you stick for 6-7 episodes, you definitely won't regret it. If you watch it with ease and not much seriousness, you adore this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art is lovely but I still believe it could've been better. It is flashy and I think it is meant to be flashy, but sometimes more is less. It lacks a little in detail too. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. The sound tracks are all beautiful. Good voice acting too, but some actors were not able to pull out the best in the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Some characters will be interesting and will appear to be likable, but because of their underdevelopment the series will seem very crude and mediocre. A lot of them had a lot of potential but were never taken care of. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10.  Although this has been a 'wild card' type of series for me, it was very enjoyable. Without much seriousness, this anime will be easy like a breeze. You might finish the anime in one day.  It has somehow kept me from dropping it---the show was again inconsistent, but it was good enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. K Project is an anime series that could've been so big like the other animes. It had huge potential but it was never taken care of. It will provide eyecandy and it will be definitely an easy watch. Underdevelopment and some plotholes will show, but how some characters portray emotions, and things like friendship, honesty and camaraderie are present too. It wasn't totally cliche, in fact it had twists enough for you to be enjoying yourself in.  \\n\\n\r\nK Project was undoubtedly, a very bumpy ride, but I guess I didn't mind after all, and I hope you won't too.",

            "content": "Hmmmmm.... \"K\"\r\nWhat can it stand for? Obviously it stands for \"Kool\" because that is what K is in a nutshell. Cool characters doing cool things in a cool way.\r\nK has a rather interesting premise where gang leaders called Kings, maybe that's why its called K. Anyway, Kings dominate majority of the city and each King is represented by a color, red, blue, yellow, green, silver, etc. And then there is one special King called the Colorless Kings that is shrouded in mystery. Our main character Yashiro ends up getting caught in the midst of the gang war because he was framed for something he didn'tdo. Kuroh, the Black Hound and with the intent on killing him, ends up being his saving grace and ally on resolving the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself had so much potential and the world was really interesting. But many of the ideas were never explored, such as how do Kings get their power, what relationships did some of the Kings have, and why was Yashiro so gosh darn beautiful. Just kidding, but in all seriousness, the story becomes really confusing and you might need to pause in order to actually grasp what is going on. The characters are, like I said, Cool. The majority had some depth to them and are really entertaining to watch, especially Misaki, a skater who belongs to the red gang, who I doubt anyone will hate since he basically summarizes the entirety of this show. Cool, short, fast, charming, and most importantly COOL!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation had a really interesting touch. A lot of the art looked really shiny and the action was really intense and well done. The soundtrack, ironically enough, isn't just rap or hip-hop, but mostly orchestral music. The OP would always get me pumped up for the show as it show cases all the characters doing their cool thing, while the ED closed each episode on a rather low note. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, K is a real blast to watch. It is just cool, nothing more, nothing less. If you want a good anime with cool action and cool characters look no further because K fits the bill. Besides that K doesn't really offer anything else besides entertainment material.",

Unfortunately, K falls largely into the latter. It is not bad, but it certainly did not live up to expectations. The central conflict is so poorly defined that it is difficult to determine what the different factions stand to gain by winning, or why they are even fighting in the first place. This may be one of those things that is better explained in the manga or the upcoming secondseason, but if that is the case then the first season of K looks even weaker as a result; a story that is intentionally vague because it is assumed that the audience is either familiar with the source material or is willing to stay for a second season does nothing but diminish any merit it has. While entertaining, K feels far too incomplete to warrant a second viewing and raises doubts as to the necessity of watching another season.",

            "content": "Where to begin with K: Project? As many of you already know, this anime has received a notable income of poor feedback, and it's share of rather fair reviews as well. However, I find a lot of these responses to be either biased or not written correctly, and I intend to give what I find to be a reasonable resolution to the actual quality of K.\r\nIn short? I enjoyed it. Despite some easily forgivable flaws, K: Project wasn't actually a terrible process. In some areas it could definitely sharpen its blades of mastery, but regardless of what other reviews are claiming, K is not asbad as it seems. In fact, if you're into a story like this, I would even recommend it to people. It certainly is worth a look; and I would by no means say the quality of this anime is \"shallow\" or \"poor\".\\n\\n\r\nIn length? Let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of K isn't a completely unseen topic, as it has been touched upon by some other anime. Despite the unoriginal sequence of events, K: Project has decent storytelling and it isn't by any means \"cliche;\" hell, it could even be pleasant to watch. Some astonishing moments have hit me in the story, but it could be difficult or confusing to follow if you haven't got time to read the Wikis for extra information.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the storytelling is rushed or delivered improperly; and some of the events flowed too quickly, leaving your head spinning if you don't rewatch a few moments of it. I'm not afraid to deny I have done my share of Wiki reading and revisiting old episodes to understand the plot, but I'm also just as happy to claim that it was never less enjoyable every time. In fact, understanding the plot could leave you enjoying the story more - but not everyone has time to read the Wikis like me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art of K: Project - especially towards the beginning - is astonishing. K's quality of visuals allured me into the plot more, even if the latter is a bit slow in the beginning. Throughout K: Project, we were given the beautiful detail of Tokyo's streets through well-placed fisheye cameras that were absorbed in light, depth, and amazing style, as well as astounding shots of fire, ice, and electricity that the Clans in this anime used. In K, I never found myself dissatisfied with the well-polished touch-ups to glare, lighting, or use of tints, despite what others are saying.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, I have to mention slight animation failures towards the ending episodes where several characters' seem to have several ill-proportioned limbs or awkwardly big eyes, but the overall delivery of the style is more than enough to make up for this flaw. If the story alone doesn't entertain you, then the art should be plenty to let you watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of other opinions I've seen on this, K: Project has given us memorable music quality, especially through multiple combat sequences and opening shots. In particular, I listen to many of these soundtracks to this day - and the impact of some of these still lingers there. The tracks were original, from what I've seen, and I haven't experienced anything close to the likes of some of these moments since I've been watching anime - and K: Project was the second anime I ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the other hand, I have to rate this section as a \"9\" because more than just two of the tracks were boring, forgettable, and had no flowing rhythm. That being said, some of these soundtracks are so poor to the point I've forgotten some of them entirely. In adjustment to this, there were plenty of good songs to choose from.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the opening and ending songs were nothing special, in my taste, and they never change in the first season - and I did have to skip through the opening a few times to ignore this choice of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI love K's characters, I really do - but this anime, for just 13 quick episodes and rather rushed plot, has such an overabundance on characters and side-characters that it took me over three times of watching this anime to even remember half of them. In specific, SCEPTER 4, which has many branches of military and command, have a certain section known as the \"Swordsmen\" that consist of up to 8 independent characters, and almost none of them had screen time or significant development.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main characters - Yashiro, Kuroh, and Neko - were somewhat enjoyable as the story started, but none of them were talked about progressively throughout the story and little was known about Kuroh or Neko's childhood. Yashiro, on the other hand, was given an episode, I believe, to focus on his history, but this may be due to the plot significance of his story.\\n\\n\r\nLess-important characters, primarily focusing on HOMRA's and SCEPTER 4's supporting cast, were scarcely touched upon at all, although multiple links of characters from both appeared to have some connection with each other. Yata Misaki and Fushimi Saruhiko are the two notable exceptions of this and despite that fact, they are still required to be read about on the wiki to even know where they originated.\\n\\n\r\nEven less memorable characters - the school characters, respectively - are present through K: Project. To this day I don't remember what any of the schoolgirls' names are, and they're all rather transparent and cliche, and despite their forced roles in the story, aren't plot-critical and could have been left out altogether.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nK: Project, through it's visuals and enticing character design, was a formidable experience for me. I would rate it as an \"8\" here because I never found myself sitting through an uncomfortable or boring moment in this anime, although I have read speculations on this. If the characters are read about on other resources, a few exceptions are rather developed and interesting, and some characters like Fushimi Saruhiko, as I mentioned before, are relatable and layered.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, despite the flaws, is entertaining to watch in co-existence with its well-placed music and unforgettable animation. K: Project was, in particular, enjoyable and humorous in some areas, and some of the moments could have been considered shady or mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nShould you give K: Project a try? I would certainly hope so. While the story may be one of the worst things here, it also has other areas of expertise that make up for this. Action-packed areas will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and some of the soundtracks will be in your memory undeniably. I would give this anime such a high rating because K is by no means a rushed or sloppy anime, and even if you don't like it after reading my thoughts on it, at least you could say you tried. Hell, even tell me what you thought of it if I inspired any of you border-edges to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you K: Project because it is a horribly underrated, uncredited anime that is definitely worth a look!",

Let's go.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSo, yeah. They are a lot of mixed opinions about the plot and the story, how confusing and insufficient it can get. It's possibly the most major reason as to why this anime is poorly reviewed in the first place. I won't really delve into the \"holes\" of the storyline, as a lot of the existing reviews seem to do that well. The idea behind the story itself is extremely creative, with the sevendifferent powers with various characteristics (mischievous, calm, just, etc.) overruling the land of Japan. Although during its execution, there were some parts that were missed. However, it does have a fulfilling outline which will keep you interested throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFabulous, that's all I can say. The overlay gradients that were applied onto specific scenes of the anime was spectacular and eye pleasing, though due to the soaking saturation of those filters, it can get overbearing sometimes. But it only appears in \"iconic\" scenes that are memorable. The character designs itself are, of course, made well \u2014 with each character's personalities reflecting on their atmosphere and appearance. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I am being subjective here. But I do really love the soundtracks of K, although some might argue that it is simply mediocre. Personally, I loved it, and you wouldn't believe how many times I had that melancholic nostalgic feeling when I listened to the OSTs. I'm sure many of you who have watched anime \u2014 or any series at all \u2014 over the years will understanding the emotion I'm feeling. It has that orchestra-like undertone/accompaniment to it, which some moreover modern melodies that mix in perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a seven since no characters were particularly distasteful, none struck my nerve because of its inability to develop. The character development were fairly there, just not extremely evident the first time I watched it. Nevertheless, I did enjoy how the candid relationships of each kings unfolded, and how exactly they affected the whole entire storyline of seizing power to rule a \"peaceful\" land.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. I loved it. Did you? I never got bored of the series, actually, when I viewed it for the second time, I finished it in 3 days. (Maybe I have no life.) Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that it is entertaining, its medium-pace, aesthetics and such. Yes, it DOES get confusing sometimes, but hey, that's how lores normally are. Plus, finding out those little lores throughout the anime can feel rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGo for it. You're not paying to see the anime (perhaps except for your time), you have nothing to lose! This anime IS all or nothing, but it doesn't hurt to try.",

Anyway i gave it an honest shot and completely fell in love with the way this anime looks, it's a bit differnt from other animes but when you get used to it you'l love it. \r\nThe story is good in the baseline, with that i mean the thoguht of kings, gangs and stuff is really cool. I got a really cool feeling almost like chills when seeing the reds, it kinda felt like real life in an suburan area. The story is also very originalwich i respect. It's not like other animes. But what i didn't like is how many episodes you were stuck watching Isana proceed with his day to day activities. I felt like some episodes were just fillers in an 12 epsiode anime, wich is really uneccesary. They should have just made one season with all the episodes in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art i completely loved, it just looks so clean and shiny. I do get why some people would think it looks bad because sometimes i felt like it looks to good. As if i was watching some shiny dream that was missing alot of details. This didn't bother that much because i still loved it. It was a while ago i watched it and still i miss this type of artstyle. Again really original you've never seen before.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was the only thing i didnt love, i feel like the company producing this anime just fell short there. I was kinda annoyed with Isana's voice acting. Although if you're not that picky im sure you wont be bothered. ><\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime is defiantly some of the best/coolest iv'e ever seen in an anime. I just compltely love The red king and his humbleness. The characthers are all very developed and thought over, you can kinda sense some insights from the real world with the Class diffrences. The reds are kind of \"scums\" and i belive this is inspired by the real world. And racism (sry for getting deep on yall)\\n\\n\r\nOverall i really enjoyed watching this anime, i toatally recommend this anime to all you anime fans out there. This anime toatally deserves some recognition and fame. I highly doubt this can become a classics because it just kinda falls short with the sound. And i do actually understand some of the cristism it has been getting because it's a bit diffrent and fast paced. Sometimes you'l might get lost in whats happening. (maybe just me thats stupid).\\n\\n\r\ntyty <3\\n\\n",

It's such a hilarious and amazing mix of any possible genre, scheme, and theme, that you just have to laugh at it. No-one can possibly take this anime seriously, and I doubt its producers did. It contains everything: a whole spectre of personalities, bishounens, cat-girls, Lolita-girls, beautiful, well equipped and deadly intelligent women, samurai with their swords, Japanese art and culture, advanced technology, school-life, gangs and organizations struggles, superpowers, even immortals - and in just13 episodes! Against that all, I daresay, the plot itself is of a lesser importance.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, it's a very good anime, with fine soundtrack and superb art/animation. I also found seiyuu did a great work - especially Mamoru Miyano, whom I normally don't admire, but generally I felt really positive about most of the cast. (To tell the truth, I decided to watch \"K\" only because of seiyuu ^^) I'm definitely going to watch the movie, as well as the second season!\\n",

            "content": "K is sometimes difficult to dissect. On first glance, it looks like it has the potential to be a masterpiece. At the same time, when you really get down to it, it's nothing exceptional. K is overall a decent series and it has its strong suits, but it's certainly not worth your time if you're looking for a great series to pick up and here's why.\r\nWhat first drew me to K was the background of the story. The series is set in a futuristic world where Japan is essentially dominated by the 7 kings of color. Each of the kings has a different power accordingto their colors. For all intents and purposes, their superiority over the rest of humanity is absolute. On top of that, they're assisted by their clansman, who essentially pledge their loyalty to the kings in exchange for superhuman powers. The balance of power is carefully maintained until story is set in motion by a murder case. A man who self-identified as the Colorless King shot one of the Red King's clansmen, and the entire thing was captured on the camera that clansman was carrying. It just so happens that the supposed Colorless King looks exactly like the main character, who's an oblivious and sociable high school student living in school. And the search is on for this killer.\\n\\n\r\nSo far so good. What went wrong then? Well, nothing went wrong, so to speak. It was just that the plot unfolded at a pace so slow, people were literally asking \"so what exactly happened in this episode\" on the discussion boards. A typical episode features at most 3-5 minutes of actual plot explanation and the rest is devoted to character interaction and the occasional battles. To their credit, the animation quality is great. I liked the art style and every action was incredibly smooth. The battles themselves were quite entertaining and you can clearly tell they weren't trying to cut corners there, but quite frankly, the plot was simply lacking. It started with some momentum in the beginning, then dropped off a cliff for at least 2/3 of the season, then picked up again in the last 2-3 episodes. That's something you'd expect from a fan service series -- not K, which clearly strives to play itself as a serious piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nK is a weak series for another reason. Instead of being plot-driven, it's mainly character-driven. In place of plot, you have a number of characters with strong and some would say memorable personalities that draw the audience in. The problem is that K doesn't even try to ease the audience in with the characters. Although you find out a great deal about each major character over the course of the series, it's mostly 30-second scenes here or there that make up for scattered pieces of information. Take Fushimi, who is the third in command of Blue King's clan. Although we're shown that he was originally a subordinate of the Red King, we end up never finding out just why it is that he decided to switch sides. Perhaps the directors of K want the audience to fill in the gaps, but it feels quite insulting to the audience who has no idea what the full history is behind most of the characters. There is a line between trying to be subtle and not really explaining anything. K's crossed the line just too many times. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I dislike the analogy but K feels just like Guilty Crown. It looks great from the outside, but when you look closer, you can see that it has somewhat of a hollow core. The promise is there. It's just that potential isn't enough to make a series great. Although I personally enjoyed watching most of the cast interact and doing whatever they do, when I got to ep. 13, the ending felt bland and somewhat anticlimactic even. And the glaring plot holes here and there make it hard for me to fully recommend this series. Bottom line is, if you're not totally into plot, love flashy animations, and just want to watch cool character say and do cool things, K is something you'd enjoy a whole lot. If you demand serious plot depth on top of all that, though, kindly move on.",

In my surprised, it didn't become boring perhaps it was very good. The OP and ED were amusing and well done too. I regretted that I didn't watch this before but its okay. So here is my review to the season 1 itself only, I won't include the season 2 because I have a different impression on that one or should I say, I have a higherimpression in that one.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10: At first, I was very confused because a lot of events happened but when I continued watching, I understand the flow of events. The flow of events were well-executed and the plot was amazing. This anime made me crazy because I was really thinking of who is the real antagonist. As an anime enthusiast, I always anticipating the next event or sometimes the plot however, in this one, I always wrong with my prediction. A lot of plot twist and you will be saying \" What the hell happened?\" and \" I really didn't expect that\". Also, a lot of friendship here and action. I really like the fighting scenes and the chronology of events is also well-done. So, to summarize it all, the story is really great.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 10: The art and graphics in this anime is too good. I am not fun of OP and ED but I will give an exception here because I really like it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10: All characters are well developed.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this anime is very good and one of my favorite. \\n",

It was ranked around #200 on MAL before episode 1 even came out.\r\nBut by episode 1 or even 2, people were complaining that it was horrible with no plot and just pretty art. Some were calling it the next Guilty Crown.\r\nFirst episode of K and we have so much stuff happening and not a lot of explaining. While I love K, I do admit that is what threw a lot of people off.K throws its audience right in the middle of things andexpects us to quickly understand the situation. It plays out like we know the king system and all the characters when really we don't...or at least not yet.\\n\\n\r\nI think the real problem with K is that it had to many characters introduced and some many events happening, but not enough episodes to make it work. K would of worked better if it was a 24 episode anime. Then it would have time for character development and to be able to stretch out so many events without making it look like it is trying to stuff it all in.\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that K would be better if the manga and light novels of K were released a year before the anime aired instead of the same year. It would of gave people time to understand K's world and basic background.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a few faults in K, I love the anime because of the characters (especially team Homra). K has characters you find yourself fallling in love with.To be honest the writers could change the plot and make it an anime just about Homra (like K~Memory of REd) and I would be okay with that. The art/animation of K is just beautiful. You can really see that the animators worked hard on K.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give K : 9",

It adds so much to the plot and it makes it all the more intriguing. \\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nNow, the opening isn't one of my favorites, but it does fit perfectly. The music they use adds to the mood of the scenes, and makes it all the more intense. The soundtrack is perfect for this show.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\ni think the character development is great, honestly. Mind you, it's a thirteen episode series, so in the room there was for development, it fit it quite well. The characters are what made me love the show, they are the core. I loved every single one of the characters so so so so much, and I had SOO MANY SHIPS AND JUST LIKE, K. (sucky pun intended.) Anyway, I don't think I dislike one character since they played there roles so well. I have a few favorites, but my overall love for all of them is crazy. Their background stories, their current personalities, is all so great.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI binge watched K, and I don't regret a single moment of it. It was all totally worth it. There was moments where I was at the edge of my bed and moments when I wanted to scream my lungs out. I enjoyed it so so much.\\n\r\nOverall: 10000000\\n\r\nObviously, K has it's flaws, every anime does, but I didn't think they were big enough to rate this anime any less than a masterpiece. Now, I cannot promise you that you will love this anime as much as I did, but what I can tell you is, don't overlook this series when it could turn out to be one of your favorites. As they say, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\"\\n\r\n(I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO MAKE THIS REVIEW MATURE OKAY, I WAS HOLDING BACK ON TYPING IN CAPS AND BREAKING MY NUMBERS FOR THE RATING BUT I JUST LOVED THIS SERIES SO MUCH OKAY BU- \"eh hem\" *clears throat* please take my review, every other positive review, & K into consideration, thank you very much. Enjoy your day. :)\\n",

            "content": "Opinions are mixed when it comes to rating K, some praise its' greatness while others point out its' lackluster sides. To me, K is an anime experience highly dependent on how you precieve it. \r\nK, a mystery/superpowers anime that revolves around the death of a ceratin person. As the anime progresses, the mysterious murder starts to unfold its' secrets while more information gets revelaed about the world of K, of its' kings and of a history long forgotten.\r\nTo me, K was more of a ''short novel''. It is too short to tell you about its' world, but does a good job at telling you anenjoyable short story that would motitivate you to learn about its' world in the future. The art and voice are both high quality and fancy to say the least. The story is also enjoyable and well-written.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything to be desired, it is more complexity.. more answers. The anime ended without giving away too much. However is it only was 13 episodes, I saw it as a mere short story about a certain mystery murder case, a short story that tells you about its' world as 2nd priority, therefore leaving character progression/world develpoment behind as they could be considered a bit lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a great anime that I enjoyed. I would give it an 8 due to the way I precieved it. A high quality short story that does open a new world for you.. but doesn't give you much more. \\n\\n\r\nPS. One of the main reasons for the low scores K is getting, is because the anime feels unfinished if you are to consider it... well, as an anime. Alot of things are un-answered, character progression is lackluster due to the anime being only 13 episodes and was too focused on the main storyline which was the deathcase. To me, it felt like it deserved an 8 because of the hope... that perhaps a future season will clear everything up.",

I don't really know why people think this is terrible like i could say that it might need some improvement on some parts but it was overall really AMAZING and rather enjoyable. It was the only one that made me look forward to every week and as soon as I got home I would go straight to watch it and look forward to next week. Oh yeah sorry ifi give you any spoilers because I sometimes I don't know what I type.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 give or take it was an amazing plot overall to me quite unique well most at least. Like it goes slowly at first for like the first few episode but it picks up after sometime and gets you really excited on what will happen. Like i could say it could be longer and that might've made it better but like for those who haven't seen the last few episodes it really makes up for it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 the art was just plain OMG BEAUTIFUL! like everything was well drawn it's not like most you've ever seen!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 the sound was amazing it really matched well with everything in my opinion. It totally went well with the atmosphere and scenes and makes everything better for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 AMAZING LOVED THEM ALL! They're all different and rather lovable. Even if people say that the main got weak character development he actually got some by the last few eps. The cast was beautiful and they were all lovable that it would bring you to tears if one of them died. Even if people didn't like the main character I found them all wonderful they had their own share of good and bad traits and sometimes you just wanna laugh or cry. They truly bring emotion into the story and there just really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 I enjoyed it a lot with everything it's the only anime i kept looking forward to every episode every week. The plot could just use a tiny bit of something but otherwise it was great! Sound and Art are definitely worth listening and Seeing and Characters were just all awesome in there own way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 well this is my opinion and it's a total worth see. It may not look interesting or slightly less than what you expected at first but later it gets a lot more interesting I promise.",

            "content": "The anime is certainly one of my favourites. It has an intriguing and unique idea to it, something that I've never seen used before. \r\nThe story is fantastic, but doesn't quite reach the 10. Although the second season is close to being aired, as well as the movie now being available, they could have done much more with the story of the first season. It can also be rather confusing, to those who don't have a full understanding of the characters' reasoning as well as abilities by the end of the series.\r\nThe art is stunning, as well as the animation. The amount of detail thatgoes into the scenery as well as the characters themselves and the effects is simply amazing. The scenery, especially. The art is more than satisfactory and suits the story line as well as the base idea of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also fantastic - more specifically, the voices. This anime has both fantastic Japanese and English versions, and I have personally not found much anime like that. People often complain about dubs not being good, or not suiting the characters, but this anime is definitely an exception in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovely. I love most of them, I really do, and some of the character development that goes on throughout the series, despite being quite subtle, is really nice. The only thing that doesn't give this the 10 is one or two of them who in, my own opinion, let the series down.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this immensely. I still do, as it is a very re-watchable anime for me. It just makes me sad that the fanbase isn't very big - it deserves so many more views and so much more attention than it currently gets. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously. If you haven't already, give this anime a chance and watch it.",

            "content": "I don't have any major criticisms for K. Nothing about it comes off as a dealbreaker or particularly obnoxious aspect.\r\nThat said, it isn't without problems. The biggest one is that it has such a large, branching story and so many characters but it's still only thirteen episodes. Which makes the pacing feel overly fast and leaves some things less detailed than they could be. \r\nThat of course hurts the characters a bit. There are a ton of characters in K, and none of them are especially well characterized. Partially because they all have to share the thirteen episodes of screentime, but also just because thisanime isn't great at fleshing them out. They mostly have only a few traits and aren't that complex. Even the ones we see more of like Shiro and Kurou.\\n\\n\r\nI should point out that I don't think they're bad characters either. In fact, I like most of them. Their personalities are simple, but well defined. Almost everyone has a good balance of postive and negative characteristics, which I look for as a sign of good characters. They have sensible arcs if they have any, and their conflicts are compelling. Probably the strongest point of the anime story-wise. So let's call the cast alright on balance. I hate Neko though, and the villain is very one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nQuite a lot of the time this show has is spent on character scenes. And most of the rest of it on fights. It has a high budget with very nice animation and the fight scenes are fun.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fun in general, is what I'm trying to get at. I'll freely admit that it isn't the deepest thing in the entire world, and the structure is flawed. But I do enjoy it a lot. It's silly, and it does a good job keeping the tone light. It doesn't handle anything particularly dark and the execution softens its content further. And like I said, I like almost all the characters. For me that's enough. It's always good to watch something just for fun now and again, and there are much worse written anime than this anyway.",

            "content": "Shows with a gratuitous amount of detail within the development of the story and the development of multiple characters are usually standard fare within the anime medium. However, it\u2019s all too common that the run time for most of those shows are usually cut to a single thirteen-episode season. It\u2019s not impossible to tell the full story at a satisfactory level with limited run time. However, most writers run out of time and take shortcuts, which leave most of the audience disappointed. Unfortunately, when there\u2019s too much of a focus on exposition to move the plot more quickly, it\u2019s less likely to resonate with theviewer. K is a show with only twelve episodes (so far anyway), too many characters to develop, and a story that should require a lot of exposition. Thankfully, the writers managed to handle all the hurdles very well, putting together a resonating and action-packed show that\u2019s so much fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Yashiro Isana is a seemingly normal and free-spirited high school boy who usually spends his time being out of the roof of the school and sometimes leaving the school without permission. However, his \u201cnormal\u201d life is turned upside down when a video of him murdering someone and calling himself \u201cthe colorless king\u201d surfaces. Despite not having any recollection of the video, the Red Clan, Blue Clan, and Kuro (who\u2019s mission is to hunt down the Colorless King and slay him if he turns out to be evil) are all after him. Yashiro, now having to find a way to prove his innocence and get to the bottom of the murder, is bound to learn much more about the Clans that are after him, why he was supposedly framed, and who he actually is.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes more than three episodes to really make sense of everything that\u2019s happening and why. It get\u2019s explained later on that there are factions in the city that Yashiro resides in; the most notable in this show are HOMRA (The Red Clan) and SCEPTER 4 (The Blue Clan). Each of these Clans have their own unique power, such as The Red Clan\u2019s power manipulate fire. The reason why HOMRA, which operates with a street gang mentality, wants him dead is because the person that was killed was one of their members. SCEPTER 4, which operates more like a police force, are after Yashiro for justice and to protect the community from future harm. Both Clans have also been at odds with each other for generations, as there are always fights that break out between the two in broad daylight. Adding more insult to injury, a former member of the Red Clan caused more tension between the two by joining forces with the Blue Clan. There are at least three significant characters, including the kings of both Clans, that get an ample amount of development.\\n\\n\r\nNobody\u2019s motivations feel contrived and everything is genuine, from Mikoto\u2019s (The Red King) passion for wanting to avenge his fellow comrade to Seri\u2019s (third in-command of SCEPTER 4) tight friendship with Izumo (second in-command of HOMRA). The only problem is that there seems to be more to explore and it\u2019s possible that once the second season is produced, there will be more to elaborate. However, for one season, it was satisfactory enough.\\n\\n\r\nShiro\u2019s story is harder to get into without spoiling major plot points that take up about half of the enjoyment factor. All that can be said is that the mystery of him being the \u201cColorless King\u201d is a shadow that is cast upon him. All the more complicated is that Kuro, a no-nonsense samurai, is hell-bent on killing him as part of his mission. However, he decides to keep an eye on Shiro to give him a benefit of a doubt and give him the opportunity to prove his innocence.\\n\\n\r\nShiro is also followed along by a cat that can turn into a beautiful girl, named Neko. She has the power to manipulate people\u2019s senses and [insert spoiler here]. For a reason explained later in the series, Neko has an undying love for Shiro and is always trying to protect Shiro because he is her owner (y\u2019know\u2026because she\u2019s a cat\u2026yeah). Neko may be the only character that will rub the audience the wrong way because, in the grand scheme of things, she is basically playing the part as Shiro\u2019s submissive pet and she (who is also always naked) is supermodel pretty. The otaku\u2019s will probably love her though.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one theme that will resonate with the viewer, more than anything, is selflessness. Again, that can\u2019t even be elaborated enough because of spoilers. The plot builds up very nicely by the time the climax arrives. The ending pretty much set the show to new heights from a show that was fun to watch from an action-thriller standpoint to practically emulating the theme of Jesus Christ\u2019s crucifixion and everything that led up to it and afterwards. Yes, that may be a very bold statement to make but with an ending that was executed the way this was executed, there had to be theme in mind, stating that everyone should stop fighting and be more Christ-like. That\u2019s not to say that this is for Christians, but it\u2019s a universal lesson that everyone can and should get behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, handled by Studio GoHands, is breathtaking. All fight scenes, in particular, are animated fluidly with a lot of stylistic emphasis on the powers that the different clans use. Rarely are corners cut, nor are the character movements stagnant. The art design for the characters seem very plain to an extent because there seems to be minimal variation on the faces. The hair and eye colors and designs are nice as well of the clothes. However, the art as a whole is pleasing to the eye with the color scheme and detail that allows the characters to blend into the lovingly rendered backgrounds. CG also mixes in so well that it\u2019s not even that noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also spot on with a bunch a hip hop tracks and heavy metal riffs used appropriately to get the audience pumped up for another fight that\u2019s about to go down. The soundtrack has a diverse collection of hip-hop, rock, and house music to fit in with the technological setting of K, with every track used effectively without necessarily standing out. The English dub is also performed well across the board. Special praise goes out to Sam Riegal (Yashiro), Todd Haberkorn (Izumo), and Keith Silverstein (Mikoto: The Red King) for their standout performances. The script tends to stumble from time to time, especially when an actor is saying a long line or has to speak fast to match lip flaps. It\u2019s probably not surprising when there\u2019s so much dialogue in this show that has to be adapted. Thankfully, awkward line delivery is minimal.\\n\\n\r\nK manages to fill in all the right holes in a short amount of time with perfect pacing, an engaging trill of a story, and an ending that captures the spirit of altruism. There was apparently a movie that was released back in July and there will be a second season coming sometime in 2015. All that is great to know because, despite already having a satisfying ending, K has so much more to offer and explore in the setting. This is an action thriller for the masses that should not be missed.",

            "content": "Ok, where do I even begin with this anime. Absolutely phenomenal! A true work of art!! A hidden gem that is sadly looked over by many! \r\nLet's talk about story.\r\nSure the anime jumps right into it and the timing is a little bit wonky, but that shouldn't be an excuse to let this anime go. It was enjoyable to put the pieces together to see what was going on (Note that i did not read the summery so i went in purely out of curiosity and i regret nothing!). The more you dive deeper into the show, the more things to come into to playand the more things come to light of. The story is simple and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nNow about Art.\\n\r\nLet me say one thing clear, the art is magnificent! I mean really an art work! Whoever worked on the art really deserves a bonus on their pay and then some because the amount of detail that goes into art, the characters, the background is simply stunning. \\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\r\nMy. Favorite. Soundtrack. Of. All. Time. I play this soundtrack when i drive, when i do homework, when it's quiet at my job. Its so relaxing, it's so chill, hell sometimes I play this when there's guests and I need some chill background music. This soundtrack (just like the whole series) is amazing!! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nAh, yes, my favorite part. Characters. Let me just say the characters are BEAUTIFUL!! Each to their own characteristics, hell, even the background characters, HAD A PERSONALITY! From Kuroh, Neko and Shiro, to Homra, to SCEPTER 4, they were all simply amazing! Sure some may say they were drawn for fan service (not gonna lie they look ridiculously attractive) but that's not what got me attached. What really got me was how they were portrayed; strong willed leaders and their loyal followers, friendships being made and dedication for their loved ones. The emotions that the voice actors AND the anime portrayed was simply magnificent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\r\nWatched 7 times by myself. Watched it 5 times with my best friend. Got her hooked. We stayed till 7 am to re-watch it. Yeah, that's how great it is. I laughed and i cried. And it wasn't that wee little tear or the small sniffling. Oh no, it was a full on waterworks, my face was wet, snot was coming out of my nose, i was shouting at the T.V., cheering the characters on. A whole roller coaster of emotions i go through and every time i watch it, it's just like my first time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? \\n\\n\r\n100000000 out 10 would recommend. If anyone were to ask me what my all time favorite anime would be? It would be this. Seriously give it a try. I love this anime with all of my heart. Each character i love (well most of em) but their character build is great, dynamics are great! I could go ON AND ON about this anime if someone were to mention it in a mile radius! Yes that's how good it is. Yes! I recommend it! Dont sleep on this show, cause it's just-  its fantastic.",

On the other hand we have BLues which is like pollice anime without hunor. Actually the Blue reminded all the time by police on Gintama(other  anime)  which further won me.  The Reishi is verygood, Ruko and Anna are so sweet. Juste after 1st episode the anime has so much to tell us there is no way you can become boring. \\n\\n\r\nIf you hesitate whether to watch or continue to watch this anime just watching  one more episode and I guarantee you'll find something to capture your attention!",

            "content": "\"No blood! No bone! No ash!\" -  HOMRA [K Project]\r\nThat's the best quote from the anime and the most memorable. I decided to watch this anime when I was watching random videos on YouTube x) And it caught my attention.\r\nStory: In all honesty, even though I was quite interested in the first episode, I kind of got bored afterwards. Don't take it the wrong way though, because it's actually a pretty good anime. Trying to find the murderer of an old friend is basically the whole entire point of the plot line; not to mention seven Gods that posses special powers with a clansmanthat follows their orders. Despite  the fact that the story goes slow at times, there are those good and enjoyable moments that makes up for it. Besides, there's some action that grabs your attention as well.\\n\r\nArt: The animation is probably the best attribute of K Project. In fact, it's one of the best art style that I've seen so far. The colors, the light, the shading; all of it was just outstanding. Put it all together and it makes a beautiful setting of the show.\\n\r\nSound: The music was something that I've quite enjoyed as well. Though, I do wish that they could've added an intense or catchy music when it got to the action scenes, because they just played a smooth sound to it when things got serious, that way the viewers can get more into it. But either way, it won't bother you as much.\\n\r\nCharacter: I have to admit that I wasn't really fond of the protagonist, since he was too carefree and too dependable on his two companions. But he did got more serious and acted like a leader later in the show. The other characters were quite likable since they had their own unique personalities and their little charm that everyone knows of. I also like the HOMRA group, since they acted more like a family than the others. Mikoto, Anna, and Misaki were my favorite characters amongst all the others; just saying ;P\\n\r\nOverall, K Project was a pretty good anime with very few bad points. Even though it will grab your attention of the show slowly, you'll end up liking it anyways. The ending was truly beautiful and one of the best endings I've seen in all animes. I will tell you that it made me cry; so look forward to the finale of the show :)",

Dragon Ball Z?  \"This planet will blow up in five minutes!\" (10 episodes later)\r\nThe anime has a great story to it, revealing a little info about each character as the anime progresses.  The mix in of a little humor and with crazy ass action scenes is perfect.  It's not just non stop action, it has a lot of discussion, explaining, etc.  And the characters all seemto have different personalities.  I've ran across plenty of people who could match the description of all of the personalities in this anime and I did happen to catch my self getting lost in it several times.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I give the Story a \"9\" rating is because they end the first season early.  Which of course is a stupid reason to rate something lower, because of personal feelings I mean.  It's because by the time you get to the end, you are just like wtf!?  And you want to see more, you crave it like a cig when you've smoked your last one on a cold winter day with too much snow to get to a place to get some. lol\\n\\n\r\nNone the less.

This is the reason why: (1) Like many people are saying, and I do agree with them, the story lacked character development and it felt scattered about the place. I was just here observing various events unfolding, having absolutely no idea what was going on. I was like, \"Oh, so this is happening and that is happening. Oh look, that's happening and it's so strange. Now what's happening? Is this really happening? Why isn't something more beneficial tot he plot happening?  Okay, I see...well let me just watch and wait... and hope.\" I must say, though, that it does have an interesting idea to the plot, but a story not very well told/portrayed, so I'd say it's fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. I like it a lot. That guy with the skateboard had a scene while riding where it looked like someone was videoing him through a fish-eye lens camera. Just as you would video someone skateboarding in a stunt video. Makes it feel urban. Some of the fight scenes were very nice too especially with that Kurou guy that had the sword. As for the sound, I must say that I love the urban atmospheric feel of the soundtrack. There were several of them that sounded really nice so i downloaded the anime's OST. I'm not a big fan of the opening and ending, but the OST is really nice, as I've said.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't care for the main character nor the cat-girl that was with him. I really liked that Kurou guy though and I was interested in the kings (Red & Blue). I wanted to know more about them, but like as mentioned before, there was a big lack of character development. Even though it was somewhat slow, I can say I enjoyed this anime and it was good over all so I gave it just that rating. Since it wasn't below 7 I look forward to watching the sequels and hope that it gets better from there on.",

I returned to it to give it another shot and was pleased I gave it another go.\r\n(I am naturally a high marker and I enjoy most anime I watch but this is defiantly in my top 5).\r\nStory: 7: This is the weakest section although it is still really good. The concept of the anime is brilliant, I love the fact that there are 7 clans and each have there own different goals and ways ofdoing things. I also like the fact that they show you the different stories from each of the main clans shown in this season (red, blue, silver, colorless and maybe gold although gold and colorless was more briefly shown). However, the background information was not given straight away so it took a while to understand what was going on. It was also too fast paced.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10: Nothing much to say other than watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10: Both the dub and sub voice actors are well done. The music used is very distinct from other animes and fit in with the anime incredibly well. Music is used in the right places.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8: The characters were interesting however, there was only any significant character development from the red clan HOMRA. The blue clan did not get character development and the protagonist from the silver clan barely got any proper development until the end of the season and even that was brief. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9: Basically it was really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9: I gave it a 9 because I really really like the anime, however, it still needed improvements for it to be a 10.",

I found myself confused and had no idea how the world in this anime functioned, plus, if I'm not immediately hooked I can't bring myself to forcefully watch something.  That being said, I continued to see the anime K pop up everywhere and the art did appeal to me, so I thought I would give it a second chance.  I'm so glad I did.\r\nThe first few episodes are a bit confusing because you are thrown into this world where people have these powers and theirare individuals referred to as \"kings\" but you have no idea how it all connects and who these random people are.  However, do not give up like I originally did.  The anime does explain it all, though you have to give it some time.\\n\\n\r\nK's story itself wasn't amazing but it wasn't necessarily weak.  The idea is interesting and the hunt for a particular king, The Colorless King, is what keeps you hooked.  That and the art and action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of K was the art.  It's vibrant and I fell in love with the different action sequences and how each character has their own fighting style.\\n\\n\r\nThough, if you're one who loves characters and their development I must warn you now, the characters are kinda mehhh.  You like them, theer are some unique relationships between a few, but for some reason you can't get connected to them.  I found them likable, but I didn't really care about them at the same time.  That may be because the anime is so short (13 episodes) or maybe they are the type of characters you grow to love with more seasons.  I can't really tell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed K and the story it told.  The characters may not have tugged on my heartstrings but the art and action definitely kept me entertained.",

As for the actual story, I personally do not think it's a good anime, but I also don't think it's bad either. It does have a lot of things going on, so you need to really pay attention if you want to understand anything. \r\nStory : 10/10\r\nNeko is basically there for the fanservice. However, she does have a role in the plot, but not a huge one, depending on how you look at it. \r\nThe first 5 or 6 episodes are pretty slow, and can be hard getting into, but ithas gotten better and I will admit that I am legitly interested in it now. They did try too hard by putting in too many different things in at once, so.. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it's worth checking out, just know that the plot doesn't really pick up until like around episode 5 or 6, and it starts to get better, but remember, you have to really pay attention or you'll be lost.\\n",

            "content": "I sure am late with reviewing one of my favourite Anime just now, but nevermind that.\r\nI also know that this show got pretty low scores (and that's okay) or that it's spoken badly about but I'll try to show another side of this show.\r\nNote: I have rewatched this show 16 times, so I can't deny spoiler at all. I'll try my best. \r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nSimply: Kings, Clans, Superpowers and historical regard. Sounds pretty average, but it isn't at all.\r\nThe main Story of the Anime takes place in Shizume Town, it'd be a bit too confusing to talk about the Manga scenery.\r\nThe Story follows a young boynamed Isana Yashiro who's chased by weird looking man for no reason - actually, it has a reason.\\n\r\nI won't tell anymore about the main plot for now, but I will talk a bit about the things that happened afterwards.\\n\r\nJust a short time after Yashiro was chased by HOMRA, the Third and Red Clan, also Scepter 4, the Fourth and Blue Clan and lately the Second and Golden Clan start engaging into the action.\\n\r\nK does may seem boring at the start, but with the actions of the other Clans more things, that are supposed to help understanding the storyline get exciting.\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes of fighting between the rivals HOMRA and Scepter 4, their Kings Suoh Mikoto and Munakata Reisi finally are about to show their real power.\\n\r\nWell, too many information already, but what the hell is a Synopsis.\\n\r\nI just have to say about the Story: besides one other show it's the greatest Story I've ever seen. I like historical references and everything starts with World War II. It also takes other references (for example the Sword of Damocles), the Kings and their Vessels or the Characteristic of a 'real' King like we know it from history class.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nK's Animation is more than flawless in my opinion. I like the bright colours whose represent their King's image perfectly, also the daker, dusty colours when Flashbacks are shown. The Animation when it comes to fighting scenes (in the first Season) are also pretty good, just as the Character Design itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nSuoh Mikoto's OST will probably be my favourite OST ever. I can't deny that I don't shed any tears while listening to it, GoRa did a great job with making an OST a perfect fit for various characters/situations. I'm often listening to the full Soundtrack because it helps me calming down and I made good memories with K. I can't complain about the Character Songs, every single one suits their Character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nK offers a huge selection of different Characters. Surely we got the stereotypes in there, but it didn't bother me lots.\\n\r\nMost of the Clansmen from different Clans treat their enemies in a special way and they seem to have a favourite enemy in other Clans.\\n\r\nFor example, we've got the Tsundere and forever-virgin (thanks fandom) Yata Misaki, who's best enemy/friend is the master of provoking, Saruhiko Fushimi. Neither of them could forget about each other and I'm sure they never will. One of my #3 OTP's though.\\n\r\nWe've got the Red's Vessel Kusanagi Izumo and the Blue's Vessel Awashima Seri, who're having a pretty lovely, but secret relationship.\\n\r\nLater on we're getting a psychotic King, we've got a King like it's written in history books, a King that fights for justice, a King that lives for his country and is feared by everyone and a King who hasn't been able to forget about the last 90 years.\\n\r\nEvery Character has their own backstory (for more information I would recommend the Manga-Series), every Character is holding a big burden, every Character has some characteristic potentional which is making them outstanding.\\n\r\nOkay, you may get a bit confused by all those S4 and HOMRA boys, but it'll work out.\\n\r\nTime to talk about my favourite Character!\\n\r\nSuoh Mikoto is a King for himself. He doesn't care about his burdens, his reputation, about his obligations as a King. He never wanted to be a King but he's trying to make the best out of it. Of course he's stubborn and maybe a bit demanding, he's also using violence which isn't okay for everyone else but HOMRA but he's just doing all of it for one reason.\\n\r\nThe only reason he's still standing is his Clan, and his Clan only. He would give his life to every of his Clansmen if they would be in danger. It all has a reason and his reason is simply pain, on the other hand revenge. \\n\r\nMikoto lost his Aid and former Vessel just because some other King found it funny, it's obvious that his character changed drastically.\\n\r\nFrom the K - Memories of Red Manga to the Adaption he went trough so many hells, but somehow he survived. The pain he felt would have ruined any other Character, but Mikoto is strong. \\n\r\nAll that is the reason that he is the only real King for me.\\n\r\nNote: Character Developments are shown in Season 2 (S1 is only playing for a few days).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWell. K gave me a lot of Enjoyment, caused me a lot of pain and suffering, but also made me laugh so many times, the Anime sums up the given Genres nicely. \\n\r\nIt's the only show I've re-watched for more than 10 times and I'm still not bored of it and I guess that's a sign or something.\\n\r\nAlso K has one of the saddest Endings ever. It's still flashing me everytime I'm watching it.\\n\r\nTo every review a bit critism is needed I guess, so here we go:\\n\r\n- On the one side the 13 episodes were enough, on the other side the plot rushed way too fast. I guess that can't be helped.\\n\r\n- I'd wish for more backstory information about how the Slates has chosen the previous kings and what exactly is the course of the Weismann-Levels limit.\\n\r\nWith every more critism I'd spoiler a lot for the Second Season, but I also wrote a very short and spoiler-free Review for it a time ago.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't care how bad Missing Kings or Return of Kings were. This is a Review for the first Season and that part of K will always stay as one of my favorite shows ever. I'm happy that I gave this show a look a long time ago.\\n\r\nI would recommend K for everyone who likes beautiful and flashy Animation, historical references, fight scenes but also sad Moments and the bond of a Clan.\\n",

It was a satisfying ending, so it deserves a 7/10 overall.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nStory had potential, but the execution was something else altogether. It was intriguing in the first few episodes, but it seemed like the developers were throwing in random plot twists every now and then. And then another flashback. One character is introduced and then two episodes later is killed. The plot was completely bogus until the very end, where everything tied together and made sense. However, a lot of the background questionsare still left unanswered: Who are the Kings? Why do they exist? How did they become Kings? Did they just randomly gain magic powers? Confusing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10 \\n\r\nAnimation was pretty good. Fight scenes were pretty intense. Some nice visuals and the backgrounds were also fairly intricate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters were actually decent, even though the plot was something else altogether. The MC is pretty annoying at first, he might seem like an air-head, but he has good intentions, so I'll give him that. Side characters also had some good character development, especially some of the HOMRA members.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack was good.\\n\r\nVoice characters were pretty believable, especially Mikoto's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually hated this anime up until the very end. I hate watching characters going, \"What? Huh?\" and feeling the exact same way as them because you have absolutely no clue what is happening.

            "content": "Set in a world where history has taken a slightly different course from the one we\u2019re familiar with, K follows the story of a young boy whose life is caught in a psychic war between seven kings.\r\nStoryline & Plot: 7/10\r\nI like the plot about the king fighting another king and only king can kill a king is so cool. Its like having some special ritual power or something. One thing to note about the plot is that they let shit things happened first before explaining. Although they didn\u2019t really make it exciting and mysterious like other anime, it still explain the event fully and clearlyfor everyone. The storyline isn\u2019t that rush at all, as season 2 will be airing this October, So the story still goes on.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Character Design: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is simply stunning, if you remember the scene where Yata in his skateboard chasing Yashiro around the streets of Tokyo. The CGI effect for that part was amazing, you wouldn\u2019t feel it unless you watched it in either HD or HQ. Likewise for the character design, I like the way they design their character where they are mature looking and looks like a character that you would see in a proper and serious anime.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment & Execution: 7/10\\n\r\nIt was definitely entertaining as it shown some cool fighting scene and chasing scene. It wasn\u2019t that exciting as you already have a feeling what\u2019s coming next. That\u2019s something that will kill your mood for entertainment. But still, the execution of the story is the one that bring this segment into having a high score. The execution of the story was done perfectly, you don\u2019t feel confusing even if they skip plots and explain all of it later. Not many anime can pull that off successfully.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nNot bad at least for the opening title sang by Angela. the original soundtracks for this anime is probaby one of my favorites so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7,5/10\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely light and entertaining to watch, it has a manly tone for me, although it does attracts a following in the BL communities, Since season 2 is going to come out, I am going to wait for it. I can\u2019t wait for them to introduce the other kings and see more naked Neko in action. The animation and music quality is superb and they should keep it that way. For people out there who had not watched this yet, you should give it a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "K, by Studio GoHands, is a beautiful anime. \r\nWhether you are new to anime, or have watched hundreds, it is immediately apparent that the art here is top notch, which is always a big plus in this media. \r\nThe sound too, is top notch. Everything from the opening song \"KINGS\" by Angela, to  the ending song, \"Tsumetai Heya, Hitori\"  by Mikako Komatsu, and everything in between is great. The background music throughout the show fits perfectly, and is a good choice thematically for the art style. (GoHands also uses Angela for their 2013 anime Coppelion, and her voice is superb as always). \r\nThestory has often been criticized for being non-existent or incoherent, and I have to wonder if the people saying these things are just new to anime or not paying attention in general. In short, the series follows Yashiro Isana, a high school student, who is being accused of the murder of Tatara Totsuka, a member of HOMRA (HOMRA is one of the groups pursuing him). Throughout the show, it is up to Isana to prove his innocence to the crime, or be killed by one of his many pursuers. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, the plot is easy to follow, and it has enough curves to keep you guessing until near the end. While there are still holes (which will hopefully be filled with the various manga series and the movie that is due for release), the story is still good, just not the best you've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show work with the limited time we have with them. We are introduced to many, and while some are not all too important, for the most part, they don't fall into the ubiquitous cliche characters that we are seeing so often in anime these days. Given the number of characters in this 13 episode series, and the various factions they represent, we are not given as much character development as I would like to see.\\n\\n\r\n Characters like Reisi and Mikoto obviously have so much going on that we never really get to see, so the viewer ends up feeling a bit left out and things that could have had much more impact fall a little short. \\n\\n\r\nIn general though, most of the characters are likable or fill their roles nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has a lot going for it, but falls short on some aspects. I feel that with more episodes, these flaws would not be so prominent, but that is up in the air. The show is definitely worth the watch, just for the art and soundtrack alone, as they are stylistically some of the best in anime. Everything else is enjoyable, and doesn't fit into the cookie cutters that so many people are used to, and for that, I commend it. \\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "In this series, it is pretty obvious what the most outstanding part of the series was. The art.\r\nThe ART was most likely the best I've seen in an anime. The detail and color was flawless and always caught your eye even in the smallest of places. The character design was also good for the most part, but not out of the ordinary. Overall, the art design was the best part of this anime, even having the intro look amazing.\r\nThe STORY wasn't bad at all, but it was definitely one of those that you either would be into or not. Personally, I very much enjoyed thestory and would like to see more like it. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most all of the CHARACTERS but mostly I loved Anna and Neko. They were both the most adorable girls you ever saw. Mikoto was also an epic character along with the other kings. It also helped to put in a few humorous remarks to lighten the mood once in while.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND and MUSIC was fine but not really the biggest part that I was looking at.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL, I really did enjoy this anime, mostly because I do like supernatural themes, and would give it a 9 (Great) out of 10 ranking. I recommend it to anyone who likes a story about unknown forces affecting the government, supernatural powers, and the cliche theme of a high school kid getting mixed up into something bigger than him.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do watch it, ENJOY!!",

            "content": "I looked into this show while it aired in 2012, but soon dropped it (I believe it was as soon as the first episode), starting and dropping again for another few times inbetween then and now.\r\nSeeing the artstyle and overall very promising setting, I must have known something more was hiding after the first, boring episode.\r\nAnd I was damn right. The story arc of this show is very much like an exponential curve, with the first few episodes going incredibly slow, being inconsistent in mood and pace and overall being a hot mess of storytelling. I went into the show expecting to get a mixof lighter mafia drama and some supernatural stuff, and what do I get? Excessive screentime of a white-haired school kid running around the place with his umbrella.\\n\r\nHowever, the tension finally begins to rise when the gangs are finally thrown into the mix. And it rises high. An excessive amount of characters normally goes south very quickly, sacrificing quality for quantity. Not here. They are all different, yet understandable and full of secrets. They feel like real people.\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the ending. That was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty clear that this show attempted to do what I call \"puzzle-solving\". All the pieces, seemingly unconnected, are laid out in the beginning, and in a series of mind-blowing plot twists are brought together to finally all click into place, preferably in the last episode. Shows that did this incredibly well are Baccano and Durarara, K however lacks in that department.\\n\r\nSo what makes this show worth watching?\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional appeal. It's true that the storytelling could have been improved, that the choice of main character was kinda weak and Mikoto Suoh got barely any screentime, but in my opinion this is exactly the reason why the ending is so strong. As viewers, we got to experience the birth of a legend not from the perspective of a king, but from his clansmen. We experienced two kings making all the wrong decisions because they couldn't possibly know the whole picture, while we could only sit and watch. We saw all these characters who couldn't be more different from each other being defeated by their own flaws one after another.\\n\r\nThe details in building the world and characters, like that the clans actually named themselves in a way that would come natural to them in the real world instead of just using the color terms. The red king's earring that they don't even bother to draw attention to. The fact that they only hint the existence of a green clan in the background, and that everyone who bothers to count realizes that one clan is completely missing. An entire character only developed to show the flaws of the whole clan system by possessing the power of two.\\n\r\nThe whole show feels like a work of art, with powerful symbolism all over the place, visual appeal to the finest and one of the best soundtracks I ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nBecause what genuinely great puzzle-solving shows like Baccano didn't manage to do, is to get on my emotional side. Too much violence and mindfuck makes the show feel like a game of who can connect the dots fastest. I am an adult, I love it when they dare to kill characters. But when a show like K make me wish for plot armor, I know that it did something right.\\n\\n\r\nK was a show that missed many chances, but still managed to be great.\\n\r\nThat is the true tragedy, knowing that it still could have been so much better.",

They obviously spent a bit of time choosing the correct music and sound for every scene because it all just came together flawlessly.\r\nCharacters: My only sort of complaint was all the fanservice from the female characters, otherwise though i think they were very well developed.And if you want to know more about them just read the manga they're not that long and it gives you all the background you need.\\n\r\nOverall: SO overall I highly enjoyed the first season so very much and had absolutely no complaints or qualms about it even with that ending. Anyone whose seen it knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about. I'm still a emotional even after like 2 years..... Back on topic the first season has everything and leaves you wanting more because of how good it was. And it does have a second season and a movie so you should definitely watch those if you still haven't. \\n\r\nOverall though I really did think it was a masterpiece and deserves so much more praise then it gets because its just SO DARN GOOD! And after you watched it all and if you can get over the second season ending (you'll understand if you watch it all) then you'll probably really be glad you watched it. That is if you like a good story with interesting characters. ^-^",

It's mainly a \"streetgang vs cop,\" \"who done [the murder],\" magic + cellphone + schoolkids anime.

            "content": "K Project or \"K\", has been the talk of the viewers since it was released. It was expected to achieve greatness, and in cases it did. However, it gathered it's own share of haters as well, mostly because of its incomplete and vague description of the story and setup. Personally I believe that K has described enough, it could have been much longer, however, it didn't HAVE to be any longer than now. This is going to be my first review, so bear with me.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe anime depicts the story of a student, Isana Yashiro, who was dragged into the battle of seven kingswith psychic abilities. Classic the story may be, the execution of that classic story was done quite well. The story, despite that was rather flawed. The explanations are quite lacking, the story occasionally got boring, and in the last episodes, too much story was crammed together. Even so it deseerves a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe most impressive part about the anime is it's art. The backgrounds and characters are well drawn, except Yashiro, who had a disturbing length proportion. Even so it's art is one of it's strong points.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe BGMs of this anime are very good. Character musics had their impact, which was quite crucial in this case actually. The OP and ED were decent, nothing particularly amazing. so 8 would do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nThe characters... well in this case K was lacking. Te characters were half-baked, not truly touching, and to be frank quite boring. Same old, same old, a carefree protagonist, a kind but violent king and a cold, calculative king.,funny female character, oblivious friends, uptight yet weird sidekick who appears to kill the protagonist and ends up helping him. They were fit for their role in the story, but regardless, a 6 would be enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the story. It was not something that would chain you with the chair, but it was good. However, it is notable that someone with  no taste in serious genre should not bother watching K. Because it's not dark, but it's pretty serious all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nI wouldn't consider K to be an anime highly praised. However, I don't suppose it's that bad either. It has it's own charms, despite of it's flaws.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's going to have a second season, so we can hope that the story would be expanded further.",

            "content": "Story: 7\r\nAccording to some of my friends and online reviews, K project lacked plot. However, I found the story rather enjoyable. Shiro, a boy with amnesia, gets blamed for doing something he has no memory of doing and goes in search of the truth. I liked the idea of the swords and the clans, but some of it was very confusing. It's not bad for a short anime but others like No.6 explained things a lot better with short amount of episodes. \r\nArt:9\r\nNow here's something the anime did really well. The art was fantastic - one of the best I've seen. It had a differentfeel than other anime.... Kind of a \"tropical\" feeling, with all that blue. Backgrounds were really well done, not crap quality at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were great, not the best though. I don't have any problem with those. One thing I just have to mention are the soundtracks, especially those played during fight scenes. Can't they have something more... Intense? It doesn't really suit the mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nI didn't like how Shiro was actually someone else, but that aside, this anime had good characters. I started watching this anime because Shiro and Kuro look like Kanda and Allen from DGM, however Shiro and Kuro were unique in their own way. I love Shiro's personality, especially his cleverness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. The art, the characters, and even the songs... They were well done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nPretty average, definitely worth watching.\\n\r\nWell, I'm not so sure how to end this review... So uh the end? XD",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nThe thing that made me watch the anime was the mystery around the main character Yashiro Isana an apparently normal student, I mean\u2026He is a little bizarre in his own way but nice and sweet. He is chased and accused of a crime he doesn\u2019t remember committing and soon realizes that there\u2019s something wrong with his memories\u2026\r\nThis scenario created a sense of intrigue and curiosity that eventually lead to an huge disappointment. The promising start was ruined with the poor development of the story that took all the fun out of it. The complicated plot and the little things left without explanation really annoyedme because I felt that it could have been something so great and so epic and instead was just not that good.\\n\r\nAbout the ending, it was an epic fight that left me with so many questions I hope will be answered once I watch the movie.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest point of this anime. The quality is excellent in every aspect and every character is design in detail until is perfect, all the surroundings and background are in full detail, very colorful and with no shadows. I was particularly impressed with the glow of the clan members especially during the fights (although there weren\u2019t that many) and the beautiful colors used in the landscape.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the opening and I think it is relatable with the anime, the ending song is average. The sounds used during the series to give emphases to the scene are great I really love them and they worked so well. However, there were a little repetitive and were used when not needed but it didn\u2019t really bother me. \\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are so beautifully design that it is a shame their stories weren\u2019t properly developed. You can tell that there is tension between the clans because of some event in the past but that part is never told, we were left with pieces of the past that don\u2019t really connect. Of course that with only 13 episodes there wasn\u2019t enough time to get into their history though I was expecting more.\\n\r\nOtherwise I really like them and their unique personalities, they were just amazing. I guess I just wanted the chance to know them better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlthough it has flaws I really enjoy watching this anime mostly because of the excellent quality and the appealing personalities of the characters. In my opinion it\u2019s worth watching.\\n",

I was blown away at how amazing it was.\r\n  Character development: The character development is very different than any other anime I've seen. It's obvious that certain characters have history together, but you don't really see that history. Unlike most short anime, there aren't too many flashbacks to create history. Because you aren't exactly sure what happened, It feels more realistic. There are characters that get flashbacks,but it still doesn't cover the whole history.\\n\r\n  Art&Sound: The way the art was done was very unique and beautiful, when you combine the art, amazing soundtrack, fantasy aspects, advanced technology, and realistic characters, you get a very surreal feeling that works perfectly with the unique storyline.\\n\r\n  K is very easy to enjoy and appeals to a lot of different tastes. It's a kind of ageless story that I think absolutely anyone over 10 or 11 will enjoy.",

            "content": "A Review of K (K-Project):\r\nRight off the bat, I wanna say that this show reminds me a lot of Durarara!!, and in my book, that is not a bad thing at all. However, at the same time of being similar to DRRR!!, it's also the exact opposite. In many situations, K does what DRRR!! fails to do, and similarly, K lacks in what DRRR!! has. It's a weird feeling to compare these shows and at the same time regard them as completely different. The bottom line, however, is that K, much like Durarara!! is very, very good.\r\nIn an alternate version of modern-day Japan (WOW HAVEN'THEARD THAT BEFORE), not much is truly different from the world we know as reailty. Sure, everything is more technologically advanced by a good 10+ years, but overall, things seem rather normal. But the setting (again, much like Durarara!!) has a hidden side to it. Years ago, instead of continuing on with the normal flow of government, Japan tried something new. A mysterious relic was found that bestowed power on certain people. These people would come to be known as Kings. These Kings, with their new supernatural abilities, grow their own small clans and maintain power over certain sectors of Japan. Unfortunately, as with most ruling bodies, there is conflict among the clans (hmm clan conflict, where have I heard that before?....okay I'll stop with the DRRR!! references). Our main plot begins with the murder of one member of the Red Clan. Now, the Red King and his followers are out to find the murderer and get their revenge. Enter Isana Yashiro, or Shiro for short. After an incriminating video is displayed for the whole city to see, he is made the number one suspect in the murder case. And it's not just the Red Clan he must avoid, but also the police-style Blue Clan who wish to bring him to justice for his crimes and a man by the name of Kuro, who has his own motives for wanting to harm the boy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where DRRR!! and K differ. While Durarara!! loves to focus on the individual lives and mindsets of the ever growing cast, K gives you everyone right away and lets the story proceed easily, which I prefer to DRRR!!'s waiting 5 episodes to even focus on the 'main' character again. The supernatural aspect is also much more...straight-forward I suppose. The abilities these kings and clansmen have, while not overly detailed, seem more natural then the slew of things that go down in Ikebukuro (I realize I just said supernatural events are natural, but you get the idea). It's a gripping story throughout with plenty of twists and turns, and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really good in this one. From the kind and slightly idiotic Shiro to his shape-shifting, reality-morphing cat, Neko, to the cold, yet tasteful bad-ass that is Kuro, the main cast is just as entertaining as some of the more developed side-characters. And yes, the side characters do receive slightly more development because this show suffers from what I call 'TGS' or 'Tokyo Ghoul Syndrome' where the main character is kinda useless for the majority of the episodes. He's not as whiny or boring as Kaneki, but he is somewhat pointless from time to time. The side characters are honestly some of my favorite SINCE Durarara!!. The violent Red Clansmen of HOMRA and the stern Blue Clansmen of SEPTER 4 play off each other so well, and while there isn't much emphasis on the clansmen, especially compared to the Kings, the ones that do receive attention are really enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation. Oh. My. God. I LOVE THE ANIMATION STYLE OF THIS SHOW. Sure, action scenes are few and far between and the supernatural aura stuff isn't a work of art, but the use of color in this show is breathtaking. Each episode is tinted. I know that sounds weird, like why not just have a dark show or a colorful one, but what they do with the tint in marvelous. The majority of the episodes will be grayish-green or grayish-blue, nothing really pretty, but then you have moments when the supernatural aura appears or when the show wants you to really focus on something and there's this HUGE splash of color on an otherwise toned-down palette. It makes for such a nice effect that I completely forgive the show for being such a gross color a majority of the time. You look forward to seeing these parts of the animation and it works so well.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack I can't say as much about, unfortunately. It's not bad by any means, but nothing stood out to me. There was one song that you hear repeated a few times toward the end that was really nice, but it didn't stick with me well. However, I need to give props for the opening theme, aptly titled 'Kings', and the ending theme used in episode 6. The opening doesn't seem like much, but it quickly grew on me and I found myself singing along to the subtitles (poorly, of course, but still). As for the ending theme of episode 6, titled 'Circle of Friends', it may not seem to great for just listening to, but after watching the episode it's used in, it almost made me cry how perfect it was. So yeah, not a GREAT soundtrack, but not bad by any means.\\n\\n\r\nFor a mere 13 episodes, this show has been really great. The last show that was this short that I liked this much was Death Parade. Luckily, a second season is coming out in just a few months! K, while simple in name, is a fantastic supernatural show and a great show in general. Its similarities to Durarara!! are obvious, but it's its own being that stands strongly by itself. I highly recommend this show.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Good opening theme and great ending theme used in episode 6\\n\r\n+Characters are great, whether seen a lot or neglected a little\\n\r\n+Animation. It's just...WOW\\n\r\n+Plot is thoroughly interesting and enjoyable to watch in every episode\\n\r\n+Character development is strong, especially towards the end of the season\\n\r\n+Plot twists are well-conceived and don't feel cheap or non-meaningful\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Final conflict was somewhat lackluster\\n\r\n-Only 13 episodes (but that's soon to change!...oh also there's a movie)\\n\r\n-This is only a small gripe, but the show only has 2 leading female characters, and the show milks it almost too much (as in one of the women getting a full body camera pan every time she draws her sword)\\n\\n\r\nI loved Durarara!! and I loved K. The two are similar, indeed, but each is special and unique in their own ways. K is a fantastic tale from beginning to end and I cannot wait for more content to come out. If you watched Durarara!!, like supernatural or mystery shows, or just want to watch a great show in general, I HIGHLY recommend K. It is truly a fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why K gets a 9/10",

            "content": "The story of \"K\" is really interesting, the different Kings, clans etc.. But it leaves me quite frustrated as I don't feel they fully developped it. The first half of K is (let's say it) useless. Not even that funny, we don't really get what's happening, who is who and all that. But eventually, it leads to a really great story,  a great character development, but still we don't really understand what's the point of what they're doing, what's the meaning of the story and that's quite disappointing. I don't even know if we can actually say that there's is a story in this...\r\nTheart is purely amazing there's really nothing to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nGreat sound too, especially the ending soundtrack which is one of the most brilliant I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nThe character seem to be interesting, but there are way too much in K which hinders us from getting attached to them and that's tragic. For 3 episodes straight we only get to see Shiro, Neko and Kuro and then the next 3 episodes we barely see them... We don't really get what are the so called \"responsabilities\" of the Kings as we don\"t even know what they're supposed to be. I get that we don't necessarily need to know where they get their powers from but still. Neko is also a mysterious character : we don't know who/what she is, why she's with Shiro. Kuro, at the beginning is a really boring character as he only talks about the Great Miwa Ichigen but : we don't know him, we never see him and he litterally has nothing to do with the main characters. In the end, the characters could be really great but they're not quite interesting enough, we actually don't really know them.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I really enjoyed it even though it has many flaws in its plot and character development, the art and sound helping a lot there. I would recommend it but I've seen better. I am really frustrated by K as I feel it didn't get a full evolution throughout the episodes and it's a shame.",

            "content": "So, K is definitely a good anime, definitely, but unfortunately it's heavily overrated. And before everyone starts thinking \"Oh another one who didn't like K and just writes to make it bad\": NO, I think K has its good and its bad sites...\r\nStory: \r\nThe story behing K is...complicated, to say the least. The first setting (seven kings and so on) sounds great and gives you everything you want. An interesting setting, a little bit of mystery and just enough comedic scenes to really entertain you. \r\nThe problem is how the story evolved...without giving any spoilers, It just gets too complicated and too confusing. I likedthe flashbacks and everything but if you need a flashback in every episode to explain your story, something is seriously wrong -__-\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art...*sigh*...the characters itself look great. I really loved the details and the powers and everything related to their powers (the swords of damocles or what it is called) BUT for everything else...the colours were often just blurry or not strong enough. Some scenes just burned your eyes with the light colours and yea, overall, I hated the colours schemes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nWhile the story was okay, the art a mix between good and bad...well, the sound...the sound was just awful. In action scenes the music took away everything related to action which rioned the scenes and sometimes there was no sound at all which was just annoying. The only good sound parts were the sad and touching scenes...argh...seriously I'm getting angry just thinking about it...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLike the setting -> just amazing! I loved the characters and the character design and they are probably the only reason I even finished the anime. The characters were great and I just wished some had a different story than they had...\\n\\n\r\nSo for enjoyment and the overall score, K is a good anime. If you tend to fall for the characters and just watch a show because of them, K is perfect for you. If you want a cleanly drawn anime or some really exciting action scenes, watch something else. If you want an interesting story with a little bit mystery, good choice with this. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend K if I knew the other person likes anime like this, otherwise no. But there is one light in the dark, the movie and the second season has better art and it seems like the sound is better too!!! So if you manage to watch this -> just continue, it gets better :D",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nThe main plot of K revolves around several clans, each run by a king associated with a color. After a murder takes a place, a video is released showing the murderer to be the slightly air-headed high school student, Yashiro. You can imagine some people were a little pissed at him. \r\nAnyhow, the plot line in and of itself wasn't exactly original, it still wasn't your everyday stroll in the park.  The anime is still very intriguing, and difficult to resist cannon balling. The plot wasn't exactly executed greatly, especially in terms of pacing, but it still revolves around the characters nicely. \r\nOnemay argue concerning the clash of genres, but in my opinion, I believe that the genres complimented each other well enough. The show didn't appear to force anything in, and so I believe that the abundance of genres was merely due to the fact that it was just how they wanted to execute said plot line, and I don't believe they could have taken much out. That being said, they could have organized and paced everything much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art in K is absolutely gorgeous, there's no denying. The animations are fluid, the colors are vibrant, the backgrounds are detailed, and the effects are gorgeous. The action scenes were all very well done, and the animation style did fit the show nicely. It truly was beautifully animated. Props to GoHands. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs with the art, I believe sound was very well done, although I'm extremely biased because all of the music was right up my alley. I have a several songs on my iPod. And have been listening to them on repeat for like, days. Anyhow, yes, the soundtrack is pretty fantastic. In my opinion. It goes nicely with the anime and really helps with some scenes. The voice acting is also fantastic, portraying the characters very well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nSo, I'm totally going against so many reviews with this one. So yes, some of the character development isn't very well done and is slightly bland, but considering the massive cast of characters and there being only a thirteen-episode arc, I don't see how they could have done much better without focusing entirely on only one or two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely what I really loved about K, though. Something that has always appealed to me in anime's are a diverse, larger cast of characters. Angel Beats! And Durarara ! are some of my favorite anime's just based around that one fact.\\n\\n\r\nSo what happened when I watched K, was that I was critically judging the not so good storyline, but then all of the characters came along. And I kinda fell in love. HOMRA's (the red) clan was pretty much my drive to watch the show, and Scepter 4's (the blue) did a fantastic job of scaring me. Well, Fushimi did. Mi....sa....ki?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may seem difficult to relate to at first glance, but they are all completely tragic and with their own flaws. That being said, I couldn't hate anyone. \\n\\n\r\nK might have just used various cliches and stereotypes, but does it mean I love characters such as Mikoto and Yata any less? Nope. Still love 'em. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nNow, this is where things get complicated. Although this show isn't 'technically' good at all, I still enjoyed the hell out of it. I also cried. So this is me subtly bring up the ending, because I bawled, and then I watched it fifty more times. To be honest, that ending may have made jaded my entire opinion of the show. Because that was one of the most freakin' beautiful endings I've ever seen for an anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut yep, definitely enjoyed K. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nMy comments for overall are basically the same as my comments for enjoyment: it's technically lacking and mildly cliched, but I still couldn't help but love it.",

There were parts left unclear, information not well delivered, and I had a lot of doubts that weren't answered in the anime (had to read the manga in order to comprehend better). However, once I /did/ understand, I liked it. I liked that the story had an unreliable protagonist and that the story, although confusing and variant, was always an inescapable cliff-hanger. I say this because there is no way to 100% predict what is goingto happen.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what really did it for me... was the art. W o w. This series' art work and coloring is like a mix between NGNL (No Game No Life - an anime that, although I hated various parts, has beautiful visuals) and Hamatora (definitely recommended as well!). It is thrilling and entrancing and enticing. It charmed me, really. Whenever I thought about giving up on the series and not watching it, the visuals served as motivation for me to keep going. TBH I had to rewatch the entire first episode because I was so mesmerized by the art that I did not pay attention at all at what was going on and got completely lost. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, it's a good series with beautiful art, and I think you'd enjoy it :)",

            "content": "Quite a decent anime. Has some potential but the pacing is too slow and characters are lifeless. There are scenes that made me wanna skip, and sometimes I would check if the episodes is nearly finished. I managed to bear through it wondering how it would end. At the end of a series, one would usually feel either \"ecstatic\" or \"disappointed\" but when I finished this, I didn't feel anything at all despite THAT ending. The ending raised more questions than clear up things. I can understand that they are aiming for a cliffhanger probably in prep for season 2, but would it hurt toanswer some very basic mysteries of the series?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters, they are dull and boring. I didnt feel any connection to anyone at all. The cat girl annoyed me. Its irritating for something cute to act overly cute. Its like candy with too much sugar. Also I was hoping that Kusanagi would do something 'spectacular' but no, he just stood around and 'looked cool' til the end. Now shiro is a type of character that you would neither like nor dislike. he's just \"ok\" I guess. Not outstanding should describe him perfectly. Kuro is fine but I feel like he's a stereotype long haired stoic character. Someone like Kanda Yuu from D.Grayman. I've seen a lot of his types, so far he doesn't have any unique characteristic to set him ABOVE the others. In the end, Mikoto is the sole character I deem memorable in this series though he's pretty much stereotype himself.\\n\\n\r\nthe plus side is: \\n\r\n1. Bishies\\n\r\n2. Do i detect shonen-ai hints? \\n\r\n3. Mystery factor is what kept me going - the ending disappointed me though, it wasn't because it was a sad ending, but because, despite having \"such\" an ending, I remained unaffected and detached from the characters and storyline. Still, I'm looking forward to watch the second season hoping to see developments from the story.",

            "content": "At first, I was a bit skeptical of this anime as from images and previews I had been shown it looked like another city gangster anime. However, it was far from it.\r\nIn all honesty, I avoided writing about this anime because I didn\u2019t have much to say about. The story was great and original, the characters were interesting and well written, and the plot twist were amazing. The fight scenes were epic but honestly lost my interest after a while, so I\u2019m glad most of them were not too long and the show focuses more on the plot. I only have two complaints. One isthat the story focuses a lot more on the red and blue king than they do the main character. After the first few episodes, they basically abandoned the main character to focus on the red king and blue king\u2019s operations. While some of those scenes were important in setting things up in the plot or developing characters, some of it just seemed pointless. The second is Saruhiko Fushimi in the English dub. For anyone that watches Durarara, it is painfully obvious he is voice acted by the same voice actor as Izaya Orihara. And this is where the issue is. His voice for Saruhiko is so close to Izaya\u2019s it completely breaks the fourth wall kind of taking the whole magic away from the character and making him seem like an Izaya copy cat. However, I honestly don\u2019t feel like the voice fits the character. For me, Izaya\u2019s voice highlights his slyness and cleverness. However, to me Saruhiko may be mischievous like Izaya, but from his actions he came off to me as, yes mischievous, but also a bit lazy at times, seeming to be looking for a fight just for fun out of impulse rather than having a plan behind it, and not seeming the cleverest as a lot of times he tends to misunderstand the situation/blue king\u2019s plan and Seri has to explain it to him further. Though this is only how I personally persevered the character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, other than the two issues I had with the series I honestly really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. It\u2019s very entertaining, thrilling, and well written and is defiantly high on my list. If you're into action, complex well developed stories, and interesting characters you defiantly don\u2019t want to miss out on this one.",

            "content": "Overall 9: If you love shows with powerful characters, rivalries, mystery, and emotions, this is a show for you. There are many characters, so you're bound to like some of them. The show also managed to be surprisingly meaningful (at least for me), raising questions about the price of power, the addicting beauty of combat, and the strange bond that arises from violent competition. It seems at times that enemies locked in an exhilarating fight have a greater love and more vital dynamic between them than any other characters. This show captured that idea beautifully, and that is why I enjoyed it.\r\nStory 9: In thisshow, there are two main plot lines that converge. The mystery around Shiro, the mc's, identity, and the war between the Blue and Red Kings. I found the latter much more compelling. The fights between the two super powered \"gangs\" are exciting and emotional, conveying the fascination, beauty, and consequences of extreme power. The exploration of Shiro's past was interesting, but a bit confusing and less moving than the conflict and subtle friendship between the Kings. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Beautiful, modern, lots of eye candy. :)\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: I loved the soundtrack. It added so much to the fight scenes, making me literally get up and want to dance along with the characters as they sparred through the night sky. Rather techno, but interesting combination of violin and piano as well. Made me cry too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Shiro, the main character, is the sly yet outwardly cheerful type. At times he seemed almost shallow or airheaded by how little he was phased by the situation. Yet he is also intriguing as we find more about how he has moved behind the scenes. He doesn't seem to change much in a compelling way by the end of the story though, so I found myself not caring much about him. I watched this show for the Blue and Red Kings, the leaders of the two main superpowered gangs. I love stories that have \"frenemies.\" These characters are often fighting, yet have great respect for one another, and seem to love the constant challenge between them. The seesaw of power and trust between these characters is the heart of this show, with unique twists and a heart wrenching conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: This show was exciting. The characters themselves are swept along by the obsession and exhilaration of powers and fights. It is contagious and carries us alongside to revel in revenge, violence, and friendships tested through fire (literally). It also balances the fights with emotions of grief, fear, and mystery, which made for a great combination.",

I was attracted to Mikoto but did not know enough about him to actually fall in love. :( Such a shame because Mikoto had all the personality traits to drive a girl like me crazy (i.e. good looking, bad-ass aura, reserved, caring, and powerful) but too little was revealed about him toleave a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is solely eye candy.

If this is your flavor, I seriously suggest you watch \"K\". \r\nThe total package is as good as I've watched in years. The art work is among the best of the decade, the story is strong and complex enough to keep your interest, but not so complex as to leave you confused. At only 13 episodes, it goes at a fast pace and is totally binge-worthy. Good and diverse group of characters with adequate timegiven to each for depth development. Great sound effects bring the amazing battle scenes to another level and the soundtrack itself is pretty darn good, too.\\n\\n\r\nA few down spots though, the build up was so good that it left something to be desired come the final battle. I didn't feel finished, luckily enough there is more that takes place after this. So, I suppose they were leaving us hungry for more to come. I enjoy fan service, but the character of Neko was just catering to the shadier side of Anime fans. Picture this; a curvy, magical, super loyal, cat lady who loves to run around naked... O_O ...wow! Something for everyone, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSub vs. Dub is a decisive win for the sub. Native Japanese works better in a series that takes place in Japan, yes, but that aside the Japanese cast out-performs the English one by far. Especially Kenjirou Tsuda as Mikoto, who just personifies the character perfectly with his calm, but powerful, performance. \\n\\n\r\nAnime fans everywhere should give this show a watch and should enjoy it greatly for in a show about kings, it does lay claim to a crown in pound-for-pound entertainment.

Bright colors, beautiful music, and great characters ....... oh wait it is missing something great characters. Peoples beef with this show is that that characters are not flushed out and the story is very all over the place. The real problem of the story is not the story the characters or length. Its the fact its too complicated to put into show formula. Let just compare this show to another one that i think is very much like it. Air Gear... we got kings, big tits,guy who can fly, amazing sound track, good art, and a strong sense of story. The problem is just like Air Gear this is a go read the manga or search on the internet kinda anime. Wtf is the Sword  go on goggle or read the bible.What does yata mean again go to the internet. What is the colorless kings clansmen power .......... go read the ..... wait their is not source material. So unlike airgear this is a go read the 5 other manga i published while making this show kinda anime. Overall if your a fan of airgear and your willing to slum it through the internet to read the manga (if its even available online) its prob a decent show but its not because it does not have any cohesive plot that is contained in one manga.",

I'm not sure why, but I guess most of those people want something that's easy to understand without having to actually think about it. I personally enjoyed this series a great deal. In fact, this is one of only three or for anime that I've personally enjoyed to the point where I'm giving it a 10/10.\r\nStory: The story is about a young man named Isana Yashiro, who supposedly murdered a member of a gang called Homra, and now several different people are after him. This 12 episode series follows hisjourney as he tries to prove his innocence, discover the real killer, and learn more about himself in the process. Despite how that makes it sound like some kind of mystery series, I can assure that it's not - not fully, at least. If I had to call this series anything, I'd say it's a mixture of action, comedy, and drama with a little bit of mystery mixed in. It's also a very intelligent series, with a complex storyline and a large cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: The artwork in K-Project is absolutely gorgeous. Truly top tier. In all honesty, I think the artwork in this anime is better than almost any other anime out there. All of the characters are well-designed, and the backgrounds are just stunning. I don't think I've ever seen backgrounds that were so beautiful before. All of the characters also stand out quite well. The color pallet used for the characters creates a differentiation between background, main characters, and side characters. Furthermore, the use of 2D and 3D artwork is done rather seamlessly. I can tell they used 3D art in here, but it's done in such a way that you don't notice unless you really know what to look for.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This is probably one of the few anime whose animation is almost completely without flaw. Throughout the entire season, I didn't find any of the mistakes that most animations tend to have. It was fluid and the transitions were smooth. What's more, all of the fight scenes were beyond amazing. I've watched a lot of anime with action in them, and very few can keep the same level of fluidity in their action scenes that they do in a normal scene where there isn't much going on. This one does that, and it does that well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One thing I truly loved about this anime definitely has to be its characters. All of the characters are well-done, fully-fleshed out, and have unique personalities, which is really quite amazing, considering how many characters this anime has. The three main characters, Isana Yashiro, Neko, and Kuro are all well-crafted. Yashiro acts like a lazy high school student who just wants to enjoy life, and yet you can tell that there is a lot more to him, even at first glance. There's a lot of mystery surrounding him. And, of course, there is Neko, the mysteriously beautiful girl who can turn into a cat. We don't know much about her backstory, but she has such a vibrant personality that we don't really need to. I loved watching her and seeing all the things she did. Kuro plays the straight man in this group. If Yashiro is lazy and Neko a glutton with little common sense, then Kuro is the one who keeps both of them from doing something stupid. Watching the three of them was a pleasure because every scene they had was interesting. Of course, there are many other characters, and each of them is unique and feels real.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, can I just say that I ship this pairing so freaking hard? I do. NekoxShiro has officially become one of my favorite pairings of all time. In fact, if there is one thing that I was disappointed in with this anime, it's that these two never got together. I feel like these two were made for each other. Yashiro acts like a lazy young man whose kind of reckless and just likes to go with the flow, while Neko is a fun-loving girl who is completely devoted to him. I'm going to be honest, if these two don't get together in season 2, which comes out this October, I am gonna be so pissed off - so, so, so pissed off. I want to see them kiss so badly, and I really hope the animators make that happen. If not, I'm going to write a very strongly worded letter about how they've ruined my life by giving me such a cute couple and not going anywhere with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I normally don't have a whole lot to say about sound quality, but I have to admit that it was really something here. First off, the opening theme song is beautiful, just beautiful. I absolutely loved it. The music has a rockish feel mixed with opera vocals. It was very provocative, and the ending theme song was also gorgeous. The sound effects were all nice to, and I loved the voice acting, both from the dubs and the subs. In fact, I think the English dubbing was even better than the subtitled version this time. The voice actors who played these characters in English really knew how to put emotion into their voice. It was quite good.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some people complained about this anime, I'm not going. People are welcome to agree or disagree with me, but this is definitely one of my favorite anime of all time.",

            "content": "ANIMATION: 10\r\nThe colors range from bright and abstract to mild and soothing, are always top-notch and beautiful to look at. The motion is fluid, from fights to skateboarding to just running, and it just carries you along with it in a wave of awesome. The characters are drawn extremely well\u2014most of the time, their emotions are shown beautifully in their expressions, eyes, or postures. And, of course, there are the comedic moments with all the sparkles and big eyes, also drawn very well. \r\nSOUND: 9\r\nThe soundtrack amazing. There are a lot of fairly unmemorable tracks, and a few that are just bad, but for themost part, the soundtracks of both seasons are brilliant, and are great to use as background music when cleaning or doing homework. Some of my favorites from both seasons are Knock-On Effect, If You Die (all the sarumi), Kindling, Knight, and Kitten, but I honestly love almost all the tracks. As a background soundtrack for an anime, the music is wonderful, too. It always fits the scenes brilliantly, and is very pleasant to the ears. There are times when the most soothing music is played during a high-energy battle, and it seems strange, but somehow it all comes together perfectly. \\n\r\nThe voice acting, too, is great. The emotions of the characters are captured brilliantly, and even the nameless characters sound realistic, natural, and unique, for the most part. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was amazing, amazing, amazing! The plot reveals everything to you very, very slowly, allowing you to know barely anything more than Shiro, the main protagonist, did, while teasing you with enough extra information to make you want more. There are lots of twists and turns, and the show keeps you guessing the whole while, and then pulls the rug out from under you in a series of interesting twists, some of which make you relieved, others of which make you want to cry. The first season, on its own, would get a 9 or even a 10 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season was a bit of a let-down after the first, as the first few episodes really seemed to drag. In addition, there was a lot more fan service in the second season, and I mean really blatant boob and panty shots, which was annoying and unnecessary. However, about halfway through, it picked up again, and even lessened the fan service a little, going more into some interesting new characters and bringing even more twists and turns, although these weren\u2019t quite as engaging as those of the first season. The ending, however, was solid\u2014once again, a rug was pulled, and once again, it was done well. The second season also some some interesting character development from characters that weren\u2019t developed that much in the first season, which was nice. \\n\r\nAll in all, the story is mostly amazing, with some disappointments and downhill moments here and there, but in the end it all really comes together and leaves you satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE. There is an end credit scene in the final episode of season two, which will tie up some loose ends, so you\u2019ll have to watch for that. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also K: Missing Kings, a movie set between the seasons that explains what happened in the year that passed between them. You don't need it to understand RoK, but you should watch it anyway because it's pretty good, although there are some fight scenes that last way too long. I skimmed through it, and only watched parts that interested me, but I'd still recommend watching it for those few particularly great scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9\\n\\n\r\nI saved best for last\u2014despite not having the highest mark of the four topics I discussed, the characters of this show are probably my favorite part about it. They\u2019re all engaging and unique, but not so exaggeratedly unique that it feels forced, and all of them have strengths and failings that you often can\u2019t help but love. The antagonists are fascinating, whether they are malicious or misguided or just bored, and the protagonists\u2026 well, you either want to bow to them or hug them tightly and give them cake. Or both. Even the secondary and/or nameless characters, as I said before, are given just enough variety in the background to make them seem like unique individuals, rather than just one, faceless mass. The main characters also get a lot of development, be it personal characteristics or ideals, strengths, weaknesses, friendships, or other, which are sometimes executed gradually, and sometimes happen all at once, but it always feels natural, and the characters are almost always better characters for it. There\u2019s even more development to be found in the light novels (for example, Misaki and Saruhiko\u2019s story in \u2018K: Lost Small World\u2019) that adds on to everything in the show, helping you to understand why the characters are the way they are, or how they changed during or in between the seasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, K is a \u2018masterpiece\u2019 in my list, and I love its art, sound, story, and especially its characters. It\u2019s 26 episodes in total (not including the movie), and I honestly think that that\u2019s 8.67ish hours well spent, so, regardless of who you are or what you usually watch, you should watch this.",

However, it may not be as surprising if you have seen so many animes with the same storyline.  Every episode needs to be watched carefully in order to know and understand the mystery plot of the story.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nFor a 13-episode long series, there\u2019s a huge lists of characters to choose from. Almost all of them are interesting and would leave such impression which is very rare nowadays with the long lists of animes released every season. And besides theinteresting part, there are so many cool characters that any shounen viewers would enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nThe animation is definitely one of the best of 2012 with its unique and intensifying graphics and effects. The fight scenes are one of the most exciting out there. That being said, it still lacks in the details department. If there are more details in the fighting rather than effects alone then it might be able to go on par with some famous resident shounen action series. The amazing animation is even accompanied by cool soundtracks. The character designs are very noticeable with its distinctive and gorgeous layouts. Another thing which makes the series a huge \u201cproject\u201d is the gathering of almost all the most famous and multi-awarded seiyuus.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nNon-stop excitement and enjoyment for the plot but the flow of the story is not particularly new. And the action part has so much potential if only there are more details with the fight scenes. But still, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve enjoyed anime this much.\\n",

I finished this show in 2 days, because I had stuff to do, but along with finishing this, I watched the movie of K, and the first episode of Return of Kings. This series is great, and I have to review it now, or I'll kill myself.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is great, calm down. Most people seem to think the story is horrible (I think, I kinda avoid reviews and scores) but the story is my favorite thingafter the characters. The story is absolutely fantastic, and I cannot be bothered writing much about it, I'll try to put it simply. A simple boy named Isana Yashiro is a normal boy at a high school, but after one day, he must go on the run from everyone because he killed someone without having any memory of it at all. My first reaction to that scene, where he talked was \"Lelouch? Jun Fukuyama?\" but... no, a completely different voice actor. But, Jun Fukuyama is in this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, the art is very good, the art style and the animation, good. Very. I don't really have much to say about it, just that it's good and it fits with the anime. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really amazing, my favorite track especially is Suoh Mikoto's theme. It's just so beautiful and the whole soundtrack is beautiful. It's one of the reasons I came to love the anime even more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are really amazing, I can't think of any other show that has this great of characters, well, that's lying, I can think of plenty. But, Suoh Mikoto wasn't one of my favorite characers at first, but once a lot of stuff happened, he became one of my favorite characters in the series. He's such a great character and so is everyone else, but Suoh Mikoto is probably my favorite character out of them all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime an overall rating of 9/10. The anime was great, literally, because 9 is Great according to the MAL scales, but, the anime was a great experience and I'm looking forward to the new season, which the next episode releases not that far away!",

            "content": "First review, I'll give  it a shot by starting off with the story:\r\nPersonally I loved the story. It is well written to pull together action, mystery, humor, and even some feels. It is not particularly unique and is full of the typical anime tropes that most high school setting's entail. Additionally, the show starts off by giving you too much information, and hoping that you'll retain it all by the time everything starts to make sense. However it is one of those stories that gets better and better with each episode. From episode 4 on, the shows momentum cannot be stopped, and even theflashes of backstory are well placed and only serve to improve your understanding of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were easily the strongest element not provided by the production studio. Despite the small episode count, K included at least a dozen intriguing characters with the only major flaw being that we couldn't see more of them. The writers foiled characters to each other and provided just the right amount of backstory to develop several major players far more effectively than most 13 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much I can say about this soundtrack that would do it justice. It is beautiful. I believe that anyone who watched nothing but the first 30 seconds could not honestly deny the quality of the music. Not only is it stunning, but it sets the tone for the show as a whole, and makes an ordinary scene come alive, while augmenting the impact of the more emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stunning as well, rounding out the incredibly positive impact the studio (GoHands) had on the quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I added in another category below where I justify any other positives or negatives that wouldn't perfectly fit into one of the 5 categories provided. For example, I was incredibly annoyed by a few of the minor plot devices between episodes 2 and 4. I would also point out that many of the interesting characters were not fully developed in K, which was bothersome, but were developed in the second season. Finally, one of the main characters I found annoying as an overdone archetype who is used primarily as fanservice. (And I didn't want to factor her into \"characters\" because I felt it would not do justice to the others to include her in my number)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n",

            "content": "I thought K project was quite interesting. The graphics and music went really well with the flow of the show. The graphics caught my attention because it had much sharper images and it didn't look like any of the old style anime. The beginning of the anime was quite interesting, where Kuro, one of the characters attempts to kill Shiro, the \"good guy\". As the show goes, I my opinion, the plot does get interesting despite the holes and I did become curious about what was going on with the characters, but I was really disappointed with the last episode. I was able to accepthow slow the show went - but at the end - I was very pissed off because there were way to many pointless gaps - to the point where even if someone were to analyze the show, some of the events didn't add up such as - to avoid any spoilers I'll try to keep this vague as possible - the events between the red and blue king and their history. I would recommend that you watch this anime if you love action anime ( with a small twist of humor)  and are patent (or good and skimming anime) and if you love good graphics (one of the things that I loved the most). This anime kept me curious until the disappointing end, but I think the first 12 do have their interesting points to them. :)",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so please bear with me. \r\nThough K has several cliche qualities to it, in my opinion it's still a decent anime and is worth the watch. The plot can be confusing at times considering the anime seems to leave out explanations and clarifications for the audience, but by the end, I think that the watcher might be able to figure the majority of the missing pieces. \r\nStory 7: As mentioned above, the plot seems to be missing a few explanations from previous events prior to the time setting that this anime takes place. Despite spending a goodamount of time being confused, I still enjoyed the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Probably the best quality of this anime is the art. It's very clear and crisp; which I think helps see what is going on exactly during the fight scenes. The art is beautiful and it will stick in your mind the most. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Personally, I'm not a huge fan for the urban genre of music that is played throughout the show. I'm not going to be rude and give it a terrible rating, because in all honesty, it wouldn't be fair of me to do that because it's not my taste and it's not a terrible soundtrack either. It fits the style of the anime and the scenes well, considering it takes place is a busy city in Japan. The music could be a bit more dramatic in my book, especially for the final battles and such. The opening is strange, but I think the ending song is great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: This is probably where K is most cliche; the protagonist is a cheerful guy, a mysterious, skillful 'sidekick' and a cute, perky chested, ditsy female friend. Sure, it's cliche but these type of characters are sill and always will be enjoyable. The only problem I had with the characters that I found it hard to make some kind of emotional connection with them. This probably has to do with that there isn't much focus on character development or the past of the characters. There are small flashbacks here and there in some episodes, but it's not enough to fully understand why the characters are the way they are (with the exception of Shiro). This is probably due to the fact that this is a 13 episode anime, which often doesn't allow much room for development of the characters. Overall, the characters are still enjoyable and favorable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: Despite the lack of character development, I still managed to enjoy this anime very much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: Yes, K has plenty of flaws (I'm pretty sure every anime has it's flaws; no anime is perfect), but with the exceptional art, interesting small plot, and cool characters, it's a good anime and will keep you guessing what will happen next. The ending is unexpected (in my book), but amazing. Don't let low and harsh reviews pull you away from this anime because trust me, it's worth the watch.",

            "content": "First things first: this is my first anime review. K is an anime that made me want to speak my mind for the first time with the whole MAL community, so please bear with me. Am I here to bash K or to praise K? Neither. I just came to state my opinion, just like everyone else does. As you won\u2019t hear me saying K was the best anime that ever existed, you will not hear me say it was the most epic fail of the whole fall anime season of 2012 (as I\u2019ve read before).\r\nStory:\r\nOverall I think the story was very good. It hadeverything to be perfect: a utopian city, Kings and their clansmen with supernatural powers, a hero trying to prove his innocence on a murder, a devoted and mysterious clansman, a girl/cat also with superpowers, you name it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, and this is a common point between many reviewers so far, it had a lot to be explored and explained and that simply wasn\u2019t. I feel like 13 episodes, for everything that HAD to be presented clearly to us viewers, weren\u2019t enough. But I also think that for only 13 episodes it\u2019s not as bad and horrid as many people point out. They made it 13 episodes long, we just have to accept the fact, it wasn\u2019t our decision.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so yes, there were many questions that arose to my head while watching the anime; probably they were the same as some of you viewers and reviewers had. Just to point out a few (spoiler alert):\\n\\n\r\n1. Who are these Kings, where do they come from and how did they get their powers (therefore also giving them to their clansmen)?\\n\\n\r\n2. Sword of Damocles? Okay, it\u2019s apparently a \u201csymbol of a king and manifests the truest image of its king\u2019s condition\u201d (Munakata, ep 10). From what little I could understand every time the Kings fight the Sword appears, but still\u2026 I guess this one relates to the first question.\\n\\n\r\n3. Weissman level? This one here got me really confused; I know Weissman had that experiment he showed to the future Gold King, but\u2026 I actually don\u2019t quite get it.\\n\\n\r\n4. Kagutsu crater? From Munakata\u2019s speech (ep 3) it was some kind of disaster caused by some excessive power usage, but it wasn\u2019t fully detailed so one can only wonder.\\n\\n\r\n5. Also\u2026 what are those crazy robot things?! No one has mentioned them here at MAL yet in their reviews and seriously, their talking and crazy acting give me the creeps.\\n\\n\r\n6. And finally... what does K stand for?! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nDespite of the whole \u201cpoorly developed characters\u201d speech I\u2019ve been reading in pretty much every review, I feel like one should look at it with other eyes. If you can actually put that aside, you\u2019ll realize that each character, despite their apparent complexity, actually has its own uniqueness to them. Even though you never get to know what they are thinking, you get pretty much a lot of dialogue between them that reveals you their nature. Don\u2019t be lazy and actually try to read between the lines, don\u2019t limit yourself to just listen to what the characters say.\\n\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t expect that in 13 episodes you\u2019ll get major character progression. Dream all you want, but then you\u2019d have no background story to focus on, just characters, their own life stories and relations.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many wonderful characters in this anime and the voice cast is as amazing as it can get (now this part may be a bit biased seeing as the cast counts with some of my favorite seiyuus of all times \u2013 Sakurai Takahiro, Miyano Mamoru, Fukuyama Jun and Nakamura Yuuichi).\\n\\n\r\nAnd, seeing as the characters are so complex, you get no insight and you have to do your own homework of trying to understand them, I could have only wished to more and more episodes just to unveil all of their pasts and relationships.\\n\\n\r\nBe aware of spoilers in the next paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, my absolute favorite characters were Fushimi and Yata (along with their obvious lovexhate relationship). I love the fact that Fushimi is so sadistic and psychotic as much as I love Yata\u2019s devotion to HOMRA and Mikoto. Yata is probably the earnest character you\u2019ll get on this show (even more than Shiro). And even though you pretty much know their story (old friends, joined Mikoto and HOMRA, Fushimi gets jealous of Yata\u2019s relationship with Mikoto, leaves out of said jealousy), I personally wanted to know more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you probably wanted to know more of was the MunakataxMikoto relationship. First of all it\u2019s obvious they knew each other prior to becoming Kings (in my understanding), but whatever happened between those two events (meeting and the \u2018present\u2019) we don\u2019t know and pretty much will remain oblivious to if they don\u2019t explain it further in the second season (which is a topic I\u2019ll be addressing to in the end).\\n\\n\r\nNow one relationship that makes me conflicted: ShiroxKuroh. Okay, so most of us Westerns were wondering: \u201cWHY THE HELL DOESN\u2019T KUROH JUST KILL SHIRO RIGHT AWAY?!\u201d (am I right, or what?). But one thing we have to understand is that Japanese mentality is nothing like ours. So the whole Shiro trying to explain himself and Kuroh not killing him right away became pretty much \u201cacceptable\u201d as soon as I passed that initial indignation phase.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I just talked about what appear to be the 3 main character bonds of the story.  But I was once more sunk into a sea of questions:\\n\\n\r\n1. Anna. She\u2019s probably one of the best characters of this show by far. But everyone wants to know: the essence of her powers and why and how is she close to Mikoto in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n2. AwashimaxKusanagi. Like Munakata and Mikoto they obviously knew each other before HOMRA and SCEPTER 4, so\u2026 a little insight was needed on this.\\n\\n\r\n3. Miwa Ichigen. He\u2019s pretty much a mystery and that\u2019s it. We get to hear his \u201cavant-garde poetry\u201d and\u2026 that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t delay myself in here, because it\u2019s plain to see that the art is purely magnificent. So, there you go: magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t talk about the OP and ED, just the BGM. It was simply fantastic. It\u2019s probably one of the best anime soundtracks I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to listen to and the songs always fit perfectly into the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\n2nd Season:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, SPOILER ALERT (if you haven\u2019t watched this anime yet, I recommend skipping the next paragraph. You have been warned).\\n\\n\r\nMy whole question about this: how can there be a second season when the apparent main character is dead? When Mikoto himself is dead? Unless this second season is, I don\u2019t know, just in depth episodes on the characters relationships, or we meeting the other Kings because something tragic is about to happen, or even ALL of our questions being answered, I simply HAVE NO IDEA as to what the second season might be about. Seriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo end this, I don\u2019t know whether I should recommend this anime or not. Like everything in life, it isn\u2019t perfect. It has some flaws, and I\u2019ve gone through some of them, those that I found the most relevant in my way of thinking. I think that, if you find the summary interesting, if the art captivates you, if you\u2019re simply curious, or whatever other reasons you may have to want to watch this anime, go right ahead and do it. Take your own conclusions as to this is a great anime or not.\\n",

I'm sorry if this is so biased, but I like how the graphic drawn , its colourful and look solid. its like , despite any other aspect , I will surely watch any anime with such graphic or similar to it, its just look promising. my own way of scoring anime anyway. one word, the ART is wonderful.\r\nSound 8/10\r\nNot much to comment here, I think everything just right , like OP/EDand Voice Actor is doing it right for every character, not really much a problem\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 / 10\\n\r\nI like how the character designed , like everyone got different personality and unique\\n\r\nlike the mysterious character, the traitor character , hot blooded character, absent-minded yet powerful character , loyal character , charismatic leader (sorry , try to be not doin any spoiler , so i just describe the major part of character personality) , every character has room to develop and some character past surely bring curiosity to the watcher and make them want to know more, but.........\\n\\n\r\nStory 4 / 10\\n\r\nHere's the thing got awful , the anime theme is about the kings war which is good, but as you can see before , there are lot of room for character personality development, and some decent explaination about their past is needed yet the anime didn't really bring anything up. only a very slight was shown and what worse the anime only stand for 13 Eps which left behind many thing unexplained. I think the story got a lot of potential to be great but  yet , its just potential, if its not developed then it's not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4 / 10\\n\r\nThey just sum up my curiosity on every Episode and then the anime just finished like that which is giving me a really less enjoyment about it. hoping for a second season but only ended up got some 2 hour-ish movies which i'm sure not explain everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5 / 10\\n\r\nI think for some graphic design / manga drawer / fan art people , this anime is great ( I got some friend who work as graphic design love this series and do a lot of fan art) \\n\r\nbut for me who watch anime for enjoyment and story , I think this anime flaw in many parts. I think i'll change the score if there is 2nd season (26-ish episode) which if there really is , will surely explain all the mystery.",

            "content": "I dont understand why people keep underrating this anime it's actually quiet good not the best but defiantly not the worst like most people would like you to believe. K (or referred sometimes as K Project) is a 2012 anime series animated by the studio GoHands and directed by Shingo Suzuki, who also serves as character designer for the series. \nthis series is very interesting indeed with a large cast and stunning animation its simply one of the best animes to come out in the 2012 fall period. however due to some kids poor ability's to understand a plot this anime has been getting poorscores. these people are complete Baka they rate it so low because \"they dont understand\" or \"there's no foreshadowing\" something like that. also may i add that the same people who underrate this show also gave SAO 10/10 witch has more plot holes then K and also make's absolutely no sense.. anyway here is my review\\n\\n\nPlot: 7\\n\nYashiro Isana has lived a relatively ordinary, simple life. He lives in the technology-advanced Shizume City and attends Ashinaka High School, a notable high school that is located on an island just outside the areas. Yashiro is friendly with everyone. Nothing ever seems wrong about him, except perhaps his habit of forgetting where his school-issued PDA is.\\n\\n\nHowever, nothing normal has been happening since the recent murder of Tatara Totsuka, prominent member of the infamous HOMRA. No one knows who exactly killed him but the man responsible bears an uncanny, identical appearance to Yashiro. Seeking vengeance, the Red Clansmen of HOMRA set out to get Yashiro and kill him.\\n\\n\nOK now may i add not every plot is perfect and yes i agree K hasn't got the best story. is full of holes and most things were left an answered at the end of the 13th episode but you cant expect 13 episodes to explain everything to you. however the story was pretty interesting to watch waiting to see who's the killer and whatnot was really exciting. good thing there's a sequel .\\n\\n\nArt: 10\\n\ni dont think i need to explain why this gets a perfect score.\\n\\n\nSound: 9\\n\nK has one of the best ED songs to come out in 2012 and is absolutely beautiful and the sound track is also lovely. that's about all i can say here im not very good in this area\\n\\n\nCharacter: 7\\n\nPeople who tell you that this show has weak character development or that the characters are generic are wrong. Considering that K has only 13 episodes, and it's cast is huge, the characters are not the best and certainly not the worst. Their interactions, personalities, motives, and their ability to make you laugh. all that is apart of what K is about..\\n\\n\nbut characters who are clearly important to the show do not have enough screen time and they dont really change threw out the series usually i wouldn't really mind that not everyone needs to change but for K the characters developing may has been something good to see the fact that no one changed at all makes me angry except maybe shirio he did kinda change..\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\nthis anime was really fun to watch it made me laugh and kept me asking \"whats gonna happen next?\" keep in mind i was watching 1 episode a week soo i was kinda excited when each episode was aired. not much else to say.. other then i really enjoyed this anime =D\\n\\n\nOverall: 8",

He gets accused of killing a gang member begining his quest for clearing his name. The story itself is quite confusing, and kinda slow at the beginning, but overall it's pretty good. Once your done you'll probably end up wanting more.\r\nArt:7 and Sound:7\r\nPretty good art work. Though its the kind you can see with most other anime. Though the fight scenes and anything magic scenes were really cool. Though one thing I question is if the artist's are fans of BL. I just saw a lot of sceneswhere I thought \"that's pretty close to kissing.\" maybe it's just me. As for sound the battle music, or maybe the before battle music was the only thing that stood out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting. Despite the show only having thirteen episodes they're relationship were developed it quite well. Though even with these I thought BL... I don't know why? It made me question if they were trying to make us ship characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nThere was times when I felt this show kinda dragged on but once I finished it I realized I really enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of action so action fans should watch it probably. Though BL fans that like BL that's implied should watch it. Either way I'd atleast give it a shot",

            "content": "As much as I personally love this anime, I'm going to write this review unbiased...or try to.\r\nKnow this: Alongside the anime are two mangas out. \"Memories of Red\" which is basically a memoir of HOMRA that comes before the anime, and \"Stray Dog Story\" which is Kuro's life before the anime. You don't need to read either of them to start the anime at all, but it is interesting for those who truly follow the franchise.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n--It mainly follows three groups: Scepter 4, HOMRA, and Shiro's ragtag group (Shiro's being the absolute focus). It starts out very vague, and the very beginning may be aturn off to some people because of the extremely broken English script, but once you get past that, it does pique your interest to see two feuding groups, and for no explicitly stated reason. The transition into the next episode is very vague. Rather, the whole anime happens to be vague a lot, but that may be a reason to keep you hanging on until the end, which isn't that far away considering it's very short (only consisting of 13 eps). A lot of times you will be left with a cliff hanger at the end, and even by the time you finish the whole thing, you're left with wondering questions. It's rather rushed, and we don't know the whole detail for anything really...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n--The CGI incorporation is pretty amazing. The level of FX in this is above the standard for anime, which is what I really like. The art of the characters aren't too unique, but I do prefer the style to others. The coloring kind of threw me off. It's very bright in a lot of the scenes. So much so, you lose the details of some characters. The background art is amazing, while some things are rather bland, they did put a lot of extra details into the buildings, if you have an eye to pay attention to it. There are a few inconsistencies that can be spotted, but nothing too big or attention grabbing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n--The soundtrack is very calming for the most part, but when the mood changes, it usually matches well. The soundtrack is also very limited. You'll notice that the anime repeats the same tracks in multiple episodes, but at least it's not annoying. It's rather intense. It's light sometimes and easy to listen to, and other times it's rather heavy, but nonetheless it does matches the mood quite nicely. I personally hated the OP and ED, but I don't usually count either of those when I rate the sound. The FX sounds were pretty good. I would say that they would make great ringtones as notification sounds. The voice acting: 100% right. I felt that all the characters were truly matched well with their given voice actors. Nothing felt awkward about their voices to the characters at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\n--Some people will say that there are a lot of characters, but it's not hard to fish out which ones are actually important. Pros: The characters strongly have their own personalities that sets them apart from one another. Those that get enough screentime definitely leave their mark. Cons: Some characters that should have gotten more screentime, didn't. We don't know enough about certain characters when we should. I'll tell you right now, reading the mangas won't tell you much even still. I did find one particular character to be intolerable, and that's Neko. It may just be how useless I thought she was, or how annoying she ended up being. Nonetheless, she happens to be a key character. By the end of this anime, you'll probably remember maybe 7 characters top and that's because they happen to get the most screentime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n--Despite there being a lack of a solid foundation, it does show promise. I enjoyed following what would happen between the two feuding kings, and now I still wonder what happened by the end of it. There was an announcement saying that there will be a second season, but I wonder what they will do since at least three key players that made, what little of the plot there was, the series continue.",

That is how I feel about this anime.\r\nThough it starts out vague, pieces start coming together along the story, and it makes you wonder and crave for more. The interesting characters, the stunning artwork, and the battle scenes are all fun to watch and interesting to see.\r\nI find this anime to be one of my favorites, and here's why:\r\nThe story line is in fact a bit sloppy and the background is a bit vague, but I believe the series completely makes up for it.\r\nSo here we have cute, happy-go-lucky, slippery, tricky Isana Yashiro. He kept me interesting right offthe bat, being the lovable character he portrays. Getting himself out of sticky situations seems to be his thing, and he's great at it. His interactions with other characters is hilarious as well, and he's just the sweetest thing, even though he can be a little brat sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were unique and original, having flawed but lovable personalities and attributes, and you find yourself rooting for characters on all teams. There wasn't really any of them that bothered me at all, except for Awashima on SCEPTER 4. Because we all know that huge bobbed chick is on the show purely for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the plot line. While it starts off strange, I found myself getting engaged immediately with the mysterious, different atmosphere the anime gives off. The Red King and his clansmen were probably my favorites, aside from Shiro and the gang. Anyway, it's a little sloppy like I said, but it comes together in the end well enough, and it comes together nicely in my opinion. I can't say I am too pleased with how it ended, but I'm positive MISSING KINGS promising PV tells me the movie is going to make up for it. It was extremely interesting in my opinion, and I find myself rewatching it over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great. It was new and jazzy. Lovely, calming tunes to fun little battle tunes. I like to listen to the sound track once in a while, it's so leisure and I absolutely loved it!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good, and I didn't find anything wrong with it. They had the little details down perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very unique and refreshing, with very different looking characters. I'm always annoyed when I find art that makes all of the characters look similar, but this one definitely differs from the rest. I highly enjoyed how they did it.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this to the max. As you can tell from my almost perfect ratings. I don't find many anime that I watch all in one day, but this one too the cake for sure. I watch it all the time and anticipate the movie. I think it was put together nicely and had a very nice feeling to it, and you grow attached to characters. Even though we didn't see too much of Totsuka, I absolutely fell in love with him! This is definitely my most favorite anime, and holds a very special place in my heart.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watched K Project not really for the character development nor the story, but simply it was such an enjoyable story. I never really found anything that made the story and character development worthwhile to mention.\r\nThe art is simply fantastic. It pops out, and it actually looks extremely pretty. The scenery gives a feeling of happiness that completely mirrors Shiro's happy-go-lucky personality. The characters are also particularly cute, especially Shiro. But the other characters all have artistic aspects of them that make them particularly likable. \r\nThe sound synergizes well with the art, meaning that it's particularly beautiful. It is the third anime out of thousandsthat I openly went \"Woah! The music is incredible!\" (After Code Geass and Owari no Seraph -- and this music is better than that from those animes!). Mikoto's theme is notable because I love the combination of the drumset and partial orchestra. Shiro's theme is pure beauty. The opening theme is beautiful and the type that you wouldn't get tired of listening to for thirteen episodes straight. Unfortunately, I can't judge the ending scene too much because I was way too distracted with Neko's lack of clothing... and because I had to skip over it since I was afraid my parents would look over my shoulders and wonder what I was looking at.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters hold a tad bit of unrealisticness, but they all are particularly likable. Truly, Mikoto is the best king that anyone could ask for, with a hidden side of compassion mixed with his anger. Totsuka shows the power of peace. Yata is amazingly stereotypical of an angry teenager, but that's more likable points from me. Izumo is an oddball for his ability to stay calm (even weirder since he's part of HOMRA). Neko is just plain creative and original, I've never heard of having a naked cat lady in the main role. Shiro's personality makes him thoroughly likable, and his antics with Kurou are funny. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the story. It's okay. I accidentally spoiled it for myself while going on Wikia for some clarification information, so... woops. It wasn't as confusing, thank goodness. The only judgment for the story is the wow factor at how such an original idea came from an original work. Not something commonplace. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up, this anime was truly a one-of-a-kind, and I kinda understand why the fujoshis would converge around this anime, but it holds much more than just shipping Mikoto and Kei.",

It was enjoyable enough to watch, so clearly, it isn't SO bad that I had to struggle through it. However, the actual story wasn't really calling my name. \r\nI think that it wasn't a very strong story, and that's not to say that it wasn't an intriguing one, but it just didn't seem very grand. It was also sort of predictable, but that's not always a bad thing. \r\nThe only other thing I really didn't like much about this anime was the music. Although I don't thinkmusic is ever a reason to watch or not watch an anime, it did sort of put me off sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, they were pretty enjoyable to learn about. There wasn't much development for any of them, but then again, the story is far from over. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I am still interested in what's to come with this anime franchise, so I will continue to watch it. My advice: if this anime seems interesting to you, watch it. You could really like it.",

            "content": "So, uh, i just glanced over all the reviews and while there are a few good ones, most seem to be saying the plot is incoherent or slow and characters don't get time to shine. Suffice it to say, as i watched the anime i didn't feel most of these emotions. Though there was that sense of intrigue that few other shows have managed to instill in me till now. I won't be going too deep about any particular element, just scratch the surface of what i believe have been, quite unfortunately, poorly understood or appreciated. I definitely recommend watching the anime though.\r\nNow, i actuallysaw the first episode of this anime quite a few years back, at least 3. Back then, i believe i was in my 'action badassery' phase and wanted all main characters to be this sort of OP and decisive guys. And i had kind of dropped this back then because the mc, surprise, wasn't. (the shounen ai elements didn't help as well, or what i interpreted as such).\\n\r\nSo coming back into this with that view, and to persuade anyone who might be wary due to 'weak' characters, i found all characters (except one annoying cat) to be quite great, including the MC. There's a lot you have to read between the lines here. Much of the relationships between the characters aren't exactly spelled out, especially those between the kings (i really loved those). And while many reviews seem to say there are a plethora of characters and not sufficient time between them and what not, without going into spoilers about the factions, there are in fact only a handful that the show ever truly focuses on. You won't be getting an exact dismantling of each thread that makes up the characters, an exacting analysis of what makes them tick (would that even be interesting), but try to understand what their motivations are and the show gives sufficient hints to fill out the answers. A fair compromise for a show with only 13 episodes. (Really though, half the time with most complaints its like 'It tells too much!' or 'It tells too little!'. You should just see the anime and see for yourself which case it is, i suggest).\\n\r\nThen the other part, plot holes. Or an incoherent plot. The show takes its time, but it, again, focuses on whats important, leaving just enough to let you answer most other questions. And try as i might, i can't just think of any particular plot hole or thread that remained to be resolved (well a few, but that's mostly related to the conclusion which im sure is dealt with in the sequel).\\n\r\nFor the rest, art is a bit strange in terms of colors sometimes, but its not bad enough to prevent anyone from watching, so dont let it stop you.\\n\r\nSound, again nothing great, nothing bad, shouldn't even be a reason why someone doesn't watch anything to be honest (unless its reaaal bad or creepy).\\n\r\nAs an overnight marathon, i had great fun with it. And also the feeling that i may not have appreciated the show as much had I watched it all those years ago. My mind says, 8/10. The heart, 9/10.\\n\r\n(Eh, that was kind of long, thanks for reading. i also believe this is my first review? Let me know if there's anything strange in there, thanks again.)",

            "content": "*Warning: Possible spoilers here and there*\r\nI love supernatural anime. Whether it is about ghosts, vampires, demons, gods, magic, super powers, immortality; basically, everything about it amazes me. I just love myself a good supernatural anime. Today, I will be talking about a supernatural anime that not a lot of people talk about for, well, reasons. It is known as K. Now I know what you\u2019re wondering. \u201cK? Just the letter K? That is just creative as L is.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s a bit strange which is the reason why it\u2019s best to call it K Project or K eine weitere Geschichte (\u201canother story\u201d in German). Ithink the K means \u201cKings\u201d since it\u2019s all about a bunch of kings. Well not the royal type of king, but a king who have been given supernatural abilities that can recruit other people into their clans. Whether if it\u2019s a police force, a gang of mobsters (plus a loli) or a trio of students that includes a magical cat that can turn into a naked girl.\\n\r\nWhen I first heard of it, K reminded me of Ryogho Narita\u2019s works (like Durarara and Baccano). Since much like those two, it\u2019s an action urban fantasy anime filled with gangs, as well as centering around several different characters. But is it as good as his works? I have yet to see his anime shows (which I\u2019m very excited to see), but I will say this. While the premise is great and the music is so damn good; is just that the execution is - how can I say it? Weak. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nK follows the story of Yashiro (Shiro) Isana whose life is caught in a psychic war between two different kings due to being framed for a murder of one of the King\u2019s clan member. \\n\r\nAt first, the story sounds awesome. Really awesome! Battles between different groups, different point of views, a cute cat girl and a cute loli, all of it! It was a great premise for an action urban fantasy anime. So why would a great premise like this can turn into, well, quite a mess. Here\u2019s why.\\n\r\nThe biggest problem that K has is that it mainly focuses on how cool and action-packed it is; up to the point that they are forgetting a lot of important plot elements. Because of that (as well as the fact that the 1st season only has 13 episodes with loads of characters in their hands), the story was rushed leaving loads upon loads of plot-holes. I mean I have a huge list of unanswered questions about this show. Why would such a little girl like Anna join HOMRA? How did Mikoto and Reishi become Kings? What\u2019s the relationship between Kusanagi and Awashima? Why are the clans fighting each other in the first place? And why is Kurou such a damn good cook?! I need answers please! ANSWERS! I know that there are sequels of the show; but please stop focusing on just fighting and give some specific details about some these questions I just asked! The plot may sound intriguing, but I wish that it didn\u2019t have such a poor execution like this.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters are divided into 3 different groups: HOMRA, Scepter 4 and the high school students. Yes, of course you would put some motherf***ing high school students because it\u2019s anime! Why not we talk about them first shall we? First, we have the main character Shiro whom personally, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the main character. He may have traits as one, but the story doesn\u2019t just focus on him. As a character himself, I think he\u2019s one of the most developed characters because of spoilery reasons so he\u2019s probably an okay character. The same goes to Kurou Yatogami, who was also an interesting character from being a great badass and a great cook. Also, he can be a bit hilarious at times with his obsession of his master\u2019s words of wisdom. I really like the contrasting relationship with Shiro and Kurou, since their names mean \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cBlack\u201d. Rounding off the trio is Neko, the so-called magical cat that can turn into a naked girl. She may be cute, entertaining and sexy, but is that her only significance in the show? If it was then she\u2019s pretty damn useless. There\u2019s also the high school students which are nothing but forgettable side characters.\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Scepter 4 who looks cool and all as being policemen with freaking swords! But they can be pretty one-dimensional. You\u2019ve got the Blue King Reishi Munakata, the stoic boss and Seri Awashima, the sexy female fighter (and don\u2019t get me started on those pointless fanservice shots of hers); both look cool but mostly bland.\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s HOMRA, with the Mikoto Suoh, the badass Red King, Izumo Kusanagi, the smart gut of the bunch, Tatara Totsuka, the na\u00efve guy who died (not a spoiler BTW as he died like in the start) and Anna Kushina, the cute as hell Lolita. Personality wise, they are a bit better than Scepter 4, but they would be better if there was more information about them (especially with Anna).\\n\r\nIf I have to pick who are the best characters in the show, it would have to be Saruhiko Fushimi and Misaki Yata. He\u2019s a smart jerk from the Blue guys and he\u2019s a violent jerk from the Red guys who used to be good buddies with each other until Fushimi left for the Blue clan. I really loved their contrasting rivalry with each other. Along with Shiro they have the only significant backstory out of all the characters .\\n\r\nWith the characters, some can be bland or annoying while some can be quite likeable and worth remembering.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nK is an original anime created by an underrated studio known as GoHands, who does other works like, well, anime that aren\u2019t well known and aren\u2019t that good either. If there is one word to describe the art style of K, it would be \u201cflashy\u201d. Everything that K shows loads of flashy blue colors with hints of red thrown into. And probably, I think they put a lot of it. Way too much of it. So much it is sort of hurt my eyes. Also, what\u2019s the purpose of putting some pointless fanservice in the show (especially with Neko and Awashima)?! We don\u2019t need some goddamn panty shots in this show!\\n\r\nBut does that mean the art is bad? Hell no. The art style is very nice and very fluid with loads and loads of sakuga. Probably one of the most smooth-looking anime I\u2019ve ever seen. \\n\r\nAs for the character designs, they looked very unique, even though some may look confusing (I mean, I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Munakata and Fushimi at first). The art may be a bit too flashy, but it still is smooth and nice-looking.  \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nProbably the best and the most memorable part of K is the music. I love it how they mix urban style music and electronic music with classical music. It definitely matches the show with it\u2019s urban fantasy setting. As for the opening, KINGS, the visuals look good but there is too much going on. Song-wise however, it\u2019s so damn good, since the fact is performed by one of my favorite anime bands angela. Her style of music is quite perfect with the show (she does sing a few insert songs too). The ending Tsumetai Heya, Hitori sung by Mikako Komatsu (Neko\u2019s seiyuu) looks very out of place since it only shows a naked Neko striking some poses but sounds very calming just for you to calm down after all the action going on. Also there's Yui Horie (my fav seiyuu) who does a few songs too. Since she voices Anna, she does some cute singing as her.\\n\\n\r\nDUB: 9/10\\n\r\nThe anime was licensed by Viz Media which is quite a surprise, since they barely handle underrated anime like K and are mostly known for well-known anime and manga like Naruto, Bleach and Sailor Moon. But for the dub, they did have well-known dub actors. We have people like Sam Riegel (Shiro), Matthew Mercer (Kurou), Stephanie Sheh (Neko), Keith Silverstein (Mikoto), Patrick Seitz (Munakata), Ben Diskin (Yata), Todd Haberkorn (Kusanagi), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Anna), Tara Platt (Awashima), Johnny Yong Bosch (Fushimi) and a couple of others too. And all did a very good job with each of their characters. If I had to pick which roles are the best it would have to be Kusanagi (cause he's voiced by my favorite VA), Fushimi (cause it's Johnny Yong Bosch), Kurou (cause it's f***n Levi from AOT guys) and Neko (despite how I hate her, Sheh was adorable as her). The dub is not one of the best dubs ever, but it can be as good as the sub is.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\r\nK may be a good looking anime with a flashy art style and amazing music, but it's far from being a good anime with a poorly developed story with somewhat interesting characters that still needs a little fixing. If you like a good action urban fantasy, then K Project isn't a bad choice, but not a good one either. If you want a better choice, then go for Ryogho Narita's works or even Blood Blockade Battlefront since their storytelling is a bit better than K's.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ Flashy and smooth animation\\n\r\n+ The music and the dub\\n\r\n+ Some character relationships are great with Shiro/Kurou and Fushimi/Yata\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Almost everything is executed poorly (like the story)\\n\r\n- Interesting characters but with no development at all \\n\r\n- A bit too much blue\\n\r\n- I need answers please! ANSWERS!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHere are some words of wisdom from my great master: \"Do not expect a lot of good in this show.\"\\n",

(more backstories about them will be nice, but maybe I have to go to the manga for this)\\n\\n\r\ni hope the next part neko doesnt put me off the show too much as i have dropped good animes from characters like that. (I guess you'll find out when I write a review for that)",

It has interesting plot and character developement. Sudden twists and turns just might be surprising indeed.\r\nIf you are put off by the amount of characters on the cover, don't be. It is centered mainly around five kings(so far). Gold, Silver, Red, Blue and Green. There might be more in season 2(hehe).  \r\nBut its Main Character is still one person, a male by the name of Isana Yashiro. He also goes by other names but that will bea spoiler. :)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has great drawings and fighting scenes. When a certain character die, it made me cry so hard. Ga, *sniffs*, but still, the anime is great if you want a change of scenery from slice-of-life anime. \\n\\n\r\nNot sure if this is your time? Check the below list that this anime is:\\n\\n\r\n1. Great Action\\n\r\n2. Not completely OP MC(sort of)\\n\r\n3. No annoying girls\\n\r\n4. Fantasy\\n\r\n5. Great character developement\\n\r\n6. Drawing/Graphic is modern and fabulous!\\n\r\n7. Male Main Character\\n\r\n8. the female characters are also powerful, not weak.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, give it a try and I hope you like it! It is one of my all time favorites!",

            "content": "For 2/5 of this anime I was really worried, but since I had nothing to watch I still kept watching. This anime is really good:even if there is no character development, the art and characters are cool.\r\nStory- Not a very original story. A guy wakes up one day and has lost his memory. All he has is a cat and an umbrella. Then he remembers everything (like that his name is Yashiro Isana) but remembers nothing about before a week ago or so. A bunch of people come after him trying to kill him: a man who wants to kill him because he thinks thatYashiro, or Shiro, is the Colorless king and his duty is to kill the Colorless king if he is evil. Except that all of this happens in a supernatural world. But, the reason why I gave this anime such a high rating is because of the ending. Most animes have bad endings *cough cough Vampire Knight* but this anime has the best ending ever.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art & graphics are outstanding. The magic of Homra is drawn real well and the faces of the people are definitly not messed up (it's far from being messed up).\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say. Except that Neko's voice king of irritates me but that's all right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ahhhhh... the interesting part. My favorite character is Mikoto Suoh, the Red King. First of all, he's loved by all his \"subjects\", he's hot and he makes the ending the best ever. I also really like the blue king because he is so buddy buddy with the red king and does a not so friendly act at the end, but prevents a possible destruction of the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I probably re-saw the end a thousand times because I really loved the end: \\n\r\n(Possible Spoiler Alert) a dead man, a sad young girl and those red fires in the sky are just plain awesome.\\n\r\nEven if I said a bunch of negative things about this anime, I really enjoyed it and recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "To be very clear, it has been a little while since I have watched this series. When I saw it on my Netflix though, I quickly turned it on and re-watched the 13 episodes of sheer amazing art quality and enjoyed the characters once more. This anime sent me through a wave of emotion. Why? Well, let's see here.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI gave this story a 9 because it was greatly deserving of it. Just a little short of outstanding. The plot could be confusing every now and then, but in the end I felt they wrapped it up the best they could to fit those thirteenepisodes (main reason I'm waiting for season 2!). Another reason why I wish they would translate the manga to English already.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is simply MARVELOUS. Sure, it had some fan service with a certain girl we all know, but the lighting, the effects, oh my it was just stunning. I wish to be an animator, and this art... to animate something so beautiful... it would be an honor to one day do the same. \\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n I personally when I found out there was a dubbed, watched that after knowing the subbed voices. Neither version disappointed me. The Red King's raspy, bad boy voice made me so happy. I could almost say I like his voice better in dubbed, but his Voice Actor's do truly deliver and give us extra along the way. (Not to mention I found Yata's voice very fitting as well.) Sound effects, the battle scenes, made me feel like I was right there myself.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis will be my lowest rating. Why do I give the character's an eight? Well, for one, it kinda made me sad they didn't talk more about some of the background characters. (Like Eric and Chitose from the Reds as an example.) I did mention this earlier though, they did only have thirteen episodes. So I completely understand the focus not being on them (C'mon Season 2!)  Yet, while I found they did relations with the Red King and Tatara very well, they didn't reveal a whole bunch about the Red King and Blue King and how they really knew each other. Why does the Blue King care for the Red King? Vice versa. This is referring later into the end of the series, so you'd have to watch it to know what I'm speaking of. Again though. Thirteen episodes. Completely understandable, but I still deduct two points.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI would watch this series over and over and over again! I love all the characters featured and how they are all connected! Ugh this show!\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWatch it. Seriously. You will enjoy this series so much if you liked the look of the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, watch the movie.\\n\\n\r\nAnd stick around for SEASON 2~!\\n",

This anime made me cry at one point too so tragic. ;-; I enjoyed the coloring and the art the most during the action scenes.\r\n Sometimes throughout the story I would get confused though because I couldn't rememberwhat exactly happened in the previous episodes.

Lots of loop holes, unexplained ideas, annoying character personalities, very little to zero character development, slow-paced storytelling here and there. But what really made me watch 'til the end is my curiosity on how will the story reveal the mystery about the main character. Despite its shortcomings, there were moments of fun, drama, and pain that made this anime allworth it.\\n\\n\r\nEven with a 7 rating, I have to say this anime is still worth a shot!

And while going thru half of it's episodes, I find myself interested to it maybe because of neko and shiro's relationship that I hope will last until the final episodes.\r\nThe story was quite good, a battle between the 7 kings where the 1st king was framed up and lost his memories and protected by a cat which turns into a cute girl who loves him so much. And as said, a battle between the 7 kings, Idon't know why it's just the 4 of them who were caught in the fight and the 3 others were not involved.They didn't even introduce all of the kings, making me wonder who were the other 2.  And the finale is the only part I didn't liked very much which is a sad end. And that's why whenever I see the name of the anime K/ K project, I said to myself \"oh that's the one with a sad end\" then remembers what happened in the last moments of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch this, just don't expect too much when it comes to the romance part. Maybe in the K (movie) there's something worth waiting for. Or maybe a second season is better.",

But glad i decided to finish the series and is really good at the end. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended for people who have time and patience to ride this train. It only make sense at almost the end of series so you really got to GAMBATEH <3\\n\\n\r\nThat being said , i started this anime without checking out the summary. Go check the summary of this anime as well so that you know what the show is going to be like.\\n\\n\r\nPEACE OUT <3",

            "content": "\"K\" is a bit of a mixed bag. While it does have some impressive visuals, the story and characters leave a lot to be desired in a series that could only do so much in 13 episodes (and a movie I've yet to see).\r\nThe story of \"K\" is easy to follow, but it is also a a bit hard to understand because of how it is presented. Certain things are revealed and certain characters make decisions throughout the series that exist more or less because they need to push the plot along. \r\nThe characters are rather bland to me. It never really feels like theirmotivations are genuine, but rather that they exist to move the plot. Misaki and Fushimi are the most developed in my opinion because they are really the only ones that have any of their history explained. Kuroh and Yashiro are entirely too uninteresting to be the main characters of this series. They serve their purpose, as does everyone else, but they don't have anything about that that make them interesting away from the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The animation is greatly detailed, even in moments when there isn't a lot of action. My only issue is that the colors are a bit too washed out, but this is something that might not bother most people.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fine. I liked Ben Diskin as Misaki. I also thought that Matt Mercer did well. Everyone else did well, but nothing to stand out. \\n",

            "content": "Since the '90s, the first episode of Escaflowne has been my benchmark episode. It is very well done with beautiful art, animation, music, and special effects on top of a well paced story that ends on an incredible hook. It is so good, even if people don't watch anything else, they absolutely should watch that single episode just to see how great anime can be.\r\nLikewise, the first episode of K will blow people away. The colors, the camera angles, the scenery, interesting characters, lushly animated crowd scenes, and intriguing plot are simply put, compelling beyond belief.\r\nYou have two warring factions under leaders called kings. Theop tells you that the show will be about these two groups fighting each other. Then there's a mystery set up later on in the first episode about Yashiro Isana, who you can see is listed as a main character on this very page. It's set up to be an action show with slight comedic elements, say like Rurouni Kenshin.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? I'm going to stop writing for now. GO WATCH EPISODE ONE. It is amazing. Then come right back.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nBack? Okay! Now you can skip the entire rest of the show. Don't waste your time on it. It's clear just from episode two that that they blew two to three episodes' worth of budget on episode one. That's not the major problem, though. While Escaflowne falls apart at the end, K falls apart in episode two. Specifically, the show turns into a light comedy with action bits. Those two kings in episode one? They don't really hate each other. Those two warring factions? They don't really fight each other very much at all. Eventually, they even pull a piece of animation out of the op and use it in the show. o_o Then they do it again with the same piece.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, the production values take a nosedive in episode two and never recover, as the recycling increases more and more. The intense action-packed show that's set up in episode one dissolves immediately at the very start of episode two because they can't keep up the pace, and that mystery? Trust me when I say that whatever you think the answer is will be a much more satisfying answer than what they came up with. ~_~;\\n\\n\r\nA note about scores. I use a traditional 5 point objective scale:\\n\r\n1 terrible\\n\r\n2 bad\\n\r\n3 average\\n\r\n4 good\\n\r\n5 great\\n\\n\r\nThis is stretched to 10 points, so everything is multiplied by 2 with no half-points allowed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall series animation gets a 2 and art gets a 3.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching all of Escaflowne and knowing the sad fate that befalls the end of that show, I still found it compelling enough to purchase the whole thing on DVD. On the other hand, I would not buy K.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the bottom line is everyone should see episode one of K, then just imagine how the rest of the series goes. Enjoy!",

            "content": "I decided to watch K to scratch that itch when you just watched a decent \"powers\" anime but had no real closure.  You know that feeling don't you?  (Yeah you do!).  Anyways, I didn't have high expectations, just a bit of hope.  From the opening few minutes I really liked it though..it really had a strong identity, was beautiful and stylish, with a laid back soundtrack that just oozed cool.  Of course, that is the spell that K weaves.  I can totally see it being hit or miss with some people really..\r\n[Story]  The story is very media res,as a viewer you pick up as things unfold and there is a rich sense of history as we enter the story.  It's a little confusing at first but the info dump is not too bad.  The main plot is quite focused and there aren't a lot of confusing side plots, just a few nice character threads that add well to the main plot.  Pacing is quite good.  My only main frustration with the story is how passive the main character faction is.  All the cool stuff is driven by other protagonists, although that in itself is kinda the point in places.  There are some beautiful punchy fights that don't outstay their welcome at all and a lot of dialogue that is nice plot building.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/animation]  I've never really heard of GoHands but they delivered some beautiful animation and design in this.  It is so stylish and fluid that at times you can be mesmerised by the riot of colours and action.  Shout out to the Misaki's skateboarding scenes as well (I wish I looked that good on a board).  This anime is total eye-candy!\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]  I'm not a bit fan of constant backing music invading almost every scene but in K it's part of the entire experience with a soft electo or piano and drums riff soundtrack behind almost everything.  It is quite enchanting, although it adds nothing to any action scenes since it calms the tempo of the animation a bit.  It does make this anime feel very chill though.  The OP and ED are totally forgettable though and I found myself skipping them a lot to get on with the story.  I tried both the sub and dub and they are both decent.\\n\\n\r\n[Character]  So conflicted on the characters.  I liked (almost) all of them but it's quite an ensemble cast so none of them get massive development.  The MC is likeable but by his nature so SOOOOO passive that a number of times I wanted to slap him about and shout \"Just do something useful!!\".  The real joy to the characters are that so many are done well enough for you to get to know them, but this is also a problem because you want MORE of them.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]  Oddly, K is an anime that is more than the sum of it's parts.  Whilst it does not feel altogether satisfying it is also not a waste of time.  It doesn't quite inspire any extreme feels but it is very nice to watch and listen to.  Aside from the ending (there is a sequel) it delivered some great fights, nice scenes, OK characters.  Just frustrating about that MC.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]  I did watch the movie followup and sequel as I enjoyed it enough.  I guess I'd say this was pretty OK.",

            "content": "Story - 7/10\r\nThe story was very intriguing. The seven kings, powers, gangs, factions, this whole ordeal with a war and how the powers originated, but it wasn't properly explained. There are seven kings, Silver, Gold, Red, Blue, Colorless, but yet there was no mention of the seventh king. Upon further exploration on the wiki, apparently there's a green king, but this information must've been gathered via a different series or movie about the same anime universe. There were many points in which the words \"I'm confused\" came out of my mouth during this anime. So much so, that I started to worry I was justan idiot. But, unshockingly, it wasn't me, it actually was the anime. This show didn't explain many things, and the things it did, they barely went into detail. Besides their lack of detail, the story was interesting, and I was always at the edge of my seat. The amnesia  was a very cool factor in the beginning episodes, which made the series overall, fun. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nThe visuals were shocking. Very bright, at times, too bright. And the effects when the kings started using their powers was very cool, but overall, not unique, which was disappointing. But still very pretty. I'm not all the smart when it comes to detail in the art, but at times, it lacked detail. At other times, the detail was immense. So I wont take away too many points. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nI watched this series on Netflix, and because their subs suck, I was forced to watch a dubbed version. It wasn't amazing, but I liked their voice actors (for the most part).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters were disappointing. The only two I was actually impressed with were Adolf K. Weismann and Kurou Yatogami. Even though they were both cliche type characters, Weismann really took the cake with his caring for even the most evil, such as the Colorless King. There were background stories on Weismann, Misaki and Saruhiko, but only a little for the latter two. This part the anime is where it lacked most. If I wasn't such a softy, I wouldn't have cared for any of these characters, because they're just cardboard cutouts and honestly, at times, quite boring. But, I still loved them all, and because of that, this section doesn't quite fall down the drain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed myself! While this anime lacked explanations on many parts and was a little chaotic, it was still enjoyable, and re-watchable. I had fun with the characters, especially during the beginning.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a decent one. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the \"Anime of the Century,\" at least, in my opinion. And that's what this is all about. Opinions. If you thought it was terrible, so be it. If you thought it was wonderful, good for you. I think you should be the judge. Just don't go telling everyone that they must accept your opinion.",

Everything comes together in a beautiful way and I cry for an episode and a half. \r\nThere is character development. It's not traditional. Little character development through dialogue, however bythe last couple episodes I had a new understanding of and appreciation for characters I either wasn't sure about, didn't like at all or thought were enemies. Plot development and character development were executed in a way I found refreshing. The audience had the opportunity to see into things by the full effect of the show rather than just dialogue or action alone. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Its a bit weird for sure, and not a weird like \"shin-chan\" weird or even \"kill-a-kill\" weird. Its in a class of its own but I feel like the crew, writers, animators, etc, had a serious goal in mind when creating this anime. I think they achieved it: stunning art, confusing story, simple message and really quite beautiful overall.",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!\r\nSo I watched K: Project the first episode when it aired, but was devastated that I couldn't find the rest. A few years later, I've found and watched the entire thing, and I can say without a doubt it was worth every damn second of my time.\r\nStory: 8\r\nWhile there is the outwardly generic \"city-ruled-by-opposing-factions\" and the \"institution-vs-viligilante\" tropes, K follows the butterfly effect of a politically motivated murder. The pacing is superb because a lot of the time, you get both exposition and action at the simultaneously. Then, there's the constantly switching POVs, telling you more about the plot while focussing on acharacter. It is essentially wrapping a rotten apple in sticky chocolate. Beautiful on the outside, it leaves you slightly horrified and traumatised by the end...\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: poison dart in a raisin tart\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nNo one can disagree that K is a visual masterpiece. There's panning, distortion, foreshadowing and a superb use of colour. From the beginning, the warm colours of Homra make you feel at home, then the slight unease of the sterile Scepter 4, to the opulence of Misashira tower and the detachedness of the Himmelreich, colour is everywhere. Its what you see in the contrasting fights, the eyes and *headshot* I can't even put it into words how fluid the action is, everything just naturally tumbles from one place to another.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: eye candy extravaganza\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nMelancholy and upbeat is the best way to describe it. When the orchestral music comes on, you feel it in your chest. The opening is a bit heartbreaking because it reflects the angsty, walls closing in feeling you get from the MCs. Best part is, it's not overdramatic or overdone. Also, the voices. Mikoto's deep voice sent shivers down my spine every time he spoke, Reisi's voice is like silk, the dialogues are just so natural! Even when there were cringey \"you baka/uragirimono\" type conversations (read: Fushimi v. Misaki) and the loudness was annoying, it built the atmosphere for the plot. The voice acting was generally on point\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: orgasm in my ears\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned in the story section, its the contrast between characters that really tied the thing together. The Kings are each distinct, but you can feel the loneliness, the pressure weighing down, the struggle to keep your loved ones safe annnnd.....them failing. Tragically. With horrible consequences. Speaking as a fangirl, some of the moments made me go OMG KISS ALREADY, the sexual tension is well done. I do however, dislike the lack of female leads. Anna tends to be just a damsel in distress fixture, while Seri is bitchy MILF type (or a Riza Hawkeye ripoff, whichever you prefer). Even so, they do fit into the universe perfectly, and their attitudes aren't fake or overly fanservice-y. Rage and helplessness are also major themes, and the character reactions are relatable, you can see yourself reacting the same way.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: real af\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThere were moments when you'd go like, okkkk there's the plot hole or just look away for a bit because on screen didn't matter. But that's fine because that is a needed break from all the emotions going on. I have seen many negative reviews for the anime, but I'm firmly convinced that it's for a slightly older audience, 18ish in my opinion. Why? Because there's betrayal, angst and morbidity, and if you are feeling any kind of pressure, K will kick you in the gonads because every character shows that strain of waiting, not feeling adequate and every other emotion in the spectrum. I personally cried at Episode 13 and the heartbreak is so bittersweet I'd erase my memory of it just to feel it all over again.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: Oh the feels....\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI am definitely watching K: Return of the Kings, already seen K: Missing Kings, and am reading through the prequels. Watched the radio dramas, read the card game and basically went full out otaku on it. It's the first series to hit home at me from the gorgeous animation to the fleshed out relationships. Like Durarara it works with a wide cast, and it does sometimes leave you underwhelmed, but if you have any free time, I recommend it unreservedly.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dnr: go watch it",

            "content": "First off, I'm going to start by saying I will not be giving the plot. When I watched K, I didn't read a single thing about it and just simply watched it straight through. If you want to get the full enjoyment out of K, you have to be careful, because \r\n- some of its greatest moments (plot twists and such) being ruined could decrease K's value probably in half.-\r\nI've read many reviews stating that K is a 3 or 4, that there's hardly any character development. Well, I'm here to explain.\tFirst off,\r\n- K is slow.-\r\n Yes. I think most everyone can agree on that.You don't find out anything of consequence regarding the universe until episode 3. And this is out of 13 episodes. The entire first half, and a good portion of the last, you\u2019re just \\n\\n\r\n- thinking \"what the hell is going on?\" And I loved that.-\\n\\n\r\n Every time \\n\\n\r\n-K gave you an answer to one of your previous questions, you got about two or three more questions you wanted answered.-\\n\\n\r\nIt left me feeling like I had to finish, even though I'd been up for 24 hours straight, so I could know how it ended. \\n\\n\r\n-It kept me entranced the entire time.-\\n\\n\r\n And yes,\\n\\n\r\n- if you don't pay attention, to nuances or facial expressions or (especially) dialogue, you are going to be so lost and never catch up,-\\n\\n\r\n leaving you with a bad opinion. Comparatively, dialogue is limited in this anime, and \\n\\n\r\n-nearly everything said in it has a purpose.-\\n\\n\r\n Even inconsequential actions and words at the beginning come back towards the end as something BIG. Now, secondly, I'm going to address the whole \"barely any to no character development\". I'm going to say this:\\n\\n\r\n- K was never meant to be a standalone anime!-\\n\\n\r\n It's merely meant to be a glimpse into this universe and at these characters to get you hooked. \\n\\n\r\n=There are manga, novels, and even CD/Radio dramas that flush out characters that you barely even noticed in the anime.-\\n\\n\r\n Pretty much everyone gets their spotlight, and there are still more coming out to help give these characters meaning. So, yeah, if you don't want to invest the time in such a lengthy story, then this might not be for you. Because, personally, I believe that stand alone, the anime is good. However, if you want it to be great, if you want to be so emotionally invested in these characters that when you re-watch the anime you are nearly in tears, then invest. It is well worth it. The mangas and novels and such are mainly prequels. \\n\\n\r\n-These show characters interacting that you thought only had a hate or disinterested relationship with each other and having their very core shaken by the other. These show why the characters are so emotionally invested in one another. These show why the characters do what they do.-\\n\\n\r\n The anime is the end, the exception being the few sequels that have come out and the movie, and you watch it first. (Seriously, watch the anime first.\\n\\n\r\n- Don't think \"Oh, I'll just go read all of that stuff then watch the anime.\" They won't make as much sense then or give off the impression they were meant to.)-\\n\\n\r\n You come in after the betrayals and death and bonds being formed and have little to no idea how they formed. Then you go back to the beginning and read about these characters that have so much hope and so many plans. You see characters that were dead when the anime started alive and kicking. You see their lives and how they affected those still living.\\n\\n\r\n- Left with the epithet, \"This is a story full of happiness,\" (it's only meant for Memories of Red but it felt like it applied to all of them for me)you really realize the depth and emotions of these characters.-\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now that I've finished that little rant, I'll go on to mention what everyone else tends to mention. \\n\\n\r\n-The art is beautiful. The sound track is amazing.-\\n\\n\r\n I still sing the opening because it's just so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\n-The story plot at first appears generic, but it gets its own interesting twist to it through all the sci-fi and fantasy in the story.-\\n\\n\r\n Once again, I will mention how slow the pacing is. \\n\\n\r\n-The entire second episode seems almost completely pointless, though it's freaking hilarious.-\\n\\n\r\n The tone of the story seems to shift from humor to serious so many times in the first half until it settles on almost entirely serious about half way through. There's still a little humor up until the final few episodes, though. It gets really fast at the end, and a lot of people criticize this. Personally, I feel it fits. \\n\\n\r\n-The last half is a dramatic rush up to the climax. I don't feel as if the writers were just rushing to tie up loose ends, but more like they had planned the pacing out and had intended to make the pacing match the mood of the story.-\\n\\n\r\n The ending is rushed, because the characters themselves have become rushed. While at the beginning, the characters were frantic, yes, they weren't as frantic as the last four episodes or so.\\n\r\nPersonally, \\n\\n\r\n-I think GoHands is genius. Not because of the story, but because of their smart marketing style. This is one of the main reasons why I feel all the flaws people point out in K aren't really flaws, but intentional to further sells.-\\n\\n\r\n This might piss some people off, but I personally see no problem with it.\\n\\n\r\n- This is their livelihood after all, and I see no shame in them trying their best at making money and appealing to fans. Which is why I don't fault them with their obvious fan service-\\n\\n\r\n. It doesn't detract from the story in my opinion, and some of it even goes with the character's personalities. \\n\\n\r\n-Instead of seeing \"GAY\", just think of it as that person being an \"in your face\" type of guy.-\\n\\n\r\n (Not to mention socially awkward with no regards to personal boundaries.) \\n\\n\r\n-That's how I choose to view it, and am happy to overlook the obvious panty shots and over the top cleavage. -\\n\\n\r\nSo, give K a shot, and keep an open mind about everything. I think it'll make your experience much more enjoyable. I give the anime probably a 7.5-8/10 and the whole enterprise an 9/10, but honestly I'm not good at that kind of thing so you might not want to take those numbers to heart.  \\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for something worth watching, give this a try.\r\nProject K fails to reach higher because it succeeds in its purpose, it succeeds in a story driven anime although having the perfect environment to create such a masterpiece had it been more battle driven or atleast balanced in both terms. \r\nI do promise it gets better with each episode tho.\r\nGetting straight to the review:\r\nStory:  6\r\n(resuming) K tells the story of a young boy who got involved in a \"war\" between 7 kings with super powers. He discovers his identity not to be as his memories tell.\r\nStanding amazing in terms of creativity and tastytwitsts, the main story doesnt fall too far behind. I see it mediocre in terms of both conclusion and beggining, understanding of course that it has both an open \"start\" and \"end\" to it, it really doesn't develop as much as it \"promisses\", having a slow almost \"boring like\" progression. It mainly falls from a given 9 due to its utmost disapointing lack of propper organization or explanation endwise and almost uninsteresting progression rate.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAbsolutelly amazing environment, theme, colour and detail, not to forget the animations that simply leave you drolling, Everything seems alive.\\n\r\nGoHands did it's job, congratulations on a well deserved 10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are proper, contrary to what others have said i actually thought both songs fit it's videos; the soundtracks however where good and amazing. Sound effects are good, just not good enough for a 10.\\n\r\nMikio End\u014d made a very good job with the sound, expecially the soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nYashiro, the main character, is truly \"introduced\" and presented in a very intelligent and interesting way: first you will meet his true heart, held by a semi-untrue personality (unknown untill certain point) by following this character's daily life at school and even after entering the main story, as the story progresses, at a certain point, when met with his real past, you will meet the real characters personality and easily bond with him. The secondary characters however, having only around 1 or 2 actually being averagelly presented, the rest of them are actually left almost \"unknown\" where the author kind of makes you interested in the actually coolest and best characters but disapoints you in never actually meeting them. \\n\r\nIn terms of depht and compexity most characters are actually average.\\n\r\nThis is one of the things that hold the anime back... if you're goint to have a story driven anime, try not the have 2 or 3... or 4 guys have similar personalities... and please dont throw random \"hints\" if you're not actually going to either mention or show us more of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI had fun watching, though you wont really be THAT interested in watching the next episode, which is in my opinion, a necessity to every anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nSomehow disapointing on how such important details like powers, environment (i mean the whole world or perhaps the city itself) and characters are unexploited. You will see yourself wanting to see more of what isn't going to be shown throughout these 13 episodes.\\n\r\nSuch adjective wouldn't be better, its \"good\". Its one of those simple animes that end up being \"typical\" and common, yet somehow stands out from most.\\n\\n",

            "content": "K is a beautifully well written anime in my opinion. It's short and concrete, there's nothing really confusing about it and it's easy to understand. The world in the anime is slightly different than our own, and involves various factions of groups, each one with it's own entertaining characters. There is a sense of good and bad, though even characters from the \"bad group\" are entertaining, have good intentions, and vice verse with the \"good group\" each group is led by a king who holds this sword which gives them a specific sort of power or trademark, almost like magic. for instance there is animmortal king and you can probably guess his trademark. (hint. it isn't the ability to summon ducks) The music is well portrayed, and seems to have a belonging there. It is a warm, soft hearted anime, a comedy at times, but also a endearing drama, with enough action, chaos and plot twists to keep the watcher involved and thinking. The story, again, is well thought out and seems to do justice to the overall story. The art is very well done, as you can imagine from a 2013 anime. I enjoyed it very much, and i cannot wait for the second season. I highly recommend this short superb anime to anyone.",

            "content": "I had put off this anime for so long, but since it's summer and I decided to catch up on my hold list, I thought why not give this anime that got hype for the pretty art, a chance? \r\nI started watching K knowing nothing about it. I usually look up background info before starting up an anime, because I really don't like following the 3 episode rule. So this time I if ignored my past ways, and dove right into K! And I'm sure glad I did.\r\nStory: 8\r\nK starts with your typical white haired boy named Shiro. He's well liked by everyone at school.Life for Shiro is peaceful, until he is attacked and chased by these guys while he was out for a school errand. Running away, he accidentally gets cornered, and when all seems doomed, you have the black haired boy, Kuroh dash in from of the sky to save Shiro. What seemed like a rescue turned out to be Shiro's turn of luck because now he's being targeted by these enemy groups called HOMRA- the Red Clan Scepter 4- the Blue Clan, as well as the boy Kuroh, for having murdered one of their so called Kings and a member of their group?!?!?!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI shouldn't even be giving them an 8 by the sole fact that there was 0 character development. But, I'm not since I thoroughly enjoyed the little hints that were thrown here and there and because I quickly grew to like the characters and even have favorites. One could quickly note from the little that was revealed, how the character's personalities were. Although the characters didn't get any background exposure, you can read that stuff in the novels. To my knowledge, they have been translated in English by fans. You can easily find them if you google around.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nOh man. The hype the anime got for the art is pretty spot on. The characters which you can easily see on the promo posters, are made really nicely. it doesn't stop there though. The expressions and movements they make are highly detailed. The first 2 episodes were brilliantly made. The scene were Yasu is riding his skateboard through the city, and the action filled scenes, showed the true wonders of how cgi should be in anime. These scenes had me awed in amazement. People keep bashing that the team focused too much on the visual concept instead of the story, but that's just wrong. The visual concept is PART of the story. K wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't like this. The colors are a major aspect that set off the ongoing and non drifting mood that is recurring throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThe anime only has 13 episodes, which I think is good since animes that drag on (especially with useless filler episodes) are annoying. But for some reason, this seemed to be the major issue to others. Some think it was rushed and badly made, but I actually found this anime really enjoyable since I watched it all one sitting, and was at the edge of my seat at that. I love and find the the whole concept of clans and kings to be really original. The twist and turn of events got to me and left me craving for more, which is why this anime instantly turned into a favorite to me.",
