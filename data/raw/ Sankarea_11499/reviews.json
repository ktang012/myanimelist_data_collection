            "content": "So imagine this. Close your eyes and picture yourself walking to school, having a great day, realizing that you just aced a test, talked to a boy/girl you like, ate a good meal, and come home. You go to your room to relax but the first thing you see is a zombie girl lying half-naked on your bed. You try to to tell yourself if this is reality or fiction but just can't seem to do it.\r\nHonestly, that's the feeling I got when I first started watching this series. In other words, very surprising. Originally, I didn't have high expectation of this series. No, itis not because the series is tagged as \u201cecchi\u201d by MAL or the fact that the main character has a zombie fascination (more like a fetish to be honest). However, after watching about half the series that aired already, I have a  hope for this series as it surprised me quite a bit, for the better. \\n\\n\r\nThe story tells the young boy named Chihiro Furuya, who has a strange hobby, or more a fascination on zombies. Now, there's something you don't see or hear everyday. However, despite being strange as it sounds, it is what our our main character loves. His obsession with zombies can be traced to the point of obsession and even a fetish. Sounds strange right? I'm sure this would definitely be something strange even for any of us considered to be an otaku. The story continues on from there where he meets another girl, an idol, to be exact who later after unfortunate circumstances becomes what he \"loves\". As for our main heroine (or maybe anti-hero later? I mean, she's freaking dead already), she is an unique character. Despite being one of the most beautiful girl at school, she strives hard to gain \u201cfreedom\u201d or to be free from her life. Most prominently, she tries to escape her circumstances at home because what goes beyond those doors are circumstances that some of us may puke or feel disgust about. It is definitely something I'm sure most of us don't want to be placed in our own circumstances in real life. (unless you like living in big mansions and get free tuition) \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have other characters like Ranko Sa\u014dji (also known as Wanko). She is rather tomboyish judged by her attitude and appearance but there's some history between her and our zombie loving MC, a history that can be traced back to puppy love, zombie movies, and all that rest of good stuff. It would definitely be interesting to see what kind of rivalry or friendship she may later develop towards our school beauty, aka Rea.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, my impressions of story so far is great. Even the very first episode got me hooked like a zombie. The movement of the story so far is somewhat slow but easy to follow and as the series continues, we see some of the unraveling details such as Rea's background. More importantly, the tone of the story becomes darker (mixed in with comedy the same time) as we see what is going on behind the scenes of Rea's life. We also see the history between Ranko and Chihiro as well as childhood memories are treasure that most us should keep placed in our hearts.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I'm not too impressed. Well, let's just say that when I first saw that Studio Deen was the studio involved for this, my hopes were dead like a zombie. However, after watching these first few episodes, I'm glad they proved me wrong. I like the style and art of the series so far even if it's a bit plain. After all, art isn't something that determines the overall enjoyment of a series. Don't believe me? Just ask Gurren Lagann. As for the sound and music, I think so far it does seem to fit. I mean, it's not something eerie like Shigofumi: Letters of the Departed but you'll notice it soon once you get into the series. There's also emotional music mixed in that reflects on some of the mood of the story. Then, there's the melody of comedic music thrown in during lighter atmospheres. Overall, I'd say that the soundtrack isn't something worth an Emmy Award but also compelling to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm enjoying this series as it is so far. It's not something I'll be obsessed about as much as the main character for zombies but definitely enjoying it at an anime fan level. The story (although somewhat easy to predict) has drama with an emotional background mixed in with comedy and possible romance. The characters are appealing and the soundtrack fits well. My only concern at this point is Studio DEEN as it's definitely not my favorite anime studio of this world. But beyond that, I see potential for this rare little gem this Spring Season. \\n\\n",

Regardless, this show is very entertaining.\r\nSpoiler Free, outside from the summary information.\r\nQuick and simple for those that want to know if this is a go or not.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThis story was very enjoyable to me. It had just the right amount of comedy and ecchi without hurting the quality of the entire show. It pulls you in to see what on earth could happen next. With the whole plot around zombies, you cant usually go wrong, usually. The story will haveyou wanting things to happen and wish things continue, since theres only one season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was very good and on par with what I enjoy looking at. Everything fit and looked amazing the whole time I was watching it. I really enjoy eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was fine. There isn't a negative thing I can really say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThis is why the show is special, the characters. One crazy about zombies, one too rich to be free, best cat in the world and more await when you decide to start this anime. The chemistry between everyone is just great. The show really shines when you want to know more about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe show was, like I said before, very enjoyable. The characters, plot and art all mix together to make a decent anime worthy of anyones time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Conclusion: 8\\n\r\nOverall, this was a pleasant journey. I begged for more in the end and that to me means that the anime did a great job. You'll love the situations they get into as well as the overall story. The art work just adds more praise to such a wonderful anime. If you like the idea of zombies and a bit of ecchi/romance then give it a try. I did and was thoroughly surprised.",

            "content": "Falling into 6 genres, Sankarea lacked a specific direction and yet remained enjoyable.\r\nThe first 3-4 episodes focused on mainly building the setting on which the rest of the show would be based on, and from there it took the direction of a typical romantic comedy SoL type anime. Being a fan of many SoL anime, I found the rest of the show to be enjoyable. Those who do not enjoy SoL shows may be disappointed after watching the well paced, plot based first 3 episodes when the majority of the show is a character based comedy.\r\nAs for horror and ecchi, both were incorporated into Sankareain an unobtrusive manner. Whist the first 3 episodes had horror undertones, the rest featured horror in a more comedic manner. Nothing overdone or such. Ecchi was also incorporated smoothly and presented in a subtle manner. Nothing too distracting and in-your-face yet still enough to provide service to ecchi-fans.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual score breakdown\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nAfter the first 3 or so episodes, the plot of Sankarea quickly breaks down into something similar to a SoL, with periodic arcs. Nothing really remarkable. Heck, the majority of the anime IS character/comedy based. It's still enjoyable, just don't expect some amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is simply superb. Not only is the quality excellent, the character design is also well done and each character takes on their own unique art style and appearance. The background is nicely detailed, and the atmosphere and lighting done just right. Animation is smooth as well. After watching the absolutely stunning animation/art of Fate/Zero though, I really can't give Sankarea a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nVoice acting is well done and brings out the personalities of all the characters. Background music could be a bit better, but it still integrates into the show quite well. The OP and ED are both excellent. Being an audiophile, I found everything to be recorded nice and squeaky clean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOther than the story, the character was the second weakest part of the show. Both lead characters were well personified and likeable to some degree. Unfortunately, every character was a subcategory of a clich\u00e9, but kept me interested through the rather... unusual circumstances the lead goes through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nMuch of the enjoyment stems from the comedy. Although it is no where as good as the better SoL/Romantic comedy/Comedy I've watched, Sankarea was mostly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI believe Sankarea deserves better than a mediocre 6 or 7. The whole quality of the show is very impressive, and even though the plot and character is slightly weak, I give Sankarea a very good 8/10.",

            "content": "Tell me if you've heard of this before. A high school boy dreams to be with his ideal girl. Not too uncommon among romantic tales, but here's something that might run your blood cold, pun intended. He likes zombies. He really likes zombie girls, and one day, POOF! Due to plot, he gets to live with one. With a premise like this, what could possibly go wrong? Quite a bit actually, yet Sankarea stands out as quite the opposite, as something special. It, however, requires some context.\r\nAdapted from a manga of the same name by Mitsuru Hattori, Sankarea was directed by Shinichi Omata, with in-showcharacter designs by Kyuuta Sakai. Produced by Studio Deen, for something designated with genre labels such as \u201ccomedy\u201d and \u201cecchi,\u201d the series begins rather morbidly. Chihiro Furuya has spent the last several evenings putting his enthusiast facet to work searching for a way to revive his beloved deceased cat. During a couple of these dusks, he overhears the strained cries of a girl his age, desperate to lead a normal life with friends and outings. She's no other than Rea Sanka, the school idol of the local prestigious girl's academy and the sheltered heir to a rather wealthy and influential name. And, through one direct encounter, the zombie otaku and the school idol end up hanging out and working through the nights on what now became a joint project, neither being intimidated by the other. In the most natural of fashions, through this relationship the show breaks down the walls of the stereotypes that would have otherwise defined these two. Chihiro, outside his odd persona, and Rea, outside her perfect exterior, reveal themselves to us as characters of depth: sensible, quirky, considerate, kind. In fact, the show does very well, for the most part, in coaxing out the stuff of substance from many of the cast, even the most despicable ones.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, comedy is a prominent fixture in this show, and a welcome one at that, characters playing off one another in funny and even clever ways that forgo heavy reliance on exaggerated visuals. In fact, such restraint promotes that underlying sentiment of unease that balances the frivolity and serves to make the show compelling in a meaningful way. It's this ever-present feeling of tragedy that makes the moments that are meant to be tragic doubly so and the instances that are sweet more bitter than before, tragedy that's driven by two factors:\\n\\n\r\nOne is zombieism itself. Far from being just a fun, but ultimately needless accessory, the show utilizes key aspects of this condition to derive really compelling drama. The specter of mental health and physical well-being wasting away overtime looms in whatever air our two leads breathe, and while the living dead gain abilities such as super-human strength and insensitivity to pain, they also lose precious things that we, as people, take for granted. The capacity to bask in the sun, to feel warmth, to shed tears.\\n\\n\r\nTwo is how zombieism is applied to Rea. To live under the confines of a suffocating patriarch who's, at best, neurotically obsessive and, at worst, possessively abusive to his daughter, where his affection for her is that of a blur between love and lust, and a jealous matriarch who doesn't give a damn, she's like a songbird in a cage, crooning for her freedom. And so the songbird becomes a zombie. A tragic paradox rings true: She feels more alive dead than she otherwise felt living, and here's where everything falls together. No matter how much she aches to be normal, she can't. She's cheated out of experiencing life to the fullest because her condition chains her down.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show flirts around humorously with the premise of zombie love, it also holds no illusions to its implications: wish-fulfillment, if not precisely necrophilia. But taking care of a zombie girl is a lot more emotionally demanding than can be preconceived, Rea living with Chihiro as much a romantic nod as it is sanctuary and liberty from her folks, the chemistry of this relationship, from before the girl becomes a zombie, to after the girl becomes a zombie, feels undeniably genuine, and the question is brought up constantly, aloud and not. Is this a lust toward zombie girls, or a love toward a girl that now happens to be a zombie?\\n\\n\r\nAny review of this show would be remiss without at least a mention about the direction. While this is Omichi's first project as the head director, he's worked on a number of Shaft projects. He's a Shaft veteran, and, for anyone familiar with Shaft's style, that influence is apparent from the get-go: camera angles, theatrical metaphor, abstract imagery etc. But rather than being a mere copy and paste of Akiyuki Shinbo, whose application of said style can be heavy-handed and sometimes irrelevant to the narrative (to make the visuals superficially striking through its unorthodox-ness, in other words), Omichi co-opts the style as something his own, that carries meaning every time is utilized in place of the mundane (which I think is rather beautifully rendered, by the way) rather than something that is abused for novelty's sake. Something like a painting or curtains rising and falling to bring the audience in and out of flashbacks adds to sad and bad memories in not only a new way. It adds a whole new layer of melancholy by probing the emotional implications of these ruminations. Something like an arm fading away into nothing in place of a normal slap of the hand conveys far more than a one-fold rejection. In addition, the pacing goes at a slow, but natural pace that's embedded with a decent amount of subtly that allows the audience to really know about the characters rather than know of them. An example of said subtly can be found in the male protagonist's usually reserved deadpan of a snark sister, Mero, both in Episode 1 and Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if it can be helped, I recommend watching Episode 9 before watching Episode 8, since Episode 9 takes place chronologically before Episode 8 anyway, and has unfortunately been perceived as a rude detour, what with it being placed in a middle of an ongoing crisis, so much so that its beauty and genius has been dismissed as mediocre filler.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these wonderful things being said, the show suffers substantially on a few fronts. Ecchi. There are actually interesting uses for it in the show. Sparingly, it's great when it's used to convey atmospheres of the frankness of freedom and the desperation for affection. Sparingly, it's amusing in comedic moments, or at least tolerable. However, the show also goes somewhat heavy-handed on it for titillation's sake, something which mars characterization and, in general, is just in bad taste, what with how grim, but well-told the series otherwise is. And while the characterization is very good, for the most part, the show also plays up the gimmicky troppiness of some of the characters in a way that can get irritating at times. \\n\\n\r\nNow to end on a happy note, pun intended. Well, maybe not happy, per say, but the audio and visuals of the OP and especially the ED are impressive. The OP \u201cEscoragoto\u201d was done by nano.RIPE, and while I can't say I'm a fan of nano.RIPE's vocalist on her own, the melody, combined with the musical accompaniment, drum set, electric guitar, electric bass, makes for an energetic, uplifting piece that, even then, is tempered somewhat by some of its bitter visuals. Outside of introducing the cast, the OP does a great job saying a lot about each major character without saying anything, in particular, the segment involving Rea surrounded by her parents and household, this really fake, almost dead countenance of geniality pasted on her face when gripped on the shoulder by her father. Even the title \u201cEscoragoto,\u201d translated from Japanese, means \u201cfabrication\u201d or \u201cpipe dream.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nBut if there's any one concise thing I could show to anyone that demonstrates the level of respect the show has for its material in a brief one minute, thirty minute music video, it would be the ED \u201cAbove Your Hand,\u201d by Anabel. Soft, sincere, beautiful vocals accompanied by classical guitar, then electric bass, then the drama of the drums set and embellishing echoes, before revolving back to guitar, the visuals, which take place in the backdrop of the bowling alley Chihiro and Rea first met personally in, plays well with the classic dichotomy of dark and light which, when the female protagonist faces the light's source, is greeted by the male protagonist. She's much a figurative as well as literal person brought back to life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot wrong with Sankarea. In fact, it does a lot of things right. It dares to something smarter, darker. More insightful, and heart-warming too. And, for the most part, it succeeds on every account.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sankarea an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Sankarea is an adaptation of Hattori Mitsuru's light novel series. Mostly, the anime stayed true to the manga and as such many of my issues to do with the show stemmed from the poorly written script. \r\n*Please stop reading here if you have not seen the show and do not like spoilers*\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story is of a young sheltered girl trying to free herself from the clutches of her very strange family - namely an abnormally obsessed father and an indifferent mother. The main story itself was quite interesting but that is where the positive ends. In trying to establish a deeper story, Sankarea poorlyspends its time revealing the back-story of some of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin, episode 7 which was dedicated to explain how Wanko developed feelings for the protagonist had issues. It begins by her crying as she runs alone in a cemetery. Viewers are left confused as to the reason she cries. Did she seriously just run into a cemetery to get scared? The point is, for a show that feeds the viewer information and does not employ undertones, this one scene is poorly explained.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the show never makes clear if Chihiro's family is aware of Rea's 'zombie' circumstance. For most of the show, his Dad and sister seem confused as to why Rea chooses to only eat those hydrangea leaves, however in episode 9, it seems that Mero is fully aware that Rea is a zombie. On that note, did they seriously place that filler episode 9 in between the \"climax\" of the show? Talk about terrible sequencing.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the show signaled the possibility of a second season but I cannot stress how poorly done it was. It did not create the cliff-hanger effect intended, instead it just left the audience feeling dumbfounded. Why would the director even end the show there instead of a bit earlier when some resolution was achieved (after Rea's Dad left)? \\n\\n\r\nThe scene where Chihiro fends off the dog to save Wanko was pathetic. The dog just stood there and barked without attacking for ages and was scared away by a little kid who looked like he could support the weight of the bat... unreal but effective in winning over Wanko's heart.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that there was episode 10 about Rea's mother. But that will discussed more in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art did not break new grounds. The background and scenery was good but the characters sometimes looked strange from angled shots. The use of changing weathers to create an atmosphere was over-used to the point that it didn't create the desired effect when it really mattered (episode 11). \\n\\n\r\nThere are also many inconsistencies in artwork that should not have been ignored. For instance, when Rea fell down and got up there were not wound marks left. Also when Chihiro was stabbed, where is the blood when Rea removes the blade from his body? Why is it that he only starts to bleed profusely once he has collapsed and finished his little \"talk\"? There is no suitable excuse given how much blood was poured earlier in the show when Rea \"died\". \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a decent job. Although it was probably hard for them because the characters were lacking in personality. The ending song was mediocre. While liking some other works by Nano.Ripe, the opening song may have been good, but did not seem to fit the show very well. The music in the show itself was just okay as it did not really enhance the feel of the show in any way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI don't know if I have ever seen such a pitiful cast before. The characters are about as uninspired as the title of the show. There is zero character development, mainly because every character is one-dimensional. It is almost as if the characters were given one stereotypical role, and that is all they do, quite horribly though. It is difficult to relate or like any character in the show, because they are ultimately just empty shells. They may think or talk about their feelings but this does not give them extra depth. Additionally, these characters talk about responsibility and things they need to do. Yet none of these things seem to be very high in their agenda. Here is an example: How does Chihiro plan to preserve Rea's body? He decides to stop trying to look into books and follows his grandfather's advice to observe. What can possibly achieved from this is only noting down the rate Rea rots away. But I guess his pervy and lazy desires are satisfied in the process and so he sticks with it. \\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough in episode 10, Rea's mother while wallowing in self pity and filled with tears she continues to watch on as her husband takes naked photos of his daughter. The servant who also knows of this does nothing to intervene. It seems that Aria does not feel enough anger nor does she have enough morality to stop the act. Also, the servant who knows of it does nothing as well... very strange that they aren't calling the child abuse hotline or something. Yes, the characters in Sankarea are unbelievable. Another example is when Chihiro gets stabbed, it doesn't seem to matter to all the maids watching. Their loyalty is truly commendable. Also, after getting up why didn't Chihiro just report Danichirou for assault, did he forgive that bastard after seeing how \"cute\" Rea was in a nurse outfit? \\n\\n\r\nAs per normal, the main character in a shounen is always dense but Chihiro was surprisingly sharp in episode 6 when he told Wanko \"She's  (Rea) not my girlfriend or anything\" as a way to thank Wanko for donating some clothes. It's almost as if he knew Wanko's feelings in episode 6 but not in the rest of the show... Interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nSankarea had potential but was poorly executed. It did not satisfy the genres listed. No horror, lack luster comedy, and little romance... If anything, this anime did not even present romance in the roundabout fashion that many shounen do. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of real emotions and unlikable characters really made this show a difficult watch.",

Zombies in fiction are generally considered gross, and having a romantic obsession considered weird. This show knows this and has fun with it whenever possible. But that is not the only way that it is hilarious. The dialogue, the characters, they all work together for great comedy. It's funny, engaging, weird, and surprisingly heartfelt. I would recommend it.",

            "content": "It pains me a lot to give this series a 7. In fact, I really want to give it a 9 or 10 for this review.  However, a few things stop it from being higher, actually only two things really. The first thing is simple. It never keeps the amazement factor rolling, the first three episodes were fantastic, but it slow goes to great, then good, then just plain OK. The second, and in my opinion much more important thing is that it stop just when things get interesting. It force me to read the manga from which this is adapted from and actuallymade me a lot more disappointed in the anime. The Manga is fantastic, easily one of the best I have ever read, in fact currently it is my second favorite of all time. If the anime had gotten enough support, or if it had gotten enough care to completely adapt the manga through and through then this could easily be a different review where I say ,\"This is the best anime ever no exaggeration.\" Alas, it is not, so it pains me immensely to have to give it a score of only good.\\n\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nIt is definitely interesting. It is a blend of romantic comedy, horror, ecchi, zombie (yes, zombies are in my mind it own separate genre, sort of like how it is for gaming), and even a little bit of action. It starts off intriguing, but after episode four things start to become chaotic. It feels like a chronological mess (which to people who has read the manga, it is) and things seems to be out of place, or it feels like an event was suppose to happen but didn't. The ending was also felt incomplete and felt like a setup for something else. However, I will say that in the story department this anime is amazing at creating side stories and giving us background details on some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nYes, Sankarea only gets a 7 for art. Yes I know most people would give a much higher score with it beautiful environment, but to be quite honest I seen better, from the same year and from anime such as Sword Art Online and a bunch more. The character design are also pretty average outside a few exception like Rea and Chihiro and a few other.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nYeah, you saw the score correctly. No typos and accidents, the music is fantastic through and through. I don't know the name of the composer, but once I do I will listen to every song compose by him/her. Other then the two reasons mention in to introduction, the music is another huge reason why it pains me greatly give the anime a OK score. Each track match the tone of the event and two songs, Honto no Kimochi and Sukeru Hitomi, stands as some of my favorite songs from not only anime, but of all mediums gaming including (which is quite an amazing feat, cause I like myself some game music).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nNow we get to the one that was the most greatly affected by the short runtime. Don't get me wrong, the show stills have great character - Rea being one of my favorite character even if we only consider the anime. However, the anime is missing much need explanation and character development for the other characters which the manga provides. It provides enough for me to get interested, but stops short of me caring about any of the characters besides the above mentioned Rea.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nAs with any review, anime or otherwise, the enjoyment is not part of the final verdict.The reason is because I may love a series, but not be able to give a good score for it because of it's up irrefutable flaws. This is one of those cases. I love Sankarea it have a lot of morals and ideals that are similar to mine, and Rea is one of my favorite characters and IS my favorite female protagonist. Also as stated the music is amazing which greatly factors and can even change my personal enjoyment on anything, anime or not. Also as stated above I read the Manga which allows me to make sense of the cryptic story and allows be to care for each characters even minor ones. It is extremely disappointing that this anime didn't adapt everything otherwise my overall score could be identical to my enjoyment one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:7\\n\r\nAt this point I probably sound like a broken tape recorder so I really don't want to repeat what I have said a million time. But I really need to stress that this anime could have been a \"This is the best thing since sliced bread!\" anime instead of a meh one if it had done a full adaptation of the manga. So here's me hoping for season two, really crossing my finger on it.\\n",

His world revolves around zombies & the type of romance he's looking for is with a dead girl.... Weird tastes right? The story starts out pretty subtle & introduces Chihiro & expresses his zombie madness. On a day like no other a tragedy occurs within his household. There's one family member short. His family cat happened to die. Chihiro becomes emotionally unstable so he tries to resurrect his cat Baabu. As the story progresses it starts to revolvearound Rea Sanka whom Chihiro spy's on during his resurrection process of Baabu. A few days later an accident occurs in which Sanka figues out that she was being watched. The story progresses from there and they meet for the first time & have a long chat about zombies & try to get on each others nerves. The chats pretty normal except for the fact that they talk about zombies in such a eerie place & find it natural. Well thats all I'll say because I don't want to spoil it. To tell you the truth there isn't much to go on whether Sankarea will live up to its name from the first episode alone. Apparently I happened to find it quite suitable to my tastes because I want to see FUNimation's creativity with zombie romance which I think will be quite amusing. I'm really looking forward to more episodes & its getting really hard to bottle up the excitement.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nSankarea is a 13-episode anime series created by studio Deen. The story follows Chihiro Fuwuya a zombie fanatic who spends the majority of his time watching zombie and horror movies. One day his cat Babu is ran over by a car. A saddened Chihiro attempts to resurrect his cat with the help of a troubled girl called Rea Sanka.\r\nWhen I finished high school of the dead I found myself craving for more zombie-oriented anime. After searching around on the internet I saw some recommendations and the first notable one I saw was Sankarea. My expectations as from the previous anime were gore, violence and over-the-topballs to wall action. That which I did not receive\u2026 I did however happen to get a very pleasant surprise in the form of a undead romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nChihiro is the main protagonist for the show and he is without a doubt my favourite character in the series. He struggles to come to terms with the death of his cat and he digs him up from the grave in order to resurrect him. Now I know the concept of this seems creepy and arguably it is creepy\u2026 Ok its just plain creepy. He does have good intentions, unfortunately his fixation with the living dead prompts him to make said creepy scenario occur. His relationship with Rea is very sweet, he strives to give Rea the life of a normal girl which she couldn't achieve under the iron fist of her dad. His resolve is tested throughout the series with the effects of the resurrection potion having problematic effects.\\n\\n\r\nRea Sanka has been brought up in a very wealthy home, but it is also a home of captivity. Rea is restrained by her farther as he does not allow Rea to go out with friends, permits any animals from entering the premises and fires any maid that attends to Rea in a way that obstructs his own ideals. Rea eventually reaches breaking point and sneaks out at night in order to get some freedom and vent her frustration and sadness. When she meets Chihiro he symbolises some freedom that she has craved for years and the sheltered girl takes an unusual interest into his hobbies. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was relatively good, the background was well designed and the characters designs were well varied with Chihiro's character.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fitted in well with each of the scenes, however on its own most of the soundtrack doesn't sound all to well. I will give honourable mentions to the wacky opening and the beautiful ending for the show \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show as a fellow zombie otaku can empathize with Chihiro on his love for the genre, maybe not so much on his resurrecting habits though. I also like how the genre of zombies was made into a sweet romantic comedy, something which i thought would play out in horrible fashion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSankarea is a delightful romantic comedy with slight horror elements for those good ol' zombie fans. I would not recommend this to those squeamish with slight blood and gore and i would not recommend this to those looking for something similar to highschool of the dead. I do recommend this to those looking for a different romantic comedy in comparison to the norm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Sankarea a 7.7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, Have a nice day!",

            "content": "~ this review contain spoiler ~\r\n       The first few episodes of this show really lead into what should have been a really decent story. The premise was there, the characters were there, but the follow through was very much less than ideal.\r\n        It\u2019s a bit of trouble to explain without throwing in a couple of spoilers, so if you plan on watching this series and don\u2019t want spoilers, stop here. You\u2019ll see for yourself what I\u2019m talking about when I say the execution was terrible. For those that don\u2019t care much aboutspoilers, this will probably divert you away from this show.\\n\\n\r\n          The show starts off quite well, setting the plot up and introducing the characters. Given the plot summary, it\u2019s pretty obvious that this girl dies. I won\u2019t say how, but she does. Furuya never expected his little potion to actually work, but it does. Not only on his cat, but Rea as well. She had taken it in hopes that it would have the reverse effect on the living. Her father was too possessive and allowed her virtually no freedom whatsoever, so she had a death wish.\\n\\n\r\n           What happens from this episode forward is utterly ridiculous. You would think a zombie otaku like Furuya would be over joyed that he got his wish to date a zombie girl. The problem is, she is still very much herself and appears normal other than being a bit pale and having ungodly strength. Another issue is that rather than seeing romance come about, it actually focuses more on how Furuya can keep her body from decaying.\\n\\n\r\n           On top of this, they throw in an entire episode and a half revolving around Furuya\u2019s childhood friend who is obviously jealous of Rea. The whole plot point here was unnecessary and could have been left out. I was rather bored throughout the entire sub plot.\\n\\n\r\n             All in all, I can only thank the heavens this show was only 12 episodes. Any more than that would have been unbearable. Although the show has its merits, it unfortunately doesn\u2019t have it where it counts",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I'm going to be as careful as possible here. This story is something I've sort of seen before, but with zombies instead. \r\nStory:8 \"Very Good\"\r\nThe story overall is a nice idea, but the ending is unclear if you watch just the anime. The manga explains and goes further than the anime. This is actually pretty common though, so I will be giving the story an 8. Also it's extremely hard for me to talk about the story without writing any spoilers.\r\nArt:9 \"Great\"\r\nThe artwork is odd, yet interesting, as the main characters look pretty and realistic. I'll explain odd inthe character section. The art is nice, with good backgrounds. When the art was meant to be scary, it was (to my friend).\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 \"Great\"\\n\r\nI'm not sure how to talk a lot about sound, but the music, sound effects and voices are enjoyable and not grating on the ears. The OP is nice; it was hard for me to skip it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9 \"Great\"\\n\r\nThe main character, Furuya (sorry I can't remember full names right now) has these cat-like ears, which is what was odd for me. After around 2 episodes, I got used to it, so it wasn't much of a problem.\\n\r\nThe background of each of these characters are not exaggerated and are believable.\\n\r\nTo avoid spoilers, I don't want to say anything more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10 \"Outstanding\"\\n\r\nI was kind of haunted by the ending; I thought about it for over a week. If a story leaves this kind of impression on me, it was truly well-written. To be honest, I was upset by the ending, but that was my opinion and views. The combination of characters, story, and art helped cling me to the ending, and then the manga to understand further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 \"Very Good\"\\n\r\nTo be honest, from an objective standpoint, I must rate this an 8, rather than a 9. The romance is not much of a main focus, I must note, also. So if you are looking for a mainly romantic story, this may not be for you. Overall, this anime is well-written yet confusing at times, especially the endings of some episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Summary: This one is just meh. I'm having a hard time classifying it because it didn't really do anything very well and didn't fit into any category well. I want to say that makes it unique but it just felt kind of drab to me.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThis had the makings of a descent albeit cliche story. The only thing that makes it unique is that she is a zombie but that isn't handled all that well (and gets no resolution in either OVA set). This anime was betting all it had on a second season. I find this interesting because it really wasn't that good... Ihave seen FAR better anime that didn't get a second season. Even if there are some interesting and creepy elements, every single one of them will be dropped and you'll likely end up feeling like you wasted your time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is basically the only saving grace of the anime. I liked the character designs and the use of colors. The shades of each character worked well and I did feel like they captured what a \"sexy zombie\" could look like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt got the job done. There were a few meaningful moments that were enhanced by the sound, the rest was meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nI only truly liked one character and it was the little sister. She barely said anything but also had one of the only really good character moments when relating Rea to her deceased mother. I thought that scene was pretty special and is the only positive thing I really took out of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nIt was middle of the road for me. I watched it fairly quickly hoping it at least got a good resolution (it did not) and looking back on it I was moreso holding my nose and guzzling that truly being captivated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIf you don't mind zombie movies and think the concept of the anime seems neat, you will be disappointed. If you want something with a good ending, you'll be disappointed. If you thought it would take an interesting twist and you would learn a unique perspective about zombies and the philosophy or logistics behind them, you'll be disappointed. Really, the only way you won't be disappointed is if you go in with low expectations and somehow enjoy the sad plot that drives Rea to become a zombie (the whole father angle completely missed with me). I'd say pass this one up.",

            "content": "I will sum it up for you right in the start: \"Pretty comfy anime, but nothing significant or memorable.\" Decently drawn show with rather interesting start which unfortunately loses steam as it moves forward. The concept had much potential: possessive love of deranged perfectionist father towards daughter, alcoholic mother apparently tired of living in solitary splendor, the whole make your dead gf thing etc.. but the execution of show seems very tacky, especially in the end. Its a shame that such a short show is filled with fillers which does not reveal any useful information about plot development nor they show any new interesting characteraspect. Anime is doing quite a good job at breaking zombie clich\u00e9. Once again the great story potential was wasted on fanservice. For me, just a big disappointment. Let me say that Kore Wa \"Zombie desu ka?\" was for more enjoying for me although there is definitely less effort put in the concept. Sometimes having fun with its absurd initial set is better then wasting one.",

            "content": "Ok, so I decided that from now on, I'm gonna write my reviews a bit differently. So, I won't give scores for each category, but instead, I'm just gonna talk about my experience with the anime. I find that giving scores does not help people understand as to why I gave it that score as it's a personal thing. Not only that, but I feel like if I focus more on talking about my experience, then you guys will know if the anime is for you or not. So, let me what you guys think: do you like my reviews more in this format ordid you prefer the old format? Also, I apologize if I haven't posted a review in a while, college can get busy at times. So, now without further ado, let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story Sankarea follows Chihiro Furuya, who is obsessed with zombies; so obsessed with zombies he even wants one as his girlfriend!  This hobby becomes somewhat of an obsession as he tries to revive his pet cat Babu. He meets Rea, a girl who is popular and seems to have it all, is not as happy with her life as it would seem. Her wish is to be reborn another person and she might just get her wish after crossing paths with Furuya. Chihiro then has to deal with taking care of her as a zombie. \\n\\n\r\nThe story also explores what life is like for Rea who has been resurrected as a zombie such as what she eats, what is it like for her to go outside...The story also goes in-depth as to how all of this changes her.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into Sankarea, I found the first episode intriguing. However, I didn't think the first two episodes really got into the core of the story. I honestly found the story to be all over the place throughout the anime. The story hooked me because it was silly, a bit scary at times, fun, and romantic. I also think it managed to juggle all of those elements well. All of those combined together made it fun to watch. There were times where the actual story, and there were times when I felt like there were filler episodes that didn\u2019t add anything to the main story. The anime does not seem to have a clear ending, but the ending is still enjoyable overall but if you're one of those people where you want the anime to have a clear ending and you don't want to interpret the ending for yourself, then the ending may really frustrate you. Despite these issues, I found the story quite enjoyable due to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Sankarea enjoyable is its cast of characters. When I went into the first episode, you didn't really see many characters so I thought the anime was only going to feature Chihiro, Rea (the girl), and Babu (the cat), but as you get further into the series you start to see more, and more characters appear. The other characters you see; however, (except for the villain) are side characters. At first, you see Rea's father, who is really creepy, and is obsessed with his daughter. At first, I really hated him! I thought he really was a creep! And you might get that feeling too when you watch the anime. But, that being said, when you see the last few episodes, you kind of feel sorry for him. I'm not gonna say why as I don't want to spoil too much. You had a character named Ranko that was funny and who would come and beat up Chihiro in a friendly way at times because they're pretty much childhood friends and cousins. Then, you had Chihiro's sister, Mero, who is the quiet type. Pretty much all the side characters (except one side character which I'm not gonna spoil who or why) contribute funny moments to the anime You also get some cute moments between Chihiro and Rea.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nicely done. However, an issue I had is there was an episode that had a editing issue or so, it looked like in my opinion. Episode 11, I think, where they show Rea father in the plane. I thought the editing was rushed, and the dialogue seemed to have cut off badly by it. Also in episode 3, they censored a woman\u2019s guts, and I've always believed if you're gonna do gore, then go all out! It frustrated me to see a censor. That being said, I understand why they did it as they're trying to appeal to all viewers.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the voice acting and music was good.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea isn't for everyone. If you're into zombies, romance, and comedy, then you'll love Sankarea. If you're looking for a spectacular anime that blows you away, Sankarea is not it. I recommend Sankarea if you're just looking for an anime to relax to and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I want to know what you guys think. If you've watched Sankarea, did you guys enjoy it? If not, would this be a anime you'd watch? Let me know your thoughts!",

            "content": "When I first came across this anime, I thought, zombies? In an anime? I had never heard of using these creatures as a main plot feature. So I immediately added it to my watching list and begun.\r\nThe first thing I noticed and loved about this anime  is its setting. A family living in the temple grounds in a country area, much more relaxed than the bustle of a busy city. Each of the character's in the family play their roles perfectly, and contrast each other nicely. There isn't any fooling around with the extreme anime cliches, such as the 'horror' of openly talking toa girl or touching them, and there are many nice hints to a peaceful family life. \\n\\n\r\nNow, down to the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\n  Sankarea introduces the three main characters off the bat, Saouji Ranko, Furuya Chihiro, and of course, Sanka Rea. It's obvious enough that these two will fight for Chihrio's love (with Rea being the 'true' route). I feel that the characters are developed at a well timed, gradual rate, beginning with 'Wanko' ( XD) and Chihiro's playfull nature, and Chihiro witnessing Rea's stress release at the abandoned hotel. As we learn more about these two girls and their relationship to Chihiro, his own traits are revealed. So without going into specific details, if you are sick of characters acting extremely tsundere, shy, or down-right annoying, this anime is a refreshing break that will leave you feeling concerned and engaged with its characters, instead of knitpicking at the tiny annoying things that many anime characters can get up to (I know I do when a character gets on my nerves). Overall; Character: 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\n  In accordance with the seeming Laws of the Anime Universe, this series sports a love triangle, with questionable outcomes for the characters, and comedic side characters that occasionally steal the spotlight for a good laugh (which are actually very funny, take note of the grandpa and Chihiro's best friend, Yasuda). However, one thing makes this anime stand out in the crowd, its plot device. I have never, never, heard of a zombie in an anime before. I feel this one one of the main reasons I started, and finished this show. I also love that they don't get absolutely side tracked on trivial matters, and instead choose to deal with practical issues (such as Rea's body rotting, instead of random beach and pool trips and losing bikinis etc). Overall, I found the plot to be quite original and witty, in the sense that addressed issues relevant to many watchers lives (such as horrible parents, lazy high school students, and chores/jobs/work). Overall; Plot: 9/10. (Another point to make is the minimal fan-service. No one looks tits shoved in their face allll the time). \\n\\n\r\nI believe that many anime's are based off their appearance, (and a quick synopsis read) which can immensely benefit a well drawn series compared to a crappy quick handed sketch. In my opinion, Sankarea sits a notch about the average. Its art isn't anything to rave about, however there are some beautiful scenes when the characters either go for a walk up a hill and look over the town at sunset (a scene which I rarely dislike), or a bird's eye view shot of the town at night ( I also love a good city-scape). However, the characters are quite attractive, and are definitely not an eye-sore. So if you aren't a super art fanatic and need everything is 10 million HD then there will be no problem. Overall; Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  The biggest problem I had with this series was its OST. The soundtrack annoyed me. The OP song seemed to be just a throw away that they tacked on at the end of production. It appeared to me that minimal thought had gone into its selection. The soundtrack for a change of scene was also nothing special (Even though this is an area that most animes don't attempt to explore). If the OST for this series had more effort applied to it, I feel the show would improve dramatically. Overall; Sound: 5.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole this series is DEFINITELY worth watching. I could even say it's one of those shows I wish I hadn't seen, so I could re-watch it and experience it again. If you haven't already, add it to your list, and start watching :3. \\n\\n\r\nOverall; Sankarea: 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first ever review on MAL. (*\uff9f\u25bd\uff9f*)",

            "content": "Once you've seen a lot of anime that focuses on romance and comedy it tends to get harder to recall them individually; this is especially true for the countless number of shows which choose to sacrifice story presentation and deep characters in exchange for unspeakable amounts of fanservice. It's not necessarily a criticism of the entire genre though. I mean, there's only so much you can do with a standard plot usually involving two characters who fall in love, only to be denied by one reason or another.\r\nThe successful romantic comedies (and I mean in terms of quality and not just commercially because crap animemay also sell a lot) often overcome this by portraying endearing characters and relationships with enough realism to make you actually care what happens, in a way that's enjoyable to watch too. On the other hand, there are those which introduce elements such as aliens, deities, fantasy, gender benders or sports in order to mix things up a little. If handled in the right manner this results in a series that stands out from the majority of the pack, and one that you'll remember when thinking about romantic comedy anime in future. Sankarea is a prime example of this.\\n\\n\r\nZombies. The mere mention of this term in the synopsis means that rather than trying to be realistic, Sankarea belongs in the latter group of romantic comedies and introduces, yes, zombies into the story to give it an extra dimension. So how is it incorporated? To begin, our main character Furuya Chihiro is a high school student who has a rather unhealthy obsession with the undead that in most cases would cause everyone to avoid him, let alone girls. But as luck would have it, he encounters the beautiful Sanka Rea who has her own fair share of problems, and inevitably the two hang out together; their new relationship is heart-warming and there's a sort of nice and understanding connection between them. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a sequence of events Rea dies and becomes a zombie, which brings with it a wealth of unique problems for the both of them. Although several issues are raised throughout the series, such as the exact nature of how Rea is revived and how long her body will last before it rots away, they are never really fully explored. Instead, the short twelve episode run includes: Rea adapting to her new situation with much help from Chihiro, family issues (in particularly Rea's father), the obligatory love triangle and a cat called Baabu. Praise should go to the series because there's excellent drama that provides an extra layer of development to its characters, but the final episode does end in quite an abrupt manner. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the pacing is far from perfect as the anime starts off pretty well but slows down noticeably after the opening episodes. There's a couple of filler episodes that serve to flesh out the supporting cast, but they are positioned at strange points in the story which causes the pacing to stutter even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation in Sankarea is a variable aspect that may not be to everyone's tastes. Character designs and the attire they wear are usually on the simple side, whereas the background art can be stunning at times but less detailed and sharp at others. Fortunately, the art remains at least consistently decent throughout the length of the series, and character motions are always smooth and fluid.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is surprisingly good in Sankarea. Although sparingly used, there are a wide range of beautiful instrumental themes for the mysterious, sad and unsettling scenes in the anime, and also light-hearted tunes for the peaceful and comedy moments. The voice acting is adequate and none of the characters sound bad. The theme songs are pleasant to listen to, with a unique-sounding and energetic track by nano.RIPE (who also did an equally-catchy OP for Hanasaku Iroha) for the opening, and a calm/soothing song by Annabel for the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of decent characters, Sankarea is well-covered. As mentioned before the cat-like Furuya Chihiro's standout aspect is his zombie fetish, and he has some entertaining expressions and dialogue. However, he's willing to fully embrace his fetish despite what others think, he can act serious when the need arises, and he is also quick to make important decisions; these are strengths for a main character in this type of anime, and it works to make Chihiro a better than average lead. \\n\r\nSanka Rea is a student from a wealthy family who's popular at school and looks cheerful on the surface, but unknown to most people she's lived a sheltered life and wants to act more like a normal girl. She's a cute and fun character, yet much of the drama also springs from her side of the story to make you feel sympathy for her, especially as she tries to adjust to her new life. \\n\r\nThen there's Chihiro's cousin, Saouji Ranko, who is a likeable girl but sadly her role is limited to mostly comedy situations and fanservice while competing with Rea for Chihiro's affection. As opposed to Rea, Ranko is talkative, likes to beat up Chihiro, and is actually alive; this provides a good contrast in character between the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast includes quirky members of Chihiro's family (the relatively normal father, the senile but entertaining grandpa, the amusing and quiet younger sister Mero), as well as members of Rea's rich household who are interesting for vastly different reasons. He's a bit of a conundrum, but chances are you'll be surprised at how much of a freak Rea's father is during the full length of the series and beyond; it's easy to see why she wants to escape her family, but her freedom does come at great cost. Finally, to round things off there are a few school classmates who are used for comic relief and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not every day that you come across a touching romantic comedy which also includes darker themes like isolation and suicide, graphically bloody scenes, more than just a hint of craziness, and a supernatural spin. And yet, Sankarea pops up as an enjoyable anime series that has done a fantastic job at establishing its setting and a likeable group of core characters with relevant backstory. It's also screaming for a second season with an improved focus on storytelling and new events that should undoubtedly build on its existing potential.\\n",

            "content": "I had heard of Sankarea before and reading the premise I didn't except it to be any good; I expected it to be some ecchi romantic comedy with alot of black comedy and pointlessly dark moments, much like the lukewarm Elfen Lied. However, it caught my interest after seeing it labeled as one of the best anime of 2012 and started watching it some time after. And I was completely blown away.\r\nContrary to what others have said, this anime is NOT a romantic comedy in the least. Sure, it has some decent comedy but not a lot. What it gave me was an engaging dramawith two great leads and a lot of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the bad stuff though: Sankarea really doesn't have that many flaws honestly. Maybe the biggest flaw it has in my opinion is the character of Chihiro's pervert red headed friend whose name I can't recall. He was a VERY annoying character, being inconsiderate of other people, totally flat and as a comedic relief he failed miserably. In one scene, he actually makes Rea's situation WORSE giving me more reason to dislike him.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw that I can't really call a flaw so much as my own opinion is Rea's father. Oh my gosh, Rea's father is one of the most obnoxious, hateful, loathsome, horrifying, selfish villains I have ever seen in any medium. Unlike other truly evil villains like Griffith from Berserk or Johann from Monster, he has absolutely no redeeming values. The only time he did do something that wasn't self centered was ruined by the fact that he still engaged in horrifying and selfish desires after it. He's by no means a badly written character because he was very well written, it's just that he really, really isn't fun to watch. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing though.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the good stuff: animation (which was excellent and atmospheric) and sound aside (which was good), the characters of both Chihiro and Rea were just great. Chihiro isn't a typical romantic protagonist; he's not bland or boring, in fact he's rather quirky, can be funny and under his jerkass exterior is actually a rather swell guy. I immediately liked him and the story showed that he was a great guy by showing him being kind to Rea.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Rea, she ahs to be one of the greatest female anime characters I've ever seen. Not every female anime character has to be a badass like Rukia from Bleach nor do they have to be well adjusted people. In fact, Rea's back-story really hit me. When I found out what happened to her, I wasn't angry. I was FURIOUS. Ballistic. It was the kind of righteous fury where you want to do anything and everything to solve someone else's problem and that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to save Rea from her abusive home, I wanted to hug her and comfort her. Her personality was also really great. Beneath her suffering and the fact that she is a zombie, Rea is still a very normal girl, one who wants to do normal girly things. I like how instead of making her into a typical introverted girl who keeps to herself ala Rei Ayanami, they went into a different direction. Because of that, Rea feels like a real person and not a typical cookie cutter anime girl.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are Rea and Chihiro's interactions: there\u2019s some obvious sexual tension and the anime does point that the two will end up with each other and I'm really rooting for them to do so. Chihiro is a really kind person at heart and his declaration of protecting Rea and standing up to her is really sweet. As for the other characters like Mero, Ranko, Grandpa etc... They\u2019re all OK and memorable and interesting and with the exception of redhead pervert and Dan'Ichiro Sanka, they're all pretty likeable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 9 out of ten for excellence. I wish a second season came out soon because frankly, I want more and the 'ending' does sort of point out that the story will continue. It's not a 10/10 as it's not something like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Monster but it doesn't have to be. Is it recommended? Highly so, but don't except this anime to be some ecchi rubbish because it is not. While it does have some fanservice, it also has a lot of fan disservice and the tragic moments should not be taken as opportunity for engaging in lustful thoughts.\\n",

Since I will come back later to write a longer review. \r\nThe most unique thing is the story- a relationship/romance between a zombie and human. \r\nMovies that adopted this plot existed before but I don't believe any anime has done this. \r\nEqually splendid plot is that the girl Sanka actually chose to become a zombie to liberate herself from the patriarchal control of her hypocritical father. The idea that being undead as a liberation from the reality is definitely not new asyou can find examples in many zombie movies.But this vision is still fairly non-mainstream and radical in a sense.",

            "content": "So imagine this. Close your eyes and picture yourself walking to school, having a great day, realizing that you just aced a test, talked to a boy/girl you like, ate a good meal, and come home. You go to your room to relax but the first thing you see is a zombie girl lying half-naked on your bed. You try to to tell yourself if this is reality or fiction but just can't seem to do it.\r\nHonestly, that's the feeling I got when I first started watching this series. In other words, very surprising. Originally, I didn't have high expectation of this series. No, itis not because the series is tagged as \u201cecchi\u201d by MAL or the fact that the main character has a zombie fascination (more like a fetish to be honest). However, after watching about half the series that aired already, I have a  hope for this series as it surprised me quite a bit, for the better. \\n\\n\r\nThe story tells the young boy named Chihiro Furuya, who has a strange hobby, or more a fascination on zombies. Now, there's something you don't see or hear everyday. However, despite being strange as it sounds, it is what our our main character loves. His obsession with zombies can be traced to the point of obsession and even a fetish. Sounds strange right? I'm sure this would definitely be something strange even for any of us considered to be an otaku. The story continues on from there where he meets another girl, an idol, to be exact who later after unfortunate circumstances becomes what he \"loves\". As for our main heroine (or maybe anti-hero later? I mean, she's freaking dead already), she is an unique character. Despite being one of the most beautiful girl at school, she strives hard to gain \u201cfreedom\u201d or to be free from her life. Most prominently, she tries to escape her circumstances at home because what goes beyond those doors are circumstances that some of us may puke or feel disgust about. It is definitely something I'm sure most of us don't want to be placed in our own circumstances in real life. (unless you like living in big mansions and get free tuition) \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have other characters like Ranko Sa\u014dji (also known as Wanko). She is rather tomboyish judged by her attitude and appearance but there's some history between her and our zombie loving MC, a history that can be traced back to puppy love, zombie movies, and all that rest of good stuff. It would definitely be interesting to see what kind of rivalry or friendship she may later develop towards our school beauty, aka Rea.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, my impressions of story so far is great. Even the very first episode got me hooked like a zombie. The movement of the story so far is somewhat slow but easy to follow and as the series continues, we see some of the unraveling details such as Rea's background. More importantly, the tone of the story becomes darker (mixed in with comedy the same time) as we see what is going on behind the scenes of Rea's life. We also see the history between Ranko and Chihiro as well as childhood memories are treasure that most us should keep placed in our hearts.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I'm not too impressed. Well, let's just say that when I first saw that Studio Deen was the studio involved for this, my hopes were dead like a zombie. However, after watching these first few episodes, I'm glad they proved me wrong. I like the style and art of the series so far even if it's a bit plain. After all, art isn't something that determines the overall enjoyment of a series. Don't believe me? Just ask Gurren Lagann. As for the sound and music, I think so far it does seem to fit. I mean, it's not something eerie like Shigofumi: Letters of the Departed but you'll notice it soon once you get into the series. There's also emotional music mixed in that reflects on some of the mood of the story. Then, there's the melody of comedic music thrown in during lighter atmospheres. Overall, I'd say that the soundtrack isn't something worth an Emmy Award but also compelling to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm enjoying this series as it is so far. It's not something I'll be obsessed about as much as the main character for zombies but definitely enjoying it at an anime fan level. The story (although somewhat easy to predict) has drama with an emotional background mixed in with comedy and possible romance. The characters are appealing and the soundtrack fits well. My only concern at this point is Studio DEEN as it's definitely not my favorite anime studio of this world. But beyond that, I see potential for this rare little gem this Spring Season. \\n\\n",

It had just the right amount of comedy and ecchi without hurting the quality of the entire show. It pulls you in to see what on earth could happen next.

            "content": "Falling into 6 genres, Sankarea lacked a specific direction and yet remained enjoyable.\r\nThe first 3-4 episodes focused on mainly building the setting on which the rest of the show would be based on, and from there it took the direction of a typical romantic comedy SoL type anime. Being a fan of many SoL anime, I found the rest of the show to be enjoyable. Those who do not enjoy SoL shows may be disappointed after watching the well paced, plot based first 3 episodes when the majority of the show is a character based comedy.\r\nAs for horror and ecchi, both were incorporated into Sankareain an unobtrusive manner. Whist the first 3 episodes had horror undertones, the rest featured horror in a more comedic manner. Nothing overdone or such. Ecchi was also incorporated smoothly and presented in a subtle manner. Nothing too distracting and in-your-face yet still enough to provide service to ecchi-fans.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual score breakdown\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nAfter the first 3 or so episodes, the plot of Sankarea quickly breaks down into something similar to a SoL, with periodic arcs. Nothing really remarkable. Heck, the majority of the anime IS character/comedy based. It's still enjoyable, just don't expect some amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is simply superb. Not only is the quality excellent, the character design is also well done and each character takes on their own unique art style and appearance. The background is nicely detailed, and the atmosphere and lighting done just right. Animation is smooth as well. After watching the absolutely stunning animation/art of Fate/Zero though, I really can't give Sankarea a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nVoice acting is well done and brings out the personalities of all the characters. Background music could be a bit better, but it still integrates into the show quite well. The OP and ED are both excellent. Being an audiophile, I found everything to be recorded nice and squeaky clean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOther than the story, the character was the second weakest part of the show. Both lead characters were well personified and likeable to some degree. Unfortunately, every character was a subcategory of a clich\u00e9, but kept me interested through the rather... unusual circumstances the lead goes through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nMuch of the enjoyment stems from the comedy. Although it is no where as good as the better SoL/Romantic comedy/Comedy I've watched, Sankarea was mostly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI believe Sankarea deserves better than a mediocre 6 or 7. The whole quality of the show is very impressive, and even though the plot and character is slightly weak, I give Sankarea a very good 8/10.",

            "content": "Tell me if you've heard of this before. A high school boy dreams to be with his ideal girl. Not too uncommon among romantic tales, but here's something that might run your blood cold, pun intended. He likes zombies. He really likes zombie girls, and one day, POOF! Due to plot, he gets to live with one. With a premise like this, what could possibly go wrong? Quite a bit actually, yet Sankarea stands out as quite the opposite, as something special. It, however, requires some context.\r\nAdapted from a manga of the same name by Mitsuru Hattori, Sankarea was directed by Shinichi Omata, with in-showcharacter designs by Kyuuta Sakai. Produced by Studio Deen, for something designated with genre labels such as \u201ccomedy\u201d and \u201cecchi,\u201d the series begins rather morbidly. Chihiro Furuya has spent the last several evenings putting his enthusiast facet to work searching for a way to revive his beloved deceased cat. During a couple of these dusks, he overhears the strained cries of a girl his age, desperate to lead a normal life with friends and outings. She's no other than Rea Sanka, the school idol of the local prestigious girl's academy and the sheltered heir to a rather wealthy and influential name. And, through one direct encounter, the zombie otaku and the school idol end up hanging out and working through the nights on what now became a joint project, neither being intimidated by the other. In the most natural of fashions, through this relationship the show breaks down the walls of the stereotypes that would have otherwise defined these two. Chihiro, outside his odd persona, and Rea, outside her perfect exterior, reveal themselves to us as characters of depth: sensible, quirky, considerate, kind. In fact, the show does very well, for the most part, in coaxing out the stuff of substance from many of the cast, even the most despicable ones.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, comedy is a prominent fixture in this show, and a welcome one at that, characters playing off one another in funny and even clever ways that forgo heavy reliance on exaggerated visuals. In fact, such restraint promotes that underlying sentiment of unease that balances the frivolity and serves to make the show compelling in a meaningful way. It's this ever-present feeling of tragedy that makes the moments that are meant to be tragic doubly so and the instances that are sweet more bitter than before, tragedy that's driven by two factors:\\n\\n\r\nOne is zombieism itself. Far from being just a fun, but ultimately needless accessory, the show utilizes key aspects of this condition to derive really compelling drama. The specter of mental health and physical well-being wasting away overtime looms in whatever air our two leads breathe, and while the living dead gain abilities such as super-human strength and insensitivity to pain, they also lose precious things that we, as people, take for granted. The capacity to bask in the sun, to feel warmth, to shed tears.\\n\\n\r\nTwo is how zombieism is applied to Rea. To live under the confines of a suffocating patriarch who's, at best, neurotically obsessive and, at worst, possessively abusive to his daughter, where his affection for her is that of a blur between love and lust, and a jealous matriarch who doesn't give a damn, she's like a songbird in a cage, crooning for her freedom. And so the songbird becomes a zombie. A tragic paradox rings true: She feels more alive dead than she otherwise felt living, and here's where everything falls together. No matter how much she aches to be normal, she can't. She's cheated out of experiencing life to the fullest because her condition chains her down.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show flirts around humorously with the premise of zombie love, it also holds no illusions to its implications: wish-fulfillment, if not precisely necrophilia. But taking care of a zombie girl is a lot more emotionally demanding than can be preconceived, Rea living with Chihiro as much a romantic nod as it is sanctuary and liberty from her folks, the chemistry of this relationship, from before the girl becomes a zombie, to after the girl becomes a zombie, feels undeniably genuine, and the question is brought up constantly, aloud and not. Is this a lust toward zombie girls, or a love toward a girl that now happens to be a zombie?\\n\\n\r\nAny review of this show would be remiss without at least a mention about the direction. While this is Omichi's first project as the head director, he's worked on a number of Shaft projects. He's a Shaft veteran, and, for anyone familiar with Shaft's style, that influence is apparent from the get-go: camera angles, theatrical metaphor, abstract imagery etc. But rather than being a mere copy and paste of Akiyuki Shinbo, whose application of said style can be heavy-handed and sometimes irrelevant to the narrative (to make the visuals superficially striking through its unorthodox-ness, in other words), Omichi co-opts the style as something his own, that carries meaning every time is utilized in place of the mundane (which I think is rather beautifully rendered, by the way) rather than something that is abused for novelty's sake. Something like a painting or curtains rising and falling to bring the audience in and out of flashbacks adds to sad and bad memories in not only a new way. It adds a whole new layer of melancholy by probing the emotional implications of these ruminations. Something like an arm fading away into nothing in place of a normal slap of the hand conveys far more than a one-fold rejection. In addition, the pacing goes at a slow, but natural pace that's embedded with a decent amount of subtly that allows the audience to really know about the characters rather than know of them. An example of said subtly can be found in the male protagonist's usually reserved deadpan of a snark sister, Mero, both in Episode 1 and Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if it can be helped, I recommend watching Episode 9 before watching Episode 8, since Episode 9 takes place chronologically before Episode 8 anyway, and has unfortunately been perceived as a rude detour, what with it being placed in a middle of an ongoing crisis, so much so that its beauty and genius has been dismissed as mediocre filler.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these wonderful things being said, the show suffers substantially on a few fronts. Ecchi. There are actually interesting uses for it in the show. Sparingly, it's great when it's used to convey atmospheres of the frankness of freedom and the desperation for affection. Sparingly, it's amusing in comedic moments, or at least tolerable. However, the show also goes somewhat heavy-handed on it for titillation's sake, something which mars characterization and, in general, is just in bad taste, what with how grim, but well-told the series otherwise is. And while the characterization is very good, for the most part, the show also plays up the gimmicky troppiness of some of the characters in a way that can get irritating at times. \\n\\n\r\nNow to end on a happy note, pun intended. Well, maybe not happy, per say, but the audio and visuals of the OP and especially the ED are impressive. The OP \u201cEscoragoto\u201d was done by nano.RIPE, and while I can't say I'm a fan of nano.RIPE's vocalist on her own, the melody, combined with the musical accompaniment, drum set, electric guitar, electric bass, makes for an energetic, uplifting piece that, even then, is tempered somewhat by some of its bitter visuals. Outside of introducing the cast, the OP does a great job saying a lot about each major character without saying anything, in particular, the segment involving Rea surrounded by her parents and household, this really fake, almost dead countenance of geniality pasted on her face when gripped on the shoulder by her father. Even the title \u201cEscoragoto,\u201d translated from Japanese, means \u201cfabrication\u201d or \u201cpipe dream.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nBut if there's any one concise thing I could show to anyone that demonstrates the level of respect the show has for its material in a brief one minute, thirty minute music video, it would be the ED \u201cAbove Your Hand,\u201d by Anabel. Soft, sincere, beautiful vocals accompanied by classical guitar, then electric bass, then the drama of the drums set and embellishing echoes, before revolving back to guitar, the visuals, which take place in the backdrop of the bowling alley Chihiro and Rea first met personally in, plays well with the classic dichotomy of dark and light which, when the female protagonist faces the light's source, is greeted by the male protagonist. She's much a figurative as well as literal person brought back to life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot wrong with Sankarea. In fact, it does a lot of things right. It dares to something smarter, darker. More insightful, and heart-warming too. And, for the most part, it succeeds on every account.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sankarea an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Sankarea is an adaptation of Hattori Mitsuru's light novel series. Mostly, the anime stayed true to the manga and as such many of my issues to do with the show stemmed from the poorly written script. \r\n*Please stop reading here if you have not seen the show and do not like spoilers*\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story is of a young sheltered girl trying to free herself from the clutches of her very strange family - namely an abnormally obsessed father and an indifferent mother. The main story itself was quite interesting but that is where the positive ends. In trying to establish a deeper story, Sankarea poorlyspends its time revealing the back-story of some of its characters. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin, episode 7 which was dedicated to explain how Wanko developed feelings for the protagonist had issues. It begins by her crying as she runs alone in a cemetery. Viewers are left confused as to the reason she cries. Did she seriously just run into a cemetery to get scared? The point is, for a show that feeds the viewer information and does not employ undertones, this one scene is poorly explained.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the show never makes clear if Chihiro's family is aware of Rea's 'zombie' circumstance. For most of the show, his Dad and sister seem confused as to why Rea chooses to only eat those hydrangea leaves, however in episode 9, it seems that Mero is fully aware that Rea is a zombie. On that note, did they seriously place that filler episode 9 in between the \"climax\" of the show? Talk about terrible sequencing.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the show signaled the possibility of a second season but I cannot stress how poorly done it was. It did not create the cliff-hanger effect intended, instead it just left the audience feeling dumbfounded. Why would the director even end the show there instead of a bit earlier when some resolution was achieved (after Rea's Dad left)? \\n\\n\r\nThe scene where Chihiro fends off the dog to save Wanko was pathetic. The dog just stood there and barked without attacking for ages and was scared away by a little kid who looked like he could support the weight of the bat... unreal but effective in winning over Wanko's heart.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that there was episode 10 about Rea's mother. But that will discussed more in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art did not break new grounds. The background and scenery was good but the characters sometimes looked strange from angled shots. The use of changing weathers to create an atmosphere was over-used to the point that it didn't create the desired effect when it really mattered (episode 11). \\n\\n\r\nThere are also many inconsistencies in artwork that should not have been ignored. For instance, when Rea fell down and got up there were not wound marks left. Also when Chihiro was stabbed, where is the blood when Rea removes the blade from his body? Why is it that he only starts to bleed profusely once he has collapsed and finished his little \"talk\"? There is no suitable excuse given how much blood was poured earlier in the show when Rea \"died\". \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a decent job. Although it was probably hard for them because the characters were lacking in personality. The ending song was mediocre. While liking some other works by Nano.Ripe, the opening song may have been good, but did not seem to fit the show very well. The music in the show itself was just okay as it did not really enhance the feel of the show in any way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI don't know if I have ever seen such a pitiful cast before. The characters are about as uninspired as the title of the show. There is zero character development, mainly because every character is one-dimensional. It is almost as if the characters were given one stereotypical role, and that is all they do, quite horribly though. It is difficult to relate or like any character in the show, because they are ultimately just empty shells. They may think or talk about their feelings but this does not give them extra depth. Additionally, these characters talk about responsibility and things they need to do. Yet none of these things seem to be very high in their agenda. Here is an example: How does Chihiro plan to preserve Rea's body? He decides to stop trying to look into books and follows his grandfather's advice to observe. What can possibly achieved from this is only noting down the rate Rea rots away. But I guess his pervy and lazy desires are satisfied in the process and so he sticks with it. \\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough in episode 10, Rea's mother while wallowing in self pity and filled with tears she continues to watch on as her husband takes naked photos of his daughter. The servant who also knows of this does nothing to intervene. It seems that Aria does not feel enough anger nor does she have enough morality to stop the act. Also, the servant who knows of it does nothing as well... very strange that they aren't calling the child abuse hotline or something. Yes, the characters in Sankarea are unbelievable. Another example is when Chihiro gets stabbed, it doesn't seem to matter to all the maids watching. Their loyalty is truly commendable. Also, after getting up why didn't Chihiro just report Danichirou for assault, did he forgive that bastard after seeing how \"cute\" Rea was in a nurse outfit? \\n\\n\r\nAs per normal, the main character in a shounen is always dense but Chihiro was surprisingly sharp in episode 6 when he told Wanko \"She's  (Rea) not my girlfriend or anything\" as a way to thank Wanko for donating some clothes. It's almost as if he knew Wanko's feelings in episode 6 but not in the rest of the show... Interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nSankarea had potential but was poorly executed. It did not satisfy the genres listed. No horror, lack luster comedy, and little romance... If anything, this anime did not even present romance in the roundabout fashion that many shounen do. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of real emotions and unlikable characters really made this show a difficult watch.",

            "content": "It pains me a lot to give this series a 7. In fact, I really want to give it a 9 or 10 for this review.  However, a few things stop it from being higher, actually only two things really. The first thing is simple. It never keeps the amazement factor rolling, the first three episodes were fantastic, but it slow goes to great, then good, then just plain OK. The second, and in my opinion much more important thing is that it stop just when things get interesting. It force me to read the manga from which this is adapted from and actuallymade me a lot more disappointed in the anime. The Manga is fantastic, easily one of the best I have ever read, in fact currently it is my second favorite of all time. If the anime had gotten enough support, or if it had gotten enough care to completely adapt the manga through and through then this could easily be a different review where I say ,\"This is the best anime ever no exaggeration.\" Alas, it is not, so it pains me immensely to have to give it a score of only good.\\n\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nIt is definitely interesting. It is a blend of romantic comedy, horror, ecchi, zombie (yes, zombies are in my mind it own separate genre, sort of like how it is for gaming), and even a little bit of action. It starts off intriguing, but after episode four things start to become chaotic. It feels like a chronological mess (which to people who has read the manga, it is) and things seems to be out of place, or it feels like an event was suppose to happen but didn't. The ending was also felt incomplete and felt like a setup for something else. However, I will say that in the story department this anime is amazing at creating side stories and giving us background details on some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nYes, Sankarea only gets a 7 for art. Yes I know most people would give a much higher score with it beautiful environment, but to be quite honest I seen better, from the same year and from anime such as Sword Art Online and a bunch more. The character design are also pretty average outside a few exception like Rea and Chihiro and a few other.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nYeah, you saw the score correctly. No typos and accidents, the music is fantastic through and through. I don't know the name of the composer, but once I do I will listen to every song compose by him/her. Other then the two reasons mention in to introduction, the music is another huge reason why it pains me greatly give the anime a OK score. Each track match the tone of the event and two songs, Honto no Kimochi and Sukeru Hitomi, stands as some of my favorite songs from not only anime, but of all mediums gaming including (which is quite an amazing feat, cause I like myself some game music).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nNow we get to the one that was the most greatly affected by the short runtime. Don't get me wrong, the show stills have great character - Rea being one of my favorite character even if we only consider the anime. However, the anime is missing much need explanation and character development for the other characters which the manga provides. It provides enough for me to get interested, but stops short of me caring about any of the characters besides the above mentioned Rea.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nAs with any review, anime or otherwise, the enjoyment is not part of the final verdict.The reason is because I may love a series, but not be able to give a good score for it because of it's up irrefutable flaws. This is one of those cases. I love Sankarea it have a lot of morals and ideals that are similar to mine, and Rea is one of my favorite characters and IS my favorite female protagonist. Also as stated the music is amazing which greatly factors and can even change my personal enjoyment on anything, anime or not. Also as stated above I read the Manga which allows me to make sense of the cryptic story and allows be to care for each characters even minor ones. It is extremely disappointing that this anime didn't adapt everything otherwise my overall score could be identical to my enjoyment one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:7\\n\r\nAt this point I probably sound like a broken tape recorder so I really don't want to repeat what I have said a million time. But I really need to stress that this anime could have been a \"This is the best thing since sliced bread!\" anime instead of a meh one if it had done a full adaptation of the manga. So here's me hoping for season two, really crossing my finger on it.\\n",

His world revolves around zombies & the type of romance he's looking for is with a dead girl.... Weird tastes right? The story starts out pretty subtle & introduces Chihiro & expresses his zombie madness. On a day like no other a tragedy occurs within his household. There's one family member short. His family cat happened to die. Chihiro becomes emotionally unstable so he tries to resurrect his cat Baabu. As the story progresses it starts to revolvearound Rea Sanka whom Chihiro spy's on during his resurrection process of Baabu. A few days later an accident occurs in which Sanka figues out that she was being watched. The story progresses from there and they meet for the first time & have a long chat about zombies & try to get on each others nerves. The chats pretty normal except for the fact that they talk about zombies in such a eerie place & find it natural. Well thats all I'll say because I don't want to spoil it. To tell you the truth there isn't much to go on whether Sankarea will live up to its name from the first episode alone. Apparently I happened to find it quite suitable to my tastes because I want to see FUNimation's creativity with zombie romance which I think will be quite amusing. I'm really looking forward to more episodes & its getting really hard to bottle up the excitement.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nSankarea is a 13-episode anime series created by studio Deen. The story follows Chihiro Fuwuya a zombie fanatic who spends the majority of his time watching zombie and horror movies. One day his cat Babu is ran over by a car. A saddened Chihiro attempts to resurrect his cat with the help of a troubled girl called Rea Sanka.\r\nWhen I finished high school of the dead I found myself craving for more zombie-oriented anime. After searching around on the internet I saw some recommendations and the first notable one I saw was Sankarea. My expectations as from the previous anime were gore, violence and over-the-topballs to wall action. That which I did not receive\u2026 I did however happen to get a very pleasant surprise in the form of a undead romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nChihiro is the main protagonist for the show and he is without a doubt my favourite character in the series. He struggles to come to terms with the death of his cat and he digs him up from the grave in order to resurrect him. Now I know the concept of this seems creepy and arguably it is creepy\u2026 Ok its just plain creepy. He does have good intentions, unfortunately his fixation with the living dead prompts him to make said creepy scenario occur. His relationship with Rea is very sweet, he strives to give Rea the life of a normal girl which she couldn't achieve under the iron fist of her dad. His resolve is tested throughout the series with the effects of the resurrection potion having problematic effects.\\n\\n\r\nRea Sanka has been brought up in a very wealthy home, but it is also a home of captivity. Rea is restrained by her farther as he does not allow Rea to go out with friends, permits any animals from entering the premises and fires any maid that attends to Rea in a way that obstructs his own ideals. Rea eventually reaches breaking point and sneaks out at night in order to get some freedom and vent her frustration and sadness. When she meets Chihiro he symbolises some freedom that she has craved for years and the sheltered girl takes an unusual interest into his hobbies. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was relatively good, the background was well designed and the characters designs were well varied with Chihiro's character.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fitted in well with each of the scenes, however on its own most of the soundtrack doesn't sound all to well. I will give honourable mentions to the wacky opening and the beautiful ending for the show \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show as a fellow zombie otaku can empathize with Chihiro on his love for the genre, maybe not so much on his resurrecting habits though. I also like how the genre of zombies was made into a sweet romantic comedy, something which i thought would play out in horrible fashion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSankarea is a delightful romantic comedy with slight horror elements for those good ol' zombie fans. I would not recommend this to those squeamish with slight blood and gore and i would not recommend this to those looking for something similar to highschool of the dead. I do recommend this to those looking for a different romantic comedy in comparison to the norm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Sankarea a 7.7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, Have a nice day!",

            "content": "~ this review contain spoiler ~\r\n       The first few episodes of this show really lead into what should have been a really decent story. The premise was there, the characters were there, but the follow through was very much less than ideal.\r\n        It\u2019s a bit of trouble to explain without throwing in a couple of spoilers, so if you plan on watching this series and don\u2019t want spoilers, stop here. You\u2019ll see for yourself what I\u2019m talking about when I say the execution was terrible. For those that don\u2019t care much aboutspoilers, this will probably divert you away from this show.\\n\\n\r\n          The show starts off quite well, setting the plot up and introducing the characters. Given the plot summary, it\u2019s pretty obvious that this girl dies. I won\u2019t say how, but she does. Furuya never expected his little potion to actually work, but it does. Not only on his cat, but Rea as well. She had taken it in hopes that it would have the reverse effect on the living. Her father was too possessive and allowed her virtually no freedom whatsoever, so she had a death wish.\\n\\n\r\n           What happens from this episode forward is utterly ridiculous. You would think a zombie otaku like Furuya would be over joyed that he got his wish to date a zombie girl. The problem is, she is still very much herself and appears normal other than being a bit pale and having ungodly strength. Another issue is that rather than seeing romance come about, it actually focuses more on how Furuya can keep her body from decaying.\\n\\n\r\n           On top of this, they throw in an entire episode and a half revolving around Furuya\u2019s childhood friend who is obviously jealous of Rea. The whole plot point here was unnecessary and could have been left out. I was rather bored throughout the entire sub plot.\\n\\n\r\n             All in all, I can only thank the heavens this show was only 12 episodes. Any more than that would have been unbearable. Although the show has its merits, it unfortunately doesn\u2019t have it where it counts",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I'm going to be as careful as possible here. This story is something I've sort of seen before, but with zombies instead. \r\nStory:8 \"Very Good\"\r\nThe story overall is a nice idea, but the ending is unclear if you watch just the anime. The manga explains and goes further than the anime. This is actually pretty common though, so I will be giving the story an 8. Also it's extremely hard for me to talk about the story without writing any spoilers.\r\nArt:9 \"Great\"\r\nThe artwork is odd, yet interesting, as the main characters look pretty and realistic. I'll explain odd inthe character section. The art is nice, with good backgrounds. When the art was meant to be scary, it was (to my friend).\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 \"Great\"\\n\r\nI'm not sure how to talk a lot about sound, but the music, sound effects and voices are enjoyable and not grating on the ears. The OP is nice; it was hard for me to skip it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9 \"Great\"\\n\r\nThe main character, Furuya (sorry I can't remember full names right now) has these cat-like ears, which is what was odd for me. After around 2 episodes, I got used to it, so it wasn't much of a problem.\\n\r\nThe background of each of these characters are not exaggerated and are believable.\\n\r\nTo avoid spoilers, I don't want to say anything more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10 \"Outstanding\"\\n\r\nI was kind of haunted by the ending; I thought about it for over a week. If a story leaves this kind of impression on me, it was truly well-written. To be honest, I was upset by the ending, but that was my opinion and views. The combination of characters, story, and art helped cling me to the ending, and then the manga to understand further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8 \"Very Good\"\\n\r\nTo be honest, from an objective standpoint, I must rate this an 8, rather than a 9. The romance is not much of a main focus, I must note, also. So if you are looking for a mainly romantic story, this may not be for you. Overall, this anime is well-written yet confusing at times, especially the endings of some episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Summary: This one is just meh. I'm having a hard time classifying it because it didn't really do anything very well and didn't fit into any category well. I want to say that makes it unique but it just felt kind of drab to me.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThis had the makings of a descent albeit cliche story. The only thing that makes it unique is that she is a zombie but that isn't handled all that well (and gets no resolution in either OVA set). This anime was betting all it had on a second season. I find this interesting because it really wasn't that good... Ihave seen FAR better anime that didn't get a second season. Even if there are some interesting and creepy elements, every single one of them will be dropped and you'll likely end up feeling like you wasted your time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is basically the only saving grace of the anime. I liked the character designs and the use of colors. The shades of each character worked well and I did feel like they captured what a \"sexy zombie\" could look like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt got the job done. There were a few meaningful moments that were enhanced by the sound, the rest was meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nI only truly liked one character and it was the little sister. She barely said anything but also had one of the only really good character moments when relating Rea to her deceased mother. I thought that scene was pretty special and is the only positive thing I really took out of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nIt was middle of the road for me. I watched it fairly quickly hoping it at least got a good resolution (it did not) and looking back on it I was moreso holding my nose and guzzling that truly being captivated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIf you don't mind zombie movies and think the concept of the anime seems neat, you will be disappointed. If you want something with a good ending, you'll be disappointed. If you thought it would take an interesting twist and you would learn a unique perspective about zombies and the philosophy or logistics behind them, you'll be disappointed. Really, the only way you won't be disappointed is if you go in with low expectations and somehow enjoy the sad plot that drives Rea to become a zombie (the whole father angle completely missed with me). I'd say pass this one up.",

            "content": "I will sum it up for you right in the start: \"Pretty comfy anime, but nothing significant or memorable.\" Decently drawn show with rather interesting start which unfortunately loses steam as it moves forward. The concept had much potential: possessive love of deranged perfectionist father towards daughter, alcoholic mother apparently tired of living in solitary splendor, the whole make your dead gf thing etc.. but the execution of show seems very tacky, especially in the end. Its a shame that such a short show is filled with fillers which does not reveal any useful information about plot development nor they show any new interesting characteraspect. Anime is doing quite a good job at breaking zombie clich\u00e9. Once again the great story potential was wasted on fanservice. For me, just a big disappointment. Let me say that Kore Wa \"Zombie desu ka?\" was for more enjoying for me although there is definitely less effort put in the concept. Sometimes having fun with its absurd initial set is better then wasting one.",

            "content": "Ok, so I decided that from now on, I'm gonna write my reviews a bit differently. So, I won't give scores for each category, but instead, I'm just gonna talk about my experience with the anime. I find that giving scores does not help people understand as to why I gave it that score as it's a personal thing. Not only that, but I feel like if I focus more on talking about my experience, then you guys will know if the anime is for you or not. So, let me what you guys think: do you like my reviews more in this format ordid you prefer the old format? Also, I apologize if I haven't posted a review in a while, college can get busy at times. So, now without further ado, let's get into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story Sankarea follows Chihiro Furuya, who is obsessed with zombies; so obsessed with zombies he even wants one as his girlfriend!  This hobby becomes somewhat of an obsession as he tries to revive his pet cat Babu. He meets Rea, a girl who is popular and seems to have it all, is not as happy with her life as it would seem. Her wish is to be reborn another person and she might just get her wish after crossing paths with Furuya. Chihiro then has to deal with taking care of her as a zombie. \\n\\n\r\nThe story also explores what life is like for Rea who has been resurrected as a zombie such as what she eats, what is it like for her to go outside...The story also goes in-depth as to how all of this changes her.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into Sankarea, I found the first episode intriguing. However, I didn't think the first two episodes really got into the core of the story. I honestly found the story to be all over the place throughout the anime. The story hooked me because it was silly, a bit scary at times, fun, and romantic. I also think it managed to juggle all of those elements well. All of those combined together made it fun to watch. There were times where the actual story, and there were times when I felt like there were filler episodes that didn\u2019t add anything to the main story. The anime does not seem to have a clear ending, but the ending is still enjoyable overall but if you're one of those people where you want the anime to have a clear ending and you don't want to interpret the ending for yourself, then the ending may really frustrate you. Despite these issues, I found the story quite enjoyable due to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Sankarea enjoyable is its cast of characters. When I went into the first episode, you didn't really see many characters so I thought the anime was only going to feature Chihiro, Rea (the girl), and Babu (the cat), but as you get further into the series you start to see more, and more characters appear. The other characters you see; however, (except for the villain) are side characters. At first, you see Rea's father, who is really creepy, and is obsessed with his daughter. At first, I really hated him! I thought he really was a creep! And you might get that feeling too when you watch the anime. But, that being said, when you see the last few episodes, you kind of feel sorry for him. I'm not gonna say why as I don't want to spoil too much. You had a character named Ranko that was funny and who would come and beat up Chihiro in a friendly way at times because they're pretty much childhood friends and cousins. Then, you had Chihiro's sister, Mero, who is the quiet type. Pretty much all the side characters (except one side character which I'm not gonna spoil who or why) contribute funny moments to the anime You also get some cute moments between Chihiro and Rea.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nicely done. However, an issue I had is there was an episode that had a editing issue or so, it looked like in my opinion. Episode 11, I think, where they show Rea father in the plane. I thought the editing was rushed, and the dialogue seemed to have cut off badly by it. Also in episode 3, they censored a woman\u2019s guts, and I've always believed if you're gonna do gore, then go all out! It frustrated me to see a censor. That being said, I understand why they did it as they're trying to appeal to all viewers.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the voice acting and music was good.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea isn't for everyone. If you're into zombies, romance, and comedy, then you'll love Sankarea. If you're looking for a spectacular anime that blows you away, Sankarea is not it. I recommend Sankarea if you're just looking for an anime to relax to and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I want to know what you guys think. If you've watched Sankarea, did you guys enjoy it? If not, would this be a anime you'd watch? Let me know your thoughts!",

            "content": "When I first came across this anime, I thought, zombies? In an anime? I had never heard of using these creatures as a main plot feature. So I immediately added it to my watching list and begun.\r\nThe first thing I noticed and loved about this anime  is its setting. A family living in the temple grounds in a country area, much more relaxed than the bustle of a busy city. Each of the character's in the family play their roles perfectly, and contrast each other nicely. There isn't any fooling around with the extreme anime cliches, such as the 'horror' of openly talking toa girl or touching them, and there are many nice hints to a peaceful family life. \\n\\n\r\nNow, down to the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\n  Sankarea introduces the three main characters off the bat, Saouji Ranko, Furuya Chihiro, and of course, Sanka Rea. It's obvious enough that these two will fight for Chihrio's love (with Rea being the 'true' route). I feel that the characters are developed at a well timed, gradual rate, beginning with 'Wanko' ( XD) and Chihiro's playfull nature, and Chihiro witnessing Rea's stress release at the abandoned hotel. As we learn more about these two girls and their relationship to Chihiro, his own traits are revealed. So without going into specific details, if you are sick of characters acting extremely tsundere, shy, or down-right annoying, this anime is a refreshing break that will leave you feeling concerned and engaged with its characters, instead of knitpicking at the tiny annoying things that many anime characters can get up to (I know I do when a character gets on my nerves). Overall; Character: 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\n  In accordance with the seeming Laws of the Anime Universe, this series sports a love triangle, with questionable outcomes for the characters, and comedic side characters that occasionally steal the spotlight for a good laugh (which are actually very funny, take note of the grandpa and Chihiro's best friend, Yasuda). However, one thing makes this anime stand out in the crowd, its plot device. I have never, never, heard of a zombie in an anime before. I feel this one one of the main reasons I started, and finished this show. I also love that they don't get absolutely side tracked on trivial matters, and instead choose to deal with practical issues (such as Rea's body rotting, instead of random beach and pool trips and losing bikinis etc). Overall, I found the plot to be quite original and witty, in the sense that addressed issues relevant to many watchers lives (such as horrible parents, lazy high school students, and chores/jobs/work). Overall; Plot: 9/10. (Another point to make is the minimal fan-service. No one looks tits shoved in their face allll the time). \\n\\n\r\nI believe that many anime's are based off their appearance, (and a quick synopsis read) which can immensely benefit a well drawn series compared to a crappy quick handed sketch. In my opinion, Sankarea sits a notch about the average. Its art isn't anything to rave about, however there are some beautiful scenes when the characters either go for a walk up a hill and look over the town at sunset (a scene which I rarely dislike), or a bird's eye view shot of the town at night ( I also love a good city-scape). However, the characters are quite attractive, and are definitely not an eye-sore. So if you aren't a super art fanatic and need everything is 10 million HD then there will be no problem. Overall; Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n  The biggest problem I had with this series was its OST. The soundtrack annoyed me. The OP song seemed to be just a throw away that they tacked on at the end of production. It appeared to me that minimal thought had gone into its selection. The soundtrack for a change of scene was also nothing special (Even though this is an area that most animes don't attempt to explore). If the OST for this series had more effort applied to it, I feel the show would improve dramatically. Overall; Sound: 5.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole this series is DEFINITELY worth watching. I could even say it's one of those shows I wish I hadn't seen, so I could re-watch it and experience it again. If you haven't already, add it to your list, and start watching :3. \\n\\n\r\nOverall; Sankarea: 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first ever review on MAL. (*\uff9f\u25bd\uff9f*)",

            "content": "Once you've seen a lot of anime that focuses on romance and comedy it tends to get harder to recall them individually; this is especially true for the countless number of shows which choose to sacrifice story presentation and deep characters in exchange for unspeakable amounts of fanservice. It's not necessarily a criticism of the entire genre though. I mean, there's only so much you can do with a standard plot usually involving two characters who fall in love, only to be denied by one reason or another.\r\nThe successful romantic comedies (and I mean in terms of quality and not just commercially because crap animemay also sell a lot) often overcome this by portraying endearing characters and relationships with enough realism to make you actually care what happens, in a way that's enjoyable to watch too. On the other hand, there are those which introduce elements such as aliens, deities, fantasy, gender benders or sports in order to mix things up a little. If handled in the right manner this results in a series that stands out from the majority of the pack, and one that you'll remember when thinking about romantic comedy anime in future. Sankarea is a prime example of this.\\n\\n\r\nZombies. The mere mention of this term in the synopsis means that rather than trying to be realistic, Sankarea belongs in the latter group of romantic comedies and introduces, yes, zombies into the story to give it an extra dimension. So how is it incorporated? To begin, our main character Furuya Chihiro is a high school student who has a rather unhealthy obsession with the undead that in most cases would cause everyone to avoid him, let alone girls. But as luck would have it, he encounters the beautiful Sanka Rea who has her own fair share of problems, and inevitably the two hang out together; their new relationship is heart-warming and there's a sort of nice and understanding connection between them. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to a sequence of events Rea dies and becomes a zombie, which brings with it a wealth of unique problems for the both of them. Although several issues are raised throughout the series, such as the exact nature of how Rea is revived and how long her body will last before it rots away, they are never really fully explored. Instead, the short twelve episode run includes: Rea adapting to her new situation with much help from Chihiro, family issues (in particularly Rea's father), the obligatory love triangle and a cat called Baabu. Praise should go to the series because there's excellent drama that provides an extra layer of development to its characters, but the final episode does end in quite an abrupt manner. \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the pacing is far from perfect as the anime starts off pretty well but slows down noticeably after the opening episodes. There's a couple of filler episodes that serve to flesh out the supporting cast, but they are positioned at strange points in the story which causes the pacing to stutter even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation in Sankarea is a variable aspect that may not be to everyone's tastes. Character designs and the attire they wear are usually on the simple side, whereas the background art can be stunning at times but less detailed and sharp at others. Fortunately, the art remains at least consistently decent throughout the length of the series, and character motions are always smooth and fluid.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is surprisingly good in Sankarea. Although sparingly used, there are a wide range of beautiful instrumental themes for the mysterious, sad and unsettling scenes in the anime, and also light-hearted tunes for the peaceful and comedy moments. The voice acting is adequate and none of the characters sound bad. The theme songs are pleasant to listen to, with a unique-sounding and energetic track by nano.RIPE (who also did an equally-catchy OP for Hanasaku Iroha) for the opening, and a calm/soothing song by Annabel for the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of decent characters, Sankarea is well-covered. As mentioned before the cat-like Furuya Chihiro's standout aspect is his zombie fetish, and he has some entertaining expressions and dialogue. However, he's willing to fully embrace his fetish despite what others think, he can act serious when the need arises, and he is also quick to make important decisions; these are strengths for a main character in this type of anime, and it works to make Chihiro a better than average lead. \\n\r\nSanka Rea is a student from a wealthy family who's popular at school and looks cheerful on the surface, but unknown to most people she's lived a sheltered life and wants to act more like a normal girl. She's a cute and fun character, yet much of the drama also springs from her side of the story to make you feel sympathy for her, especially as she tries to adjust to her new life. \\n\r\nThen there's Chihiro's cousin, Saouji Ranko, who is a likeable girl but sadly her role is limited to mostly comedy situations and fanservice while competing with Rea for Chihiro's affection. As opposed to Rea, Ranko is talkative, likes to beat up Chihiro, and is actually alive; this provides a good contrast in character between the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast includes quirky members of Chihiro's family (the relatively normal father, the senile but entertaining grandpa, the amusing and quiet younger sister Mero), as well as members of Rea's rich household who are interesting for vastly different reasons. He's a bit of a conundrum, but chances are you'll be surprised at how much of a freak Rea's father is during the full length of the series and beyond; it's easy to see why she wants to escape her family, but her freedom does come at great cost. Finally, to round things off there are a few school classmates who are used for comic relief and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not every day that you come across a touching romantic comedy which also includes darker themes like isolation and suicide, graphically bloody scenes, more than just a hint of craziness, and a supernatural spin. And yet, Sankarea pops up as an enjoyable anime series that has done a fantastic job at establishing its setting and a likeable group of core characters with relevant backstory. It's also screaming for a second season with an improved focus on storytelling and new events that should undoubtedly build on its existing potential.\\n",

            "content": "I had heard of Sankarea before and reading the premise I didn't except it to be any good; I expected it to be some ecchi romantic comedy with alot of black comedy and pointlessly dark moments, much like the lukewarm Elfen Lied. However, it caught my interest after seeing it labeled as one of the best anime of 2012 and started watching it some time after. And I was completely blown away.\r\nContrary to what others have said, this anime is NOT a romantic comedy in the least. Sure, it has some decent comedy but not a lot. What it gave me was an engaging dramawith two great leads and a lot of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the bad stuff though: Sankarea really doesn't have that many flaws honestly. Maybe the biggest flaw it has in my opinion is the character of Chihiro's pervert red headed friend whose name I can't recall. He was a VERY annoying character, being inconsiderate of other people, totally flat and as a comedic relief he failed miserably. In one scene, he actually makes Rea's situation WORSE giving me more reason to dislike him.\\n\\n\r\nAnother flaw that I can't really call a flaw so much as my own opinion is Rea's father. Oh my gosh, Rea's father is one of the most obnoxious, hateful, loathsome, horrifying, selfish villains I have ever seen in any medium. Unlike other truly evil villains like Griffith from Berserk or Johann from Monster, he has absolutely no redeeming values. The only time he did do something that wasn't self centered was ruined by the fact that he still engaged in horrifying and selfish desires after it. He's by no means a badly written character because he was very well written, it's just that he really, really isn't fun to watch. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing though.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the good stuff: animation (which was excellent and atmospheric) and sound aside (which was good), the characters of both Chihiro and Rea were just great. Chihiro isn't a typical romantic protagonist; he's not bland or boring, in fact he's rather quirky, can be funny and under his jerkass exterior is actually a rather swell guy. I immediately liked him and the story showed that he was a great guy by showing him being kind to Rea.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Rea, she ahs to be one of the greatest female anime characters I've ever seen. Not every female anime character has to be a badass like Rukia from Bleach nor do they have to be well adjusted people. In fact, Rea's back-story really hit me. When I found out what happened to her, I wasn't angry. I was FURIOUS. Ballistic. It was the kind of righteous fury where you want to do anything and everything to solve someone else's problem and that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to save Rea from her abusive home, I wanted to hug her and comfort her. Her personality was also really great. Beneath her suffering and the fact that she is a zombie, Rea is still a very normal girl, one who wants to do normal girly things. I like how instead of making her into a typical introverted girl who keeps to herself ala Rei Ayanami, they went into a different direction. Because of that, Rea feels like a real person and not a typical cookie cutter anime girl.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are Rea and Chihiro's interactions: there\u2019s some obvious sexual tension and the anime does point that the two will end up with each other and I'm really rooting for them to do so. Chihiro is a really kind person at heart and his declaration of protecting Rea and standing up to her is really sweet. As for the other characters like Mero, Ranko, Grandpa etc... They\u2019re all OK and memorable and interesting and with the exception of redhead pervert and Dan'Ichiro Sanka, they're all pretty likeable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 9 out of ten for excellence. I wish a second season came out soon because frankly, I want more and the 'ending' does sort of point out that the story will continue. It's not a 10/10 as it's not something like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Monster but it doesn't have to be. Is it recommended? Highly so, but don't except this anime to be some ecchi rubbish because it is not. While it does have some fanservice, it also has a lot of fan disservice and the tragic moments should not be taken as opportunity for engaging in lustful thoughts.\\n",

Since I will come back later to write a longer review. \r\nThe most unique thing is the story- a relationship/romance between a zombie and human. \r\nMovies that adopted this plot existed before but I don't believe any anime has done this. \r\nEqually splendid plot is that the girl Sanka actually chose to become a zombie to liberate herself from the patriarchal control of her hypocritical father. The idea that being undead as a liberation from the reality is definitely not new asyou can find examples in many zombie movies.But this vision is still fairly non-mainstream and radical in a sense.",

Then there is the main antagonists that try to separate them but soonstops.  Which is basically all I'm going to say.",

However , due to some people that suggested Sankarea to me , i just got to give this one a shot and it did a good job capturing my interest . But , some good anime are bound to have a flaw and Sankarea are one of them . There aren't much flaw in it but a flaw is still a flaw .\r\nStory:7\r\nThe reason why it have my interest is because of the story plot it self . Its perfect . Not too perfect because someepisode just make my interest keep getting lost and some just make me want to watch more . I guess it have its on way on getting people interest .\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe arts are good . Nothing bad and all . Its one of those anime that can capture your attention with its beautiful arts .\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nYes for the first time in my life , i gave a rating a 10/10 . The sound are good including the voice actor .  I never bother to listen to any anime opening theme song if its not good but Sankarea did make me\u00a0listen to it and i love it . Don't forget about the ending theme song\u00a0too . Either way , it deserve 10/10 from me .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nNot much to say about the character because every character does have its charm(don't know why but Rea father also have its charm in a creepy way i guess) . Put that aside , i just love Rea because she is the type of person that can make you say \"Kawaii!!!!\" or something like that . I can only give it an 8 rating because it missing something that i don't know how to describe .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nSometimes it make me wanting to watch more and sometimes it just make me think to myself , lets stop for now . Either way , i enjoy the rest of episode just fine but there are some that didn't capture my interest .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nWell i can say that Sankarea did a good job on making me wanting more because i still want more than just 12 episode . But , i can only hope that there is gonna be more in the near future .",

Lets start with characters:\r\n1. Chihiro, he like zombies and he is gay.\r\n2. Rea, smart and beautiful both in and outside, shes the reason i watched this show.\r\n3. Chihiro's Family, Monks that seems to be on drugs all time because they talk very slow.\r\n4. Ranko, annoying childhood loveinterest of Chihiro, she realy wants a bf anddosn't realy care about anything even real zombies.\\n\r\n5. A bunch of annoying sidecharacters that exist to prevent you from enjoying the story by constantly force dumb and uninteresting scenes that dosn't have anything to do with the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the episodes:\\n\r\n ill count first 0-4 together because ist just a little pre-story that was streached from 15 minutes to almost 2 hours.It's like you go to a movie about zombies and zombies appear only after 2 hours. In those story tells about Chihiro and Reas life.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5. Well imagine you meet a real zombie girl and she is cute and nice 17 year girl.\\n\r\nWhat would you do?\\n\r\n1. talk to her for days\\n\r\n2. ask her how she feels and what is is like to be a zombie\\n\r\n3. flirt with her\\n\r\n4. just stare at her for days\\n\r\n5. go out to with your friends for like 10 hours and talk about something unrelated\\n\r\nWhat do you think Chihiro that is all crazy about zombies picked? Yes you guessed its 5! So 45% of this episode where zombie girl finaly appears is not even about her.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6. Little spoiler: zombie girl dosn't feel well, so what is our hero going to do when a girl need help?\\n\r\n1. find out why zombie cat dosnt have such problems\\n\r\n2. make another potion\\n\r\n3. go clean a shrine for a whole day because your parent said so and you want ot be a good boy.\\n\r\nOfc our gero picked 3. and this whole episode is basically him cleaning temple and talking to his very slow talking family then when you think it finaly done.. a Ranko appear to help keep you away from the story longer. Well basically this whole episode is about our hero cleaning th temple. On some point Rea gets a bit better and decided to save herself, ofc because even in her zombie mode where she cant realy think or even talk she is still smarter then Chihiro, che choose first option and fallows the cat tofind out how he survived and as result saves herself.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7. For no reason we get a whole episode about annoying Ranko, we learn about her childhood and her love for Chihiro and buch of other boring shi we never wanted to know.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8. Finaly back to actual story!!! yay!!! This is so special, every scene in this Episode deserves a seporate review and an oscar.\\n\r\nThis story starts so well, Rea finaly goes out to a mall and enjoys life she realy desered after all she has been thru.\\n\r\nBut not for long, because for some reason Chihiro desides to go check another side of this mal leaving her.\\n\r\nAnd suddenly annoying friend of chihiro appears and start to talk how he likes Rea and how they should go check outside and not listening what Rea says just takes her hand and drags her towarde entrance LEAVING HER STUFF BEHIND.. japan is fkn weird.. \\n\r\nBut thats is just a start, there also 3 guys that want to kidnap Rea and because a multi level full of people mall is best place for this they decide to attack them near entrance because there were only 10 random people around but they they were like 3 meters away so nobody noticed how 2 grown up guys attacked 17 your girl picked her up and are draging her out while shes resisting.. every day life in japan it seems..\\n\r\nAs Rea gets a bit lose and yell for help so loud that even our hero on second level of the mall hears her but all the >200 mall shopers ignore it completely, nobody care, nobody call cops and apperently there is no security in this mall.\\n\r\nSo Rea has to save her herself again. When our hero finaly gets there, all 3 criminals and his dumb friend anre on floor, so naturaly he decide to not call cops but to ask those guys questions, because they will surly answer right?!\\n\r\nWell they decide to kidnap him. \\n\\n\r\nWell i will start a new paragraph because what happen next is so epic.\\n\r\nTwo kidnapers take chihiro and run with him.\\n\r\nFor no reason in same second chihiros friend regain conscious and catches Rea's foot so she cant run after them.\\n\r\nThen after get far enough he releases her foot and gets unconscious again.\\n\r\nWhile third kidnaper apperently managed to stand up run towards his car that was like 10 meter away, open door, start engine, drive to pick other guys and that all in like 5 seconds.\\n\r\nThere you have to pause anime an just think about. Then you release that third kidnaper mus be able to accelerate to about 58 k/h in les then 300 ms and i cant explain how he managed do stop and not crashed in his own car.\\n\\n\r\nEpidode 9. Well we got a half season anime where 0-4 episode is a prestory and here goes another whole episode about unrelated side story about another sidecharacter nobody cares about. Well to be fair there is a short but nice scene with Rea and a bit of related story.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10. actualy good, we get to learn some non surprising story about Reas live, even if it feels like we knew all this from before, but it is a related story.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11. This is just weird and unserius sometimes, considering this being the big bos fight, it is actualy not good. Rea is being awesome as usualy, but story is plain trashy.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13 / 12 , very good episode, just nice watch.\\n\\n\r\nWell considering Rea and awesome outro song, i decided to overrate this anime.\\n",

At the time i hadn't seen that sort of twist on the whole zombie idea and it was sort of unique to me which made it all the better. The show itself tells a real nice story about a boy and girl with the whole twist of dead coming into play and they do a good job explaining everything to you so youdon't feel like there are any plot holes, though it worked against in some cases where the show sorta got a little boring. \\n\r\nShould you watch this show? Yes i think you should, i feel like the well developed story and fun characters is well enough to watch this show and enjoy it \\n\r\nHope the review helps \\n\r\nMurphy",

I'm not joking, this anime was recommended to me by friend, I am happy that the person has recommended it to me (if you've ever seen my list of the reviewed anime, you may notice that so far I have the luck for good anime, yet). Lets talk about the story, shall we? (Although not the most original but that doesn't matter). The story begins quietly, as it may seem but then something happens and it starts getting momentum, that continues through oneor two episodes , and then somehow goes away slightly, and at the end turn will begin to get more momentum again (bad example, but it will do), it doesn't matter this anime was/is good. As you could read in the label, its about zombies, more like about one zombie. Caution a slight preview of the story - Reader discretion advised. So our main protagonists had met (Chihiro and Rea) Rea suddently dies from accident, but (that the point when I mentioned its getting momentum) resurrects as zombie (I will not talk about how it happended, if you want to know, go watch the entire series) so her father want her back (When you start watching this anime, you will hate him, buuut at the near end you will forgive him) but she refuse, she want to be with Chihiro, to live as normal girl and have freedom that she hasnt when she was with her father. Still father want her back. In that time we will meet Chihiros sister, cousin, father, his perverted friend aaand ridicuosly small and funny grandpa. Only things that are making barier between Chihiros and Reas relationship is: 1 Reas father, 2. Chihiros cousin (that cousin is actually she, and she want him = incest, thats right folks), 3. circumstances. Still reading this? Good. This anime has 12 episodes and 3 OVAs, if you will manage to watch it all you will find out, that this anime ist that bad actually and you will start like it (as for most reviewers that reviewed this anime) OVAs will take you through story of Mero (Chihiros sister) at the time Rea is in their household, Babu (Chihiros cat, he is zombie too), and the first one will take you to the time before the time of main story. Although this anime is from 2012 its good, very good, and am happy i was able to saw it. Go watch it, if you want...",

            "content": "Main Male Lead, Furuya Chihiro,a man who has watched horror movies since young and has grown attached to them, has an ideal girl who.... is a zombie. One fine afternoon, with the sun shining, he gets to live with a girl, the woman of his dreams. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nZombies? There's hardly any anime which includes love with a zombie! Blood, death, censoring, zombies, love, comedy? All here. This anime should be one of the favorites of those who like blood and romantic comedy animes. Sometimes, I honestly found it a bit too simple. About the ecchi genre listed? No. I don't think it even deserves theecchi genre. Reason being that there is barely any fan service except for 98% skin reveal by a man, which is not really appealing or attractive, at all. I guess the ending was alright although\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler - Both Main Male and Female Leads turn into zombies. Except one turned into a zombie faster than the other and it was the female lead's fault that the male lead turned into a zombie.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying I hate the female lead.\\n\\n\r\nNot that bad compared to some other types of anime. Although I would really want the ending to change, it was better than some other types of anime which kill all their characters. E.g. School Days\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was relatively good. It showed how the characters was feeling spectacularly. The art will probably be stuck in your head for a bit. The way the injuries were drawn was very typical. Although there actually was a censor at one of the points which refused to let viewers see the injury, it was okay. Female lead, Sanka Rea, was drawn well, top to bottom. (Not literally) Character's personality matched the character itself quite a bit. Not top notch but a level below that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI just found the VA's voice suitable for the character itself. Besides that, maybe the way the movies in the anime were played. I could not really hear what they were saying. But the sound effects are relatively good. Especially Babu. I love Babu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's personality is appealing. ' Best friend jealous of other best friend who attracts chicks ' clich\u00e9.  Well, if I must say, the person I would dislike the most is Sanka Rea's father. He, oh god, he is a father who is a pervert. \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler -\\n\r\nI mean, who takes nude photographs of his own daughter? \\n\\n\r\nRelated to spoiler but not spoiler. But, I guess it's a spoiler so you can just skip it -\\n\r\nJust to remember his late wife? Why don't he just take a photograph of her and treasure it?\\n\\n\r\nBest supporting character I like? I already mentioned it but Babu. I absolutely love Babu. His purr, his tail, his body. It's cute. Can't stand it really. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime makes you want to watch it till the end. The episodes stop at just the right time to make the suspense wide. Thus, making you want to continue to watch. I'll probably remember this anime as the first anime which includes love with zombies. Got to treasure that, you know. For a first timer (watching anime), this would be a rather good anime to start off with. Provided that you're not afraid of zombies and all. A great way to start off with romantic comedy anime genres. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI just gave it because I gave it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Mind my English.)",

NO! this is nothing like that its a bit more on the serious obsession side. bottom line this would be recommended to those who have a love for crazy risks and hardcore love an gore people such as me. this anime is a really serious one so I would rate it on the same level as angel beats. its serious guys give it a try if you have time -_- ^_^ \\n\\n\r\notegato gozaimas",

After an incident where the families pet cat dies in an accident, Chihiro tries to resurrect it...and succeeds. However, After a fated meeting with rea during his experiments she steals some of the potion to use as apoison on herself. After her failed attempt at suicide she runs from home only to be killed when confronted by her father who accidentally pushes her off a cliff to her death. From there....You have to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in a nutshell isn't to bad. odd, but good.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were impressive. With the show having a fairly small cast of characters we got to know everyone. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you see it) the characters seem to follow a very generic route that we have all seen before. The only difference though is the way there presented.\\n\\n\r\n For example - Chihiro is the obsessed otaku for zombie/horror movies.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nStudio deen...enough said\\n\\n\r\nActually the art wasn't terrible in this show. It was bland, had very little color at times, and looked boring. But the show did shine when it wanted too, but not to the degree of complete eye candy. Honestly, don't watch this show for the art.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fine. I usually skipped the OP and ED because they were boring and too energetic for me. Honestly, I was expecting this show to be darker than it was. The music is fine, but nothing stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is amazing.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL~\\n\\n\r\nThis show was good, But not a master piece. With the low quality art, strange story, and less than pleasing ending (BECAUSE IT DOESN'T END!!!), this show doesn't score well with me. The show was enjoyable, and I liked how it tried to explain the complications of try to preserve a zombie while hiding it from the public. It's not that I don't recommend this show, but there are better options out there. If your looking for a short series to enjoy by yourself then watch it. \\n\\n\r\nRating - Stream it",

The ecchi theme was NOT the core problem though! You will get what I mean soon enough. Also, I have not read the manga yet and won't take it into consideration at all in this review.\r\nOkay, sorry but I won't write this traditionally as I think it will only take up space and waste your valuble time. I liked the story, art and sound with no major flaws that would hurt enjoyment orthe overall score. The thing that DID though, is mainly the character called Ranko Saouji. I don't want to start a flame-war, but this character should have been excluded from the series and I will now tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nShe has no depth and is only seen as an obstacle more than anything else. She takes up all too much space that would have made room for the actual story to progress. And can you guess what... she is the embodiment of fan-service in this anime and shows no purpose besides flashing her tits in your (and the MP's) face. The ecchi scenes were fine. Her? No. This may sound offensive, but she wasn't even visually appealing... at all (Sorry, personal preference).\\n\\n\r\nSo you have all these other lovable characters that you want to explore and learn more about (maybe even have fan-service of). Then there's Ranko, who has no character development, isn't funny or attractive and has an annoying (and highly clich\u00e9d) personality. THIS character gets a whole episode dedicated to show off her past! I literally moaned when I realised this and struggled to get through that particular episode (not as easy as it sounds). It was so stupid, so badly written I wanted to... nevermind. \\n\\n\r\nAll the interesting and hilarious characters are instead put far back in the background with just very short conversations to keep them alive. Such a waste.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I think I'm done bashing. \\n\\n\r\nBesides this, the anime was beautiful, funny and utmost enjoyable to watch. This is by far the best ecchi anime I have ever seen. I recommend it deeply. It had the potential to become much better though.  \\n\\n\r\nJust skip the 7th episode and you might make it through. It has no relevance to the rest of the series and you will get right back on track by going from 6 to 8. I just saved some of your valuble time, you should thank me.   \\n\\n\r\nI'm going home. I'm so tired of being disappointed.",

            "content": "Known for venturing to where many people dare not tread, the world of Japanese anime production has gotten crazier each year. From depictions of a post-apocalyptic world riddled with zombies to creations solely focusing on the idea of \"moe\", the range and possibilities of anime in Japan are limitless and endless. Given the aforementioned story styles are on opposite ends of the spectrum, you might think that it'd be impossible to see the two being combined into one. Well, think again. With the production of Sankarea, the Japanese have unleashed the questionable idea of \"zombie moe\" into the anime community. So will this bold andinnovative combination be a raging success, or will it be yet another experimental failure? Let's take a look. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nAlthough there were times where the lack of effort could be seen quite easily, the animation quality of Sankarea was for the most part decent. In terms of background details, they can be considered up to par with current standards. The depictions of hydrangea, which was a prominent symbol in the show, were on the plus side as I found them to really stand out apart from everything else. As for the character designs, I was glad that the characters didn't look totally generic; the designs seemed fresh and made it so it was easy to distinguish the characters from one another. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nIn general, characters inside a zombies-based story change through struggling and persevering through the most gruelling of situations, while characters that are part of more light-hearted stories focusing on moe develop via interaction with others. In Sankarea, the characters are living a normal, everyday life for the most part, so the latter holds this time around. The development of the main character, Furuya Chihiro, focuses mostly on his gradually maturing personality. At first, Chihiro is depicted as a socially awkward teenager with a weird fetish. But soon enough, after his seemingly impossible dream came true, he began to develop a sense of responsibility, and started to act and think on a more mature level. Along the way, his interactions with various characters aid in these changes, with female protagonist Sanka Rea being an integral part of Chihiro's development. In exchange, Rea also develops as a character thanks to the time she spends with Chihiro. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nIt's not too often I find a piece of music that sticks with me well after the anime ends, but for Sankarea, \"Sukeru Hitomi\" does just that. To me, it's one of the most memorable OST tracks of the year so far. The way it intensifies the emotions of the scenes in which it's played in really helped to increase my overall enjoyment of the show. As for the theme songs, the relationship between the OP and the ED is similar to that of the two main genres of the series\u2014pretty much the opposite of each other. While the OP is fast-paced and upbeat, the ED slower and more mellow; both were great tracks though. And although no big-name seiy\u016bs were involved in this project, I felt the characters' emotions were brought out well nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nOn the surface, Sankarea is a romantic comedy aimed slightly towards zombie enthusiasts, but more so for those who enjoy stories of romance. The idea of coupling a human and a zombie in itself is bound to create some comedic situations. Throw in a childhood friend of the male protagonist and you've got your typical love triangle too. But in the end, I view Sankarea as somewhat of a tragedy (in the dramatic sense). That's not to say the story's bad; in fact, I actually like how it turned out that way. In an essence, Sankarea is a story about a pair of star-crossed lovers who try their best to avoid the inevitable\u2014that one day, they'll be separated for good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nSo while the idea of \"zombies\" and \"moe\" sounds crazy, in the end, Sankarea is just another typical romantic comedy, but with a twist. Clearly, the show is best suited for the niche audience of people like Chihiro\u2014those who dream of being in a relationship with a zombie\u2014but even if you're not that type of person (I know I'm not), it's still an enjoyable show. Having a season two would be nice as the ending was open-ended and left viewers wondering what would happen next. Overall, Sankarea is a solid series worth watching.",

As of now, I haven't watched that episode, so I'm just reviewing the first 12 episodes.\r\nThis anime is kind of wonky. I didn't have a problem watching it, which means that I didn't find it bad by any means. However, it also was that great. The story itself was kind of all over the place. My biggest issue with it is that Rea's father got a redemption arc, which to me, is unacceptable. Not to mention,it was completely out of place and out of character. It didn't line up at all with the rest of the story. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the premise is very strange. I guess I can give it points for originality, but the fact that Rea being a zombie is so easily accepted by all of the characters is sort of annoying. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as good aspects of this anime go, it was entertaining, and that probably is mostly because of the main character. I'm familiar with his voice actor, so pretty much anything he said was entertaining to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nIs this a love story? Not really, no. At least, not one that's well done. It's essentially grasping at straws and running with the smallest hint of attraction these two have for each other. Anyway, it wasn't a complete wash to watch, but I don't think I'll be returning to it in the future.",

            "content": "I may be over-rating this because it's the first series I've totally finished.  This series could have easily been a confused mess, since you can't really nail it down as one or even two genres, but it actually works really well.\r\nStory:  Although this series centres around a young boy's unhealthy obsession with zombies, it's overall quite unambitious in scope and knows its limitations only being a 1 season, 12 episode series (but i STRONGLY recommend watching the 2 OVA episodes & 'episode 13'). The word ambitious isn't intended as a criticism here, rather that it knew better than to delve way too deepand develop way too complicated character arcs that couldn't possibly be fully fleshed out in a single season.  You could probably guess what the series is going to mainly comprise of after watching the first 5 minutes of episode 1, but that doesn't mean it's not good storytelling.  POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THE SECTION: I also found the episode centred around Mero Furuya particularly good, providing some additional background to some of the side characters that I wasn't expecting the series to be able to do elegantly, also at the beginning of the episodes there's quite an amusing 4th wall break which I liked considering the series doesn't really take itself too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  There's not really anything to complain about here, the art isn't as beautiful as some animes that are renowned for their artistic beauty but I would say the art style used was a perfect fit for the seriousness of the series.  If it was 'Kimi no na wa' levels of art with a stunning panoramic every 15 seconds it would've felt out of place here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Based on the intro and the credits songs it deserves a solid 9 at least, since they're both just a perfect fit for the series in my opinion.  A critique of the music would be that the outro song wasn't written for the series (not that that matters particularly) and throughout the series the same soundtracks are used quite a few times frequently.  They're always used at times where you could consider their feel to be appropriate for the section of the show in which they're used, but nonetheless hearing the same track a few times cheapens things slightly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION)  This is probably the one area where the whole series kind of lets itself down.  One of the main characters, Chihiro Furuya, has about all the depth of a puddle.  He's constantly portrayed in an incredibly shallow way, with a constant, unrelenting affinity for anything related to zombies since he was a toddler and complete reluctance to participate in any activity that is not directly related to zombies in any way.  Obviously you need to be in a weird place mentally to want to have a zombie girlfriend, but spending ~12 years obsessed on one thing and one thing only?  Especially considering that the study of zombies isn't a particularly nuanced topic with lots of complicated angles.  Some other side/supporting characters also had some characteristics that were clearly unbelievable and clearly just plot devices, but considering the entire series is told over roughly 5 hours, I can't hold that against them and thought that it was a very good effort.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  This is where the series shines for me.  Every episode felt good to watch and there was very little padding, the story explains itself very well and then wraps itself up in a neat package.  The show doesn't deal with some challenging issue that will make you reconsider your existence so you can really just enjoy it without having to go at full capacity just digesting its message, which can be a nice change of pace depending on what kind of stuff you normally watch.  At no point was I hovering my mouse trying to see how long an episode had left, as I've often done in the past.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I'd recommend this to just about anyone, but maybe don't watch it with someone who is on the fence about anime, because there are a few shower scenes that will probably reinforce negative stereotypes about anime.  You'll know within about 10 minutes of the first episode if this is your kind of thing to watch.  Will it ask you big questions about life and leave you a different person than before you watched it? No.  Will you have fun watching it and feel satisfied after watching it?  For sure. (but please watch the additional episodes too!)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

There are very few zombie animes out there, High School of the Dead and Is This A Zombie? being the most notable.

            "content": "Sankarea: Dead and Loving It\r\nWhile I'm not exactly a fan of the horror genre, this anime does a masterful job of mixing a little horror with a romance genre. Going into this anime, I wasn't sure what to expect and even after watching, I was surprised with what I got (if that makes any sense).\r\nSankarea, for the most part, is a series about a girl from a rich family that was dealt with a bad hand and in an attempt to commit suicide, she lives through it, dies later in an accident, and is revived due to her attempt to commit suicide (by poisoning). Itjust so happens that the poison she took to commit suicide is part of a potion to bring the dead back to life as an undead life form.\\n\\n\r\nThis series primarily revolves around two main characters. Chihiro, who is the son of a monk who is obsessed with zombies and Rea, the daughter of a wealthy school master who's been mentally abused by her father. Rea meets Chihiro when he tries to revive his dead cat by using an old, handwritten potion book of unknown origins.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is atmosphere. The animation, the writing, the music. Everything is so perfectly intertwined that the plot, as ludicrous as it sounds, becomes almost realistic. I think the theme that struck me the most was Rea's side of the plot. You had a rich daughter from a family that she wanted no part of. A family that granted her no freedom. Yet, when everything went against her, Chihiro, some \"weirdo\" kid with a zombie complex helped her in her time of need. It was such an enthralling story because even despite Chihiro's rather odd obsession with zombies, his main goal was to help Rea live the life of a normal girl, even though she's technically a zombie. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is a little difficult to describe because for one reason or another, it was an enjoyable watch. Chihiro, Rea, even the minor characters like Mero, Ranko, and Doon in their own way had their charm albeit Chihiro, Rei, and Danichirou for the most part stole the show. I really loved the family element behind this show with Rei struggling with the \"real\" family atmosphere before she's introduced to Chihiro's family. For someone who had a borderline pedophile father who's psychological abuse was quite extreme, this had to be quite a culture shock for Rea's character to handle. It was interesting watching the interactions and I must say, I absolutely loved Chihiro's interaction with Danichirou when the time came.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this series, despite my enjoyment of it, was the plotholes. They were quite evident with the biggest one being, why did Rea have a poision liquid that completed the potion for immortality? This was a MAJOR event early on in the series that got no explanation afterward although I was expecting one throughout the series. It did seem like one of those things that they would possibly cover in a 2nd season...if it even got one (at this point, I have my doubts). Another one of the plotholes would include the ending, which again, leads to the possibility of a 2nd season. I'd say the biggest problem the Sankarea season might have is their is probably enough material for a 2nd season (or a 24 episode anime) but since we're left with an open-ending, it leaves too many open questions. \\n\\n\r\nWith Sankarea being so open ended, how do I feel about this series as a whole? Well, it's enticing and unique for starters. Anytime you have a story about a zombie trying to live a normal life, I'm sure there's an audience wanting to know how that turns out. I'm not even really a big zombie fan and I found this series fascinating. The biggest problems with this series are as I mentioned. It just left way too much unanswered after a 12 episode series. This is one of those animes that really should've received a 24 episode set but wasn't granted that. One minor complaint I had with it was there was WAY too much fan service. I usually don't mind fan service that much as long as its used in moderation and there are reasons for having it...this series just sort of slapped it in your face and said, \"here you go, all the zombie fan service (and then some) that you could ever want.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fascinating series. I really enjoyed watching it and I find the enjoyment factor to be the strongest part of this series. However, there's far too much missing from this series for me to say it's a great anime. A good, fun-filled anime, yes indeed. A great anime?...It's just lacking too much for that sort of title.",

            "content": "Chihiro Furuya has no interest in the opposite sex.  This is of course far from uncommon in the anime world, as male protagonists often act chaste and reject the conventions of romantic or sexual attraction, but the difference with Chihiro is that he has an actual reason...  He\u2019s been obsessed with zombie fiction for as long as he can remember, he\u2019s been on the look out for a certain kind of girl that\u2019s just drop dead gorgeous...  That is to say, a hot zombie chick.  One day, after finding a mysterious ink-splatted book about resurrecting the dead in his attic, hisprecious pet cat Babu is run over by a local man\u2019s car, killing the freaky feline instantly.  Not yet ready to part with one of his only friends, Chihiro begins to study the old book, and begins to experiment with the potion listed inside of it, crafting different variations of the same concoction to try and find that one sweet mix that will bring Babu back to life.  Of course he can\u2019t do this at home, so he chooses an abandoned hotel as his makeshift mad science lab...  And that\u2019s where he meets Rea.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of the most popular girls in school and the daughter of it\u2019s owners, you might expect her to live a happy and privileged life, fulfilling and free of want, with nary a care in the world that wouldn\u2019t fall under the term \u201cFirst world problems.\u201d  You would be wrong, as the lifestyle of this rich and famous heiress is closer to that of a detainee than that of a debutante.  Putting up with her Father\u2019s soul-crushing over-protection and her Mother\u2019s alcohol-influenced indifference, she finds Chihiro\u2019s weirdness to be a pleasant diversion, and winds up becoming the igor in his experiments.  Unbeknownst to them, she actually manages to perfect the potion, so when she secretly steals of a vial of it to end her own life with, she soon winds up becoming the one thing he\u2019s always wanted...  A living dead girl.  But with her psychopathic father waiting for the perfect moment to strike, and her own mysterious condition presenting them with challenges at every turn, is there any hope for their boy-meets-ghoul romance?  Or like Rea, are they simply living on borrowed time?\\n\\n\r\nOnce upon a time, I came across somebody in the forums I frequent, denouncing Studio Deen as the worst animation company he\u2019s ever seen.  He showed a mediocre-looking clip from the first episode of Fate/Stay Night, calling it \u201cliterally the best looking thing they\u2019ve ever done.\u201d  Now I\u2019ll admit that that Deen\u2019s put out a few ass-looking anime before, but I was quick to show him clips from a few shows that I\u2019d specially selected to show just how amazing some of their shows can look...  And one of them was Sankarea, which had just begun to air on Funimation.com.  I selected this particular title for one specific reason...  Because the animation in this series is nothing short of perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong...  We are of course not talking about constant fluid motion, like what you may find in the best looking Kyoto Animation hows...  On screen movement is restricted to what\u2019s necessary, but it never feels like they\u2019re being held back by anything other than their own discretion.  When the movement does slow down, it\u2019s almost always for the sake of an emotionally significant moment, at which point it\u2019s more like the visuals stepping back and letting you become engrossed in the shock and gravity that you\u2019re supposed to be experiencing, which is further amplified by the exquisite art design and brilliant use of sound effects.  This gives the series a sense of energy and atmosphere that can, at times, make you feel as though you\u2019re really there in the moment alongside the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art design is rooted firmly in reality...  Well, blonde japanese girls with large breasts aren\u2019t exactly realistic, but you could consider that the exception that proves the rule.  Everything from a field of flowers to a row of trees to your basic urban settings are drawn with elaborate detail down to the very last blemish, arranged on screen with strict adherence to attractive color palettes and in ways that draw your eyes directly to the human characters living out their lives in the midst of it all.  Having said that, the use of off-beat camera angles and just plain weird shot set-ups doesn\u2019t always work, and can at times feel a little over-excessive, like they\u2019re trying way too hard to look like Studio Shaft, who can be extremely hit or miss in terms of visuals in their own right.  Some occurrences deserve to be explored from less commonplace angles, but when you\u2019re trying to spice up a conversation in a locker room by having three characters open up their lockers as though they\u2019re practicing their timing for a synchronized swimming meet, the show can start to look a little pretentious.  The character designs are also a bit strange, despite the mostly realistic body proportions...  I will never for the life of me understand why old people are often portrayed as little people...  And then there\u2019s the main character\u2019s cat-like hairdo, which I\u2019m sure has some sort of symbolic meaning in regards to his zombie cat.  Rea looks like the stereotypical standard of young Japanese beauty, and while I would be crying \u2018generic\u2019 over it, there\u2019s an argument to be made that her father simply raised her to look like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending portions are just beautiful.  The OP, Esoragoto by nano.Ripe, is one of my favorites of all time for some damn good reasons.  Asiude from the throwaway \\n\r\nside-character breakdown that happens at about 45 seconds in, the imagery used in this opening is full of metaphors for the story of the anime, none of which you\u2019ll understand until probably your second time through.  They\u2019re very subtle in the way their presented, and the childish voice singing the lyrics perfectly emphasizes the tragedy of a young adolescent who was never truly allowed to experience childhood, and thus hasn\u2019t been allowed to grow up.  The ending, Above Your Hand by Annabel, takes that idea to it\u2019s natural conclusion...  Rea in a bowling alley, what one might consider the ideal teen hangout, just lying in the lane and waiting to get struck, knowing she\u2019ll never truly live and patiently, serenely awaiting death to take her.  There\u2019s a good reason the singer sounds older here than in the OP...  It\u2019s the harsh reality to the op\u2019s unsettlingly upbeat fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nIn keeping with these thematic ideals, Yukari Hashimoto composed the soundtrack to hit two major note...  One decidedly better than the other.  Half of the OST explores the emotional trauma faced by Rea...  The exact nature of which is betrayed by an array of music box, organ and piano orchestrations.  The other half is tailored more towards Chihiro, and there\u2019s a reason nobody\u2019s going out of their way to upload them on youtube.  These tunes skew more towards the background, and have a much more homey feel to them...  They can be downright happy and disarming, and while they\u2019re perfectly fine in their own right, the emotional resonance of the stronger half of the soundtrack does tend to attract more attention.  Personally, my favorite is Babu\u2019s theme, Babu no Iru Fuukei, which just sounds like the anthem of a cat strutting around town without a care in the world, and it\u2019s surprisingly easy to dance to.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is also top notch, which shouldn\u2019t surprise you if you look at the list of names involved before viewing.  The backstage work is in the hands of the right people, with Joel McDonald directing and Monica rial writing the script, two choices you can\u2019t go wrong with.  Jamie Marchi stayed the hell away from the script, which is also to it\u2019s great credit, as she\u2019s a far better actor than she is a writer.  She plays Chihiro\u2019s cousin Ranko, and while she\u2019s played more than her fair share of loud, energetic girls, her character has a great deal more emotional depth than your typical incest-obsessed cousin cliche, and Marchi makes you genuinely feel for this character who would probably come off as annoying in anyone else\u2019s hands.  David Wald, whom I\u2019m convinced can do no wrong, plays Rea\u2019s creepy father, bringing forth an air of pride and nobility, with some heavily unsettling tones lurking just beneath the surface.  \\n\\n\r\nMonica Rial is of course adorable as a zombie cat, as is Felecia Angelle, who plays Chihiro\u2019s ghost-obsessed sister Mero with the perfect deadpan sarcasm.  However, the real surprise here is with our two leads, Chihiro and Rea.  Ever since Aaron Dismuke hit puberty, I\u2019ve found his performances to be extremely hit-or-miss, but he was luckily able to play off of his own obsession with zombies to play his strange, socially awkward character.  His performance could be described as one note, but it\u2019s the kind of one-note an introverted teenager would believably use, and he\u2019s more than capable of emoting through it whenever he needs to.  And what\u2019s more shocking is that I\u2019ve NEVER liked Tia Ballard, the high-pitched banshee who ruined the first episode of Shiki for me.  But in the title role of Rea Sanka, there are no words for how amazing she is.  She shows an unbelievable amount of control over her voice, and is able to put forth consistent quality whether her character is cheerful, suffering, or going through rigor mortis(her approach to which is hilarious).  When she goes into her backstory, her expository dialogue can be downright heartbreaking, and it\u2019s clear she feels all the pain in her character\u2019s heart.  She can come off as a bit too whiny and spoiled at some points in the story, but I can\u2019t really fault the actor for that...  It is, unfortunately, the way the character was written.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s that?  You think it\u2019s weird for a girl who\u2019s been established as an abuse victim to be portrayed as annoying and spoiled?  Well, get ready for worse, because this show is really freaking weird.  And I\u2019m not referring to it\u2019s concept, either...  This is one of the most bafflingly executed anime series I\u2019ve ever seen.  It has no sense of tone, it constantly shoots itself in the foot with it\u2019s lack of focus, and seemingly has no idea what it wants to be.  Is it an intense, dramatic character study?  Is it a light-hearted slice of life with an unusual premise?  Is it a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the zombie genre?  Hell, it could be all of those things without feeling nearly as jarring...  Comedy, drama and off-kilter subject matter has been handled expertly in shows like Ouran Highschool host club... but Sankarea just doesn\u2019t understand how.  \\n\\n\r\nOur central character is Chihiro, a zombie obsessed boy who immediately gains your attention via some subtle hints that he actually doesn\u2019t want a zombie girlfriend, and is only saying that as an excuse to himself as others as to why he\u2019s not yet mature enough to be interested in girls.  He lives in a house with what could almost be called a Japanese Addams Family, has a dead cat he\u2019s trying to resurrect, which(along with his own cat-like appearance) could be a metaphor that he desperately wants to get a life himself.  He\u2019s one of the better male protagonists I\u2019ve seen, but he\u2019s immediately over-shadowed by the lead female, Rea.  Not long after she\u2019s introduced, we start to hear her story, and it is so bizarrely horrifying that it winds up hijacking the story.  It\u2019s like hearing about a triplegic puppy who just found out it has another case of leg cancer, it\u2019s that merciless of an attack on your sympathies.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, we\u2019re told that her father takes naked pictures of her on her birthday, which she\u2019s sick of.  Then we find out that he shelters and controls her, firing any maid who he doesn\u2019t agree with, possibly killing a stray cat that got too close to the house, and using his influence to destroy the lives of the family of a girl she\u2019d confided to about the pictures.  You\u2019d think that\u2019s bad enough, but as the story goes on, we also learn some things that are supposed to make him feel more sympathetic, but they just wind up making the situation feel all the more sinister.  I won\u2019t give away the spoiler that reveals this, but it becomes evident by the end of the series(to anybody who\u2019s really paying attention) that he\u2019s planning to start engaging in a physical relationship with her as soon as she turns 16.  Hell, there\u2019s an OVA episode where it\u2019s heavily implied that he takes extra naked pictures of her that DON\u2019T wind up in the official collection.\\n\\n\r\nEvery time I watch this series, my heart feels heavy for Rea, and the tone of the series at that point is appropriately crushing.  But that tone starts to fade, and by the time she\u2019s become a zombie, it\u2019s all but gone.  We go right back to silly, weird slice of life zom-com fare.  It feels like you\u2019re watching a different show, and the worst of it has to be the gratuitous fan-service.  Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve got nothing against animated nudity.  I\u2019m no prude with that kind of thing, and if it\u2019s done well, I welcome it.  But Sankarea is that rare title where it just feels like a horrible, misguided idea.  Remember, we just got through a soul-crushing backstory where it was firmly established that the exploitation of her naked body is supposed to feel sick and wrong.  Why not follow this up with pointless shower scenes(she even states that she doesn\u2019t need them because she doesn\u2019t sweat) where she\u2019s confusedly squeezing a loofa between her boobs and getting comedically attacked by an old man?  Yeah, they use her hair as a source of convenient censoring, and even if they didn\u2019t she has no nipples for us to ogle(which is strange, because Ranko definitely does), but it still feels wrong.  It starts to feel like the writers and animators are no better than her father.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it is of course possible to start an anime on an emotionally turbulent note and still have it be a comedy.  It\u2019s not an immediately terrible idea, but you have to commit in some way to both sides of the story.  In Kotoura-san, we follow a telepathic girl as she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s not supposed to be able to read minds, so she unknowingly alienates her friends and destroys her own family by revealing peoples\u2019 secrets to each other.  She grows up depressed and cynical, until she meets a group of friends who are willing and eager to accept her for who she is, and even though she has many hilarious misadventures with them, we\u2019re never spared the psychological effects of her unfortunate childhood and the damage that she has to overcome, and we\u2019re terrified of what will happen when her mother re-enters the story.  See?  This sort of thing can be executed well, but you have to work to make IT work.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not like Sankarea doesn\u2019t try...  That\u2019s the most frustrating thing about it.  It has depth, but it doesn\u2019t know what the fuck to DO with it.  First of all, this series is a subversion of the magical girlfriend genre, style of story where a male protagonist who\u2019s unlucky in love receives a female companion who\u2019s perfect for him through supernatural means, and likely has to teach her an unspecified amount of stuff about the world around them, while she finds fulfillment in simply being his waifu.  Sankarea is the zombie version of this, which is a welcome diversion compared to the homogeny of the genre.  She\u2019s found happiness in death that she didn\u2019t have in life, a;though this is eventually shelved so the story can focus on exploring the physical properties of zombies in it\u2019s canon.  Frankly, I would have loved to see the trope humanized further by having Rea get uncomfortable with Chihiro filming her for research, as such an activity would probably remind her of her father\u2019s photo sessions.\\n\\n\r\nBut while we\u2019re on the subject of Chihiro and Rea\u2019s dad, there\u2019s a whole other can of worms lurking in that subject.  A few times during the series, Chihiro reflects on how he\u2019s no better than her Dad, because he keeps her locked up in the house.  This serves as a convenient reason for him to take her on some walks around town, but what the anime fails to realize is that the similarities go a lot deeper than that.  Yeah, they both keep her locked up, but it\u2019s also worth mentioning that she symbolizes an unusual fetish for each of them, and also that they both value her primarily as a triumph of life over the tragedy of death...  Chihiro because she\u2019s a zombie who literally came back from the dead, and Rea\u2019s father for certain spoiler reasons.  Aside from those rare moments of lucidity that I mentioned before, Sankarea never capitalized on these things, forgoing a wealth of possible depth in exchange for an ending that begs for an unlikely sequel and a resolution that deals with Rea\u2019s father almost as poorly as Akihiko was dealt with in Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Sankarea a bad show?  I don\u2019t think so.  Yeah, there are a lot of negative aspects to the writing and execution of the series, but most of them are more like missed opportunities than actual flaws.  It\u2019s like I said before, this is just a really weird show all around, and it can make for a bewildering experience, regardless of what you were expecting from it.  It\u2019s overuse of cliches can be irritating, especially when it comes to Chihiro having basically the same two best friends as Kyon from Haruhi and several other protagonists had, but it manages to cast more of it\u2019s cliches in an interesting and fresh light than not.  Hell, even the incest-crazy cousin is way more sympathetic and relatable than she should be, by any convention.  Honestly?  I just can\u2019t help but enjoy it in all of it\u2019s flaws, just because of how bizarre it is.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea is available from Funimation.  It was originally released as the censored TV cut, but was later released uncensored, although if i\u2019m being totally honest, if you can save some money by picking the censored version, you probably should.  There really isn\u2019t that much difference between them.  For the extra money you get a couple shots of zombified Rea with her guts hanging out, as well as no more than 30 collective seconds of uncensored nudity that you\u2019ll barely miss.  The uncensored version is cheaper now than when it was released, going for thirty-five bucks instead of sixty, but you can still find copies of the censored version floating around Ebay for ten to fifteen bucks.  The original manga is available stateside from Kodansha entertainment, and while I haven\u2019t read it, it apparently offers a more complete story.  It has a few OVAs, and while one of them made it onto the DVD set as an episode, the other two did not, and are not available stateside.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea is far from perfect, but I still have to stick to my guns on one thing I said two years ago...  It\u2019s the best zombie anime ever made.  It creates it\u2019s own logic from scratch instead of clumsily trying to reinterpret and reinvent the existing logic, choosing to paint the many established zombie lores as the works of fiction that they are.  It\u2019s love of the zombie sub-genre and dedication towards being a new and distinctive entry into said sub-genre is what ties the series together with a note of other-wise sorely lacking consistency, and to it\u2019s credit, the off-kilter execution just serves as one more thing that\u2019s unique about it.  There\u2019s a lot of things that it could have done better, and there are parts of it that feel jarring and uncomfortable, but I really like it\u2019s brand of weirdness, and would easily recommend it to anyone who loves zombies, but is sick and tired of watching the same old genre fare.  Even as a Halloween title, it might not be for everyone, but with it\u2019s high production values, offbeat campiness and unwavering devotion to the undead, I still recommend checking it out.  I give Sankarea a 7/10.",

WTF!. . .\r\nStarting from the chars there are good in general but... Well there is so much melodrama behind some charts that's just 'Too much' and unrelatable . But that's not necessarily bad. Their actions are and chars are well fleshed out and nothing illogical at least to my eyes...\r\nThe art is absolutely beautiful and stunning. Nothing really unique but the colors are just great. There is a particular scene that even made me wonder if i waswatching anime or a real life picture. There are details and overall overwhelmingly good. I can say its an eyeful literally.\\n\r\nThe story tho is clearly aimed for teenagers. And this anime is clearly for only to those who liked its concept otherwise you don't want to get involved trust me in this one.Its comedic aspects are highly laughable and romance content average. (it exist in other words)But there is no actual horrow and the ecchi contain are not extreme luckily. . . except the skin service...and one pedophile scene...Overall its neither a great one nor a serious one but i can ensure some laughs, in the very least.Actually, i had numerous of cliche moments, but nothing big or that went terribly wrong.\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\n\r\nSounds just doing their job right i guess. Nothing out of the box. The OP found it a bit deeper than the average Ecchi-Com-rom and kinda made me have big expectations of the show but it wasn't nothing of that sort, just random input things...The ED tho was fairly good! Would say it was well aimed and overall nice. \\n\r\n----------------------------------------Personal Thoughts and weaknesses--------------------------------\\n\r\nYou can't just mix Comedy-Horror and Ecchi-Shounen...those are some bad taste combinations... totally ridiculous and absurd especially in here...Comedy destroyed any serious development and its was just too hard to take it seriously after all that happened... The shipping also went terribly wrong here... You either ship Zombies or incest.Moreover, it had many cliche moments and after that cringe moments also follow through. Okey. Let's say your MC believes in afterlife and zombies. That's logical. But how can other \"NORMAL\" people believe in zombies when their told? Personally if someone told me he was a zombie i would seriously call a hospital for him. Last but not least,2nd season baiting or manga advertising. Dunno but it was so obvious that was bad!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i wouldn't call it completely bad since it was an easy and not so disturbing watch, but its not for everybody. So unless you are really edgy and tolerant to stupidity i wouldn't suggest it to you. \\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-the most normal and cool sister ,i've seen in an ecchi romance. Cheers!!\\n\r\n-If you love mentally sick people, you gonna like the Heroines Dad. He is just lovable!\\n\r\n- The majestic visuals and actually hilarious comedy.",

            "content": "Please don't read if you don't want anything spoiled.\r\nI'll do my best to keep from revealing some twists and turns, but I will hint at things.\r\nWell, I'll start by saying this-- I like to check out strange anime. Usually, when something seems odd, it's worth a shot, and sometimes I'm rewarded for my time. It turns out to be a good series no matter how crazy it initially seemed. I'm sure all romance-watchers out there have seen human + vampire and human + demon. I've seen those, and also a human + alien. Just when you thought things were crazy, I'm now watching a human+ zombie show. Odd, right? Well, maybe you wouldn't think so, but I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory~\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were what caught my interest. I'm the \"dark twists and turns, depressing backstory\" sort of person. When we found out that the main girl, Rea, is from a very odd and broken home, it snatched my interest. I was intrigued. We have the main guy, Chihiro, who's overly-obsessed with zombies trying to revive his dead cat, and a sheltered girl from a very \"different\" family. It's fun, right? Right. And so when some dramatic stuff happens (to be precise, Rea's overprotective father found out she was with Chihiro)... Well, all right, long story short she falls off a cliff and dies. Let's skip back slightly. Chihiro needs a potion to bring his cat back to life, and he needs a certain plant. But all he knows about this plant is that it's poisonous. He tries a bunch of different things, until finally, he decides it's not going to work and he gives up. But Rea had snuck some of the potion and drank it in the hopes it would kill her, since... you know, she's depressed about her life. The potion later ends up working, and Rea is revived, thus becoming a zombie.\\n\\n\r\nIf that didn't make sense, go watch the show. I don't know how else to explain it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this happens, some cliche things ensue. Rea goes with Chihiro to his house, where she stays. Some dramatic stuff happens, and she realizes she needs to eat hydrangea leaves to stay alive. It's another long story. After this, a love triangle ensues, and I can't say there's anything special about it. It seems stereotypical, and sometimes I wondered why I was even watching this. It was entertaining, though, so I couldn't seem to stop clicking the link for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then episode 10 comes on. Warning-- this might be slightly spoiler-y. To me, this was one of the best episodes (along with the first few), because it was so dramatic and, to me, different. (Or maybe I just haven't seen that many anime.) Aria, Rea's mother, reveals some secrets about her marriage with Dan'ichiro (Rea's father, if you didn't know). The entire story caught my attention very well, and my eyes wouldn't move from the screen. It was a depressing and very odd flashback episode, but I personally enjoyed every minute.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we have an overview of how I feel about the plot, let's move on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nWell, the art is well-done. It's a bit unique in its own way, but is bright and eye-pleasing. However, the backgrounds are pretty good at setting moods. It'll be dark when it needs to, giving an air of sadness or mystery. Then, other times, it will be bright and joyous. The characters themselves are rather interestingly-drawn, and it did take a while for me to get used to Chihiro's cat-ear-like hair.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the art is quite good-- happy and shiny when it needs to be, darker when the show calls for it. It doesn't seem jumpy or poorly drawn to me, but there is fanservice here and there. It isn't super ecchi quite yet, but it does have jiggling boobs and the occasional glance up some girl's legs. I hate fanservice, personally, but I can deal with this because it's occasional and isn't used when it isn't needed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nEh... they're ok. They're different in their own way, but I wish they'd develop a bit more. Perhaps they will, so I'm waiting to see. Chihiro seems to be the somewhat-sterotypical anime guy, except that he has an insane zombie obsession. Just this alone drew me into his character, wanting to know more. He's a decent guy, and seems sweet and helpful sometimes, but he's not overly considerate of those around him when he's watching a zombie show or reading about them. He's got his interesting quirks, but I'm hoping they'll develop him enough to peel away just a few of his cliches here and there. Maybe he needs them, I dunno.\\n\\n\r\nRea is interesting enough. She's your average naive, sweet girl type, who doesn't seem to know much. I would have been irritated and given this show up if it weren't for the reasons behind that. Of course, she's sheltered... overly much, and her father is a maniac who takes nude pictures of her. She used to think it was normal, but as she matured, she realized it wasn't. She struggles, and hides it behind a facade for the most part-- but she is truly a little naive, and sweet to those she cares about, I'd say. She isn't too bad of a character at all.\\n\\n\r\nRanko is Chihiro's cousin, and she likes him. As in like like. Yeeeah. She seems to be your utterly stereotypical teasing-strong-girl type, with a soft side she doesn't want to show (but she does anyway, whether she likes it or not). And she has big boobs, which is a large cause of fanservice in this show. I'm hoping they'll flesh her out a little and make her different, but so far she's just the same as all the other \"part of a love triangle, has unrequited love\" girls I see so often in anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack~\\n\r\nWell, I heard it in there somewhere. Every time I start a new series, I bug myself about remembering to listen to the soundtrack so I can write a review on it. And yet I always forget to. I do know that the music matches the mood pretty well, and brings out the actual happenings on-screen more. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are rather... average, but they do fit their roles. They don't do a terrible job at voicing their character, which is good-- but Rea's voice seemed way too high for me in the beginning of the show. Either that has changed through the course of the series or I just got used to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song seems pretty average, nothing special, but the animation that goes along with it is just... odd. It reminds me of some stupid dream I had when I was seven about a magical world with fluffy, sharp-toothed bunnies. Not that there are any fluffy, sharp-toothed bunnies in this (I think) but the setting of the theme song just reminds me of it. It's weird, and that's all I can say. And I haven't listened to the ending song yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is very entertaining and intriguing, though it has its cliches. It is fun to watch, and will pass the time very nicely. I'm excited to see the next episodes. It's good overall, but if you're not a romance fan, I don't know what to tell you. It's not amazing enough to recommend, but I will tell you to at least try it and see how you feel. It's the type of show romance-lovers might find very interesting, but not the type I'd go around telling everyone I know to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's worth a shot, and my time was not wasted on this show.",

            "content": "Sankarea is weird, very weird indeed. For a sense of its weirdness, this show includes zombie fetishism. Hold on. Before you click the back button, let me preface that this fetishism is reigned in, for not even the great Studio DEEN would be able to get away with planting the idea of having coitus with rotten shambling remains without backlash from the audience. Instead, the writers of Sankarea toyed with the technical definition of the zombie, an undead character, but kept the outward appearance of said zombie in traditional anime character style, with some gore thrown in, making the idea of zombie romance less appalling.What results, is an eccentric take on the term 'undying love', one that I cannot seem to get off my mind. \\n\\n\r\nChihiro Furuya is our ordinary male protagonist who, as it is very happens in these stories, comes to befriend this mysterious, sheltered girl, Sanka Rea. Things happen, and without too many spoilers, we find ourselves in a Romeo and Juliet love story with a George Romero inspired twist to it. I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence.\\n\\n\r\nHaving introduced our two main leads, Chihiro and Rea, I must applaud Studio DEEN for fleshing them out early on in the show, for they exhibit strong, distinguishing personalities that put a unique twist on the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the Shakespearean play. Each character starts off with emotional baggage, a hole in their hearts and lives, which some of us can relate to. Chihiro is a horror fan, one that takes this love too far, I feel, while Rea is a Yamato Nadeshiko (Google It), a girl who projects a facade of perfection, with not-so-pretty secrets behind her prestigious upper class upbringing. These two clearly set the show up well for further exploration into their personalities and further misgivings. Their feelings also subsequently mature to help each other seal these holes in their lives, giving the show strong romantic progression, a selling point of Sankarea. Sadly, side characters fall into the usual tropes: helpful, obedient sister Mero, lacking-screen-time plot device parental figure Doon, childhood friend who gets jealous Ranko etc. A slightly disappointing display, but expected at this point. The mediocre side cast aside,our leads more than make up for this shortcoming, since we watch Romeo and Juliet for Romeo and Juliet, not their extended families, so character-wise, Sankarea does alright.\\n\\n\r\nAs per Romeo and Juliet, the idea of forbidden love works on many levels in this narrative, one being that of parental disapproval and the other being necrophilia. But necrophilia jokes aside, Sankarea is a Romeo and Juliet love story in anime, and in that regard, I feel DEEN has succeeded, where the growing love, the maturing affection between the mains is seen when our main characters become better people as their romance progresses, following my point that the two helps to fill holes in each others\u2019 lives. Chihiro helps to fulfil the wishes of sheltered Rea, and he himself grows to be a more caring, less passive and unmotivated individual. Rea becoming less sheltered, feels less repressed, more free and happy when with Chihiro. Having their love bring out the better in them gives the romantic plot sufficient impact and weight, which is good writing on DEEN\u2019s part, and puts Sankarea a cut above your standard anime fare. I also liked the impact in the show. Situations have been given significant gravitas, such as essential zombie maintenance and the inevitable decay of dead flesh, and they help keep the audiences on the edge of their seats. Tension occurs even on rewatching Sankarea, and this tension is also released quite adequately despite awkward pacing, even during rewatches, meaning tension still holds up well. As mentioned, pacing is a weak point in the show\u2019s narrative, where there are slow and fast moments, inexpertly pieced together throughout twelve episodes, demonstrating inconsistency in writing. Pace should be consistent, not uniform, not varied, deviating from an established speed by some degree to emphasize important moments on occasion. However, twelve episodes also means such errors should not be too hard on the viewer on the first watch through, still, it was worth pointing out. The story has flaws, but offers significant merits, such as novelty in its zombie love premise, enjoyable, substantial romance and good, old-fashioned fun that helps it stick out of the crowd a bit more. A harsher critic may pan the problems highlighted to a greater degree, but reviews are opinion and I like to give leeway to novel ideas, especially this one which has stuck with me for too long a time to dismiss casually, so the story is good in my books.\\n\\n\r\nI was about to criticise the visual design of the show, being not as good in my recollection, but upon blu-ray release, everything looks crisp and excellent. Animation is great, colour composition has been balanced out very well, to mix a tone of horror and love. Everything looks nice enough to give first time viewers a treat. The character designs simply look good. Chihiro has tufts of hair on his head, making him look like a dog, with no offense being implied here as there is significance in this observation since it ties in with some Asian cultural beliefs that dogs are able to see the supernatural and share affiliation with these phenomena. This all fits the theme of supernatural horror Sankarea quite nicely. Rea is the main love interest, so obviously, she will look good, with large bright eyes, fair, almost pale skin and physically desirable characteristics in a female, at least in the eyes of this reviewer, full discretion. The leads are easily recognisable, so DEEN has done a good job here. Though the side characters are essentially tropes, they still look presentable and original, and do their job. Special mention to Gramps, he looks shrunken and deformed, making him stand out along with his more bizarre and original personality among the side characters. He eats poisonous leaves for fun. Have I mentioned how this show was weird? Collectively, I have no gripes with the character designs at all, and wish they were give more character definition to complement their unique looks, and DEEN has done well on the blu-ray release.\\n\\n\r\nSound design is average. Again, I would use the word serviceable to describe it. Not bad, not memorable, where comedic scenes, romantic scenes, action scenes all have tracks played systematically to add slight immersion, but I would not recommend it for another\u2019s consumption.  The ending is alright, I did not pay it much heed, but it gave me a feel of melancholy, which does reflect how I felt when I could not watch more Sankarea, so that exists. I would instead like to point your attention to the opening song of Sankarea along with its accompanying visuals. The title of this song is \u201cEsoragoto\u201d or \u201cPipe Dream\u201d in English. I like it. J-Pop by nano.Ripe. The title of the song, visuals in the opening all tie in back with the entire premise of the show, where giant flying cats, M.C. Escher\u2019s \u201cEndless Stairs\u201d are depicted, all help to demonstrate surrealism at the start of the episode. And this theme of surrealism applies to Sankarea very nicely, by tying back to the context within the show, that of \u201cZombie Love\u201d, which comes off as far from reality as one can get, to show love toward a being that has risen from the grave, a sort of pipe dream, as the title of the opening song suggests. Also, at the end of the opening, Chihiro and Rea both entering a marked grave symbolises how everything that transpires in the narrative starts with death, as one enters a grave upon death. To analyse more would be to spoil the plot, so I will hold off on that for now, but it comes to stand that the opening of Sankarea shows unexpected depth and I am impressed with DEEN\u2019s detail in the opening design. Nicely done.  Both dub and sub are good.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, Sankarea is a series with an eccentric charm to it with competent execution in some aspects of its narrative. It also looks clean and gory in its visuals, which zombie fans may come to appreciate as well. A tale of Romeo and Juliet, layered with palpable zombie love that can melt the coldest of undead hearts. While there are flaws in Sankarea, one could definitely do worse when looking for something to watch, and for what it is worth, it drew me in enough to keep me watching. A recommendation for someone who wants to try something new, and is not afraid to dig through dismembered guts to find it. Wherever I may be, I feel Sankarea will stay in my unconscious forevermore, until someone asks me for something very weird to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: I don\u2019t give scores/ 10",

            "content": "I enjoyed Sankarea till the very end because the plot was interesting - and despite being labeled as ecchi - its not as dirty - so I was relieved :P. When I watched it, (if I had not read the episode summery before) I would have definately (sorry about spelling errors) been totally curious from episode 1 - but I had the general idea. The plot was unique because it was one of the first anime I watched in which the plot revolved around the \"non - living\" and living - and wanted to know how the show would flow - but I ended upenjoying almost every bit of the anime. The plot followed well and I loved the art work. The music also flowed and (kind of a spoiler alert so I'll just leave it in parenthesis - I was surprised by the perverted nature of the Sankarea's father - it gave me the creeps, but I also kept watching this show because in my head I would hope that somehow she gets aways from her father). I saw there was a manga that goes farther into this plot so im gonna have to just wait till hopefully second season because I'm to lazy to start reading - but I really loved the unique twist to this anime. One thing that did annoy me though was how clique the main characters (including and especially Ranko) were - but I love Furuya's grandpa's personality and how the show is all because the death of Babu. Hopefully the person reading this review enjoys the anime as much as I did :).",

            "content": "As you might recall i first wrote a review on this anime when the first 6 episodes were the only ones available and in that time the entire show changed from what i thought would be a contender for top 8 anime of the year to the endless abiss of \"meh\" where all anime have a component that makes it stand out yet cant break apart from its cliche enough to be deemed \"unique\". So i will start this review the same intro as the review when there was only 6 episodes and all parts that is in CAPS are the edited parts after finishingthe anime to give contrast on how stagnant this anime becomes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou must die to live. \\n\r\n Words that have been used time and time again in many plays originating in Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet and Much ado about nothing. Sankarea takes that simple quote to a whole new level. Sankarea is the story of Furuya who loves zombies, wait right there before you  think this is just another high school of the dead otaku filled anime cuz if you think so then your very wrong. \\n\\n\r\n Sanka is a girl that lives a luxorious lifestyle and is an idol in and out of the classroom but she keeps a secret with her. During her birthday each year she takes a picture fully nude which is done in secret by her father originally she felt contempt and happy with this as a young girl but into her adolescent year she started to think it was rather strange. Her father also is seen as over protective in which everyone she had a relationship with would either be fired or for mysterious reasons have to quit there job. Sanka realized that her father was manipulating other people in order to keep his baby girl all to hisself. Eventually Sanka started to sneak from home to an abandon building where she meets Zombie lover Furuya. Furuya is there trying to revive a cat that recently died and sanka asks if he succeeds would he take resurrect her if she died and would take \"responsibility\" for her. (>.>) Furuya says yes. \\n\\n\\n\r\n Story (10): studio deen has a good record of anime with good story lines that has good comedy such as Higurashi, Ruroni Kenshin, Detective loki, and Vampire Knight but the thing that all these anime have in common is that the ending is the absolute weakest part of these anime and unfortunately it looks like Sankarea is going down that path as well since 5 episodes in it haven't developed any form of purpose yet. So yes so far i give story a 10 but don't expect that to stay the same till the end.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY(8 AFTER FINISHING):THE STORY OF A GIRL WANTING TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE STARTED TO FADE AS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SHOW CAME INTO PLACE AND IN MOST CASES THOSE INDIVIDUAL PARTS SUCH AS GIVING ENTIRE EPISODES TO A SIDE CHARACTERS WAS POINTLESS AND TOOK UP SPACE SINCE SANKAREA ONLY HAD 12 EPISODES TO WORK WITH. ALSO IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE SHOW THE GIRL WHO WANTS TO DO NORMAL THINGS ONLY DOES SOMETHING NORMAL ONCE... SHOPPING AT A MALL BEFORE CRAZINESS AGAIN HAPPENS.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Art (10): When i first watched this anime i instantly thought SHAFT because the art resembled Bakemonogatari so much so that i started to get a nose bleed at the simple sight of the scenery. When i realised that it was Studio Deen work i was bamboozled as i never seen such high quality work done for any anime that ever came out of studio deen before and thats saying something.\\n\\n\r\nART (STILL A 10): STUDIO DEEN TRULY OUTDID THEMSELVES WITH THIS ANIME TAKING SOME THINGS THAT MAKE SHAFT AND GAINAX SO POPULAR AND MAKING IT THEIR OWN IS SOMETHING THAT ALOT OF COMPANIES WOULDN'T WANT TO RISK ON SUCH A WELL BUDGETED SHOW LIKE THIS. REALLY ITS LIKE WATCHING SEITOKAI ICHIZON THEN HIGURASHI THEN SANKAREA AND SEEING HOW BEAUTIFUL SANKAREA IS COMPARED TO TWO ANIMES THAT WERE CONSIDERED DECENT ANIMATION AT ITS TIME\\n\\n\\n\r\n Sound (8): good music but easy to forget not much moving music except for some zomb music here and there\\n\\n\r\nSOUND(8 STILL BUT NO THING TO ADD)\\n\r\n Characters (7 ): Dont let this seven fool you the characters for this show is great but the only reason i gave the characters a seven is because they're sterotypical (i word to overly used in anime) but thats okay in some cases. These characters are never going to change or grow or expand their gonna be as naive as they were from the beginning of the series but thats what this anime needs it to be. If Sanka never changed then she would've by now taken action against her father along time ago. Sanka's father would've changed to and would learn why her daughter doesn't understand his love for her. These characters are supposed to be so rigid in which their beliefs are already set and can't be modified so in this a 7 is neccessary.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6 AFTER REALIZING HOW STUPID MY ABOVE COMMENT WAS OF CHARACTERS I HAD TO DEDUCT THE SCORE A BIT CUZ THE CHARACTERS BEING UNIQUE DOES MATTER AND AFTER 12 EPISODES OF STAGNANT CHARACTERS MAKE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF \\n\\n\r\n enjoyment (9): Its not often that i write reviews most of my reviews are youtube video reviews and are scripted edited and then recorded so i have alot of time to watch it and revise it so the mere fact of me taking my time and writing an essay trying to get people to watch this anime is prove enough that this show is awesome. Give the first two episodes a try if you like shaft youll like this anime if you like romance youll like this anime if you like bakemonogatari youll like this anime if you like a show with a driving plot yet good unconventional humor youll like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (7 ITS SO HARD TO SAY THIS BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT COULD'VE GONE RIGHT ON THIS ANIME. AND WORST OF ALL THE ENDINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG WHY ITS LIKE THE SHOW ENDED WITH OUT GIVING WARNING ITS ABOUT TO EN...\\n\\n\r\nSOME THING LIKE THAT YEAH EXCEPT YOU GO ON MYANIMELIST.NET AND REALIZE THAT PROBABLY IS THE REASON WHY THE RATING FOR SANKAREA WENT FROM BEING #443 TO THE HIGH #800\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SANKAREA MADE THE RIGHT MOVES AT FIRST THEN JUST TOTALLY BUSTED AND EXPLODED WHEN CRUNCH TIME CAME ROLLING ABOUT. A PROBLEM TO OFTEN SEEN IN ANIME THE END RESULT WAS TO ANTI-CLIMATIC AND JUST LEAD TO A \"MEH\" TYPE FEELING AT THE END. SANKAREA IS A START THOUGH A NEW WAY STUDIO DEEN CAN POSSIBLY TRY TO PRODUCE ANIME SINCE THE CONCEPT WASN'T TO BAD AND I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING MORE ANIME LIKE SANKAREA THIS ANIME RIGHT NOW IS NOTHING MORE THAN A BUST AND WASTE OF INVESTMENT ON FUNIMATION POINT OF VIEW (WHICH JUST LICENCED SANKAREA AS AN ANIME THEY ARE PLANNING TO DUB IN THE FUTURE)\\n\r\n :D have a nice day",

            "content": "Somehow after watching this anime, I had to rewatch it after the OVAs came out to remember what had happened in the anime series. The whole faint zombie feel is nice. Not too heavy and not too light, just the right touch.\r\n(May have some spoilers, maybe)\r\nStory: This anime ends up being a cliche where the heroine is saved by the main protagonist, but the story develops in a way where it is unique though, given the genres. Certain information is relayed later as the anime goes on and in a seemingly fitting way. I am not sure what they intended the viewer to feel whenthey found out about the heroine's situation before meeting the main protagonist. I just got a sense of helplessness from her. Not a strong character and therefore the main protagonist had a role to fill. Although the overall feel of this anime feels typical and satisfies the supernatural vibe, it does leave a good aftertaste. I just wish that there was more romantic gestures in this anime. A lot of anime tend to leave it as light as possible and as a viewer I just don't understand. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is nice since it is relatively new. Anything after 2010 with anything below mediocre art is hard to watch so this passes on my standards and is watchable. Not much else to say...colorful and a lot of white texture? \\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing to say, really. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character designs on the main protagonist is unique but I do not understand why the main protagonist's sister have different hair color from her family. The MP feels super average and childish at the core. Even when he seems reliable, it's only on a topic or situation that is very niche. The characters do build an aura about themselves that presents them as a part of the story well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It does have a fair amount of comedy that gives a little here and there. The whole ordeal with the father of the heroine is creepy though, disturbing doesn't begin to describe the aura of the episodes with him in it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Certainly an anime I would recommend to a friend. The reason why I can't rate this any higher is because it never gave me one of those \"Bam!\" moments, whether plot-twisting or heart-wrenching feels. It did not leave any bad tastes so I wouldn't rate it lower so 8 is where it stands for me. Well, check this anime out if you're into a small amount of romance and a little bit of chill.",

            "content": "Plot: 7/10\r\nSankarea carries with it a rather unique plot, tackling the classic zombie genre and turning into a charming yet dramatic romance story. The story does a lot of things right, moving the plot along at an even speed while maintaining tension common for a horror story with various plot developments. The plot deals with very real conflicts, preserving Rea\u2019s body and dealing with her father\u2019s obsession, and do not feel forced at any point.  However, the story does take a lot of time to provide backstory for many of the characters, and while this is good for character development, it does steal alot of momentum from the story that is taking place in the present. By spacing out the story via backstories, some of the tension from scenes is lost. The other biggest flaw is the cliffhanger ending, which is only further exasperated by the introduction of another conflict/unexplained phenomena very last minute in the final scenes, leaving the viewer unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for Sankarea are well developed, maybe overdeveloped in some cases (not in a bad way), and have well defined personalities. The main protagonists, Rea and Furuya, are both strong leads with clearly developed personalities. However, some characters feel a bit unoriginal save for a few characteristics. For example, Wanko is the stereotypical childhood, being both a rival and foil for Rea. She is highly aggressive, which helps offset the stereotypical feel she carries. The challenges of the characters, while the details are unique, the general gist of the problem is not surprising. Nonetheless, the character make a strong presence in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show has pretty good animation style, that is pretty clean and easy to follow. I find the depictions of the hydrangeas quite beautiful. It offers a lot of surprising visuals that help portray the mood and tension in the series, too.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not overly impressive, though the closing is among my favorites across all anime. A fair chunk of the soundtrack is acoustic, which is pretty cool. I find the opening kind of annoying, but it is enjoyable to some people.\\n\\n\r\nThemes: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series is loaded with themes, both directly addressed and present in symbolic ways. The most prominent symbol is found in the hydrangea, specifically the species Hydrangea macrophylla. This species is native to Japan and is toxic due to a chemical compound in them known as a cyanogenic glycosides. In the language of flowers, this species of flower carries two meanings typically: gratitude and boastfulness. The gratitude relates directly to Rea, who is quick to thank people throughout the series, especially Furuya. The boastfulness relates to Rea\u2019s father, the main antagonist. He is boastful of his daughter and how in the right he is. This boastfulness carries over to another theme: obsession. Both the Furuya and Rea\u2019s father have an obsession that inhibits their character, though to vastly different degrees. Themes relating to life are also present, unsurprisingly, within the series. Sankarea also effectively combines several genres, including romance, horror, and drama to create a unique experience for the viewer. However, saying this genre combination is completely successful would be too far. The anime is plenty appealing on its own, but the inclusion of ecchi elements frequently enough detract from the mood of many scenes, as they feel rather out of place with the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 44/50\\n\\n\r\nhttps://rishraffreviews.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Story: 7/10\r\nThe premise presented is really and eyecatcher for me. It was something that nearly met my current expectations. The first few episodes of the show really caught my attention, but as I watched more and more episodes I started to get really worried with the pace the show was going at near the end. Keep in mind that there is a possibility that to you the series may have an incomplete feeling to it. Even so, the later episodes did have great moments that got me excited or surprised when I was watching. Basically the story had a good start, but a questionable end.\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nThe art style for most of the supporting characters was generic and did not stand out too much to me. But the two main characters, Chihiro Furuya and Rea Sanka really stood out. I liked how Furuya's hair looked like he had cat ears, and there was an odd feeling I had when I saw the ultra pale skin and the red and black eyes on Rea. I would also like to mention Mero Furuya and Danichiro Sanka. Mero's silver-blue hair and her almost emotionless reactions were super adorable. Danichiro's character design was plain mesmerizing to me because of those 3 dots going down the middle of his forehead.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10 \\n\r\nI have only seen the dub of this show, but in my opinion the dub was decently casted. I quickly got used to all of the voices, except Ranko, which I thought was ok at times, great other times. Also Mero's VA fit perfectly 99% of the time, only one moment was awkward hearing. The other VAs were good but were not stand outs in my opinion. Also there was not any OSTs that really stood out, but it is good enough to set the tone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nNot going to spend too much on this part. A good number of characters followed a certain type of archetype is some way. What is good is that there is development for our main cast throughout the show and if there was a little more development I would definitely push this rating up to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI usually try not to expect to much out of a show unless I'm hyped about it. With that in mind, the show was entertaining and even brought up small little bits of information a few episodes back and put them in the light near the end of the show. Those little events that foreshadowed was one of the reasons that kept me watching the show. Although there was small bits of comedy thrown in by our comedic relief character, it kinda broke the immersion sometimes when he was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nLiked the show but it is not really something I'd recommend to someone newer to anime. I would recommend this show if you just want to kill time. Also, would like this show to have more episodes if it ever does.",

There are so much interesting and refreshing things in the storyline. The scary, comedy, drama, and romance parts are all well-balance.\r\nIf the story is unique, wait until you see the very unusual characters. There\u2019s a father who loves his daughter so much that it\u2019s becoming incestuous. There\u2019s the very weird and unusual boy who loves zombies and dreams of having a romantic zombie encounter. And not only his personality is strange; his appearance is also very weird. Well, it\u2019s notevery day you see a protagonist with hair that looks like cat ears. And that\u2019s even more with a love story. He\u2019s definitely not the typical cool male lead in a love story. Finally, there\u2019s the zombie female protagonist who dreams of a normal girl\u2019s life and that includes experiencing a normal romantic life which is extremely weird considering she\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d in the first place. It\u2019s weird that she has to be physically abnormal just to have a normal life. And this is the first time I see a very \u201ckawaii\u201d zombie.

I also love zombie action stories but this is definitely the first time I encounter a \u201czombie love story\u201d. That kind of originality is absolutely interesting and refreshing not only from the everyday anime but also with the everyday love story. If you are fed up with traditional animes or love stories that look like made by the same person then this series is like a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s not particularly exciting as there are not really explosive plot like some mainstay shounen animes of today but it is still very much interesting.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 4 (Decent)\r\nAssuming you've read the synopsis, you have a general picture of how this starts out. Girl becomes zombie and is the love interest for the guy with the creepy zombie fetish. After that there isn't much of a plot. She has an abusive father who she managed to get away from when she got \"zombified\" and the father tries to get her back, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda, etc. Aside from this, the plot is basically our main character trying to find away to preserve his zombie crush - who will eventually decay like any other corpse. So he's basically observing her,yandere father, trouble ensues, yadda yadda yadda. As you can tell, I am not extremely enthusiastic about the plot.\\n\r\nThere are also some really unnecessary filler episodes. Well, not completely unnecessary, but only have about a minute or so of actual plot, while the rest seems to be just for lols. Speaking of which: this is a comedy. Nnnnnnnnot that funny. I slightly chuckled. Twice. As for horror, I never get scared with the horror genre. At the most I'll just get really on edge, but I didn't really have any moments like that with this anime.\\n\r\nReally important part here: if you don't like inconclusive endings, you won't like this anime. It ends and leaves you like \"WTF that's it?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nNot quite what I'm used to, but good. Some of the backgrounds tend to be kind of bland, though, while others really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nOP and ending theme are catchy, though not enough for me to not skip over them. Voices are good and reflect the characters nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4 (Decent)\\n\r\nWe've got a loooooot of stereotypical characters here. A 12 year-old girl who seems like she's completely emotionless, a junior high kid who's the main character's friend and also happens to be a complete pervert, a senile old man who sometimes has \"sane moments\", a tomboy, an adorable airhead, the girl next door who has always been in love with the main character, and a girl with incestuous daddy-issues.\\n\r\nThe most original character is the main character, and that's only because of his weird zombie fetish.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nDespite the \"eh\"-ness and being not quite impressed, I DID find the anime enjoyable to watch. It took me until episode six to get really interested, though. If it was really long I might not have bothered finishing it, but I was able to handle only twelve episodes of mediocre plot. Overall I found it fairly enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nIf you're interested in ecchi anime, however, have a seat and watch the show. We've got partial nudity, bouncy boobs, panty shots (not even because the character was seated in a certain way; they LITERALLY just cut to under someone's skirt for no particular reason whatsoever), a girl licking another girl's boobs and all that classy stuff.\\n\r\nI, however, watched this anime because I read the synopsis, thought it was one of the stupidest things I'd ever read and thought it would make for some laughs, though they ended up giving the story a more serious tone than I had anticipated. However, if you've read the synopsis and genuinely think the plot sounds interesting, then go for it.",

It is a very light story without any heavy, mind-blowing or amazing plot. Maybe the director could've make it a little bit faster? Some episodes just seemed like sllice of life-type of episodes. It worried me, because this was a 12 episode anime and the director made the pace as if it were a 24 episodes anime, which usually has a slowerplot. The thing is that the climax in the last episodes did not give much of an impact and the romance is still kinda underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI liked the art. I liked how the characters were made and some scenes. However, I do not think there was much variety or scenes that made a big impact. Of course, I know that this anime doesn't have the same budget as Fate/Stay and other big budget-animes. So, for the art, I guess it's good.\u00e7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nWe do not see them struggle that much. Rea has some problems with her father, but they did not go too deep. They could've made it so much better.\\n\r\nFuruya doesn't develop much. Rest of the characters are pretty 2-D/dull. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nIt was good. The sounds were okay for the setting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI liked it and enjoyed it. I reccommend you to watch if you have the time.

            "content": "Sankarea is an interesting take on the genre of ecchi romance.  It dares to do something different by adding the main character, Chihiro's, zombie fetish, which may be strange but is original.  The show is a little better than your average ecchi romance and I would put its importance on your \"Plan to Watch\" section a little above those that you want to watch because you are bored but no above those that you definitely should watch.\r\nStory:  The story of Sankarea revolves around Chihiro, a high schooler that has a strange infatuation with zombies.  As I said before, pretty original.The show brought up what it needed to and I don't think that there was more that needed to be added.  At times it seemed a little slow, and at first I thought that they were avoiding the goals that they set forth but eventually Sankarea got around to them.  It finishes strong and was pretty enjoyable, but since some episodes included a little filler here and there I will give it an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art was very nice, nothing original but I really liked its look.  It was consistent and had no problems.  However, I have seen better.  The character design was very nice as well.  Since it doesn't go above and beyond though, I will give it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Nothing noticeably good in this section, the intro and outro were good but nothing too special.  As far as the background music, nothing that I can quite remember.  I'm gonna stick this section with a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Although parts of my review might seem like I thought of this series as an average anime, that is not how I feel.  I enjoyed the anime at all times even when some episodes were slow, I kept moving forward without break out of enjoyment and wondering what would happen next.  Although I cannot ignore that some of the aspects of the show were not to my liking.  I'm going to put this at an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  The anime was well done, could have been better but still well done.  By how it ended I would expect to see a season two if the show does well enough.  It was a good addition to the list of 2012 anime and the show has made me interested enough to look into the manga.  As I said earlier, put this show above shows that you just want to watch in your free time.  This show is not a waste of time like some other shows end up being but it is not going to make it into one of the anime that I look back on and say that I really enjoyed a ton despite not being a favorite unless they improve with the second season, which is definitely a possibility.  For this section I will give the first season a solid 8/10",

            "content": "You know that feeling that when you finally gotten what you got, you lose that sense of satisfaction and want, such is the want of freedom...\r\nSankarea was LA's Halloween Special for 2018 and well, this wasn't quite the \"horror\" anime LA picked out to be but nonetheless for what Sankarea had of one of the weirdest \"meet cute\" scenarios well Sankarea succeed in it's own fronts...with some slight weaknesses to go with it.\r\nSpoilers Ahead!\r\nSankarea is essentially a meet cute scenario of a zombie by the name of Sanka Rea voiced by Maaya Uchida and the zombie fanatic Chihiro Furuya voiced by Ryohei Kimura, add adash of love triangle romance and deep character development of most of the core cast and we have Sankarea.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea is by this front a more character focused plot than a narratively focused anime but the development of the core cast is what LA call one of the best strength of Sankarea, tie that in to it's thematic core of freedom and the \"different kinds\" and the plot as somewhat laxxed as it is, packs ALOT of it in. \\n\\n\r\nFor characters, let's start with Rea, she's the typical ojou rich girl however is completely restricted and obeys every word her father tells her, but she longs to be \"normal\" and would kill herself in order to do so, once she becomes a zombie, she by all reasoning is \"reborn\" and wants to experience being a normal girl but her father obviously bars that mainly through Chihiro, you really do feel for Rea and she is something of subversion of the ojou archetype in a ways of wanting to be normal. Chihiro is a zombie fanatic, thinking nothing but zombies and wouldn't mind having a zombie girlfriend, he gets his wish but at the cost of Rea well being in the process. As much as LA thinks he gets the least change of the cast, his development in moving away from zombies into caring for someone, something he's never done is development to say the least and how his \"wish\" though granted is something is slowly finds ironic. Ranko Saouji voiced by Sayuri Yahagi is Chihiro's cousin and our third wheel to our love triangle, YUP we have kissing cousins trope with Ranko and the thing is, LA actually finds Ranko also a good character even with this trope in place, sure she's the childhood friend to Rea's maniac pixie girl but childhood friend trope has their backstory that Chihiro and Ranko has together and by all reasoning as much as LA doesn't like the kissing cousins trope with her, LA was rooting for her yeah...dumbfounded LA. Next we have what LA deems the most irredeemable character in the series, Rea's father, Danichirou voiced by Unshou Ishizuka, why?, well him being the strict father is nothing, for what's it worth, he made everyone around him suffer for his own delusional grandeur to the point of wanting to preserve Rea and by extension his wife's memory and purity by taking naked pictures of Rea every year like what the fuck, add to that his control over Rea and his utter dismissal of Aria that once Aria got her backstory about how she met Danichirou and the backstory tried to sympathize with Danichirou, LA felt more sorry about ARIA than Danichirou and Aria plays off the \"wicked stepmother\" trope!. As much as the finale loosened Danichrou up, LA just can't ignore Danchirou's delusional sense of freedom and grandeur over his own daughter...just...creepy as hell. With that who was LA's favourite character?...Mero voiced by Yuka Iguchi, yup Chihiro's little sister and no LA isn't a siscon with this pick, as both Rea and Ranko were pretty even with their love triangle thus couldn't pick either, LA went with the most chill character of the cast thus leading LA to Mero and she's something of deadpan comedic relief and that was enough for LA!\\n\\n\r\nSankarea does take the zombie thing in a playful but realistic in a sense of what happened if you have a zombie girlfriend, everything from Rea getting rigor mortis to some of the lore as to how Rea became a zombie and using that to help Rea normalize herself in being a zombie and of course comes her notion of eating and the such, but Sankarea's depth of world building of zombies doesn't dive too deep and focuses more on it's characters more. \\n\\n\r\nFreedom itself is a fickle thing, it's something you want but what happens once you do?, be happy to do what you want at some point you will either restrict others with your newfound freedom like Danichirou or let things run it's course like Chihiro, if anything Rea is a manifestation and symbolism of freedom and funny how \"death\" is her way into freedom, huh the \"only things that are certain are death and taxes\" right?. Chihiro does touch on the subject of freedom but the thematic weight goes more to Rea, Chihiro more or less goes into what happens if your wish was granted and it both changes you as a person but that you lose that want once you obtained it. Sankarea may be a love triangle romantic comedy with zombies in it, but Sankarea's thematic significance is solid and explores it in earnest.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Studio DEEN, well from the character designs and backgrounding is decent enough from Studio DEEN, especially with the colorful palette of the characters, but something LA noticed is of the transitioning of the anime and the odd quirks it has at times, i wasn't until LA looked the director, Shinichi Omata that it clicked, as Shinichi was Episode and Storyboard Directors for Arakawa Under the Bridge, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko and Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica that it was clear that Sankarea's direction has SHAFT influence towards it and all the more for it for the animation to moderately have that flair that SHAFT is well known for, really Shinichi's SHAFT touch was actually used well is what LA is getting at.\\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, LA was pleased with many of the voice cast from Maaya Uchida, Sayuri Yahagi, Yuka Iguchi, Ryohei Kimura and as much as LA hated the character, Unshou Ishizuka as Danichirou. Mayumi Asano as Aria though she was the drunk abrasive character, she did well as Rea's stepmother and portrayed her well with all regards, LA says this as LA sympathized with Aria through Mayumi's abrasive acting. But LA's MVP would go to....Sayuri Yahagi and Maaya Uchida...of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe only faults to Sankarea LA would say is the more obvious finale to how leaves things open ended, it's a manga adaptation things like this happened ALL the time for people to read the manga, that and during the build up it takes a detour with it's core cast from an Mero and her friends antics to how Ranko and Chihiro meet and the aforementioned Aria backstory but to this one's defense, it builds and develops the characters even further and for a character-focused narrative only strengthened it's plot as well as subtlety answering some loose small questions that was in the air and executed extremely well with the adage of \"show don't tell\" in the form of backstories no less! LA's final fault is that Sankarea has some fanservicey moments sprinkled throughout the anime and in the more serious moments kinda ruins it at times though it seems Sankarea is self aware at times with Mero but the fanservice is blatantly apparent is with Ranko and her jiggle physics and Rea with her fanservicey costumes, but nonetheless a \"sprinkle\" of fanservice didn't hurt anyone so this flaw is more subjective to say the least but wanted to bring up nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSankarea wasn't the zombiefest LA was expecting instead getting a meet cute anime with zombies and the moral quandaries of freedom, unexpected but executed well. Sankarea's finale may have left things open ended with Rea's condition and the love triangle still going but for what it's worth, Sankarea was a pleasantly interesting experience with zombies, having great thematic ties to it's characters and an overall decent production value coming from Studio DEEN. \\n\\n\r\nThe only things that are certain are death and taxes...huh. Sanka Rea begs to differ...",

This one's a bit more twisted and maybe a little psychological. \r\nStory: I loved the story. Romance with a zombie sounds kind of silly but the way the story was told was quite interesting. With just one season (14 episodes in total if you watch the Special and OVA), the characters all get a lot of development.\r\nArt: The art is pretty nice for this series, especially the way Rea is drawn. She just looks so beautiful!\r\nSound: There's nothing outstanding about the sound. Nothingbad either, so that's good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Like I said before, the characters are all pretty interesting. I found myself hating one in particular for likely the same reasons you will... But really, each character the story focuses on are given a good bit of plot and development.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it! It's different from your typical romance or comedy anime.

            "content": "Overall Rating: 6.6\r\nThis wasn't a spectacular show or anything, but it was a casual story that was fairly enjoyable. There were some things that were a bit questionable, but not enough that it really ruined the show for me. I would mainly recommend this show to any guy or girl interested in seeing the love story (mainly from a male perspective) of a zombie obsessed teen boy and, well, a zombie. \r\nPLOT: 6 | Fair\r\nThe plot wasn't amazing, it was fairly simple, mainly just to live out the fantasies of a teenage boy who loves zombies. For a love story, I will give it creditfor being a bit more of a unique one. If it weren't for Rea's deep back story and the character depth we get to see within her family, I don't think this show would have been that great. I think the bits of backstory for characters helped the show. Not to mention, the fan service really was thrown in there quite a bit, so if you're into that then this is for you. Personally, I found it unnecessary--especially at times when things could have been very serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nART: 7 | Good\\n\r\nThe art was cute. It was like your average modern-day anime art style. I think Chihiro's art style was a bit different from the rest, and I honestly still question why the heck he looks like a human cat? He has hair like he has cat ears and then sharp teeth like a cat..but this is never addressed. Weird, but whatever. Otherwise, I thought the art was nice. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6 | Fair\\n\r\nI gave this a 6 because the music or sounds never really caught my attention in any way or stood out to me. I can remember one little tune that played most of the time, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7 | Good\\n\r\nI think the characters all improved throughout the show and developed, which is the most important thing to me. Of course, it didn't quite happen gradually for some, but more so all of a sudden we were exposed to their whole backstory and were able to understand why they were the way they are. I appreciated this. I didn't like Ranko at first, but she grew on me somehow. I honestly felt bad for her. Rea herself I thought was a bit boring and one-dimensional, mainly supposed to play the cute innocent zombie girl. Chihiro's sister was also very one-dimensional. However, Rea's family and Ranko were enough for me to give the characters a 7.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7 | Good\\n\r\nI enjoyed it enough to watch the whole show in a few days. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't the worst either. I'd recommend this to any guy who wants a romance anime with fan service, lol. \\n\\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\\n\r\nI thought the English dub for this was amazing, though! Great voice actors for Chihiro and Ranko especially.",

            "content": "-So did you ever want to have a zombie girlfriend? If you did then you came to the right anime but let me tell you my friend this will not go the way you think it will.\r\n-I love a lot of the backgrounds and color palettes used throughout this show. The locations aren't quite as varied as I'd like but damn the nighttime scenes look pretty. the op/ed are cute tunes that are appropriate for the tone of the show but nothing special.\r\n-this is yet another anime that desperately needed a second season that never received one and most likely wont since its already been6 years since its initial release but if you aren't fully satiated by its short season there are 3 ovas that can supplement the content of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-lets get to the nitty gritty here: This show is about a kid obsessed with the undead....he wants to screw, kiss, be with an undead girl in general. It is very weird but the show makes it seem funny in a way? The main female character is being sought after by her father.....in a creepy sexual way. Plus to top it off the main characters cousin wants to be with him too. at first you think wtf Japan but ultimately these unusual elements do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the show. the cousin is easy to sympathize with and the father is easy to hate so it mostly works out. \\n\\n\r\n-there is a small amount of blood in the series (but if you are squeamish it isn't nearly as over the top as more mainstream horror titles). The characters are mostly likeable and the plot is cute plus it has zombies and cats. The typical zombie tropes do not even apply in this show since the main female character doesn't act like a zombie from a George Romero zombie movie. You could do a lot worse for a show if you are looking for something cute with a few shades of darker shows that are out there.\\n\\n\r\n-the only thing I would emphasize is that if you want a well rounded plot with a conclusion you won't find that here since most animes of this length do not feature a solid conclusion or any conclusion at all.\\n",

It has that sort of way of not letting you predict what happens next, or making you want to skip through.

            "content": "When I started Sankrea I was skeptical because I don\u2019t particularly like romances, especially high school ones. Needless to say I was impressed by this one. It proves that romances don\u2019t have to be frilly dramas. They can blend seamlessly into other genres and make a great story.\r\nThe best part of this anime is the premise. It is original, interesting and had me hooked. I especially like the blend of romance and psychological horror. It gives the show a very tense feeling that makes the romance lively. \r\nSo why doesn\u2019t it get a ten? The pacing is too slow. While the premise takes a whileto set up, the plot grinds to a halt very quickly. This pace does somewhat add to romance/horror aspects of the story by adding atmosphere, but it doesn\u2019t stop some parts from being dull. Each episode feels like one episode stretched into 2. Many of the themes and characters flaws end up getting over-repeated just to fill space. There is also some filler, which is unnecessary for a 12-episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, I enjoyed it a lot and the other aspects are good enough to make the pacing forgivable. I would recommend it. Some good advice, if you find the ending slightly unsatisfying then I highly recommend the last OVA. It gives the horror aspect a little boost and is a great setup for the second season. \\n",

However, it is still quite enjoyable withstanding the fact of being lacking of \"plot\".\r\nokay this sort of genre is actually quite new for me. It is definitely worth watching since it is not very mainstream. (but you could still relate to many characters in other anime probably because of the arts). I personally like the art.\r\nYou should definitely take this anime lightheartedly since it includes many taboos such as \"possessive\" father, romantic relationship with undead ...\\n\\n\r\nThe ED \"Above your hand\" by Annabel is simply beautiful. It does compliment the anime by being soft, dreamy and relaxing. It's just beautiful! Probably one of the reason why I didn't plan to drop the anime since it has kinda a slow build up for the first few episodes.... I never skip the ED.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is okay but kinda slow. Bear in mind, it is surprising fun and relaxing to watch although it includes horror elements. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, just try watching it till the the 5th episodes ... you might like it  or you could drop it after then. Have a go and be adventurous, my fainthearted pals!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever thought of what it would be like dying and coming back to life as a zombie?  I'm sure that Chihiro Furuya has, your typically normal high school teen who has an obsession for anything zombie related.  He also has a thing for zombie girls and has always wanted to date one.  After meeting Rea Sanko, the typical cute and popular girl at Sanka Academy, he just might get his wish after Rea dies and comes back to life as a member of the living dead.\r\nAfter watching the series I found that I was thoroughly entertained by the unique andsimple plot that anyone could follow.  Something that caught my attention were the many twist and turns through out the show.  I personally love a good suspenseful mystery, and with Chihiro doing his best to deal with the situations presented to him with what little knowledge he has about non fictional zombies, it personally kept me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nI found that the character development was pretty well written.  Chiriho is lazy, nerdy, and anti social.  But after the death of Rea he has come to realize that he has a responsibility,to do his best in taking care of this girl.  Rea, being the daughter of a rich family never had the right or privilege to do the same things that normal girls do.  After her tragic death she is given the true freedom she desires and does her best to come to terms with her feelings for Chiriho, considering she has never had a boyfriend. \\n\\n\r\nThe only draw back to this amazing anime series is that the very last episode is left on a cliff hanger.  Due to the ending, you are forced to read the manga to get the full story.  I felt like I was kind of cheap shot, having to force myself to read the manga.  Though I do admit that I binged read the entire thing in one day.  Once I reached the end of the story I was satisfied at the development of story and characters, but sense this is also a romance story, the ending wasn't really what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for a funny romantic and horrific time, than Sankarea is the anime for you.  Especially if you don't mind reading the manga to get the full details.  That being said, if your the type of person that does not approve of a happy yet sad ending than get your anger medication ready.  Overall its definitely worth a shot\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm not quiet sure how to best rate this anime.  I have seen some unique ones in the past that I could not follow the purpose for there changes in direction, and this one seems to fit into that category for me.\r\nThe premise of the story being of a boy, Chihiro, falls in love with a zombie girl who becomes that way under some very unusual circumstance I find to be very \"avaunt guard\". Chihiro, being a horror NEET as it would be, has the way freaky fetish for falling in love and having a romance with only an zombie girl.  Completely unheardof, but actually meets a sweet, naive girl; all be it tormented, that becomes a zombie which is even more unheard of. They go about the few episodes explaining how this comes about, which fit together well from it's description, that being one of a mainly supernatural/ horror genre; however after a bit, that feeling to the show, seems to fade. In it's place raises a much larger main stream romantic/comedy air about it.\\n\\n\r\nBeing devoted to the story line as much as the development of the characters I found this to be a bit distracting, and confusing. It starts out working really hard to get it's viewer's to feel the suspense and a, as best as I can put it, type of shuddering fear for a horror. Then is then soon dropped for for many more cutesy events or scenes that don't seem to fit with it's original flow. It is as if the writers are having a hard time balancing the idea's of loving romance and chilling horror. Overall with this confusion they seem to do a decent job of pulling it all together by the time they finish.\\n\\n\r\nYet again even with all is said and issues resolved, there are some hints that stay unanswered that bother me.  First you get hints that Chihiro's deceased Mother may likely have been turned into a zombie for some reason by his Grandfather. This issue seen enough to make you wonder is never really addressed. Then you get the whole complete and utter insanity of the Sanka household. Most of it seems to be done and taken care of, but Dan'ichir\u014d leave on a flight to look for a so called \"cure\", and is it just me or does the rich Sanka family seem to have trace hints of the occult to it that the rest of the society is oblivious to. Finally the most important one of all. WHAT HAPPENS TO REA?! I mean does she truly rot away in the end, does Chihiro finally figure out how to perfect the potion, does Rea stay undead forever or is some odd cure or change take place? That is all so frustrating that it is just left hanging there.",

When the character shares/resembles the same aspirations with you. I liked how the characters were introduced as to their own perspective , you gonna go on a feels trip every time. I didn't like the ending(but still I love Sankarea), because they introduced a new character while leaving an open ending.That's why you better read the manga after watching so you'll have peace of mind, lol.

At first I really enjoyed the first few episodes getting to know the characters, but it didn't go too far into the characters sadly. That leads me into what I really hated about this anime was the fact that themes from the first few episodes continued throughout the whole anime. Maybe I'm just used after x is done y can now happen, but by x I mean the objective is completed mid season and is done for the remainder. Unfortunatelythe father character maintained being a creepy dude till the last episode where I found him slightly more tolerable. Although that is the sole reason I dislike this anime, it has a good plot but not the lovey dovey shit I like so much haha.",

            "content": "Ok I can't help but feel like this is one of the more underrated anime. Although I agree that the anime lacked direction from its few 12 episodes for plot, I will give it top marks for enjoyment. I mean come on, the first 30 seconds consist of a guy in an abandoned building in the middle of the night while a high class lady is screaming \"Noooooooooo!\" into a well. Although I feel like the line that hooked me into watching more would be\r\n\"If I became a zombie, would you please take care of me?\"\r\n\"I love zombies, so I'll love you even if you'reundead.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\n(my apologies to readers, this is not actually the order that they appeared. xD the second line was actually to babu the cat, but the first is still from the girl to furuya. Just thought it would be more interesting this way.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is interesting as it takes the involvement of a zombie much more seriously and \"realistic\", if you may, than many anime. This is what gives it a feeling that wants you to watch more. Though it has these good points, it lacks plot developement. Very little happens in these 12 episodes regarding how they planned to deal with the problems of having a zombie girl. There were some episodes that didn't even have her show up. Although the darkness of the series keeps me watching it, the plot developement isn't much of a plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was....plain but beautiful. There was no amazing details, but that adds to the story since this is about two average people with the most unusual of circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are meh. Though the heroine is a but recycled, the mc furuya is somewhat more unique. He is in a family of priests with a (supposedly) crazy grandfather and a zombie fetish. The heroine comes from a rich family that wants to enjoy life and lo and behold she gets it in the most unusual way possible..by becoming a zombie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is what made it good for me. The way they presented the situation, and with fairly good music complementing it, makes the series much more enjoyable. I especially liked the ecchi horror combination between the two girls. The cousin was searching through movies and found a strand of hair in the room. Knowing this can't be her cousin, furuya, she thinks there's someone there(typical zombie scene) and *music plays* opens the closet except no one's there. phew right?...Except the camera pans behind her to show a zombie girl with a creepy face. Screams occur and when furuya rushes to the room, he finds Rea licking Wanko's boobs.......o.O....that is just one example of how it combined horror and ecchi, but I found that to be the best example.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're looking for enjoyment in an anime Sankarea should keep you interested. If not, and you're looking for deep plot with amazing art and whatnot, there are many other series out there.",

The Japanese voice actors especially Rea and Furuya capture the emotions and quirks of the characters effectively.\r\nThe sound didn't leave me too impressed but perhaps it is because I got wrapped in the story, for anyone wanting to know more of these lovely characters I suggest reading the manga, chapter 8 is were the anime started to diverge slowly from the story. Yet the 'filler' episodes were nicely done and still used conversations from the manga itselfmaking a well rounded 'what if the story had taken another direction' seeing as some characters were not introduced in the anime. Most of all I love the realistic approach to Rea's condition, she's a zombie, this is a fantasy story but she won't just survive with some random zombie magic or anything, she will rot if she doesn't take the hydrangea leaves, and it won't work forever both for her body and her mental stability as a human. Although this part of the plot is more furthur explored in the manga its still very real in the anime which makes it easy to get attached to both story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nHaving picked up the manga just before finishing these twelve episodes I'm not displeased at all and although it seemed a bit rushed in the end  I can give it a solid overall 8 seeing how the quality of the art style was kept topnotch throughout.",

In fact, I was alright with zombies. I alsolike solving mysteries. However, this anime was not as scary as it was but it was so exciting in episode 11 when Chichiro owns Danichiro on the head.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great. The opening and ending theme is ok.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Ranko who is energetic just like Yuigahama from Oregairu\\n\\n\r\nWe have Sanka Rea who is a sweet and shy girl but in the end she picks up courage and develops as a character. She has similar traits like Sayaka Maizono from Danganronpa.\\n\\n\r\nChichiro is the most likable and relatable character in this anime. He reminds me a lot like Hachiman Hikkigaya from Oregairu especially Kodaka from Haganai not to mention Hotaro from Hyouka. In fact, he really showed bravery and courage. He also know how to handle relationships. Without him, I wouldn't be enjoying this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI also like Mero and her stoic character. \\n\\n\r\nSanka Rea's parents (Danchiro & Aria) who treated Rea (their daughter) like crap. Danichiro is a despicable man who screws Rea's life and Aria is just very bossy and annoying. In fact, Aria is the headmistress of Sanka school. This is a perfect example on how power and money can really corrupt a human being. If you have a lot of power and money, you might lose sense of the world and yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Ranko & Rea really shows reasons why they loved Chichiro so much and how they admire him. Of course, to me it is not so engaing but I don't think a cousin would love each other like Ranko loving Chichiro. Incest is just wrong. Actually it is very good to have great character development so that characters can really understand one another better. I also wanted to see more character depth on Chichiro's dad and his granddad.\\n\\n\r\nWell there's nothing I could say about this anime. The anime is good but not all great. It was still worth the time for them to get to know each other.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want more plot twist (mixture of horror, romantic comedy, mystery, etc...), then I would recommend this to you.\\n\\n\r\n[Second thought]\\n\r\nThe funniest moment is when Rea is swinging the bench at episode 8.",

            "content": "The love for zombies. Many people have so much imagination on the topic of zombies. What are they like? How do they act? In Sankarea, the zombie are completely different from what we learned or picked up along our ways of \"real zombies\". In truth, the kind of zombies in Sankarea is much more realistic in my imagination than all other Anime, Movies, etc., except for Kore wa Zombie desu ka, which is a little of what I thought zombie would be like. It makes more sense for zombie to be like the one in Sankarea because in some cases in a movie, zombie doesn'teven have brain, which is pretty weird because how can they move without the brain signaling through their body? Well, same goes for Sankarea. I don't get this, so if someone could explain, if zombie can't feel pain then that mean all the signal from your whole body must have stop, and so how could they even move if the brain is not really functioning, because if the electrical impulses aren't being sent from the body to the brain, then it goes the other way around too right? Maybe I'm just not that smart on this topic so I'm gonna stop there on the brain thing. In \"real zombies\", people turn into zombies by viruses, but in Sankarea, it's not really viruses, instead, like an old type of thinking, where you can resurrect the dead by potion, which i think makes somewhat more sense. Well, there's many more things I could ask but I'm just going to skip it because it's boring.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI have got to admit that there are quite some plot holes in Sankarea. There are many more things they could explain to get the viewers to understand more, but they didn't, which i why I believe that, people who like the anime should read the manga, because it's still publishing, and probably have much more information to fill in the gaps that are confusion. Although there's many holes in the anime, the plot were great. They move the story in such a nice speed, and How they think of the story is what pulls me in the most. I didn't like the way they cut episodes to fill in some of the personal views the characters had though. Okay, it was important, but they put it in between the episode where it's just before the climax, and that's not what I want. Actually, it irritates me, and may also to some of you too. I also like the plot because it doesn't just go with the zombie topic, but instead, the family situation, the depression of humans, and the desire of people. The romance weren't really that great, but it's pretty nice and lovely, if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art are just fantastic. I really like the kind of art they chosen for this. It added, not only pure and nice background, but some dramatic scenes fit perfectly with these type of art. Of course I do think that this style that is used isn't really the best I've ever seen, but it fit well in the plot, and for the type of genre they had created. The blood doesn't fit well in this type of art though. I'm not sure if it's just me, but the blood is not really thrilling, and it leaves me to feel neither happy nor sad. In High School of the Dead, or some anime like that where it's mainly based on the zombie, even if High School of the Dead is more on fan service side, the type of art really fits well with the blood and gives you the thrill. In conclusion, I think I over rated the art on Sankarea, but I personally just like the art style, and the character design really make you smile.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI think the sounds for the background, character's voice, or any other soundtrack are great overall. It sets the mood to where it's suppose to be. The part where it gets serious or not could be tell by either characters tones, or the soundtrack they put in. It also gave the viewer a little thrilling added in. Sometime only, I found the character's voice to be a little irritating, and doesn't fit with some scene. Maybe it's just me though. I just really enjoy the voice and soundtrack of Sankarea. It's really calm and relaxing, if you pay close attention to it, or you might just feel it without noticing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEvery characters were great, besides only one. I gave this an 8 just because that character makes me do a face palm for a reason which they didn't explained why she did it. It's Ranko if you wanna know. (SPOILER: Could anyone Please tell me why she threw the thing at Chihiro's gram-pa's face? It's really bugging me, so if anyone could explain with good explanation I would really appreciate it. ) Even though it's only one character, I just don't like that person. Now then, I think every other characters did a very well done job for duplicating human reaction to a specific situations that they're in. I think to myself every time in every anime, if I was in that situation, and I have the same exact personality as that character, what will I do in this and that situation? Sankarea did great on that. There's no surprise on it, which is a bad part in another way, but I like these types of characters, because if they act too differently than how you expect them to act, or hope them to act, it will definitely annoy you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI would say that Sankarea is lacking on the romance, but I did enjoy it very much. I'm a big romance fan, so I would say, this is an average romance anime. I would probably enjoy it much, much more if they explain, or at least put more episode in it, just to explain some stuff that are missing in the plot. This is why I'm going to plan to read the manga. I wonder if this is exactly what the creator had plan.To get people to be a bit confuse so they will want to read the manga to get a clear understanding. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI can't say that it's one of the best anime in 2012, but I think it's one I enjoy very much just as equal as anime i consider in my top 50 of 2012. If I have to recommend this anime to anyone, I would probably recommend it to someone looking for a nice plot, enjoyable setting, and only a bit of romance. I big romance watcher, I don't think they will like Sankarea much, as well as zombie geeks. Someone who would just want to enjoy the plot, and doesn't care about the reality. That's the kind of person I would recommend it to, because it's not realistic as y'all may know already. Thank you for reading, and hope it helps in any way.",

            "content": "Vegetarian Zombies!.... Really!.. It seems like the zombie genre is getting more and more creative now. They added a bit more life into the supposedly dead this time, and made a really hot zombie... a hot zombie.... \r\nAs to the introduction, Sankarea basically falls into a lot of strange genres that I really didn't think would work before. But they managed to somehow work things out so that it didn't seem weird. It's pretty much just a Romantic Comedy with Zombies and incest. Wait no, scratch that. It's an anime about Romance with a Zombie and incest. Yeah, that's better. \r\nWith that kind of plotline, you'd think that this could be a \"great and original\" anime. Well, for the \"original\" part, yes. I can certainly say that this is the first anime I've seen with this strange a plot line. But on the \"great\" part, I don't think so. Yes I enjoyed the anime, and yes, the story was nice. It was fascinating till the end. But it just seemed to lack the \"attractive\" element. What I'm saying is, It really didn't grab my attention. I could remember myself losing focus at some parts of the anime too. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a boy with a zombie fetish, a zombie girl with a really, REALLY overprotective father who dies but gets turned into a zombie, another girl who's in love with her cousin, and the boy's even stranger family. Them and a zombified cat. \\n\\n\r\nThe definition of a zombie here is sort of similar to the zombies in Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Meaning they zombies that don't really loose all their sanity and they loose their body limiter. But Sankarea has also added another element that I find really nice. Rigor Mortis. It made me think about what would happen if all the zombie themed media included Rigor Mortis in their movie. It would probably be like \"magic hour\" for humanity. Although this is an element that is usually ignored, Sankarea managed to make this element fit in with the rest of the story line, and adding more depth and realism. \\n\\n\r\nNow the first few episodes were really dark. It gave the impression of a serious \"tragedy romance\" plot. They made the atmosphere perfect for the whole thing. It really made me think that this was going to be a really serious drama. But after episode 3, the plot literally made a U-turn and it ended up into a strange romantic comedy. I don't really have any complaints on that part though. I enjoy plot twists... even if they decide to just break the plot altogether. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression was decent. It left holes, but they were purposely dug holes. Meaning they are there for a reason. They get annoying sometimes, but it's not that bad at least. It also left a hole that could probably either indicate a season two, or just a teaser for the manga since the Manga has more detail and is more advanced. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent. It's a step up on some of the new anime. Props to Studio Deen. All the characters have their own special personality, and the art really makes it pop out. Although until now, I still can't help but think of Chitanda from Hyouka whenever I see Rea make a cute face.... I don't know why I do that though.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, the sound. The OPs and EDs were all decent. Although I wish they could have hired a better seiyuu to do the OP. But I guess the voice also somewhat adds to the \"lightheartedness\" of the anime. The ED was fine too, but sometimes I wish it didn't have to sound TOO sad. \\n\\n\r\nIn entirety, this is a good anime. Although I can't give it more than a 7. It's a nice anime, but I couldn't get myself to focus on it. It just didn't capture me that much. But I guess that's just a personal problem. All in all, this is a good anime, but I can't say that it's a \"great\" anime. But I can still gladly recommend it to anime fans who love \"unique romances\". \\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible spoilers\r\nI like to consider this a bit of a gem in the zombie genre of anime because instead of killing zombies we actually get to see how a Zombie would live in human society. \r\nThe story begins with Chihiro Furuya who has a weird fetish for zombies, then suddenly one day he meets a girl called Rea Sanka who ends up dying so Chihiro uses an ancient potion to bring her back as a zombie.\r\nWhat I really like about the story for this anime is that it doesn't rely on killing zombies to keep you entertained instead it decides to create one zombieand see how they live within human society, what I also like with the story is that it really goes deep into the physiology of zombies like how long they can last before the skin rots away, how sunlight affects them, what they can consume that isn't human flesh and a few other things, it was really interesting seeing how Rea would live her life as a zombie after her unfortunate accident and it really centres on the topic of whether you can live a fun life after you have died.\\n\r\nThis series can also be really dark too because Rea doesn't have the happiest of childhoods in fact it's downright creepy what her father uses her for and there are moments where Rea does slip into the actual zombie state we all know.\\n\r\nThe one thing I have against the story is of course the cliffhanger since we may never get another season and the filler episodes, they weren't bad they just dragged me out of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were mostly good, they were funny a lot of the time and had a bunch of serious interactions too.\\n\r\nChihiro who is the male MC is a strange guy who has weird fetish for zombies and is very socially awkward, but he can be a good guy and does care for Rea's well being when she becomes a zombie and tries his best to try and preserve her body from rotting away.\\n\r\nRea is the female MC and is the one who becomes a zombie, she is a very sweet person and yearns to have a fun life which as a zombie believes this can finally happen since her family were very strict, the relationship between her and Chihiro is odd, but adorable at times because they work well together and always look out for each other.\\n\r\nRanko is Chihiro's cousin and is a bit annoying since she has a crush on Chihiro and she isn't always annoying, but she mostly interrupts good moments between Chihiro and Rea, she's a tomboy like person and is also very protective of Chihiro since he is no good at protecting himself.\\n\r\nMero is Chihiro's sister and is a very monotone person, but she can be funny even if you can't tell with her tone and she has club with her friends where they try and look for extraterrestrial stuff which always turns up empty.\\n\r\nBaabu Chihiro's cat is a loveable runt who is also a zombie and becomes close friends with Rea.\\n\r\nThere is also Rea's parents and they are pretty messed up since Rea's father took pictures of Rea naked in a weird setup on her birthday every year and this just solidifies how creepy he is and Rea's mother or second mother Aria is someone who is desperate for \"cough\" sex \"cough\" and she is a pretty sly bitch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was good you could see the changes in Rea's body as a zombie and you can see the composition as her body is starting rot away, Rea's death was also pretty graphic you could see her guts hanging out and there was certainly a lot of moments where there was a dark, gloomy effect.\\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly funny moments and I'm not sure if this should be counted as a horror although Rea's father fits the bill nicely there and maybe the moments when Baabu and Rea slip into their zombie moments would be counted as horror moments too, there are some moments that were pretty intense like when Chihiro faced Rea's father or when Rea had to fight off some of her fathers goons.\\n\r\nI liked the relationship that built up between Chihiro and Rea because considering Chihiro likes zombie girls he does consider the human side of Rea and takes that into note whereas Rea takes note of how much Chihiro is protecting her and is willing to find a way to preserve her body.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fun take on the zombie genre and is something a little different from the usual kill every zombie you see show so if you're looking for a guy who has a weird zombie fetish who ends up with a zombie girl then this is certainly something interesting",

At first, I didn't expect it to be good, but on the other hand I didn't expect it to be bad. I just came across it one day and thought it seemed interesting. Point being, I was pretty damn skeptic. Immediately after finishing the first episode, I was hooked. Everything that happened to Chihiro felt like, it was all too real (obviously, it's fake), it felt real. Chihiro is the best character, no doubt about it. He had the conflicts of a real boy, buthe also did the right things to not make all to real, like reanimating Rea and Babbu. Yeah my review is mainly about Chihiro, but don't get me wrong, everyone else is great too. Except Rea's dad (nothing is perfect). While, he was the only downside and my first impression of him was that of a child molester, he was just a creepy, extremely over-protective dad who hate's anyone that isn't Rea. So, all in all, great anime.",

            "content": "I watched this anime because the plot seemed quite interesting. A boy who loves zombies tries to bring his dead cat back to life, but ends up creating an actual zombie girl.\r\nThis anime had quite a few funny moments in it, and it did also touch on some dark serious themes, but it wasn't enough to distract me from all the plot holes. One of the most confusing things about this series is the fact that Chihiro appears to be a neko since he has cat ears, and occasionally makes a \"Nyaa\" noise. But nobody ever mentions it or points it out, and none ofhis relatives have cat ears. \\n\\n\r\nOther confusing points centre around Rea being a zombie. Shortly after she becomes a zombie a certain problem arises but simply rectifies itself without any explanation. It's also ambiguous about whether Chihiro's family know she's a zombie or not. Sometimes they directly refer to her as a zombie, implying Chihiro has told them and there's no secret. But then at other times Chihiro seems to be desperately trying to cover up her odd behaviour as if they don't know. His cousin is called Ranko yet he refers to her as Wanko which is never explained either. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is incredibly dissatisfying. To put it simply, there is no ending. The last episode leaves everything open with no solutions or answers. There's also a new character introduced in the very last scene but who remains nameless and we have no idea who she is. Presumably they hope a teaser of a new character would be enough to secure a second series. But since there is no second series this is just incredibly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nRea is an okay kind of character but there's nothing particularly interesting about her. Chihiro is rather unlikeable since he seems to get distracted incredibly easily. And the art style isn't very good either.",

After witnessing the death of his cat Babu, Furuya secretly conducted a series of experiments in order to try and bring his cat back to life. When coincidentally he meets elegant pale girl named Sanka Rea. Who also just happens to be the daughter and heir of the Sanka house hold. With serious daddy problems. This fated meeting leads to Rea to help Furuya try and bring back Babu but what will happen when she becomes a zombie herself.\r\nI think this series is reallywell thought through, with plenty of fan service for the guys. The animation sort of starts off slowly and really catches you by surprise when Rea dies. It wasn\u2019t as gory as I anticipated it to be but I still wouldn\u2019t recommend watching this in a public area which was totally my mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThere is A LOT of fanservice almost to the point till which you forget that the fanservice is technically necrophilia D:\\n\\n\r\nThe aft was so pretty and cute almost out of place for an animation of this kind but I guess the art helped a lot on turning down the realistic grossness of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nLets just say this is a series with lots of people with lots of weird issues.  I mean with a rich girl who turns into a zombie to become a normal girl, a boy that can only love zombies and a Dad that has a serious lolicon daughter complex. It make everything else in the world seem normal.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah just be prepared for mild gore and some sexual themes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally these kinds of animations are not my cup of tea, but you just couldn\u2019t help but feel curious of what was going to happen in the plot next. It kept a good consistency and all I could do was put up with all the perverted fan service ( I personally am not a fan of ecchi D: )\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like how they ended the series with a major cliff hanger. But then with such a conclusion you don\u2019t really know how they could possibly continue the series.\\n\\n\r\n I would recommend this to guys and to girls with caution definitely a 15+ animation and remember not to watch it in public because you will suffer from the people who caught you watching such a series.  But for people who like to watch something abit different from their every day action animation, by all means watch this series.\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "I don\u2019t bother writing many reviews because unless the title is obscure everything that needs to be said about an anime will already have been done so in all the previous reviews. \r\nI guess you could that I\u2019m writing about Sankarea in order to remind the Future Me not to ever rewatch this or view a second season of this show if it ever happens. I won\u2019t really go into the elements where the plot is lacking. You can see all that by skimming some of the other reviews. No, my main argument in this review to keep you away from this review is thatthe main male character, Furiya, is drawn with a hair style that looks like cat ears, and it looks pretty fucking hideous. In the show, he\u2019s basically an ungrateful and overall useless piece of shit with no redeemable qualities but to compound that by looking as stupid as he does is just too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot goes absolutely nowhere, and the character development is also pretty much non existent. The zombie girl doesn\u2019t experience the freedom of being out of her father\u2019s grasp because she\u2019s now chained by having to preserve her body from decay and the loner,  zombie obsessed freak boy acts like a douche to the zombie girl who actually likes him for some reason. Some might say the father of the zombie or cousin might important characters but in reality after the first episode no one else matters. I\u2019m an editor, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.",

            "content": "I had high hopes for this, I really did. The story went to shit after it stopped focusing on trivial complications of having a zombie girl.\r\n It spent whole episodes going in depth to the backstory of side characters. I feel those episodes are better left in the manga; for fans who want  in depth details of every character. \r\nWhen you are given 13 episodes to show off your manga. I suggest having the main story line progress in each one.\r\nNot to mention it left off at a kind of cliff hanger.\r\nThere were also far too many moments where things just happened too convenientlywithout much explanation. It really bothered me because that's where the air time could have gone instead. To provide explanations for the many questions I have. Instead it provided answers to things I never wanted to know about. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it did have its moments where It did give what I came for. I enjoyed those very few moments.",
