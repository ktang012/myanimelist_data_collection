            "content": "I really, really, really loved LoveCom.\r\nIt was cute, insightful, hilarious and endearing.  It was my most anticipated episode every week.  I always wanted more.  I want more now even though I know it's over!\r\nThe story is about the tallest girl and the shortest boy in class and their search for love in high school.  It turns out they're both kooky, funny and energetic.  They're also perfect for each other... too bad they don't see that.  The story isn't complicated or new, but it was told so well that it crawled into right into that soft spot in my heart.\r\nTheromance is built slowly over time and by the end, you're head over heels for them because the creators did such a great job of laying down the foundation and actually showing you how their feelings grow over time.  It's not like a lot of shows where all of a sudden in a haze of fuzzy lighting and rose petals, love magically sprouts out of nowhere.  Instead, you see a friendship begin, a moment happens, interest blossoms, awareness grows... the whole nine yards.  You really get to know Koizumi and Otani over the course of the show and I was rooting like crazy for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so over the top and out of control that it's hard not to laugh.  They exaggerate, make ridiculous faces and they over-react to everything.  It's really kind of hammy, but that's part of the fun.  And it's refreshing to see a female lead who isn't some stereotype of a dominatrix-in-training or a weak, helpless nitwit.  She seems like a real human being with strong points and weak points.  She isn't afraid to get ugly and imperfect sometimes and I think it's really great that they made her (and, really, him too) full of all these flaws and not-so-attractive traits... and yet so completely charming and loveable.  It makes them really... human.  I would say that if you like the relationship (without the music and with a lot more actual focus on romance) of Nodame and Chiaki from Nodame Cantabile, you might like this too because there's a similarity in the way that the relationships go both ways and the strength that each of them brings to the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great too.  First of all, they took the time and effort to change the characters appearances day to day and give them all a sense of their own style, which I really appreciate.  It's just really thorough and well-executed.  I completely agree with YoshikoHatake, there is something about the style that brings Bokura Ga Ita to mind, even though the tone of the story is completely different (BGI felt a lot more serious and the colors and style reflect that somewhat, I think).  Music-wise, it's also nice.  I don't normally notice the openings and endings that much (I've always hated credits), but LoveCom's are really good in a perky, energetic kind of way, which suits the show perfectly, and I find myself singing along w/ the karaoke. ;)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! =)\\n\\n\r\nP.S.  I really haven't seen very many romances that do this good of a job at being funny and sweet and tender and honest.  If you have, I'd love suggestions!",

            "content": "At first glance you think this is one of those normal school romance, boy meets girl, girl meets boy, type anime. Well it\\'s not.\r\nIt\\'s a completely different take on the usual theory. A girl who towers over her crush, a boy who may be short and sees eye to eye with most other girls,  still gets fans.\r\nAs Risa realizes her love for him, ever so slowly, she finally admits to it, but not only is Otani short, but he is very dense, too dense.\r\nSo now, Risa tries all she can to get him to be her boyfriend.\r\nThe story is very unique, with many twistsand turns.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it follows the same line as most romances, it steers off course into new territory. This is where the height differences come in, and the super cute girl gets a demonic aura.  Not like most anime, right? And the dreamy boy she falls for is so dense, he thinks she was joking when she confesses, not at all like the usual.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for the characters has similarities to other anime. Some very discreet, some not.\\n\\n\r\nI notice there was some similarity in art to Bokura Ga Ita.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime\\'s art style follows the original character designs as the manga, with extra color and exuberance.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well as usual they picked the best seiyus to voice the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are upbeat with great lyrics, while the ending songs, tones it down slowing down a bit, and giving it a bit more sweeter change to the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters even though their wardrobe changes through their daily lives, Risa\\'s hair does as well. (Which I noticed had similarities to Bokura Ga Ita\\'s Nana.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed as to go not so far into their past, but more along the lines to explain just what kind of person they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment, it\\'ll make you laugh, and if you have a soft spot for sad romantic scenes, it might make you cry. (Just kidding, nothing so far.) Or it\\'ll make you cry for laughing too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 10.\\n\\n\r\n-Yoshiko",

            "content": "Girl meets boy and girl likes boy. But girl is also half a foot taller than boy and thus, epic drama ensues!\r\nS T O R Y - I don't read/watch a lot of shoujo, but from the start, I figured it was a pretty basic plot and as a result, probably a pretty generic story. I was right -- it's a lot of what you would typically expect from shoujo: lots of silly romantic drama, lots of hilarious shenanigans, and the your handful of cute, fluffy moments scattered throughout that always feel like an shot of diabetic sweetness straight to your black, black heart. Andit was wonderfully done for the most part. As predictable as the overarching story can be, it was still very engaging and fun to watch. The slice of life approach makes the episode-to-episode drama slightly less obvious, and I really loved that time actually moves throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose time progression would logically be more common in slice of life and shoujo series, but since I don't dabble into the genre much, it was very refreshing for me to experience. The series begins as the characters start high school and ends neatly as they graduate. Time moves at a pretty fixed pace, so there's no awkwardness in transitions. I was also really happy to see the beginning, creation, and progression of a relationship -- the series doesn't just end when they get together (I refuse to count that as a spoiler; I mean, c'mon. Did you ever have any doubts?), it keeps going and explores some of their problems and potential future. All in all, it's wrapped up pretty nicely. The story, while fairly generic, is solid, well told, and just silly and fun. The pacing is steady, and though things do feel like they're being dragged along occasionally, the feeling never lasts long. It's a good thing to watch after a shitty day. I'm actually really sad it's over for that very reason.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R - Risa Koizumi is a very dramatic girl. It's fun at first; after a while it got a little tiring. But then I came to realize that wait. Girls really ARE like this! They ARE overdramatic and hysterical and crazy and thoroughly ridiculous. After realizing that amazing truth, I didn't mind so much anymore. Risa is just a girl. And that's how they are. Honestly, I can't call her unrealistic in good conscience because everything she does, every over-the-top reaction she has, I can imagine someone I know in real life doing the same. Considering that, I think Risa's actually a pretty damn well done character. She's very sympathetic and easy to relate to, even when she's crying for the fifth time in five episodes. And she grows -- her feelings for Otani evolve and mature a lot throughout the series, and through you're constantly reminded of this progression through three-second flashbacks, it is something that's nice to look back on.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi Otani is an idiot. It's fun at first; after a while, it gets a little frustrating. But then I came to realize that wait! Boys really ARE like this! They're retarded and stupid and dense and miss all the obvious signs and are super awkward when they do finally get it! Amazing. Once again, I found Otani's depiction to be hilariously accurate on many levels. He does tend to be much less dramatic than Risa, but that's not surprising considering the male stereotype and the fact that his point of view isn't focused on as much until the second half of the series. Though both Risa's and Otani's feelings are undoubtedly romanticized greatly, I found the slower development of Otani's feelings a lot more interesting -- you know what's going to happen, but watching everything unfold is still interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of friends do a great job of contrasting their lovey-dovey relationships with the irregular, often immature, and haphazard relationship of our protagonists. This makes them all noticeably idealized to the point where they're more roles than in-depth characters, but I guess that's all they really needed to be. Seiko and Haruka were fun gimmicks as well. Still, Nobuko was a pretty convincing best friend for Risa, likely because she had the most screentime of the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\n A R T S T Y L E  &  A N I M A T I O N - The animation and art jump around a lot in this series, so there's a bit of bad and a bit of good. The opening and end themes had a lot of fun variation to them, though all seemed pretty typical of shoujo, especially in the sense that they played around with the characters' fashion and style a lot. In the episodes themselves, the characters jumped back and forth from a pretty lazy and generic style to a really hilarious caricature style to a super, sparkle-filled, shiny, pretty shoujo style. The first of those three was the most common and got annoying sometimes because there would be strange discrepancies in how certain things (people, buildings, objects) look and I noticed some variations in height differences and proportions, especially for Risa whose lanky shape stands out a lot when the proportions change. The second was really amusing, especially since many of the SD faces are uniquely and hilariously grotesque and the characters don't hesitate to point this out themselves. The final style naturally showed up in all the super romanticized and climatic scenes -- its those scenes they saved their animation budget on, I'm sure -- making everything that much sweeter. It's predictable, but hey, it's gorgeous and cute and it works, dammit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'm sure is pretty common in shoujo, but that I appreciated all the same, was the fact that fashions changed from scene to scene, episode to episode. I loved that characters changed their clothes every day and had a lot of seasonal fashions; they would also be scene shopping occasionally and the clothes they buy would show up later, etc. I also loved that Risa's hair was constantly changing -- sometimes it coincided with her mood and emotions; sometimes it coincided with events or the weather; sometimes it was just different. It's not that big a deal, really, but it makes the characters that much more real and easier to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love\u2605Com's animation is just average, but it's good enough and the style definitely suits the series.\\n\\n\r\nM U S I C - The first time I heard the first opening theme, \"Kimi + Boku = Love?\" by Tegomass, it confirmed all the stereotypical expectations I had for the series. It's upbeat and cheerful-hopeful, the vocalist's voice has an endearing, dorky quality to it, and the even the name of the song is corny as hell. It felt very right. End themes are generally slower, more somber, and more thoughtful compared to opening themes, and the first end theme, also by Tegomass, was no different. It kind of struck me how different the vocalist sounded. It also felt very right, and both songs really grew on me during the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, the second pair of themes for the series are even better! I absolutely adore how the second opening, \"Hey! Say!\" by Hey!Say! 7 starts. In conjunction with the colorful animation sequence, it suits the series perfectly. It's the kind of music that I imagine Risa and Otani would listen to in addition to Umibouzu, and the lyrics are adorable. The same can be said for the second end theme, \"BON BON,\" also by Hey!Say! 7 -- it's much more upbeat than the first end theme (though still reasonably thoughtful and kind of reminiscent) and once again, just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nLove\u2605Com also surprised me by having a really nice general soundtrack. The theme that played for all of the more depressing scenes was especially pretty and sweet to listen to. For other series of Love\u2605Com's technical quality, I usually don't notice the soundtracks because they're generic and bland, so it's definitely worth noting that the music in this actually stood out. It's one of those soundtracks I wouldn't mind listening to outside of watching the actual series.\\n\\n\r\nV O I C E   A C T I N G - If you actually know Japanese or if you are just a gigantic dork, you might notice that pretty much all of the characters in this series speak in a Kansai dialect, which makes sense since the story takes place in Osaka. I found this pretty awesome because while a lot of series will have one or two characters that speak in the dialect, few have the full cast speaking in it. The last time I heard so many \"aho\"s instead of \"baka\" was in BECK. It's really interesting and neat to hear because even if you don't understand the language that well or realize that it's a different dialect, if you've seen a lot of subbed anime, you'll be able to pick up on slight changes in pronunciation and vocabulary (the most obvious things that I caught were \"na\" instead of \"ne\" and \"chau\" instead of \"chigau\"). For Risa, I also found her pronunciation of \"Otani\" to be occasionally distracting because she stresses the \"o\" a lot more than I would normally expect.\\n\\n\r\nOther than fun dialect stuff, the voices themselves were pretty average. Risa's isn't that memorable, but it works well enough for her role. I was more impressed by Otani's voice because I found that he had a wider range of emotions and a much more recognizable tone overall -- his voice has a really unique inflection when he's upset or surprised, but it's also very charming when he's being serious. Other notable roles: Nakao was surprisingly soft-spoken, which goes great with his character, but was still surprising to hear because few people ever speak that quietly. Seiko's voice was obnoxiously high-pitched, which also went great with his/her character, but it also made me really glad s/he wasn't in too many scenes...\\n\\n\r\nO V E R A L L - Lovely Complex was a much more enjoyable series than I thought it would be, but I'm always happy to see cliches work out. It's very true -- there are no original ideas left, so all there is to do is write good stories. They don't need to be original stories, just good stories, solid stories, fun stories. Lovely Complex fullfills all of above, so even though you know they're going to live happily ever after, you can still enjoy watching it for what it is. As I mentioned earlier, I watched episodes of Love\u2605Com at the end of bad days. They're a shot of sugar and laughs, straight to the vein: adorably effective. Now I need to find another drug.",

            "content": "I'm actually quite surprised to think that this will be the first negative review of Lovely Complex on MAL. Every single review I read gives this show a 7 or higher, which I think is outrageous. I really have a lot of bad things to say about this show but I'll warn you if it gets too spoiler-laden. Here starts the review.\r\nSTORY- 2 (Dreadful)\r\n  Lovely Complex is about two high school kids, Risa and Otani. They are a comedy duo because whever they're together they fight, argue, make fun of each other, and cause a scene, which makes bystanders laugh. Risa is taller thanmost guys and that's a problem for her because she's desperately searching for a boyfriend. Otani is sort of a dumb jock/trouble maker. He's shorter than almost all the girls and he's also self-conscious about it. So two people with height complexes.\\n\r\n  Well the first 5 or so episodes of this are just filler-type comedy episodes which is pretty nice. Then Risa starts to like Otani for who knows what reason. He picks on her, argues with her, but the creators expect us to believe they're a match made in heaven because they both like this one rap group, Umibouzu. \\n\r\n  For the next handful of episodes Risa tries to confess her love to Otani but Otani is just SO DENSE he thinks it's a joke when she confesses to him. This is where the show takes a nose-dive in quality. Lovely Complex starts going in circles. Something along the lines of this: Risa confesses, Otani rejects her, Risa cries, Risa beats him up. Risa stops crying and says she gives up on Otani, but then Otani does something Risa finds sweet, so Risa cries, and beats him up. She says she's going to keep loving Otani. Does it sound stupid? Yes it does! It's very long-winded, it goes in circles, Risa must've cried 30 times in this show. The show also shifts from comedy to drama around this point. You may or may not like this, depending on your preference, but you sure as hell don't want to see Risa cry again. Episodes 1-5 were okay, but around episode 6 it was a steady decline to the awful, unbearable, disgusting episodes 8-12. The show became a chore to watch because everytime I finished an episode I was so frustrated, and multiple times I logged into MAL and almost clicked \"Dropped\". I couldn't bring myself to do it. I would have rather never laid eyes on Lovely Complex then drop it at 12 episodes. I will explain why later in this review.\\n\r\n  Episodes 13 on were watchable to my relief. Not as good as the first five but no where near as awful as 8-12. There is still the cycle of crying, beatings, motivations and what not, but their romance progresses slightly and new characters are added to the mix (which I will talk about later). I'm not going to dwell on the story any longer since I will spoil it for you.\\n\r\n  So you may be asking, looks like you hated the plot...why not give it a 1? 1 is what Lovely Complex would be if it weren't for some great moments later in the series that just made me go \"Awwwwwwwwww :3\". They weren't anything worthy of bringing my score up past 5 but they were cute sweet shojo moments, and I was happy Lovely Complex included them. But the story is still a horribly low 2, and that's fair. The last episode, though I won't spoil it for you, is horribly contrived and way too unrealistic and convenient for the main characters. \\n\r\n  All in all, Lovely Complex's story is a frustrating, long-winded, tedious, and boring one with not enough good humour for a romantic comedy. All of it is slapstick which isn't even funny. Risa kicks Otani probably as much as she cries her eyes out. It's a crappy story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 1 (Pathetic!)\\n\r\n  Characters are unlikable and underdeveloped. The main characters...okay let's discuss them. Risa, awful as stated before. No redeeming qualities, just an all around annoying person. Otani, he's probably the best in the whole show, and that's actually sad. He's underdeveloped, stereotypical and dense. Side characters...well the main one here in Nobu-chan who is Risa's best friend and side kick. She's alright, nothing really irked me about her. She had no personality, she just loved her boyfriend and provided motivation and chances for Risa to meet alone with Otani. She wasn't awful but nothing was good about her. I'm not even going to talk about her boyfriend he's so underdeveloped and useless to the story. \\n\r\n  Also on the topic of side characters, Chiharu was friends with Risa in the beginning but never mentioned past the first episode. She's just a shy girl. \\n\r\n  The biggest problem, bigger than the character's being flat, is that they weren't put to good use. These names may mean nothing to people who haven't seen the show, but to those of you who have, Maity-sensei, Haruka, that blonde transvestite, Mimi, the red and black haired kid, and Otani's ex-girlfriend recieved no character developement and were brought into the series only to be forgotten. Ok, Mimi, red head kid, and Otani's ex weren't that important to the story, but all the other side characters were! Haruka most particularly, had brought a bunch of drama in the series and created tension between Risa and Otani in the beginning, only to be forgotten and useless to the plot, and never developed. He could've had a story arc about him but the creators didn't choose to go that route which was dissapointing. In the end, no side characters got any actual closure. \\n\r\n  Character in this show is pathetic, Risa is the worst mainly because she cries too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 5 (Meh.)\\n\r\nThe \"sad moment\" music just made the scenes too melodramatic. The \"happy, funny moment\" music did it's job and fit in well with the scenes. The \"good moment\" music (ie, when something romantic happens between Risa and Otani) is probably the best. It makes the seens just that much sweeter and it puts a smile on my face. The OPs and EDs were forgettable and just not special. That's all I reall have to say.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8 (Nothing to complain about here)\\n\r\nThe art I actually quite liked. The character designs were nice, the colour palette was bright and colourful, sometimes Risa's fish-face bothered me but overall I liked the art in Lovely Complex. It was nice to look at, I would probably call it unique but from what pictures I've seen from Kimi ni Todoke and Bokura ga Ita, the art is all the same. But still, it's good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 2\\n\r\nHad some sweet moments but in the end this frustrating tedious mess of a romantic \"comedy\" made me want to bang my head against the wall and had little to no redeeming values. A MAJOR dissapointment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 3\\n\r\nLovely Complex was a terrible, horrible, nauseating show that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Unless you have a strong fetish for slapstick humour, you won't be able to sit through half of this. Anybody who actually enjoyed this has a remarkably high pain tolerance.\\n\\n\r\n(Jokes)\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, it's a bad show.",

            "content": "You love love? Then you're going to love this anime!\r\nThe story itselves seems very standard at first glance, but it isn't. Risa, the main character, is an girl who is taller than the average girl. She wants an boy that's longer than her, but then something happens. She and Otani, a very short boy from her class, are often being laughed at, because they look and act like an popular comedy duo. Although the fact they're being laughed at and are bickering all the time, their friendships start to grow and Risa even starts to like Otani. From here on the story has a lotof twists and turns, even untill the end, which makes it very interesting!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice. It has it own style and is different than most of the anime. The characters wear different time of clothing and have an other hairstyle. The art is more focused on the girls than on the boys: the guys aren't really handsome or whatever, not something you see a lot in shoujo! An other visual part are how the emotions are showed. They're typical, but also 'a bit' exaggerated. It doesn't annoy me, instead it makes me laugh! It makes it very funny and that's a part of the power of Lovecom.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was something that perfectly matched the anime. Once you know the translation of it, you're going to love it. When I first heard the OP and EN I didn't enjoyed it that much, but now I'm totally in love with it! Later on the OP and the EN change... I loved them at once!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just so human! You could have the feeling that you're one of the characters, there's nothing extra-ordinary or something about them, like that they're actually an alien or something. No, the characters are human and that's why you can feel sorry for a person when he or she is crying and sympathize with them. It makes the whole story only more interesting~!\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really enjoyed this anime. The love, joy, sadness, funny parts, dreams that come true, dreams that scatter, it is all part of it and that's what it made me totally addicted to LoveCom.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it deserves an big 9~! Just watch and see this amusing anime!",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romantic, Comedy about an odd couple; tall girl Risa Koizumi and short guy Atsushi Ootani. It is near impossible to sit through this series straight-faced, as it is full of drama and lots of laughs. XD\r\nVideo Alternative ^_^\r\nThe story proved to be both entertaining and heart-warming at the same time. One thing I personally didn&rsquo;t like about the story and other may have a problem with, was the time-scale. Throughout series, everything seemed to move so fast that it was even skipping from season to season in a single episode. But that is also a great thingas the series would have wasted a lot of time otherwise. The romance part of this Rom/Com was done incredibly well, because it thoroughly went through Risa&rsquo;s constant struggle. There were quite a lot of unexpected developments as well that easily overshadowed all the cliches. Putting the romantic aspect aside, the comedy was great with some hilarious use of slapstick comedy, mostly brought on by the comedy duo (Risa x Atsushi).\\n\\n\r\nWith the story completely revolving around Risa and Atsushi, the pair needed to be great for it to be interesting and that is exactly what they were. Not only is it delightful to watch them constantly argue with each other but also the drama and tension between them was portrayed so well that you&rsquo;ll have to be heartless to not feel anything. Well of course there were other characters, but after the first couple episodes they barely played any major part in the story and were there just for jokes or to meddle with the comedy duo.  \\n\\n\r\nThe style of animation really suits the comical manner of this anime, as it can look incredibly crude half the time to go with the various jokes. But then it can look somewhat striking when it needs to. The music is just a bunch of basic melodies to go with every situation although it does drop in a few really good tunes for the dramatic moments. The OP and ED themes aren&rsquo;t amazing, nonetheless that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t go well with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an amazing Rom/Com that is able to mix the Romance and the Comedy so well, so that neither seems overbearing. Even though the relationship was always &ldquo;two steps forward, one step back&rdquo; it never really felt dragged out. The one issue was the excessive amount of flashbacks, which sometimes got really repetitive but it never ruined the overall enjoyable feeling of the series. Even though it is a Shoujo anime, I&rsquo;m a guy who hugely enjoyed this series and it&rsquo;s definitely worth any Rom/Com fan&rsquo;s time.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Definitely not typical shoujo anime\r\nIf you looked for the meaning of \"Romantic Comedy\" in the dictionary (or maybe even Wikipedia), you'd probably see \"Lovely Complex\" written in its definition. Okay, maybe not, but somebody should put it there!\r\nAs much as I love shoujo manga and anime, I do get tired of it sometimes because most shoujo follow the same formula. Such is not the case for Lovely Complex. I think Lovely Complex is the true embodiment of the romantic comedy genre. A love match between a tall girl and a short guy is like the perfect recipe for a romanticcomedy. Not only that, it's also heartwarming, but funny at the same time. That is what makes it so refreshing. I don't think I laughed and cried for a shoujo anime as much as I did for Lovely Complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2 main characters are different from the usual shoujo protagonists as well. You have Koizumi Risa, taller than the average girl, slightly tomboyish and awkward. There's also Otani Atsushi, shorter than the average guy, insecure, and kind. Together they also deviate from the usual shoujo anime/manga couples. When they officially become a couple (not really a spoiler because it's obvious they'll get together XD), it's evident that Risa is more dominant than Otani.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't like Lovely Complex right away because I wasn't used to hearing so many characters speak in Osakan accents. The moment I heard one of them speak, I thought to myself &quot;Obviously Osakan&quot;. Not that I have anything against Osakans, but at times, it sounded as if they were speaking in Chinese and couldn't understand what they were saying (I have the habit of translating in my head even while reading the subs). I'm still iffy about the accents, but then I realize that the Osakan accents really work well for Koizumi and Otani's personalities - loud. Very loud.\\n\\n\r\nI like the character designs - Again, not typical shoujo anime/manga designs in which characters are usually bishie-fied. The characters look cute and their clothes are always so trendy. The only typical element you'd find in the character design is the out of proportion bodies, but in a different way. Sometimes Risa does look boyish because she doesn't have a figure, but I guess her look matches her personality. I also like the colors, consisting mostly of yellow-orange tones. The colors made the visuals of Lovely Complex really attractive, cute and current.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the first set of OP and ED themes at first, because I thought that kind of music was kind of corny and for older fans. Just when I was starting to like both songs, they replaced the OP and ED themes with Hey! Say! 7 songs (around episode 13), and I'm really glad they did. The latter set of songs is more current and trendy as they should be, because the anime itself is current and trendy. I especially like &quot;BON BON&quot; by Hey! Say! 7, the second ED. I think it's a really sweet and cute song.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I picked Lovely Complex when I was looking for a new shoujo anime to watch. It turned out to be one of the best series (in general) I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to all anime fans, whether you like shoujo or not.",

            "content": "A romance-comedy with a Kansai twist.\r\nI was a bit late getting onto the Lovely Complex or LoveCom bandwagon but once on board I was there till the end! LoveCom had me laughing, crying while my heart trided to leap out of my chest. It was well balanced in light and heavy scenarios, high in good anime-nutritions, a must-see for the anime-fan diet! One I devoured in two days! (All 24 eps).\r\nStory:\r\nEvery manga-ka tries to find their niche market. What do the romance-comedy fans want next? Dramatic pasts with dead characters? Forbidden loves? Deaths? Mahou-shoujo?\r\nThere are millions of romance-comedy manga and anime out there that arebased off cer-ray-zeh ideas however, it does not make them worth while, nor more interesting. However, all my kudos goes to the original Manga-Kas, Nakahara and Aya, for using the simple idea of height complexes and creating one of the worlds best romance-comedies ever! In short, the LoveCom story is simple, sweet but one of the best ideas out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art seems very simple at first glance but it is most effective. Not only does the style translate from the manga perfectly but it amazingly portrays the unique kansai humor that makes up half of LoveCom. It also well portrays the characters types which are so important in this anime about characters who have porblems with themselves. From the adorable Seiko to the tall (but model like) Risa.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nCould've done with some work. Personally I really didn't like the opening and ending themes although they did match the anime perfectly. Also, Seiko's voice was starting to make my ears bleed after five minutes. However, Risa and Otani's voice's were perfect and the background music for those heavy emotional scenes (mostly bad ones) was very effective.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis anime is built on the characters it portrays. The mix of strange and fairly normal teens (plus two teachers and some strange parents) is very effective. Each character bounces off another as they help one and other grow. Ofcourse, LoveCom is about love and complexes, and so every character doesn't go without their own little slice of problems and it's these that fuel the anime along, and these we grow to love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI must say, while I tend to greatly enjoy romance of anysort (and the love-love in this anime stopped my heart a few times) the unique Kansai region humor really did me in. Word unique to Kansai (and Osaka) like 'Aho' rahter than 'Baka' made this anime stand out, and the comedy-duo acts, in the style of japanese comedy was something new and amazing to experience, even in animation! It is so difference to western humor (much like how british humor is generally different to american) and it kept me smiling all the way!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as you may be able to tell (10/10!!) I enjoyed this anime greatly, and so should many others. It reaches many aspects of life; love, self counsiousness, moving on and being true to what you feel. LoveCom is a romance-comedy for all anime fans. What are you waiting for? The All Hashin Kyojin are preforming just for you!",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is truly a great series. Every episode, regardless of what is happening, is enjoyable and leaves you wanting to watch the next one. \r\nThe storyline isn't anything crazy or off the wall, but it is executed to near perfection and contains a lot of really good plot turns and twists. Complimenting the story, and enhancing it, is a lot of very funny comedy. A good story makes you want more, and in that regard, this does exactly that. \r\nThe artwork and animation is good, although at times it can be inconsistent. But what is most important is that the scenes that are madeto be remembered, look stunning.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, there are some very good background pieces that come up throughout the series. Of the two OP's and two ED's, I really only like the first ones. The OP and ED of the second half of the series were pretty mediocre to me, although they have both grown on me a little bit. The voice acting was what really took the cake; all of the voices were well done, with the voice actors of Otani and Risa really doing an excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really made this series so good. There is not a single character that I feel doesn't fit into the series, but again, Otani and Risa just steal the show. Their friends also have good characters, but aren't paid as much attention as the two mains. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an incredibly enjoyable anime. You come to live and die with the characters, and really feel what they feel. Lovely Complex has some of the most perfectly executed moments that I have seen, where the stars just seem to align and make a scene that forces your jaw to drop and your heart to pound.",

            "content": "Can't wait for the hate for this one.\r\nAt the start of watching Lovely Complex, I was certain that I was going to love this show, being a fan of shoujo romance. I can't say that I dislike it, but rather I was heavily dissapointed by it. \r\nThroughout the first half, I really enjoyed what it brought to the table. The start was a little rough, but it was a nice twist to an unoriginal genre (I say this way too much with romance anime, but so be it). Otani and Risa are a pairing that are so much fun to watch. The back and forthbetween them was well handled early on. Not only that, but it did extremely well with the themes of unrequited love and beauty is only skin deep.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, as the anime trotted along, I realized that this was the ONLY thing it did. It kept beating the theme of unrequited love so much that it lost a lot of it's impact. There wasn't a lot of anything else that the characters talked about other than Otani and Risa's relationship until the very end of the series. The saying goes that variety is the spice of life, and the lack of this in Lovely Complex grated on my patience.\\n\\n\r\nThis also bears a problem when talking about side characters. The four best friends of Otani and Risa (aside from Nobu who I will get to in a minute) have barely anything to them. They are left sidelined till the last couple episodes, just so the anime could say that they developed them. Hell, the one defining character trait of Chiharu established in episode one, which was she feared men, was not brought back up until episode the second to last episode.\\n\\n\r\nNobu is the only other character besides the main leads that gets much screen-time at all. All her character is is her yelling at either Otani or Risa to  either do something about their relationship, or yelling at them because they did something wrong. I didn't dislike her character, but I just felt I should mention how one note she felt for the majority of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the side characters, most of them are just plot devices to cause tension between Otani and Risa. \\n\\n\r\nOtani and Risa themselves, while frustrating at times, were the best part of the series. Risa is a girl who tries very hard to achieve her goals. Even though she cries a lot, which did get annoying sometimes, it was hard not to get behind her whenever she fails or succeeds. I also liked how Otani dealt with the whole unrequited love thing. I won't spoil it, but he handled it in a way that was frustrating but very believable, which I appreciated a great deal. They aren't the best couple I've seen, as they suffered a lot from the lack of buildup of their relationship due to the stretched out nature of the middle section of the show, but they were an extremely fun couple, for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was not fantastic. While I liked the colour palette they used, and the character designs were well done, and my god the facial expressions were amazing, but it still felt a little flat to me. The animation was stiff as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was extremely memorable. Normally romance soundtracks don't have much of an impact on me, but there were a few songs in this one that were fantastically put together. Some stand outs would be World's End, Risa, DUNK SHOOT, Deep Past, and Theme of LoveCom. Complex is also noteworthy, but only because the first 18 seconds are more or less a complete copy of the chorus of The Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\". Seriously, go listen to them both.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also memorable in how everyone has a kansai dialect. The voices of Risa and Otani are very good as far as I'm concerned. There were technically some bad voice actors here and there, Chiharu and Suzuki for example, but there voices were so different that I loved their voices regardless.\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex is a show that seems to focus on very specific things, which ended up hurting many other aspects of the show that could of been interesting. And while yes, these things that were so heavily focused on were well done, I was spoon fed so much of the same thing that it left me grasping for something else. It doesn't help when all your characters talk about is Otani and Risa's love life, and basically nothing else until the very end of the series, and that the drama felt very forced, especially towards the end. That being said, the end did leave off on strong note, with everything wrapping up very nicely, even if the drama was forced. Overall, Lovely Complex was a fun show to watch, with some great cutesy moments and comedy moments, but it isn't a show I would highly recommend. Of course, I think I'm in the minority here, so if you watch it and end up loving it, more power to you.",

            "content": "Lovely\u2605Complex is centered around our main character and tallest girl in her class, Koizumi Risa, and the shortest boy in the class, Otani Atsushi. The anime explores their relationship, from classmates to friends to maybe even lovers.\r\nThe premise of the anime is fantastic. Both our deuteragonists have a case of height complexes (hence the name) and struggle to overcome this. In the beginning, there is a mutual dislike for each other, as Risa and Otani are laughed at because of their reputation as the class' \"comedy duo\". As time progresses, however, Koizumi begins to like Otani, as a friend (and later, a crush), and acceptsthe fact that he's shorter than her. But to Otani, Risa is just the other half of their comedy duo, and no more than a friend. This unrequited love is what drives the whole story and plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple and predictable, yet the way it was executed made it interesting. There are some times where the plot doesn't flow as well, but all the episodes have use and further move the plot along. There are other times where the plot feels like it's looping, or taking \"one step forward, two steps back\", especially with romantic progression. Overall, a solid plot that does get a nice ending and ties many loose ends. However, the conflicts presented in the show heavily rely on the use of many love triangles, and most of the love rivals do not provide any doubt to the watcher as to whether the main advertised romance might not succeed , something that a well-written love rival should. Love triangles, when properly used, can bring the plot forward, but some of these love triangles did not drive the plot at all. The pace of the plot was in general, pretty fast-paced, but it's not rushed, and it received some slower progression as the plot began to unfold and broaden. The emotions that Love\u2605Com tries to evoke are a hit-and-miss: sometimes it works to an astonishing degree, allowing the watcher to sympathize with the characters, and other times, it may feel a little cumbersome or it has a delayed effect. The plot is probably the main reason why this anime, for me at least, did not have much of an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and funny, but the complexity of side characters are what I feel is the most lacking in this anime. Our protagonist, Koizumi Risa, is an exception: she's one of the most developed characters in the show. She is funny, dramatic, sarcastic, sometimes pathetic, determined yet wavered at times, charismatic, and nice. Her kindness, which is mentioned many times by her friends, tends to be overshadowed by her other personality traits, though. Her defining trait is her determination in seeking a relationship with Otani, even with all the obstacles thrown at her and all the times she nearly gave up. However, she loses sight of her goal countless times, to the point that it's hard to classify her as always determined; rather, it's like she has periods of absolute motivation and periods where she loses all hope. We get to see her go through a range of emotions, which is well portrayed in the anime. She can be over-the-top sometimes, dramatically pathetic, and an absolute idiot, but she's relatable, with realistic flaws and virtues, and that's what I think is the selling feature of hers.\\n\\n\r\nOtani is dense, sarcastic, humorous, and idiotic. He has a hard time sorting out his feelings, and doesn't like to talk about them either, therefore his feelings, if any, towards Risa, is definitely more toned-down than that of Risa's toward Otani. He constantly gives Risa hope (referring to their relationship progression) but then snatches that hope away from her, which tires her to no end. As dense and unaware of his actions as he is, many of the lines he has does have a profound effect on Risa. In short, a character with a few interesting quirks, and not at all typical.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with so much of our focus on the main characters and their love, the side characters do not receive enough attention. Most of them are two-dimensional characters that rely on one or two traits to define them. They don't have much of an impact on plot, but then again, I guess the point of Love\u2605Com is to mostly display interactions between the deuteragonists, but I would like for more depth in personality for the sides, to promote that yes, the side characters are equally as important as the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't as much character development in Love\u2605Com, because of the focus on romantic development and friendship development, but for this anime, that is exactly what makes it enjoyable. Of course, I would've liked to see some, but the anime as it is now can do without. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is spot on and greatly enjoyable. For an anime classified as a comedy, this is exactly what I'd expect: sad or tense moments followed by a comedic one to relieve the tension. Lines are perfectly executed to bring laughter to the one watching. This anime does a wonderful job at playing with the watcher's emotions. Love\u2605Com is guaranteed to make you happier after a bad day. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the romance. It develops bit by bit, and we clearly see the stages of love here. The romance part of the story is unique and lovely, but it could have been better approached. The side characters tend to bash Otani for not liking Risa, something I find a little unfair. Along with the countless love triangles as the main strain on Risa and Otani's relationship, this degrades the whole complexity of the romance by a fair bit. The romance grows with the few internal conflicts (such as Otani not being able to see Risa as anything but a friend, no matter how hard he tried) and external conflicts, but suffers under the majority of others. In general, a promising romance that, on the whole, is very satisfying and unique, but lacking in a few small areas. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music suits the anime well. There are the upbeat and cheerful songs, perfectly tuned in with the anime's overall atmosphere and inner message of hope, and then there's the sad, depressing songs played during disappointing moments. There is a good variety in song themes and it's effective, but the Love\u2605Com OST isn't as noteworthy in particular. The openings and endings of the anime aren't as memorable, with the openings being overly cheerful and peppy and the endings being more thoughtful and slow, but I do admit they also complement the anime. The voice actors are decently matched with their respective characters, especially for the main characters, who have a tendency to be expressive and loud. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is satisfying, but it's not special or exceptional. It works well with the characters, and fit their different personalities. Risa is a character that changes her hairstyle often, showing her personality and sense of style. The characters encompass a broad range of emotions, and the art does nicely in the portrayal of them, whether it's sadness, anger, or just Risa being plain exaggerative. Light colors are often used, nothing too dark, which goes along with the fact that Lovely\u2605Complex is a light-hearted anime, without any terribly dark conflicts or themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love\u2605Com is definitely worth the consideration, for its entertaining comedy, relatable main characters, and the romance. It's lovely, all right ... just not as complex. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (7) ART: (7) SOUND: (8) CHARACTER: (8) ENJOYMENT: (8) \u2605OVERALL\u2605 (7) Feedback, con-crit, and suggestions to improve this review is welcome!\\n",

            "content": "I initially reviewed this piece after watching it only once, but since then, I have seen the series three times and decided to give this a complete and thorough review.  I personally enjoy a systematic review that rates each category and explains why, but this first chunk is going to be just my thoughts on the anime as a whole.  If you want to see my ratings for each category and why, continue reading at the bottom to see it (or if you'd just rather see scores for each category, then skip to the bottom after the lines of asterisks).\r\n****************************************************************  \r\nThere aretimes when the telling of a tale becomes more than just a story - it becomes a masterpiece, forever to be treasured and remembered.  Everything seems to just work, from the overarching plot-line, down to the background character cast and everything in between, the epic masterpieces move, change and impact in powerful ways.  Lovely Complex is an anime that makes its mark as a potential to be one of these phenomenal works.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately, this anime begins by setting up the story; a guy and girl who are both very self-conscious about their heights who desperately reach out for some kind of relationship.  It becomes apparent almost immediately, though, that these two are nearly perfect for each other.  But, of course, they can't begin to see each other as a candidate for a relationship.  So the two decide to cheer each other on and help one another.  Within just a few episodes, Koizumi (the girl) begins to develop feelings for Otani.  Now beyond that is where the actual excitement and enjoyment of the story come into play.  Frequently, you will find yourself laughing (extremely hard at times) at the plethora of jokes, but almost as often finding yourself near tears or frowning at that touching emotional scene.  Very few stories have the capability to balance both comedy and drama ON TOP OF a romance plot.  But not only does Lovely Complex do just that, it's touching, the comedy is genuinely hysterical and the romance is real.  There's none of that \"lucky\" guy who's surrounded by lots of girls who adore him.  None of that \"hotter-than-the-sun\" kind of girl who compels some guy to chase after her.  What you get here is a realistic presentation of a developing relationship out of a friendship.  One that is easy to relate to, fun to watch and cheer on, and will leave you with a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they only work to enhance and improve upon the wonders of the story and characters.  Tense scenes seem to always have the perfect music playing.  Touching scenes have that beautiful, heart-tugging melody playing quietly in the background.  Throughout the 24 episodes, a common rag-time kind of theme is played that becomes very catchy and enjoyable - it seems to capture the nature of the characters and their struggles. \\n\r\nArt, while being rather unique, is fairly detailed and clearly defines what is being presented.  Often times, expressions are exaggerated (quite comically, I might add), and some scenes are taken over by \"floating flowers\" or \"swirling angry purple haze\" effects.  While these may be distracting at times, they lend to improve the mood and feeling of each scene they appear.  (Think lots of XD expressions going on).  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Lovely Complex is both a touching and hilarious storyline that is definitely worth checking out. After 3 times watching through this show, I still laugh and cry, ending up with a feeling that I don't really get from any other anime I've watched (or re-watch).  The ending seems to tie up a perfect package with an even more beautiful bow.  Who knows?  Perhaps LoveCom will ease its way into your heart as a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****************************************************************\\n\\n\\n\r\nI rate animes I have seen based upon the categories of Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Personal Enjoyment, each worth 10 points (1 being terrible, 10 being incredible).  The overall score is then multiplied by 2 to get a score out of 100.  \\n\\n\r\n**STORY**   9.9/10\\n\r\nI give the story a 9.9 out of 10 simply because I can't get enough of it.  There never seems to be a filler episode, everything seems both relevant and interesting.  The story is both compelling and moving.  Comedy, Romance, Slice-of-Life, a bit of Drama.  Now, why isn't it a 10/10?  Simply because it's a somewhat generic story - girl and guy are friends, would make perfect couple but don't see it that way, one side falls for the other, but other side has reservations.  You can probably guess what happens in the end.  BUT, there's more to a story than just WHAT it is, there's the HOW it's told that really makes a difference.  Which brings me to \\n\\n\r\n**CHARACTERS** 10/10\\n\r\nThis category I don't even hesitate to give a perfect score.  Every character, from the lovable, dynamic duo of Risa and Otani, down to even the minor characters (Umibozu) and the somewhat detestable/annoying Mimi and Haruka are given such a wonderful personality.  They all seem real, you can identify with them, you can love/hate them, cheer them on.  Each of the characters are memorable in their own right and will leave some kind of impression on you.\\n\\n\r\n**ART** 9.8/10\\n\r\nAs for art, I can't give it a full score just because it didn't blow me away.  But, what it did do, is present the story without distracting me, give life and love to each of the characters and clearly convey the mood being set up.  I'm personally not one to really care what the anime looks like, as long as it's not... weird... and flows smoothly, doesn't deviate from what it set out to do, and makes changes when change would be expected.  (i.e. 3 years go by, from 15-18, I better expect to see some changes in the characters).  Thus, I gave it 9.8.\\n\\n\r\n**SOUND** 10/10\\n\r\nRarely do I ever look for the soundtrack from an anime, but this has become one of them (Cowboy Bebop, Welcome to the NHK some of the others).  When the music is so good that you want to listen to it separately, without the scene and other things going on, you know that's a good music soundtrack.  \\n\r\nBut beyond the soundtrack, the noises, the voices, every other sound is clear, crisp and beautiful.  In that aspect, the sound is just like the art to me; as long as it's not weird or distracting, it's pretty good.  But LoveCom had that amazing soundtrack (Risa's theme is so catchy), a great vocal cast and plenty of authentic sounding noises.  \\n\\n\r\n**PERSONAL ENJOYMENT** 10/10\\n\r\nObviously, if you noticed that I'm effectively giving this anime two reviews, you should know that I would give this category a 10.  I have watched this 3 times and I wouldn't mind watching it again in a few months.  Just like that movie of which you never seem to tire, LoveCom grows on you and makes you want to see it again and again.  This anime has changed me, too, by inspiring me to have an attitude like that of Koizumi or Otani - never give up and fight hard for what you want.  \\n\\n\r\n**OVERALL**\\n\r\n99.4/100\\n\r\nIf you like any kind of romantic comedy, give this a shot.  You'll know if you'll like it after the first episode.  XD",

            "content": "\"You idiot! Big or small, as long as you have a \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 you're a man, right?!\"\r\nMy initial thoughts when starting this series? \"What am I getting myself into...\" Those words were what ran through my head when I watched the first episode. It was ranked pretty high by the MAL Community, and I decided to give it a try. After the first episode, I couldn't help but press the next episode button... I mean, who wouldn't, right? Anyways, as I started watching the series, I hadn't noticed until around episode 17 that I had just spent 8 hours laughing my head off every episode. Strange,isn't it? We don't realize that we're doing something until we've been doing it for a long time or until someone points it out. What am I getting at here? Lovely\u2606Complex was probably the highlight of my month. I watched every episode in a matter of hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, when it comes to good quality storylines, Lovely\u2606Complex might cross people's minds. True, it may not sound like anything special, but truthfully it is. Usually when it comes to Shoujo animes, the storyline is based around 1 plot, and that would be getting the 2 protagonists together in the end of the series. What makes this unique is that the male protagonists are often taller then the female protagonists. In this case, it's the other way around... by about half a foot. Risa, codename \"Giraffe\", is a whopping 172 cm tall, and Otani, codename \"Midget\", is a mere 156 cm tall. It's abnormal for either of them to be that height, so when people are trying to make romance come out of that situation, it might seem impossible, especially since the two of them are fighting constantly. But overall, the story was really well played to my surprise. There was good comedy, romance, and an overall feel to the anime. I was very happy about that. It's not often where you come across a Shoujo that hasn't copied a story from another shoujo...\\n\\n\r\n2007 isn't that long ago, and for an anime that's over 6 years old, it had a pretty decent art style. I liked how the characters were portrayed, however it seems like everyone in Lovely\u2606Complex was either really short, or really tall. I don't think there was an average height person in this show... strange, but had good quality overall. One thing I did have a problem though were those creepy-assed faces that mostly came from Risa. It ranged from a chipmunk, to a rabbit, to a god-knows-what. It's hard to like her when her face is so misshapen like that. I still laughed though, at least when I wasn't shielding my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent cast for Lovely\u2606Complex. I really liked how they got the voice actress who played Nami in One Piece to voice Risa as well. She did really well in One Piece and transferred that profession into Risa. Then there was Otani. His voice was played by Akira Nagata. Haven't heard of him? Well neither had I until I looked up who voiced Otani. He's had 2 roles, one of them being Lovely\u2606Complex, so it shocked me to see him with a lack of roles. He voiced Otani so well that I was kind of sad, not being able to hear him again. As for all the other voice actors, they voiced their roles with professionalism and enthusiasm. I applaud that.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on forever about who I liked best and why, but I'll keep the text to a minimum here. I liked Nobu the best, but I'll get to her later. For starters, Giraffe-- er, Risa was really funny, she was pretty when she wasn't cosplaying as a beaver, and she had an overall likable personality. Otani-- er, Midget-- wait, yeah, Otani seemed really dense, and when I mean dense, I mean REALLY dense. You could literally send him a note telling him \"I love you\" with your name signed at the bottom and he'd think it was a joke or for someone else. Either way, he too had some really funny moments to him. Haruka was the bane of my existence as an anime-lover. His constant obsession over Risa was almost intolerable. But either way, he seemed to have a crucial role in the story, so he was needed, to my dismay. Nobu, yaaaay! Risa's best friend. Probably the most affectionate girlfriend you could possibly have in all honesty. Truthfully I'd like to see someone get in the way of her and Nakao (Nobu's Boyfriend, and also one of the funniest characters in the show), and trust me, that person would die. Then there's Suzuki and Chiharu. I'm lumping them together because they're basically the same person, only 1 is male and the other is female. They're both really shy, but they are really nice as well. Last of all, Seiko. I'm not gonna give you a rundown of what makes Seiko a crucial character, but all I'm going to say is prepare to have your eyes burned out of your sockets and your brain blown up, along with constant laughter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10. This is probably my favorite Shoujo out there today. I got my sister to watch it and she loves it as well, and she never watches any anime other than Angel Beats! and The World God Only Knows. She has a limited tendency to watch anime, but if I was able to get her to watch this, you should try it out for yourself as well. This anime had some great comedy, really good romance scenes, and an overall likableness to it. I urge you to watch it, and I really hope that those of you who have seen it can vouch for me in supporting me on how good this was.",

            "content": "True chemistry is something hard to find. Is it acceptable to dwell on things like..height difference and being comedy partners to ignore it?\r\nI watched this show after a person with similar taste suggested it. The first impression I got was that it was going to be..a romance/comedy show, with the oxymoron of having the roles reversed, height-wise. Risa, our female lead, is really tall for a girl. This is often exaggerated, with her really slim members, to make her look like a giantess from time to time. Our guy, Otani, is good looking, a basketball star, but..he's really short for a guy. Can these twoovercome these facts, and start to see each other as more than friends, even though they've been making others laugh forever, getting nicknamed as the All Hanshin Kyoujin comedy duo?\\n\\n\r\nSo, I expected this to be about the sweet heartache of having to wonder whether he/she likes you or not. Having to deal with rivals appearing. Trying to deny true chemistry. After a few episodes, I asked myself. Is Lovely Complex what I expected? Well, partly yes, but not exactly...Is this a bad thing? Well, not necessarily...\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found this show to have a higher comedy value than romance value. I've laughed through out this. I've been disappointed with several aspects of the romance though. It's all a matter of personal aesthetics, of course, but for me, this was too one sided a romance for far too long to move me.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't like it when someone is taken for granted forever. Some might argue that this was realistic at first, you can't change your feelings and stop seeing someone as a friend in the blink of an eye. But if it drags on for too long, like it does here, you're just being spoiled. Beyond that, persistance can be admirable, and having to work for love is something that happens often, sure. It is because it happens often that I'm more interested in things that happen -naturally- . To me, something more rare is more special, more worthy of being told as a story. And then...Whatever happened to privacy, people?!\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, you have to give your friends a little push. But here..Everyone is butting in the whole time, I can't understand this. Even in moments that really should be private, it is presented as natural to have another four guys join. Then, it's more than just a light push; isn't it awkward, to have everyone forcing one onto the other, having to apologize for not wanting to be with someone, like you owe it to people? And then, what's with lecturing your rival about how she shouldn't give up on your boyfriend ?! Seriously now?\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is supposed to be funny. But the female lead gets ridiculed too much for me. Watching that second kiss hurts my eyes. Risa's been saying this \"I'm through with liking you\" a thousand times. But then again, who's been a teenager and hasn't done that? And their feelings do develop through out the series. Risa is the driving force; her actions and persistance lead, while Otani's reactions to them are the catalyst. These guys deserve each other, and they do look good together. The part with Risa going to that concert seriously annoyed me, but I guess it was the creator's idea of outgrowing the forementioned one sided phase. Oh, Nobu-chan is a star.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics remind me of a lot of other shows. The characters are quite fashionable, changing attires often. The music was nothing special, but I rather liked the voice acting. I think it made the characters memorable, the All Hanshin Kyoujin duo with their \"Kimoi!\" 's, Nobu-chan with her \"dah-ling\", and uh..that giant going \"Moo\".\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex has been quite funny, and it did have its cute moments. It's just my personal belief that a better balance between these two aspects is achievable.",

See, unlike a normal love story where the guy is always taller than the girl, here, the roles are reversed. Thegirl is much taller than the boy. This unconventional match-up brings a new factor to the table --- the complexes that the characters experience because of their height. For example, a girlfriend taller than you might hurt your \"manly pride\" (Bullshit! I know) or tall girls aren't usually cute or it is awkward if you're trying to kiss your girl and you can't even reach her. These complexes do play a certain role as the love story progresses and are dealt with nicely which is good to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo on their first day, Risa and Otani are branded as the \"All-Hanshin Kyoujin\" because they are always acting like a comedy duo, always fighting. They're always bickering and clawing at each other. At one time Risa even punches Otani in the face. They don't hold back to include the height difference in the name calling. All this goes on for a while until Risa realises that she has fallen for Otani. But Otani is really dense, he doesn't really see her that way and thinks its just part of their usual comedy routine. The chase from here on out is a nice ride.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the humour from the show comes from the two main characters as they call each other names while making weird faces. This makes this show overflowing with energy as the voice actors have done a great job with the timing. This is complimented by the art style as the faces those two make while fighting are pretty weird-looking but at the same time, hilarious. The soundtrack keeps up with the energy of the show and I liked the first opening sequence. Also, the energetic openings are complimented by the subtle endings. The show really made me laugh hard at times, so even if you don't like the romance, I am sure this will leave you laughing your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike your usual boy meets girl, they both fall madly in love, there is a confession, the end ; its a nice chase here which doesn't end at the first confession as the girl gets rejected at first (it happens early on) but she doesn't give up till the end as there is little to no romantic response from the guy most of the time (he is THAT dense). Hell, the guy thought she was joking when she confessed the first time. This dense character of his really annoyed me at times and I wanted to punch him in the face. But all is forgotten when the story concludes itself as there isn't a sudden realisation of the love but it grows nice and slow.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a one of a kind love comedy show and I had a good time laughing my ass off at the comedy scenes all the while enjoying some cute moments as Risa tries to woo Otani. The show does not go deep into the \"feels\" side and I like that they kept it that way.\\n\r\nIt left its own little print in my heart.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Koizumi Risa. \u2018Nuff said.\r\nWhile she really is all the reason a person should need to go watch this show, I\u2019ll explain what more makes this one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I\u2019ve seen.\r\nWhen I sat down to watch (more like marathon)  Lovely Complex, I really wasn\u2019t expecting anything special; the beginning of the show even had me a tad worried as I could see it easily going in a clich\u00e9d direction. Thankfully, I was wrong (well, for the most part).\r\nAfter witnessing the explosive chemistry between Koizumi and Ootani, before there was even a flicker of romance between the two, any suspicion of thembeing clich\u00e9 was blown clear out of the water. Now, I won\u2019t say that their relationship developing further was unpredictable in itself- but that\u2019s not really the point. It\u2019s all about how the show brings these two together.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not your typical romance duo- anime or otherwise. Sure, the girl is taller than average and the guy is shorter, but those details take the backseat to these two\u2019s eccentricities and meteoric charm. As lovable as they are, Koizumi and Ootani still have more to them than their comical quirkiness; both have insecurities and show vulnerability throughout the show\u2019s progression. When things do get romantic, it\u2019s always tender and believable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as much as I do love this series, I\u2019d be lying if I said it was perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe criticisms worth mentioning are few, but still they are enough to make me feel that this show could have been markedly better. Really, it\u2019s just the matter of the side characters; even those that were there from the beginning don\u2019t get nearly as much fleshing out as Koizumi and Ootani. Aside from Nobu (ultimately I felt she was a fairly solid character), everyone else comes off pretty flat. When the show does focus on them, the drama that takes place feels terribly contrived.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are where the worst of the clich\u00e9s come in; childhood friend, foreigner, ex, neighbor girl, and coworker all essentially exist for the sole purpose of initiating jealousy/competition for the leading pair.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really shines where the focus has been all along- on Koizumi and Ootani. Enough time passes in the show that we get to see the two starting to figure out who they are and who they are to each other. With all the sensitivity and hilarity added on board to that roller coaster, Lovely Complex is a delight to watch. \\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while, you receive a recommendation from an anime you really enjoyed, and in the end wind up disappointed in the result. For those like me, this is one of those times. \r\nLovely\u2605Complex is an anime that, by all means, I expected to enjoy. To start out, we're shown the main two characters of the story, Risa and Ootani. The two are seen as a comedy duo y their classmates and teacher, as the tall Risa and short Ootani commonly quarrel for all to see. Throughout the series, romance develops, but an unexpected outcome occurs. \r\nUnfortunately, for Lovely\u2605Complex, this development is notnearly enough to save it from its flaws. While the premise of the situation is interesting, the rest of LoveCom's aspects fail to keep this same interest or actively detract from it. To start with, the comedy scenes, while occasionally worth a chuckle, are far from enough to keep my enjoyment of LoveCom afloat. Some moments of bickering between our two main characters seem repetitive, in a \"I've seen this exact scene before\" kind of way, and other jokes are stretched out for more than they're worth. \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters fail to fuel one's enjoyment of Lovely\u2605Complex, and at times can serve to actively detract from any enjoyment that may occur. For example, our main male lead, Ootani, often moves the term 'dense' into a whole new realm. Where the normal male lead may be comparable to your average lead brick in density, Ootani ups the ante to Osmium-levels. His voice could also be rather grating or annoying at times, which of course doesn't help to improve the image one would have of Ootani. The other characters only occasionally bring something to the table--they are in supporting roles, after all--and fail to make up for the main cast's ineptitude. \\n\\n\r\nLovely\u2605Complex also has a major problem with setting the mood for its more 'emotional' scenes, which often hit the viewer like being blindsided by an bag of bricks. Soon after a scene of comical interactions, the scenes meant to make you feel empathy or sympathy towards the lead character Risa appear...although without the music to cue the viewer in on the development, one may miss it. As such, these scenes never really instill the feeling they are, presumably, meant to, further degrading LovCom's marks.\\n\\n\r\n--Final Thoughts--\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I can say with certainty that Lovely\u2605Complex did not live up to the expectations the users of this site have presented it with. Even with its occasionally fun moment or two, LovCom was immensely disappointing ,and I can't say I'd recommend it...but to each their own, I suppose.",

            "content": "Lovely complex is mainly a romantic drama that takes itself quite seriously. The setting is that of a high school in which the main characters have to deal with typical adolescent issues mostly related to love: understanding and accepting their feelings and others', dealing with peer pressure, expressing their emotions, and becoming committed to their relationships. The comedic element is a second-class citizen, a natural byproduct of high schoolers not knowing how to express their feelings and how to react in more delicate situations.\r\nThe seriousness is pervasive from the first moment thanks to the character designs - high schoolers DO look like actual high schoolers:there's no oversexualization and no pink hair. I have to give big props to making characters truly look different without relying just on hairstyles and eye color. The backgrounds have just enough detail, generally using colors with mid to low saturation--what you'd call \"soft\" or \u201ctoned-down\u201d colors. There are very few lighting effects and the shading is very sublte making it so that there\u2019s nothing to distract from the characters' feelings and thoughts. Characters are slightly stylized and this makes for a great looking anime when it comes to the few fluid movements that get animated. It\u2019s a sad fact that the animation is rather clunky. The design however is refreshing compared to what I consider the overly-colorful (saturated), overly-detailed design used nowadays, Your Lie in April being an example of this. Detailed backgrounds with bright color palettes such as in shows like 5cm/sec or Garden of Words would be other examples so this trend is no news, it\u2019s just more frequent now.\\n\\n\r\nIts main problems come as a consequence of misusing characters. They\u2019re good in the sense that you can\u2019t just box them inside an archetype, they\u2019re all realistic and complex, but aside from the two main characters none get actually explored.  Although it\u2019s somewhat at the cost of the side characters, it\u2019s good that much of the exploration of the protagonists, Risa and Otani, is done through friends and teachers helping them fix their issues. It\u2019s a common romance anime mistake to shoehorn in explanations through exaggerated reactions, obtrusive self-talk or over-the-top visuals or story. Another issue is that for part of the duration Otani is so dense that he manages to keep the plot looping and breaks any suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nA nice plus that probably doesn't get noticed that much is the soundtrack. It's never in the foreground with its rather low volume and the more ambiental style, but one can tell many of the 35 tracks were specially created for dramatic timing of specific scenes. Very fitting, but not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the issues I have with LoveCom are related to the plot. The anime is slow to start, as we find Risa being rejected time and time again. Couple that with the fact that it will skip from Valentines to Christmas, New Year and Birthdays and you\u2019ll end up thinking each day is a holiday in which Risa is living the same nightmare. There are cases when repetition can be used as a trope, but in this case it will only make you care less and less, or simply get frustrated. If you look at it from a troll\u2019s perspective it\u2019s almost funny, but the anime presents it from the victim\u2019s perspective. If you bear through that you\u2019ll get to the best part. That\u2019s simlpy because it reaches great variety and a good pacing. In fact it goes through almost anything that can happen in a normal relationship.\\n\r\nHowever, when the focus suddenly switches to the side characters everything feels off. They were forgotten for too long . Adding to that comes the fact that their arcs are poorly dealt with: rushed and with awkward transitions. All this is on the background of college exams and choosing their path in life which manage to keep tension up so the anime ending gets to save face with a cathartic ending about the main characters and their life choices.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some storytelling issues such as the overuse of flashbacks in order to explain some of Risa\u2019s emotions. Most of the times the respective feelings are obvious anyway so the flashabacks duration becomes even more of a problem. Luckily they aren\u2019t used that often.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth it to mention what type of comedy LoveCom has. The jokes come as a byproduct of the characters\u2019 silly but believeabale personalities or in the form of a funny plot twist having a well timed comedic setup. This secondary role comedy gets makes it that if it doesn\u2019t hit the spot for you it won\u2019t take anything away from the value of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end you\u2019re left with a fine anime that repeats the same note before remembering the rest of the song. It\u2019s not a beautifully complex song but it\u2019s catchy and simple and it might just be that one song that makes you understand romance a bit better or at least reminds you of your funny teenage love experiences.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Spoilers. Lots and lots of spoilers.\r\nLovely Complex Review:\r\nThe story centers around Atsushi Otani and Koizumi Risa, two classmates and good friends who are renowned around the school as 'All-Hanshin Kyojin\" (or something like that) due to their constant arguing and bantering, and their circle of friends. Risa is tall for her age, while Otani is rather short for his. The show follows their last two years of high school, and ends with their foray into the world beyond it.\r\nThe animation is well, nothing to write home about. It's not bad and I've definitely seen a lot worse, but it's not up to the qualityof the likes of Toradora, Death Note, Naruto or other high end anime. It's good, but not amazing. As an aside, it rather reminded me of the early One Piece seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOne would think that is a bad thing, but it's really not. I think it works well with the style that lovecom goes for. Speaking of style, lovecom is distinctive for its animation, in that characters are often distorted/animated differently in ways regarding their emotions, conversations, etc for comedic effect. I'm not sure how to describe the technique, but all you need is to watch the first episode and you'll know what I mean. I think this style works well with the light show that is lovecom. However, others might not be of the same mind. If you see the first episode and don't like the style, then know that it doesn't change.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is rather light-hearted, in that there is no deeper source of conflict. No one dies, no one loses their house, no one's long lost thought-dead twin reappears to seek vengeance, or anything equally dramatic.\\n\r\nThe main plot for majority of the show revolved around Koizumi's attempts to win over Otani in a romantic way(more on this later).\\n\r\nSome might not like this, but to me it's what made the show. It's a romcom, and it does have drama, but nothing eye-rolling like anime tends to do. All drama that pops up is resolved realistically and quickly. All those 'if only he/she got to tell him/her just this one thing' don't happen, because characters on this show do the realistic thing and talk about what's relevant.\\n\\n\r\nAs an extension of the above, what really made this show great to me was how smoothly things went. Not in the 'easy' way. I mean that the two protagonists felt like real people, and while anime behavior can't really be avoided, I was pleasantly surprised by how realistically everyone acted. Nothing felt forced. I could see everyone thinking and acting like that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I liked Otani and Risa. They had real chemistry, and their (eventual) pairing did not feel forced. They had distinctive personalities, different yet similar in many ways and it is obvious how an attraction between them could (and did) develop.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the supporting cast was rather ... not quite bland. Forgettable? Not really given much development? Something along those lines.There is an argument to be made that shows some times take the supporting cast too far, but still, lovecom kind of fell flat there. It didn't bother me, since my interest lay firmly with Otani and Risa, but this could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I put firmly on the 'Pros' side of the argument, is how the whole plot was handled. To expand on what I mentioned earlier, early on in the show Risa realizes that she has feelings for Atsushi (who is always referred to as Otani by everyone, me included), and for the middle part of it tries to win him over, while the last part is with them as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is interesting because the two of them had been good friends already, and Otani is caught completely off-guard by her feelings. It's classic drama, yes, but I loved how it was handled. Otani just did not see Risa that way. For the longest time he could not transition her from 'best friend' to 'girlfriend' in his mind. It avoided most (if not all) of the cliche drama pitfalls and kept drama to a minimum, while still keeping the situation like that. The show remains positive and uplifting, even when it seems that Risa's efforts are in vain.\\n\r\nFor the amount of episodes where it seemed like Otani really could not see her that way, I enjoyed it a lot. Otani tried, he gave it a lot of thought, etc but he just could not see her that way. That's something that I honestly haven't seen before.\\n\r\nEventually and over the course of a year and a half (or so) Otani does come around to loving her, but the transition is slow and very well handled.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing was that almost no episode felt filler-ish. The balance of slice-of-life shows is delicate, but lovecom nailed it. Each episode had its own charm, and none were of the 'unique arc that will have no further impact once complete' kind. Each led into the next, and the show progressed at a decent pace.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, there were some points in the story that just outright did not work. The whole thing with the substitute teacher (whatshisface) comes to mind. That was simply a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the main negative is that while I enjoyed the show, there wasn't much impact to it. I mentioned previously that the lack of ridiculous drama was a positive. It is. Still, LoveCom never had me on the edge of my seat, never truly inspired strong emotion in me. Its realism, while refreshing, was a double edged sword. We watch the lives of two people over a period of two years, and by the end of it we are smiling, but there wasn't much that stuck out in such a way that I will remember it months/years from now.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: LoveCom is a light-hearted, refreshingly realistic romcom with a distinctive style that will probably be hit or miss with most. Very entertaining show, but not groundbreaking. I rate it 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of slice-of-life and/or romcoms, watch Lovely Complex.",

            "content": "I really, really, really loved LoveCom.\r\nIt was cute, insightful, hilarious and endearing.  It was my most anticipated episode every week.  I always wanted more.  I want more now even though I know it's over!\r\nThe story is about the tallest girl and the shortest boy in class and their search for love in high school.  It turns out they're both kooky, funny and energetic.  They're also perfect for each other... too bad they don't see that.  The story isn't complicated or new, but it was told so well that it crawled into right into that soft spot in my heart.\r\nTheromance is built slowly over time and by the end, you're head over heels for them because the creators did such a great job of laying down the foundation and actually showing you how their feelings grow over time.  It's not like a lot of shows where all of a sudden in a haze of fuzzy lighting and rose petals, love magically sprouts out of nowhere.  Instead, you see a friendship begin, a moment happens, interest blossoms, awareness grows... the whole nine yards.  You really get to know Koizumi and Otani over the course of the show and I was rooting like crazy for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so over the top and out of control that it's hard not to laugh.  They exaggerate, make ridiculous faces and they over-react to everything.  It's really kind of hammy, but that's part of the fun.  And it's refreshing to see a female lead who isn't some stereotype of a dominatrix-in-training or a weak, helpless nitwit.  She seems like a real human being with strong points and weak points.  She isn't afraid to get ugly and imperfect sometimes and I think it's really great that they made her (and, really, him too) full of all these flaws and not-so-attractive traits... and yet so completely charming and loveable.  It makes them really... human.  I would say that if you like the relationship (without the music and with a lot more actual focus on romance) of Nodame and Chiaki from Nodame Cantabile, you might like this too because there's a similarity in the way that the relationships go both ways and the strength that each of them brings to the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great too.  First of all, they took the time and effort to change the characters appearances day to day and give them all a sense of their own style, which I really appreciate.  It's just really thorough and well-executed.  I completely agree with YoshikoHatake, there is something about the style that brings Bokura Ga Ita to mind, even though the tone of the story is completely different (BGI felt a lot more serious and the colors and style reflect that somewhat, I think).  Music-wise, it's also nice.  I don't normally notice the openings and endings that much (I've always hated credits), but LoveCom's are really good in a perky, energetic kind of way, which suits the show perfectly, and I find myself singing along w/ the karaoke. ;)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! =)\\n\\n\r\nP.S.  I really haven't seen very many romances that do this good of a job at being funny and sweet and tender and honest.  If you have, I'd love suggestions!",

            "content": "At first glance you think this is one of those normal school romance, boy meets girl, girl meets boy, type anime. Well it\\'s not.\r\nIt\\'s a completely different take on the usual theory. A girl who towers over her crush, a boy who may be short and sees eye to eye with most other girls,  still gets fans.\r\nAs Risa realizes her love for him, ever so slowly, she finally admits to it, but not only is Otani short, but he is very dense, too dense.\r\nSo now, Risa tries all she can to get him to be her boyfriend.\r\nThe story is very unique, with many twistsand turns.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it follows the same line as most romances, it steers off course into new territory. This is where the height differences come in, and the super cute girl gets a demonic aura.  Not like most anime, right? And the dreamy boy she falls for is so dense, he thinks she was joking when she confesses, not at all like the usual.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for the characters has similarities to other anime. Some very discreet, some not.\\n\\n\r\nI notice there was some similarity in art to Bokura Ga Ita.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime\\'s art style follows the original character designs as the manga, with extra color and exuberance.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well as usual they picked the best seiyus to voice the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs are upbeat with great lyrics, while the ending songs, tones it down slowing down a bit, and giving it a bit more sweeter change to the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters even though their wardrobe changes through their daily lives, Risa\\'s hair does as well. (Which I noticed had similarities to Bokura Ga Ita\\'s Nana.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are developed as to go not so far into their past, but more along the lines to explain just what kind of person they are.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment, it\\'ll make you laugh, and if you have a soft spot for sad romantic scenes, it might make you cry. (Just kidding, nothing so far.) Or it\\'ll make you cry for laughing too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 10.\\n\\n\r\n-Yoshiko",

            "content": "Girl meets boy and girl likes boy. But girl is also half a foot taller than boy and thus, epic drama ensues!\r\nS T O R Y - I don't read/watch a lot of shoujo, but from the start, I figured it was a pretty basic plot and as a result, probably a pretty generic story. I was right -- it's a lot of what you would typically expect from shoujo: lots of silly romantic drama, lots of hilarious shenanigans, and the your handful of cute, fluffy moments scattered throughout that always feel like an shot of diabetic sweetness straight to your black, black heart. Andit was wonderfully done for the most part. As predictable as the overarching story can be, it was still very engaging and fun to watch. The slice of life approach makes the episode-to-episode drama slightly less obvious, and I really loved that time actually moves throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose time progression would logically be more common in slice of life and shoujo series, but since I don't dabble into the genre much, it was very refreshing for me to experience. The series begins as the characters start high school and ends neatly as they graduate. Time moves at a pretty fixed pace, so there's no awkwardness in transitions. I was also really happy to see the beginning, creation, and progression of a relationship -- the series doesn't just end when they get together (I refuse to count that as a spoiler; I mean, c'mon. Did you ever have any doubts?), it keeps going and explores some of their problems and potential future. All in all, it's wrapped up pretty nicely. The story, while fairly generic, is solid, well told, and just silly and fun. The pacing is steady, and though things do feel like they're being dragged along occasionally, the feeling never lasts long. It's a good thing to watch after a shitty day. I'm actually really sad it's over for that very reason.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R - Risa Koizumi is a very dramatic girl. It's fun at first; after a while it got a little tiring. But then I came to realize that wait. Girls really ARE like this! They ARE overdramatic and hysterical and crazy and thoroughly ridiculous. After realizing that amazing truth, I didn't mind so much anymore. Risa is just a girl. And that's how they are. Honestly, I can't call her unrealistic in good conscience because everything she does, every over-the-top reaction she has, I can imagine someone I know in real life doing the same. Considering that, I think Risa's actually a pretty damn well done character. She's very sympathetic and easy to relate to, even when she's crying for the fifth time in five episodes. And she grows -- her feelings for Otani evolve and mature a lot throughout the series, and through you're constantly reminded of this progression through three-second flashbacks, it is something that's nice to look back on.\\n\\n\r\nAtsushi Otani is an idiot. It's fun at first; after a while, it gets a little frustrating. But then I came to realize that wait! Boys really ARE like this! They're retarded and stupid and dense and miss all the obvious signs and are super awkward when they do finally get it! Amazing. Once again, I found Otani's depiction to be hilariously accurate on many levels. He does tend to be much less dramatic than Risa, but that's not surprising considering the male stereotype and the fact that his point of view isn't focused on as much until the second half of the series. Though both Risa's and Otani's feelings are undoubtedly romanticized greatly, I found the slower development of Otani's feelings a lot more interesting -- you know what's going to happen, but watching everything unfold is still interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of friends do a great job of contrasting their lovey-dovey relationships with the irregular, often immature, and haphazard relationship of our protagonists. This makes them all noticeably idealized to the point where they're more roles than in-depth characters, but I guess that's all they really needed to be. Seiko and Haruka were fun gimmicks as well. Still, Nobuko was a pretty convincing best friend for Risa, likely because she had the most screentime of the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\n A R T S T Y L E  &  A N I M A T I O N - The animation and art jump around a lot in this series, so there's a bit of bad and a bit of good. The opening and end themes had a lot of fun variation to them, though all seemed pretty typical of shoujo, especially in the sense that they played around with the characters' fashion and style a lot. In the episodes themselves, the characters jumped back and forth from a pretty lazy and generic style to a really hilarious caricature style to a super, sparkle-filled, shiny, pretty shoujo style. The first of those three was the most common and got annoying sometimes because there would be strange discrepancies in how certain things (people, buildings, objects) look and I noticed some variations in height differences and proportions, especially for Risa whose lanky shape stands out a lot when the proportions change. The second was really amusing, especially since many of the SD faces are uniquely and hilariously grotesque and the characters don't hesitate to point this out themselves. The final style naturally showed up in all the super romanticized and climatic scenes -- its those scenes they saved their animation budget on, I'm sure -- making everything that much sweeter. It's predictable, but hey, it's gorgeous and cute and it works, dammit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'm sure is pretty common in shoujo, but that I appreciated all the same, was the fact that fashions changed from scene to scene, episode to episode. I loved that characters changed their clothes every day and had a lot of seasonal fashions; they would also be scene shopping occasionally and the clothes they buy would show up later, etc. I also loved that Risa's hair was constantly changing -- sometimes it coincided with her mood and emotions; sometimes it coincided with events or the weather; sometimes it was just different. It's not that big a deal, really, but it makes the characters that much more real and easier to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love\u2605Com's animation is just average, but it's good enough and the style definitely suits the series.\\n\\n\r\nM U S I C - The first time I heard the first opening theme, \"Kimi + Boku = Love?\" by Tegomass, it confirmed all the stereotypical expectations I had for the series. It's upbeat and cheerful-hopeful, the vocalist's voice has an endearing, dorky quality to it, and the even the name of the song is corny as hell. It felt very right. End themes are generally slower, more somber, and more thoughtful compared to opening themes, and the first end theme, also by Tegomass, was no different. It kind of struck me how different the vocalist sounded. It also felt very right, and both songs really grew on me during the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, the second pair of themes for the series are even better! I absolutely adore how the second opening, \"Hey! Say!\" by Hey!Say! 7 starts. In conjunction with the colorful animation sequence, it suits the series perfectly. It's the kind of music that I imagine Risa and Otani would listen to in addition to Umibouzu, and the lyrics are adorable. The same can be said for the second end theme, \"BON BON,\" also by Hey!Say! 7 -- it's much more upbeat than the first end theme (though still reasonably thoughtful and kind of reminiscent) and once again, just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nLove\u2605Com also surprised me by having a really nice general soundtrack. The theme that played for all of the more depressing scenes was especially pretty and sweet to listen to. For other series of Love\u2605Com's technical quality, I usually don't notice the soundtracks because they're generic and bland, so it's definitely worth noting that the music in this actually stood out. It's one of those soundtracks I wouldn't mind listening to outside of watching the actual series.\\n\\n\r\nV O I C E   A C T I N G - If you actually know Japanese or if you are just a gigantic dork, you might notice that pretty much all of the characters in this series speak in a Kansai dialect, which makes sense since the story takes place in Osaka. I found this pretty awesome because while a lot of series will have one or two characters that speak in the dialect, few have the full cast speaking in it. The last time I heard so many \"aho\"s instead of \"baka\" was in BECK. It's really interesting and neat to hear because even if you don't understand the language that well or realize that it's a different dialect, if you've seen a lot of subbed anime, you'll be able to pick up on slight changes in pronunciation and vocabulary (the most obvious things that I caught were \"na\" instead of \"ne\" and \"chau\" instead of \"chigau\"). For Risa, I also found her pronunciation of \"Otani\" to be occasionally distracting because she stresses the \"o\" a lot more than I would normally expect.\\n\\n\r\nOther than fun dialect stuff, the voices themselves were pretty average. Risa's isn't that memorable, but it works well enough for her role. I was more impressed by Otani's voice because I found that he had a wider range of emotions and a much more recognizable tone overall -- his voice has a really unique inflection when he's upset or surprised, but it's also very charming when he's being serious. Other notable roles: Nakao was surprisingly soft-spoken, which goes great with his character, but was still surprising to hear because few people ever speak that quietly. Seiko's voice was obnoxiously high-pitched, which also went great with his/her character, but it also made me really glad s/he wasn't in too many scenes...\\n\\n\r\nO V E R A L L - Lovely Complex was a much more enjoyable series than I thought it would be, but I'm always happy to see cliches work out. It's very true -- there are no original ideas left, so all there is to do is write good stories. They don't need to be original stories, just good stories, solid stories, fun stories. Lovely Complex fullfills all of above, so even though you know they're going to live happily ever after, you can still enjoy watching it for what it is. As I mentioned earlier, I watched episodes of Love\u2605Com at the end of bad days. They're a shot of sugar and laughs, straight to the vein: adorably effective. Now I need to find another drug.",

            "content": "I'm actually quite surprised to think that this will be the first negative review of Lovely Complex on MAL. Every single review I read gives this show a 7 or higher, which I think is outrageous. I really have a lot of bad things to say about this show but I'll warn you if it gets too spoiler-laden. Here starts the review.\r\nSTORY- 2 (Dreadful)\r\n  Lovely Complex is about two high school kids, Risa and Otani. They are a comedy duo because whever they're together they fight, argue, make fun of each other, and cause a scene, which makes bystanders laugh. Risa is taller thanmost guys and that's a problem for her because she's desperately searching for a boyfriend. Otani is sort of a dumb jock/trouble maker. He's shorter than almost all the girls and he's also self-conscious about it. So two people with height complexes.\\n\r\n  Well the first 5 or so episodes of this are just filler-type comedy episodes which is pretty nice. Then Risa starts to like Otani for who knows what reason. He picks on her, argues with her, but the creators expect us to believe they're a match made in heaven because they both like this one rap group, Umibouzu. \\n\r\n  For the next handful of episodes Risa tries to confess her love to Otani but Otani is just SO DENSE he thinks it's a joke when she confesses to him. This is where the show takes a nose-dive in quality. Lovely Complex starts going in circles. Something along the lines of this: Risa confesses, Otani rejects her, Risa cries, Risa beats him up. Risa stops crying and says she gives up on Otani, but then Otani does something Risa finds sweet, so Risa cries, and beats him up. She says she's going to keep loving Otani. Does it sound stupid? Yes it does! It's very long-winded, it goes in circles, Risa must've cried 30 times in this show. The show also shifts from comedy to drama around this point. You may or may not like this, depending on your preference, but you sure as hell don't want to see Risa cry again. Episodes 1-5 were okay, but around episode 6 it was a steady decline to the awful, unbearable, disgusting episodes 8-12. The show became a chore to watch because everytime I finished an episode I was so frustrated, and multiple times I logged into MAL and almost clicked \"Dropped\". I couldn't bring myself to do it. I would have rather never laid eyes on Lovely Complex then drop it at 12 episodes. I will explain why later in this review.\\n\r\n  Episodes 13 on were watchable to my relief. Not as good as the first five but no where near as awful as 8-12. There is still the cycle of crying, beatings, motivations and what not, but their romance progresses slightly and new characters are added to the mix (which I will talk about later). I'm not going to dwell on the story any longer since I will spoil it for you.\\n\r\n  So you may be asking, looks like you hated the plot...why not give it a 1? 1 is what Lovely Complex would be if it weren't for some great moments later in the series that just made me go \"Awwwwwwwwww :3\". They weren't anything worthy of bringing my score up past 5 but they were cute sweet shojo moments, and I was happy Lovely Complex included them. But the story is still a horribly low 2, and that's fair. The last episode, though I won't spoil it for you, is horribly contrived and way too unrealistic and convenient for the main characters. \\n\r\n  All in all, Lovely Complex's story is a frustrating, long-winded, tedious, and boring one with not enough good humour for a romantic comedy. All of it is slapstick which isn't even funny. Risa kicks Otani probably as much as she cries her eyes out. It's a crappy story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 1 (Pathetic!)\\n\r\n  Characters are unlikable and underdeveloped. The main characters...okay let's discuss them. Risa, awful as stated before. No redeeming qualities, just an all around annoying person. Otani, he's probably the best in the whole show, and that's actually sad. He's underdeveloped, stereotypical and dense. Side characters...well the main one here in Nobu-chan who is Risa's best friend and side kick. She's alright, nothing really irked me about her. She had no personality, she just loved her boyfriend and provided motivation and chances for Risa to meet alone with Otani. She wasn't awful but nothing was good about her. I'm not even going to talk about her boyfriend he's so underdeveloped and useless to the story. \\n\r\n  Also on the topic of side characters, Chiharu was friends with Risa in the beginning but never mentioned past the first episode. She's just a shy girl. \\n\r\n  The biggest problem, bigger than the character's being flat, is that they weren't put to good use. These names may mean nothing to people who haven't seen the show, but to those of you who have, Maity-sensei, Haruka, that blonde transvestite, Mimi, the red and black haired kid, and Otani's ex-girlfriend recieved no character developement and were brought into the series only to be forgotten. Ok, Mimi, red head kid, and Otani's ex weren't that important to the story, but all the other side characters were! Haruka most particularly, had brought a bunch of drama in the series and created tension between Risa and Otani in the beginning, only to be forgotten and useless to the plot, and never developed. He could've had a story arc about him but the creators didn't choose to go that route which was dissapointing. In the end, no side characters got any actual closure. \\n\r\n  Character in this show is pathetic, Risa is the worst mainly because she cries too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 5 (Meh.)\\n\r\nThe \"sad moment\" music just made the scenes too melodramatic. The \"happy, funny moment\" music did it's job and fit in well with the scenes. The \"good moment\" music (ie, when something romantic happens between Risa and Otani) is probably the best. It makes the seens just that much sweeter and it puts a smile on my face. The OPs and EDs were forgettable and just not special. That's all I reall have to say.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8 (Nothing to complain about here)\\n\r\nThe art I actually quite liked. The character designs were nice, the colour palette was bright and colourful, sometimes Risa's fish-face bothered me but overall I liked the art in Lovely Complex. It was nice to look at, I would probably call it unique but from what pictures I've seen from Kimi ni Todoke and Bokura ga Ita, the art is all the same. But still, it's good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 2\\n\r\nHad some sweet moments but in the end this frustrating tedious mess of a romantic \"comedy\" made me want to bang my head against the wall and had little to no redeeming values. A MAJOR dissapointment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 3\\n\r\nLovely Complex was a terrible, horrible, nauseating show that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Unless you have a strong fetish for slapstick humour, you won't be able to sit through half of this. Anybody who actually enjoyed this has a remarkably high pain tolerance.\\n\\n\r\n(Jokes)\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, it's a bad show.",

Risa, the main character, is an girl who is taller than the average girl. She wants an boy that's longer than her, but then something happens. She and Otani, a very short boy from her class, are often being laughed at, because they look and act like an popular comedy duo. Although the fact they're being laughed at and are bickering all the time, their friendships start to grow and Risa even starts to like Otani. From here on the story has a lotof twists and turns, even untill the end, which makes it very interesting!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice. It has it own style and is different than most of the anime. The characters wear different time of clothing and have an other hairstyle. The art is more focused on the girls than on the boys: the guys aren't really handsome or whatever, not something you see a lot in shoujo! An other visual part are how the emotions are showed. They're typical, but also 'a bit' exaggerated. It doesn't annoy me, instead it makes me laugh! It makes it very funny and that's a part of the power of Lovecom.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was something that perfectly matched the anime. Once you know the translation of it, you're going to love it. When I first heard the OP and EN I didn't enjoyed it that much, but now I'm totally in love with it! Later on the OP and the EN change... I loved them at once!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just so human! You could have the feeling that you're one of the characters, there's nothing extra-ordinary or something about them, like that they're actually an alien or something. No, the characters are human and that's why you can feel sorry for a person when he or she is crying and sympathize with them. It makes the whole story only more interesting~!\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really enjoyed this anime. The love, joy, sadness, funny parts, dreams that come true, dreams that scatter, it is all part of it and that's what it made me totally addicted to LoveCom.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it deserves an big 9~! Just watch and see this amusing anime!",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romantic, Comedy about an odd couple; tall girl Risa Koizumi and short guy Atsushi Ootani. It is near impossible to sit through this series straight-faced, as it is full of drama and lots of laughs. XD\r\nVideo Alternative ^_^\r\nThe story proved to be both entertaining and heart-warming at the same time. One thing I personally didn&rsquo;t like about the story and other may have a problem with, was the time-scale. Throughout series, everything seemed to move so fast that it was even skipping from season to season in a single episode. But that is also a great thingas the series would have wasted a lot of time otherwise. The romance part of this Rom/Com was done incredibly well, because it thoroughly went through Risa&rsquo;s constant struggle. There were quite a lot of unexpected developments as well that easily overshadowed all the cliches. Putting the romantic aspect aside, the comedy was great with some hilarious use of slapstick comedy, mostly brought on by the comedy duo (Risa x Atsushi).\\n\\n\r\nWith the story completely revolving around Risa and Atsushi, the pair needed to be great for it to be interesting and that is exactly what they were. Not only is it delightful to watch them constantly argue with each other but also the drama and tension between them was portrayed so well that you&rsquo;ll have to be heartless to not feel anything. Well of course there were other characters, but after the first couple episodes they barely played any major part in the story and were there just for jokes or to meddle with the comedy duo.  \\n\\n\r\nThe style of animation really suits the comical manner of this anime, as it can look incredibly crude half the time to go with the various jokes. But then it can look somewhat striking when it needs to. The music is just a bunch of basic melodies to go with every situation although it does drop in a few really good tunes for the dramatic moments. The OP and ED themes aren&rsquo;t amazing, nonetheless that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t go well with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an amazing Rom/Com that is able to mix the Romance and the Comedy so well, so that neither seems overbearing. Even though the relationship was always &ldquo;two steps forward, one step back&rdquo; it never really felt dragged out. The one issue was the excessive amount of flashbacks, which sometimes got really repetitive but it never ruined the overall enjoyable feeling of the series. Even though it is a Shoujo anime, I&rsquo;m a guy who hugely enjoyed this series and it&rsquo;s definitely worth any Rom/Com fan&rsquo;s time.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Definitely not typical shoujo anime\r\nIf you looked for the meaning of \"Romantic Comedy\" in the dictionary (or maybe even Wikipedia), you'd probably see \"Lovely Complex\" written in its definition. Okay, maybe not, but somebody should put it there!\r\nAs much as I love shoujo manga and anime, I do get tired of it sometimes because most shoujo follow the same formula. Such is not the case for Lovely Complex. I think Lovely Complex is the true embodiment of the romantic comedy genre. A love match between a tall girl and a short guy is like the perfect recipe for a romanticcomedy. Not only that, it's also heartwarming, but funny at the same time. That is what makes it so refreshing. I don't think I laughed and cried for a shoujo anime as much as I did for Lovely Complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2 main characters are different from the usual shoujo protagonists as well. You have Koizumi Risa, taller than the average girl, slightly tomboyish and awkward. There's also Otani Atsushi, shorter than the average guy, insecure, and kind. Together they also deviate from the usual shoujo anime/manga couples. When they officially become a couple (not really a spoiler because it's obvious they'll get together XD), it's evident that Risa is more dominant than Otani.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't like Lovely Complex right away because I wasn't used to hearing so many characters speak in Osakan accents. The moment I heard one of them speak, I thought to myself &quot;Obviously Osakan&quot;. Not that I have anything against Osakans, but at times, it sounded as if they were speaking in Chinese and couldn't understand what they were saying (I have the habit of translating in my head even while reading the subs). I'm still iffy about the accents, but then I realize that the Osakan accents really work well for Koizumi and Otani's personalities - loud. Very loud.\\n\\n\r\nI like the character designs - Again, not typical shoujo anime/manga designs in which characters are usually bishie-fied. The characters look cute and their clothes are always so trendy. The only typical element you'd find in the character design is the out of proportion bodies, but in a different way. Sometimes Risa does look boyish because she doesn't have a figure, but I guess her look matches her personality. I also like the colors, consisting mostly of yellow-orange tones. The colors made the visuals of Lovely Complex really attractive, cute and current.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the first set of OP and ED themes at first, because I thought that kind of music was kind of corny and for older fans. Just when I was starting to like both songs, they replaced the OP and ED themes with Hey! Say! 7 songs (around episode 13), and I'm really glad they did. The latter set of songs is more current and trendy as they should be, because the anime itself is current and trendy. I especially like &quot;BON BON&quot; by Hey! Say! 7, the second ED. I think it's a really sweet and cute song.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I picked Lovely Complex when I was looking for a new shoujo anime to watch. It turned out to be one of the best series (in general) I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to all anime fans, whether you like shoujo or not.",

            "content": "A romance-comedy with a Kansai twist.\r\nI was a bit late getting onto the Lovely Complex or LoveCom bandwagon but once on board I was there till the end! LoveCom had me laughing, crying while my heart trided to leap out of my chest. It was well balanced in light and heavy scenarios, high in good anime-nutritions, a must-see for the anime-fan diet! One I devoured in two days! (All 24 eps).\r\nStory:\r\nEvery manga-ka tries to find their niche market. What do the romance-comedy fans want next? Dramatic pasts with dead characters? Forbidden loves? Deaths? Mahou-shoujo?\r\nThere are millions of romance-comedy manga and anime out there that arebased off cer-ray-zeh ideas however, it does not make them worth while, nor more interesting. However, all my kudos goes to the original Manga-Kas, Nakahara and Aya, for using the simple idea of height complexes and creating one of the worlds best romance-comedies ever! In short, the LoveCom story is simple, sweet but one of the best ideas out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art seems very simple at first glance but it is most effective. Not only does the style translate from the manga perfectly but it amazingly portrays the unique kansai humor that makes up half of LoveCom. It also well portrays the characters types which are so important in this anime about characters who have porblems with themselves. From the adorable Seiko to the tall (but model like) Risa.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nCould've done with some work. Personally I really didn't like the opening and ending themes although they did match the anime perfectly. Also, Seiko's voice was starting to make my ears bleed after five minutes. However, Risa and Otani's voice's were perfect and the background music for those heavy emotional scenes (mostly bad ones) was very effective.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis anime is built on the characters it portrays. The mix of strange and fairly normal teens (plus two teachers and some strange parents) is very effective. Each character bounces off another as they help one and other grow. Ofcourse, LoveCom is about love and complexes, and so every character doesn't go without their own little slice of problems and it's these that fuel the anime along, and these we grow to love.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI must say, while I tend to greatly enjoy romance of anysort (and the love-love in this anime stopped my heart a few times) the unique Kansai region humor really did me in. Word unique to Kansai (and Osaka) like 'Aho' rahter than 'Baka' made this anime stand out, and the comedy-duo acts, in the style of japanese comedy was something new and amazing to experience, even in animation! It is so difference to western humor (much like how british humor is generally different to american) and it kept me smiling all the way!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as you may be able to tell (10/10!!) I enjoyed this anime greatly, and so should many others. It reaches many aspects of life; love, self counsiousness, moving on and being true to what you feel. LoveCom is a romance-comedy for all anime fans. What are you waiting for? The All Hashin Kyojin are preforming just for you!",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is truly a great series. Every episode, regardless of what is happening, is enjoyable and leaves you wanting to watch the next one. \r\nThe storyline isn't anything crazy or off the wall, but it is executed to near perfection and contains a lot of really good plot turns and twists. Complimenting the story, and enhancing it, is a lot of very funny comedy. A good story makes you want more, and in that regard, this does exactly that. \r\nThe artwork and animation is good, although at times it can be inconsistent. But what is most important is that the scenes that are madeto be remembered, look stunning.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, there are some very good background pieces that come up throughout the series. Of the two OP's and two ED's, I really only like the first ones. The OP and ED of the second half of the series were pretty mediocre to me, although they have both grown on me a little bit. The voice acting was what really took the cake; all of the voices were well done, with the voice actors of Otani and Risa really doing an excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really made this series so good. There is not a single character that I feel doesn't fit into the series, but again, Otani and Risa just steal the show. Their friends also have good characters, but aren't paid as much attention as the two mains. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an incredibly enjoyable anime. You come to live and die with the characters, and really feel what they feel. Lovely Complex has some of the most perfectly executed moments that I have seen, where the stars just seem to align and make a scene that forces your jaw to drop and your heart to pound.",

            "content": "Can't wait for the hate for this one.\r\nAt the start of watching Lovely Complex, I was certain that I was going to love this show, being a fan of shoujo romance. I can't say that I dislike it, but rather I was heavily dissapointed by it. \r\nThroughout the first half, I really enjoyed what it brought to the table. The start was a little rough, but it was a nice twist to an unoriginal genre (I say this way too much with romance anime, but so be it). Otani and Risa are a pairing that are so much fun to watch. The back and forthbetween them was well handled early on. Not only that, but it did extremely well with the themes of unrequited love and beauty is only skin deep.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, as the anime trotted along, I realized that this was the ONLY thing it did. It kept beating the theme of unrequited love so much that it lost a lot of it's impact. There wasn't a lot of anything else that the characters talked about other than Otani and Risa's relationship until the very end of the series. The saying goes that variety is the spice of life, and the lack of this in Lovely Complex grated on my patience.\\n\\n\r\nThis also bears a problem when talking about side characters. The four best friends of Otani and Risa (aside from Nobu who I will get to in a minute) have barely anything to them. They are left sidelined till the last couple episodes, just so the anime could say that they developed them. Hell, the one defining character trait of Chiharu established in episode one, which was she feared men, was not brought back up until episode the second to last episode.\\n\\n\r\nNobu is the only other character besides the main leads that gets much screen-time at all. All her character is is her yelling at either Otani or Risa to  either do something about their relationship, or yelling at them because they did something wrong. I didn't dislike her character, but I just felt I should mention how one note she felt for the majority of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the side characters, most of them are just plot devices to cause tension between Otani and Risa. \\n\\n\r\nOtani and Risa themselves, while frustrating at times, were the best part of the series. Risa is a girl who tries very hard to achieve her goals. Even though she cries a lot, which did get annoying sometimes, it was hard not to get behind her whenever she fails or succeeds. I also liked how Otani dealt with the whole unrequited love thing. I won't spoil it, but he handled it in a way that was frustrating but very believable, which I appreciated a great deal. They aren't the best couple I've seen, as they suffered a lot from the lack of buildup of their relationship due to the stretched out nature of the middle section of the show, but they were an extremely fun couple, for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was not fantastic. While I liked the colour palette they used, and the character designs were well done, and my god the facial expressions were amazing, but it still felt a little flat to me. The animation was stiff as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was extremely memorable. Normally romance soundtracks don't have much of an impact on me, but there were a few songs in this one that were fantastically put together. Some stand outs would be World's End, Risa, DUNK SHOOT, Deep Past, and Theme of LoveCom. Complex is also noteworthy, but only because the first 18 seconds are more or less a complete copy of the chorus of The Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby\". Seriously, go listen to them both.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also memorable in how everyone has a kansai dialect. The voices of Risa and Otani are very good as far as I'm concerned. There were technically some bad voice actors here and there, Chiharu and Suzuki for example, but there voices were so different that I loved their voices regardless.\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex is a show that seems to focus on very specific things, which ended up hurting many other aspects of the show that could of been interesting. And while yes, these things that were so heavily focused on were well done, I was spoon fed so much of the same thing that it left me grasping for something else. It doesn't help when all your characters talk about is Otani and Risa's love life, and basically nothing else until the very end of the series, and that the drama felt very forced, especially towards the end. That being said, the end did leave off on strong note, with everything wrapping up very nicely, even if the drama was forced. Overall, Lovely Complex was a fun show to watch, with some great cutesy moments and comedy moments, but it isn't a show I would highly recommend. Of course, I think I'm in the minority here, so if you watch it and end up loving it, more power to you.",

            "content": "Lovely\u2605Complex is centered around our main character and tallest girl in her class, Koizumi Risa, and the shortest boy in the class, Otani Atsushi. The anime explores their relationship, from classmates to friends to maybe even lovers.\r\nThe premise of the anime is fantastic. Both our deuteragonists have a case of height complexes (hence the name) and struggle to overcome this. In the beginning, there is a mutual dislike for each other, as Risa and Otani are laughed at because of their reputation as the class' \"comedy duo\". As time progresses, however, Koizumi begins to like Otani, as a friend (and later, a crush), and acceptsthe fact that he's shorter than her. But to Otani, Risa is just the other half of their comedy duo, and no more than a friend. This unrequited love is what drives the whole story and plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple and predictable, yet the way it was executed made it interesting. There are some times where the plot doesn't flow as well, but all the episodes have use and further move the plot along. There are other times where the plot feels like it's looping, or taking \"one step forward, two steps back\", especially with romantic progression. Overall, a solid plot that does get a nice ending and ties many loose ends. However, the conflicts presented in the show heavily rely on the use of many love triangles, and most of the love rivals do not provide any doubt to the watcher as to whether the main advertised romance might not succeed , something that a well-written love rival should. Love triangles, when properly used, can bring the plot forward, but some of these love triangles did not drive the plot at all. The pace of the plot was in general, pretty fast-paced, but it's not rushed, and it received some slower progression as the plot began to unfold and broaden. The emotions that Love\u2605Com tries to evoke are a hit-and-miss: sometimes it works to an astonishing degree, allowing the watcher to sympathize with the characters, and other times, it may feel a little cumbersome or it has a delayed effect. The plot is probably the main reason why this anime, for me at least, did not have much of an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and funny, but the complexity of side characters are what I feel is the most lacking in this anime. Our protagonist, Koizumi Risa, is an exception: she's one of the most developed characters in the show. She is funny, dramatic, sarcastic, sometimes pathetic, determined yet wavered at times, charismatic, and nice. Her kindness, which is mentioned many times by her friends, tends to be overshadowed by her other personality traits, though. Her defining trait is her determination in seeking a relationship with Otani, even with all the obstacles thrown at her and all the times she nearly gave up. However, she loses sight of her goal countless times, to the point that it's hard to classify her as always determined; rather, it's like she has periods of absolute motivation and periods where she loses all hope. We get to see her go through a range of emotions, which is well portrayed in the anime. She can be over-the-top sometimes, dramatically pathetic, and an absolute idiot, but she's relatable, with realistic flaws and virtues, and that's what I think is the selling feature of hers.\\n\\n\r\nOtani is dense, sarcastic, humorous, and idiotic. He has a hard time sorting out his feelings, and doesn't like to talk about them either, therefore his feelings, if any, towards Risa, is definitely more toned-down than that of Risa's toward Otani. He constantly gives Risa hope (referring to their relationship progression) but then snatches that hope away from her, which tires her to no end. As dense and unaware of his actions as he is, many of the lines he has does have a profound effect on Risa. In short, a character with a few interesting quirks, and not at all typical.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with so much of our focus on the main characters and their love, the side characters do not receive enough attention. Most of them are two-dimensional characters that rely on one or two traits to define them. They don't have much of an impact on plot, but then again, I guess the point of Love\u2605Com is to mostly display interactions between the deuteragonists, but I would like for more depth in personality for the sides, to promote that yes, the side characters are equally as important as the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't as much character development in Love\u2605Com, because of the focus on romantic development and friendship development, but for this anime, that is exactly what makes it enjoyable. Of course, I would've liked to see some, but the anime as it is now can do without. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is spot on and greatly enjoyable. For an anime classified as a comedy, this is exactly what I'd expect: sad or tense moments followed by a comedic one to relieve the tension. Lines are perfectly executed to bring laughter to the one watching. This anime does a wonderful job at playing with the watcher's emotions. Love\u2605Com is guaranteed to make you happier after a bad day. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the romance. It develops bit by bit, and we clearly see the stages of love here. The romance part of the story is unique and lovely, but it could have been better approached. The side characters tend to bash Otani for not liking Risa, something I find a little unfair. Along with the countless love triangles as the main strain on Risa and Otani's relationship, this degrades the whole complexity of the romance by a fair bit. The romance grows with the few internal conflicts (such as Otani not being able to see Risa as anything but a friend, no matter how hard he tried) and external conflicts, but suffers under the majority of others. In general, a promising romance that, on the whole, is very satisfying and unique, but lacking in a few small areas. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music suits the anime well. There are the upbeat and cheerful songs, perfectly tuned in with the anime's overall atmosphere and inner message of hope, and then there's the sad, depressing songs played during disappointing moments. There is a good variety in song themes and it's effective, but the Love\u2605Com OST isn't as noteworthy in particular. The openings and endings of the anime aren't as memorable, with the openings being overly cheerful and peppy and the endings being more thoughtful and slow, but I do admit they also complement the anime. The voice actors are decently matched with their respective characters, especially for the main characters, who have a tendency to be expressive and loud. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is satisfying, but it's not special or exceptional. It works well with the characters, and fit their different personalities. Risa is a character that changes her hairstyle often, showing her personality and sense of style. The characters encompass a broad range of emotions, and the art does nicely in the portrayal of them, whether it's sadness, anger, or just Risa being plain exaggerative. Light colors are often used, nothing too dark, which goes along with the fact that Lovely\u2605Complex is a light-hearted anime, without any terribly dark conflicts or themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Love\u2605Com is definitely worth the consideration, for its entertaining comedy, relatable main characters, and the romance. It's lovely, all right ... just not as complex. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (7) ART: (7) SOUND: (8) CHARACTER: (8) ENJOYMENT: (8) \u2605OVERALL\u2605 (7) Feedback, con-crit, and suggestions to improve this review is welcome!\\n",

            "content": "I initially reviewed this piece after watching it only once, but since then, I have seen the series three times and decided to give this a complete and thorough review.  I personally enjoy a systematic review that rates each category and explains why, but this first chunk is going to be just my thoughts on the anime as a whole.  If you want to see my ratings for each category and why, continue reading at the bottom to see it (or if you'd just rather see scores for each category, then skip to the bottom after the lines of asterisks).\r\n****************************************************************  \r\nThere aretimes when the telling of a tale becomes more than just a story - it becomes a masterpiece, forever to be treasured and remembered.  Everything seems to just work, from the overarching plot-line, down to the background character cast and everything in between, the epic masterpieces move, change and impact in powerful ways.  Lovely Complex is an anime that makes its mark as a potential to be one of these phenomenal works.\\n\\n\r\nImmediately, this anime begins by setting up the story; a guy and girl who are both very self-conscious about their heights who desperately reach out for some kind of relationship.  It becomes apparent almost immediately, though, that these two are nearly perfect for each other.  But, of course, they can't begin to see each other as a candidate for a relationship.  So the two decide to cheer each other on and help one another.  Within just a few episodes, Koizumi (the girl) begins to develop feelings for Otani.  Now beyond that is where the actual excitement and enjoyment of the story come into play.  Frequently, you will find yourself laughing (extremely hard at times) at the plethora of jokes, but almost as often finding yourself near tears or frowning at that touching emotional scene.  Very few stories have the capability to balance both comedy and drama ON TOP OF a romance plot.  But not only does Lovely Complex do just that, it's touching, the comedy is genuinely hysterical and the romance is real.  There's none of that \"lucky\" guy who's surrounded by lots of girls who adore him.  None of that \"hotter-than-the-sun\" kind of girl who compels some guy to chase after her.  What you get here is a realistic presentation of a developing relationship out of a friendship.  One that is easy to relate to, fun to watch and cheer on, and will leave you with a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they only work to enhance and improve upon the wonders of the story and characters.  Tense scenes seem to always have the perfect music playing.  Touching scenes have that beautiful, heart-tugging melody playing quietly in the background.  Throughout the 24 episodes, a common rag-time kind of theme is played that becomes very catchy and enjoyable - it seems to capture the nature of the characters and their struggles. \\n\r\nArt, while being rather unique, is fairly detailed and clearly defines what is being presented.  Often times, expressions are exaggerated (quite comically, I might add), and some scenes are taken over by \"floating flowers\" or \"swirling angry purple haze\" effects.  While these may be distracting at times, they lend to improve the mood and feeling of each scene they appear.  (Think lots of XD expressions going on).  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Lovely Complex is both a touching and hilarious storyline that is definitely worth checking out. After 3 times watching through this show, I still laugh and cry, ending up with a feeling that I don't really get from any other anime I've watched (or re-watch).  The ending seems to tie up a perfect package with an even more beautiful bow.  Who knows?  Perhaps LoveCom will ease its way into your heart as a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*****************************************************************\\n\\n\\n\r\nI rate animes I have seen based upon the categories of Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Personal Enjoyment, each worth 10 points (1 being terrible, 10 being incredible).  The overall score is then multiplied by 2 to get a score out of 100.  \\n\\n\r\n**STORY**   9.9/10\\n\r\nI give the story a 9.9 out of 10 simply because I can't get enough of it.  There never seems to be a filler episode, everything seems both relevant and interesting.  The story is both compelling and moving.  Comedy, Romance, Slice-of-Life, a bit of Drama.  Now, why isn't it a 10/10?  Simply because it's a somewhat generic story - girl and guy are friends, would make perfect couple but don't see it that way, one side falls for the other, but other side has reservations.  You can probably guess what happens in the end.  BUT, there's more to a story than just WHAT it is, there's the HOW it's told that really makes a difference.  Which brings me to \\n\\n\r\n**CHARACTERS** 10/10\\n\r\nThis category I don't even hesitate to give a perfect score.  Every character, from the lovable, dynamic duo of Risa and Otani, down to even the minor characters (Umibozu) and the somewhat detestable/annoying Mimi and Haruka are given such a wonderful personality.  They all seem real, you can identify with them, you can love/hate them, cheer them on.  Each of the characters are memorable in their own right and will leave some kind of impression on you.\\n\\n\r\n**ART** 9.8/10\\n\r\nAs for art, I can't give it a full score just because it didn't blow me away.  But, what it did do, is present the story without distracting me, give life and love to each of the characters and clearly convey the mood being set up.  I'm personally not one to really care what the anime looks like, as long as it's not... weird... and flows smoothly, doesn't deviate from what it set out to do, and makes changes when change would be expected.  (i.e. 3 years go by, from 15-18, I better expect to see some changes in the characters).  Thus, I gave it 9.8.\\n\\n\r\n**SOUND** 10/10\\n\r\nRarely do I ever look for the soundtrack from an anime, but this has become one of them (Cowboy Bebop, Welcome to the NHK some of the others).  When the music is so good that you want to listen to it separately, without the scene and other things going on, you know that's a good music soundtrack.  \\n\r\nBut beyond the soundtrack, the noises, the voices, every other sound is clear, crisp and beautiful.  In that aspect, the sound is just like the art to me; as long as it's not weird or distracting, it's pretty good.  But LoveCom had that amazing soundtrack (Risa's theme is so catchy), a great vocal cast and plenty of authentic sounding noises.  \\n\\n\r\n**PERSONAL ENJOYMENT** 10/10\\n\r\nObviously, if you noticed that I'm effectively giving this anime two reviews, you should know that I would give this category a 10.  I have watched this 3 times and I wouldn't mind watching it again in a few months.  Just like that movie of which you never seem to tire, LoveCom grows on you and makes you want to see it again and again.  This anime has changed me, too, by inspiring me to have an attitude like that of Koizumi or Otani - never give up and fight hard for what you want.  \\n\\n\r\n**OVERALL**\\n\r\n99.4/100\\n\r\nIf you like any kind of romantic comedy, give this a shot.  You'll know if you'll like it after the first episode.  XD",

            "content": "\"You idiot! Big or small, as long as you have a \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 you're a man, right?!\"\r\nMy initial thoughts when starting this series? \"What am I getting myself into...\" Those words were what ran through my head when I watched the first episode. It was ranked pretty high by the MAL Community, and I decided to give it a try. After the first episode, I couldn't help but press the next episode button... I mean, who wouldn't, right? Anyways, as I started watching the series, I hadn't noticed until around episode 17 that I had just spent 8 hours laughing my head off every episode. Strange,isn't it? We don't realize that we're doing something until we've been doing it for a long time or until someone points it out. What am I getting at here? Lovely\u2606Complex was probably the highlight of my month. I watched every episode in a matter of hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, when it comes to good quality storylines, Lovely\u2606Complex might cross people's minds. True, it may not sound like anything special, but truthfully it is. Usually when it comes to Shoujo animes, the storyline is based around 1 plot, and that would be getting the 2 protagonists together in the end of the series. What makes this unique is that the male protagonists are often taller then the female protagonists. In this case, it's the other way around... by about half a foot. Risa, codename \"Giraffe\", is a whopping 172 cm tall, and Otani, codename \"Midget\", is a mere 156 cm tall. It's abnormal for either of them to be that height, so when people are trying to make romance come out of that situation, it might seem impossible, especially since the two of them are fighting constantly. But overall, the story was really well played to my surprise. There was good comedy, romance, and an overall feel to the anime. I was very happy about that. It's not often where you come across a Shoujo that hasn't copied a story from another shoujo...\\n\\n\r\n2007 isn't that long ago, and for an anime that's over 6 years old, it had a pretty decent art style. I liked how the characters were portrayed, however it seems like everyone in Lovely\u2606Complex was either really short, or really tall. I don't think there was an average height person in this show... strange, but had good quality overall. One thing I did have a problem though were those creepy-assed faces that mostly came from Risa. It ranged from a chipmunk, to a rabbit, to a god-knows-what. It's hard to like her when her face is so misshapen like that. I still laughed though, at least when I wasn't shielding my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent cast for Lovely\u2606Complex. I really liked how they got the voice actress who played Nami in One Piece to voice Risa as well. She did really well in One Piece and transferred that profession into Risa. Then there was Otani. His voice was played by Akira Nagata. Haven't heard of him? Well neither had I until I looked up who voiced Otani. He's had 2 roles, one of them being Lovely\u2606Complex, so it shocked me to see him with a lack of roles. He voiced Otani so well that I was kind of sad, not being able to hear him again. As for all the other voice actors, they voiced their roles with professionalism and enthusiasm. I applaud that.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on forever about who I liked best and why, but I'll keep the text to a minimum here. I liked Nobu the best, but I'll get to her later. For starters, Giraffe-- er, Risa was really funny, she was pretty when she wasn't cosplaying as a beaver, and she had an overall likable personality. Otani-- er, Midget-- wait, yeah, Otani seemed really dense, and when I mean dense, I mean REALLY dense. You could literally send him a note telling him \"I love you\" with your name signed at the bottom and he'd think it was a joke or for someone else. Either way, he too had some really funny moments to him. Haruka was the bane of my existence as an anime-lover. His constant obsession over Risa was almost intolerable. But either way, he seemed to have a crucial role in the story, so he was needed, to my dismay. Nobu, yaaaay! Risa's best friend. Probably the most affectionate girlfriend you could possibly have in all honesty. Truthfully I'd like to see someone get in the way of her and Nakao (Nobu's Boyfriend, and also one of the funniest characters in the show), and trust me, that person would die. Then there's Suzuki and Chiharu. I'm lumping them together because they're basically the same person, only 1 is male and the other is female. They're both really shy, but they are really nice as well. Last of all, Seiko. I'm not gonna give you a rundown of what makes Seiko a crucial character, but all I'm going to say is prepare to have your eyes burned out of your sockets and your brain blown up, along with constant laughter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 11/10. This is probably my favorite Shoujo out there today. I got my sister to watch it and she loves it as well, and she never watches any anime other than Angel Beats! and The World God Only Knows. She has a limited tendency to watch anime, but if I was able to get her to watch this, you should try it out for yourself as well. This anime had some great comedy, really good romance scenes, and an overall likableness to it. I urge you to watch it, and I really hope that those of you who have seen it can vouch for me in supporting me on how good this was.",

            "content": "True chemistry is something hard to find. Is it acceptable to dwell on things like..height difference and being comedy partners to ignore it?\r\nI watched this show after a person with similar taste suggested it. The first impression I got was that it was going to be..a romance/comedy show, with the oxymoron of having the roles reversed, height-wise. Risa, our female lead, is really tall for a girl. This is often exaggerated, with her really slim members, to make her look like a giantess from time to time. Our guy, Otani, is good looking, a basketball star, but..he's really short for a guy. Can these twoovercome these facts, and start to see each other as more than friends, even though they've been making others laugh forever, getting nicknamed as the All Hanshin Kyoujin comedy duo?\\n\\n\r\nSo, I expected this to be about the sweet heartache of having to wonder whether he/she likes you or not. Having to deal with rivals appearing. Trying to deny true chemistry. After a few episodes, I asked myself. Is Lovely Complex what I expected? Well, partly yes, but not exactly...Is this a bad thing? Well, not necessarily...\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found this show to have a higher comedy value than romance value. I've laughed through out this. I've been disappointed with several aspects of the romance though. It's all a matter of personal aesthetics, of course, but for me, this was too one sided a romance for far too long to move me.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't like it when someone is taken for granted forever. Some might argue that this was realistic at first, you can't change your feelings and stop seeing someone as a friend in the blink of an eye. But if it drags on for too long, like it does here, you're just being spoiled. Beyond that, persistance can be admirable, and having to work for love is something that happens often, sure. It is because it happens often that I'm more interested in things that happen -naturally- . To me, something more rare is more special, more worthy of being told as a story. And then...Whatever happened to privacy, people?!\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, you have to give your friends a little push. But here..Everyone is butting in the whole time, I can't understand this. Even in moments that really should be private, it is presented as natural to have another four guys join. Then, it's more than just a light push; isn't it awkward, to have everyone forcing one onto the other, having to apologize for not wanting to be with someone, like you owe it to people? And then, what's with lecturing your rival about how she shouldn't give up on your boyfriend ?! Seriously now?\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is supposed to be funny. But the female lead gets ridiculed too much for me. Watching that second kiss hurts my eyes. Risa's been saying this \"I'm through with liking you\" a thousand times. But then again, who's been a teenager and hasn't done that? And their feelings do develop through out the series. Risa is the driving force; her actions and persistance lead, while Otani's reactions to them are the catalyst. These guys deserve each other, and they do look good together. The part with Risa going to that concert seriously annoyed me, but I guess it was the creator's idea of outgrowing the forementioned one sided phase. Oh, Nobu-chan is a star.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics remind me of a lot of other shows. The characters are quite fashionable, changing attires often. The music was nothing special, but I rather liked the voice acting. I think it made the characters memorable, the All Hanshin Kyoujin duo with their \"Kimoi!\" 's, Nobu-chan with her \"dah-ling\", and uh..that giant going \"Moo\".\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex has been quite funny, and it did have its cute moments. It's just my personal belief that a better balance between these two aspects is achievable.",

            "content": "Looking at the \"Romance\" under genre must make you think something like \"...ah! Lemme guess. Another highschool RomCom\". But I will be there saying \"Yes. But no.\"\r\nYou see Lovely Complex IS a highschool RomCom but it is quite different from your usual usual RomCom. I will explain why as I go on.\r\nThe setting is the usual -- Highschool, one boy, one girl, they fall in love. But you will see the difference right away from episode one as the characters are introduced to you. See, unlike a normal love story where the guy is always taller than the girl, here, the roles are reversed. Thegirl is much taller than the boy. This unconventional match-up brings a new factor to the table --- the complexes that the characters experience because of their height. For example, a girlfriend taller than you might hurt your \"manly pride\" (Bullshit! I know) or tall girls aren't usually cute or it is awkward if you're trying to kiss your girl and you can't even reach her. These complexes do play a certain role as the love story progresses and are dealt with nicely which is good to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo on their first day, Risa and Otani are branded as the \"All-Hanshin Kyoujin\" because they are always acting like a comedy duo, always fighting. They're always bickering and clawing at each other. At one time Risa even punches Otani in the face. They don't hold back to include the height difference in the name calling. All this goes on for a while until Risa realises that she has fallen for Otani. But Otani is really dense, he doesn't really see her that way and thinks its just part of their usual comedy routine. The chase from here on out is a nice ride.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the humour from the show comes from the two main characters as they call each other names while making weird faces. This makes this show overflowing with energy as the voice actors have done a great job with the timing. This is complimented by the art style as the faces those two make while fighting are pretty weird-looking but at the same time, hilarious. The soundtrack keeps up with the energy of the show and I liked the first opening sequence. Also, the energetic openings are complimented by the subtle endings. The show really made me laugh hard at times, so even if you don't like the romance, I am sure this will leave you laughing your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike your usual boy meets girl, they both fall madly in love, there is a confession, the end ; its a nice chase here which doesn't end at the first confession as the girl gets rejected at first (it happens early on) but she doesn't give up till the end as there is little to no romantic response from the guy most of the time (he is THAT dense). Hell, the guy thought she was joking when she confessed the first time. This dense character of his really annoyed me at times and I wanted to punch him in the face. But all is forgotten when the story concludes itself as there isn't a sudden realisation of the love but it grows nice and slow.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a one of a kind love comedy show and I had a good time laughing my ass off at the comedy scenes all the while enjoying some cute moments as Risa tries to woo Otani. The show does not go deep into the \"feels\" side and I like that they kept it that way.\\n\r\nIt left its own little print in my heart.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Koizumi Risa. \u2018Nuff said.\r\nWhile she really is all the reason a person should need to go watch this show, I\u2019ll explain what more makes this one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I\u2019ve seen.\r\nWhen I sat down to watch (more like marathon)  Lovely Complex, I really wasn\u2019t expecting anything special; the beginning of the show even had me a tad worried as I could see it easily going in a clich\u00e9d direction. Thankfully, I was wrong (well, for the most part).\r\nAfter witnessing the explosive chemistry between Koizumi and Ootani, before there was even a flicker of romance between the two, any suspicion of thembeing clich\u00e9 was blown clear out of the water. Now, I won\u2019t say that their relationship developing further was unpredictable in itself- but that\u2019s not really the point. It\u2019s all about how the show brings these two together.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not your typical romance duo- anime or otherwise. Sure, the girl is taller than average and the guy is shorter, but those details take the backseat to these two\u2019s eccentricities and meteoric charm. As lovable as they are, Koizumi and Ootani still have more to them than their comical quirkiness; both have insecurities and show vulnerability throughout the show\u2019s progression. When things do get romantic, it\u2019s always tender and believable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as much as I do love this series, I\u2019d be lying if I said it was perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe criticisms worth mentioning are few, but still they are enough to make me feel that this show could have been markedly better. Really, it\u2019s just the matter of the side characters; even those that were there from the beginning don\u2019t get nearly as much fleshing out as Koizumi and Ootani. Aside from Nobu (ultimately I felt she was a fairly solid character), everyone else comes off pretty flat. When the show does focus on them, the drama that takes place feels terribly contrived.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are where the worst of the clich\u00e9s come in; childhood friend, foreigner, ex, neighbor girl, and coworker all essentially exist for the sole purpose of initiating jealousy/competition for the leading pair.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really shines where the focus has been all along- on Koizumi and Ootani. Enough time passes in the show that we get to see the two starting to figure out who they are and who they are to each other. With all the sensitivity and hilarity added on board to that roller coaster, Lovely Complex is a delight to watch. \\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while, you receive a recommendation from an anime you really enjoyed, and in the end wind up disappointed in the result. For those like me, this is one of those times. \r\nLovely\u2605Complex is an anime that, by all means, I expected to enjoy. To start out, we're shown the main two characters of the story, Risa and Ootani. The two are seen as a comedy duo y their classmates and teacher, as the tall Risa and short Ootani commonly quarrel for all to see. Throughout the series, romance develops, but an unexpected outcome occurs. \r\nUnfortunately, for Lovely\u2605Complex, this development is notnearly enough to save it from its flaws. While the premise of the situation is interesting, the rest of LoveCom's aspects fail to keep this same interest or actively detract from it. To start with, the comedy scenes, while occasionally worth a chuckle, are far from enough to keep my enjoyment of LoveCom afloat. Some moments of bickering between our two main characters seem repetitive, in a \"I've seen this exact scene before\" kind of way, and other jokes are stretched out for more than they're worth. \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the characters fail to fuel one's enjoyment of Lovely\u2605Complex, and at times can serve to actively detract from any enjoyment that may occur. For example, our main male lead, Ootani, often moves the term 'dense' into a whole new realm. Where the normal male lead may be comparable to your average lead brick in density, Ootani ups the ante to Osmium-levels. His voice could also be rather grating or annoying at times, which of course doesn't help to improve the image one would have of Ootani. The other characters only occasionally bring something to the table--they are in supporting roles, after all--and fail to make up for the main cast's ineptitude. \\n\\n\r\nLovely\u2605Complex also has a major problem with setting the mood for its more 'emotional' scenes, which often hit the viewer like being blindsided by an bag of bricks. Soon after a scene of comical interactions, the scenes meant to make you feel empathy or sympathy towards the lead character Risa appear...although without the music to cue the viewer in on the development, one may miss it. As such, these scenes never really instill the feeling they are, presumably, meant to, further degrading LovCom's marks.\\n\\n\r\n--Final Thoughts--\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I can say with certainty that Lovely\u2605Complex did not live up to the expectations the users of this site have presented it with. Even with its occasionally fun moment or two, LovCom was immensely disappointing ,and I can't say I'd recommend it...but to each their own, I suppose.",

            "content": "Lovely complex is mainly a romantic drama that takes itself quite seriously. The setting is that of a high school in which the main characters have to deal with typical adolescent issues mostly related to love: understanding and accepting their feelings and others', dealing with peer pressure, expressing their emotions, and becoming committed to their relationships. The comedic element is a second-class citizen, a natural byproduct of high schoolers not knowing how to express their feelings and how to react in more delicate situations.\r\nThe seriousness is pervasive from the first moment thanks to the character designs - high schoolers DO look like actual high schoolers:there's no oversexualization and no pink hair. I have to give big props to making characters truly look different without relying just on hairstyles and eye color. The backgrounds have just enough detail, generally using colors with mid to low saturation--what you'd call \"soft\" or \u201ctoned-down\u201d colors. There are very few lighting effects and the shading is very sublte making it so that there\u2019s nothing to distract from the characters' feelings and thoughts. Characters are slightly stylized and this makes for a great looking anime when it comes to the few fluid movements that get animated. It\u2019s a sad fact that the animation is rather clunky. The design however is refreshing compared to what I consider the overly-colorful (saturated), overly-detailed design used nowadays, Your Lie in April being an example of this. Detailed backgrounds with bright color palettes such as in shows like 5cm/sec or Garden of Words would be other examples so this trend is no news, it\u2019s just more frequent now.\\n\\n\r\nIts main problems come as a consequence of misusing characters. They\u2019re good in the sense that you can\u2019t just box them inside an archetype, they\u2019re all realistic and complex, but aside from the two main characters none get actually explored.  Although it\u2019s somewhat at the cost of the side characters, it\u2019s good that much of the exploration of the protagonists, Risa and Otani, is done through friends and teachers helping them fix their issues. It\u2019s a common romance anime mistake to shoehorn in explanations through exaggerated reactions, obtrusive self-talk or over-the-top visuals or story. Another issue is that for part of the duration Otani is so dense that he manages to keep the plot looping and breaks any suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nA nice plus that probably doesn't get noticed that much is the soundtrack. It's never in the foreground with its rather low volume and the more ambiental style, but one can tell many of the 35 tracks were specially created for dramatic timing of specific scenes. Very fitting, but not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the issues I have with LoveCom are related to the plot. The anime is slow to start, as we find Risa being rejected time and time again. Couple that with the fact that it will skip from Valentines to Christmas, New Year and Birthdays and you\u2019ll end up thinking each day is a holiday in which Risa is living the same nightmare. There are cases when repetition can be used as a trope, but in this case it will only make you care less and less, or simply get frustrated. If you look at it from a troll\u2019s perspective it\u2019s almost funny, but the anime presents it from the victim\u2019s perspective. If you bear through that you\u2019ll get to the best part. That\u2019s simlpy because it reaches great variety and a good pacing. In fact it goes through almost anything that can happen in a normal relationship.\\n\r\nHowever, when the focus suddenly switches to the side characters everything feels off. They were forgotten for too long . Adding to that comes the fact that their arcs are poorly dealt with: rushed and with awkward transitions. All this is on the background of college exams and choosing their path in life which manage to keep tension up so the anime ending gets to save face with a cathartic ending about the main characters and their life choices.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some storytelling issues such as the overuse of flashbacks in order to explain some of Risa\u2019s emotions. Most of the times the respective feelings are obvious anyway so the flashabacks duration becomes even more of a problem. Luckily they aren\u2019t used that often.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth it to mention what type of comedy LoveCom has. The jokes come as a byproduct of the characters\u2019 silly but believeabale personalities or in the form of a funny plot twist having a well timed comedic setup. This secondary role comedy gets makes it that if it doesn\u2019t hit the spot for you it won\u2019t take anything away from the value of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end you\u2019re left with a fine anime that repeats the same note before remembering the rest of the song. It\u2019s not a beautifully complex song but it\u2019s catchy and simple and it might just be that one song that makes you understand romance a bit better or at least reminds you of your funny teenage love experiences.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Spoilers. Lots and lots of spoilers.\r\nLovely Complex Review:\r\nThe story centers around Atsushi Otani and Koizumi Risa, two classmates and good friends who are renowned around the school as 'All-Hanshin Kyojin\" (or something like that) due to their constant arguing and bantering, and their circle of friends. Risa is tall for her age, while Otani is rather short for his. The show follows their last two years of high school, and ends with their foray into the world beyond it.\r\nThe animation is well, nothing to write home about. It's not bad and I've definitely seen a lot worse, but it's not up to the qualityof the likes of Toradora, Death Note, Naruto or other high end anime. It's good, but not amazing. As an aside, it rather reminded me of the early One Piece seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOne would think that is a bad thing, but it's really not. I think it works well with the style that lovecom goes for. Speaking of style, lovecom is distinctive for its animation, in that characters are often distorted/animated differently in ways regarding their emotions, conversations, etc for comedic effect. I'm not sure how to describe the technique, but all you need is to watch the first episode and you'll know what I mean. I think this style works well with the light show that is lovecom. However, others might not be of the same mind. If you see the first episode and don't like the style, then know that it doesn't change.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is rather light-hearted, in that there is no deeper source of conflict. No one dies, no one loses their house, no one's long lost thought-dead twin reappears to seek vengeance, or anything equally dramatic.\\n\r\nThe main plot for majority of the show revolved around Koizumi's attempts to win over Otani in a romantic way(more on this later).\\n\r\nSome might not like this, but to me it's what made the show. It's a romcom, and it does have drama, but nothing eye-rolling like anime tends to do. All drama that pops up is resolved realistically and quickly. All those 'if only he/she got to tell him/her just this one thing' don't happen, because characters on this show do the realistic thing and talk about what's relevant.\\n\\n\r\nAs an extension of the above, what really made this show great to me was how smoothly things went. Not in the 'easy' way. I mean that the two protagonists felt like real people, and while anime behavior can't really be avoided, I was pleasantly surprised by how realistically everyone acted. Nothing felt forced. I could see everyone thinking and acting like that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I liked Otani and Risa. They had real chemistry, and their (eventual) pairing did not feel forced. They had distinctive personalities, different yet similar in many ways and it is obvious how an attraction between them could (and did) develop.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the supporting cast was rather ... not quite bland. Forgettable? Not really given much development? Something along those lines.There is an argument to be made that shows some times take the supporting cast too far, but still, lovecom kind of fell flat there. It didn't bother me, since my interest lay firmly with Otani and Risa, but this could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I put firmly on the 'Pros' side of the argument, is how the whole plot was handled. To expand on what I mentioned earlier, early on in the show Risa realizes that she has feelings for Atsushi (who is always referred to as Otani by everyone, me included), and for the middle part of it tries to win him over, while the last part is with them as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is interesting because the two of them had been good friends already, and Otani is caught completely off-guard by her feelings. It's classic drama, yes, but I loved how it was handled. Otani just did not see Risa that way. For the longest time he could not transition her from 'best friend' to 'girlfriend' in his mind. It avoided most (if not all) of the cliche drama pitfalls and kept drama to a minimum, while still keeping the situation like that. The show remains positive and uplifting, even when it seems that Risa's efforts are in vain.\\n\r\nFor the amount of episodes where it seemed like Otani really could not see her that way, I enjoyed it a lot. Otani tried, he gave it a lot of thought, etc but he just could not see her that way. That's something that I honestly haven't seen before.\\n\r\nEventually and over the course of a year and a half (or so) Otani does come around to loving her, but the transition is slow and very well handled.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing was that almost no episode felt filler-ish. The balance of slice-of-life shows is delicate, but lovecom nailed it. Each episode had its own charm, and none were of the 'unique arc that will have no further impact once complete' kind. Each led into the next, and the show progressed at a decent pace.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, there were some points in the story that just outright did not work. The whole thing with the substitute teacher (whatshisface) comes to mind. That was simply a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the main negative is that while I enjoyed the show, there wasn't much impact to it. I mentioned previously that the lack of ridiculous drama was a positive. It is. Still, LoveCom never had me on the edge of my seat, never truly inspired strong emotion in me. Its realism, while refreshing, was a double edged sword. We watch the lives of two people over a period of two years, and by the end of it we are smiling, but there wasn't much that stuck out in such a way that I will remember it months/years from now.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: LoveCom is a light-hearted, refreshingly realistic romcom with a distinctive style that will probably be hit or miss with most. Very entertaining show, but not groundbreaking. I rate it 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of slice-of-life and/or romcoms, watch Lovely Complex.",

Please remember to check out the genres of this series as well as the intend age group before starting.\r\n--\r\nI saw the first episode of lovely complex and was completely jaw to the floor. This is EXACTLY what I didn't want in an anime. Fast paced, no subtleties, annoying main characters. Humor which takes away from the development of theshow. I understand the humor was supposed to be funny but I didn't really laugh as the jokes were bare-faced and flat. Nothing smart and cunning or carved out. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an extremely typical shoujo, all the 'friends' were hollow and just for show. The rivals are there for the sake of jealousy--and let's be real we've seen this done way too many times. It's not healthy, and it needs to stop. The development of 'love' relies on the friends pushing the two main love interests along. The writing forces the plot along only with these events, sports festival, fire works festival, christmas, valentines, birthday and THREE love rivals all withing the first 7 episodes. No regular, healthy progression of love plays forth. None of the characters developed at all, not even the main ones. I imagine this style was newly emerging and 'good for it's time' but it's definitely nothing special now.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short:\\n\r\nThe show doesn't take itself seriously, and so it's difficult for the viewer to sympathize with characters emotions when it's clear the viewership was intended for those of a younger audience.\\n\\n\r\n* If you're a teenager with little to no love experience, who enjoys characters with no real motives and no development in an over-arching story, you'll enjoy Lovely Complex. \\n\\n\r\n*If you're seeking something more well thought out, detailed and deep love story, I would not recommend this anime.\\n",

Shorter than most people his age.\r\nProblem... Risa likes Otani, but he's very dense. It's unbelievable how dense he is. The story revolves around Risa and how she tries to make the densest boy in the universe become her boyfriend. Throw in a childhood friend, ex-girlfriend and across dresser and you have a hilarious romantic comedy.  And the fact that they speak Kansai-Ben through out the entire anime was a plus. Usually you find one or two characters with that accent in anime, but since the location of the anime was set around Osaka, almost every character spoke it. I love that accent above all in Japan, so it added extra points!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art, to me, was very original. It was my first time seeing an anime that wasnt overly girly. (Im one for shoujo style) I can see it being similar to the Bokura Ga Ita art, but not by much. And the faces... the FACES Risa made were hilarious. Very original.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great. The VA's were Kansai-Ben speakers originally, so it fit the theme perfectly. The only voice I didnt like was Seiko's. But I dont like that character anyway. :D\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs for the first season were OK. They fit the series very well and did a good job of closing and opening the show. Now... The SECOND season song, by Hey! Say! 7 were awesome. Being a big fan of H!S!7 I was quite pleased to hear them opening and closing the series. :D  And the rapper Umibozou made a landing in my book of favorites. His song &quot;Shouga Ne Ze&quot; was great and is now my txt message tone. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe character development could have been a lot more like the manga, like Otani. He wasn't, to me, as OTANI as he could have been. But other than that, the other characters were great. All kinds, A cross-dresser (Who I absolutely hated), obsessive child hood friend, a creepy yet hot teacher, a broken hearted ex, and a love struck Neighbor, and co-worker. They all  made the story go 'round, without the variety it would have been a huge bore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis series was a huge change for me, and I loved it. I was pushed by two or three friends to watch it, and I am so happy they told me too! The suspense, the laughter, the pure LOVE was a huge hit in my book. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone who likes shoujo related themes, drama, and hilarious situations. Its great for a laugh! Watch it. You will NOT regret it. :D",

            "content": "If you haven't noticed by now, one of my favorite genres of anime is the high school rom-com, behind slice-of-life and quite possibly incest. Given that Lovely[star]Complex was one of those rom-com shows, I was excited to watch another rom-com that seems to have reached universal acclaim amongst fans and skeptical viewers alike. Having seen Kaichou wa Maid-sama, Toradora!, and a whole mess of other shows that have always delivered without the action, the fan service, or all those other anime elements that average anime addicts tend to fangirl about, Lovely[star]Complex seemed to meet those exact same conditions. Plus, I was way behind when itcame time to watch it on classic anime shows as they call them, so it wouldn't hurt to throw Lovely[star]Complex in the mix of shows I'm currently watching.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, let me try my best to say something nice for once.\\n\\n\r\n\"OMGG!! LOVELY COMPLEX IS SO AWSUM!!! I GAVE IT 15/10-\"\\n\\n\r\nFuck this. Never mind.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could say just how excited I was to see this show, a friend of mine who was NEVER wrong about recommending anime shows to me told me to watch it. Every single show he recommended to me, I've enjoyed. Working!!, Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?, Psycho-Pass, and a good number of others. But if our friendship hangs off the balance of one show (and thank your deity of choice it doesn't), then we would've unfriended each other on Facebook over disagreeing about Lovely[star]Complex.\\n\\n\r\nOnly Facebook. We'd still be friends.\\n\\n\r\nYour first impression of Lovely[star]Complex might be \"just another rom-com\", the average animated filler to leave yet another dull impression on the anime market, back in 2007. And if you initially thought that, I'll tell you right now....\\n\\n\r\n....that you are probably not mistaken. Lovely[star]Complex is the average high school shoujo anime and the only real difference is the boy is shorter than the girl, that's about it. You could technically switch one thing to make it seem different and more appealing, but to be honest, it really doesn't make that much of a difference. This leaves Lovely[star]Complex, middle-of-the-road, and not purposed to surprise.\\n\\n\r\nBut if it were up to me to point out any one instance in which Lovely[star]Complex had any highlights that gave it a \"head\" above the normal crowd, I'd have to cite it for being a little too excessive. Overexaggerated, overhyped, overrated. You know what happens when a comedy act gets to be, \"too much\", right? It's the only reason Jeff Dunham landed a job as a comedian, and that's not the only reason; I'd have a hard time too getting Muppet rejects onto Sesame Street. Lovely[star]Complex is the same way in that respect. Don't agree with me? Please continue reading.\\n\\n\r\nStory: A King Kong-sized high school girl falls in love with Jeremy Lin, the shortest basketball player in existence who can miraculously drive balls deep behind \"enemy lines\" and somehow manage to get it in, and to clarify on that, horny ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy Lin, who for the purpose of this story will be renamed \"Otani\", is just a really talented basketball player.\\n\\n\r\nWhile self-acclaimed critics and public conformers ask for certain elements added into a show to make it all the more \"unique\" and therefore \"better\", Lovely[star]Complex overdoes it. As a result, Lovely[star]Complex delivers a plain-Jane romance between a shaven Star Wars Ewok and the girl in elementary school who always stood next to the teachers because she was just too damn tall to fit in the bleachers.\\n\\n\r\nSee, a lot of people think that Lovely[star]Complex has been a terrific show for its \"inspirational story about how we must overcome our differences and come together as one\", but I for one don't believe that's the case. It's just a height problem, people outside of scripted lines and animation work around it all the time. It's really nothing special. Just get some stilts and end the show in half the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut setting aside all of the height complaints, Lovely[star]Complex delivers too many complications and too many ridiculous situations in 24 episodes. One moment, Risa falls in love with a guy that is ACTUALLY HER HEIGHT, and in the same episode, she decides to herself that she is in love with Otani. I know, it's completely possible, because prostitution services require that you MUST share your affection with other men, but instead of cheering her on as the protagonist, a quick jump like that makes me think, \"is there something wrong with her?\" I'd definitely think so. That's what I thought when I was getting stalked by a girl in high school who easily changed her mind after finding out I was already dating someone, after writing my name all over her notebook which I found out about in due time (yeah, creepy shit. I speak from experience).\\n\\n\r\nThe complications do NOT stop. It's always the tragic story of \"we fight, we make up\" with this show, and it happens very, VERY often. Before they begin dating (because we know where this is going already), the show takes on the vicious cycle of fighting one episode, making up at the end. They fight another episode, they make up at the end. Does it get tiring for you to watch? I'm sure it does, but if that was what fans were looking for back then, I think everyone should reconsider their decision, or get their heads bolted on properly at their local clinic (because it spawned eight episodes of the same shit from the 2nd season of Haruhi Suzumiya).\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think this was the worst discovery I had when I first saw this show: the animator was Toei Animation. That's the studio that brought us Air Gear.\\n\\n\r\nYou're wondering, \"why is that even relevant?\" I'm pretty sure I've made it well-known that I thought Air Gear was a big disappointment, and one thing that made it horrible was the mismatched comedy which is usually delivered in the worst possible situation or when it's generally uncalled for. Lovely[star]Complex, in my personal opinion, is the exact same way. Emotional sequence? Go ahead and laugh because they made Risa's face look funny. Supposed to be a serious scene? Sure, it doesn't make a difference whether or not Otani's teeth are jagged or not and his mouth is now opening like a dysfunctional 10-year-old on coffee, we can be serious and have fun at the same time. I really disliked the comedy because I felt like the animators placed the comedy in every scene they see fit. Not that it really matters, but how hard is it to laugh at the same joke being delivered in multiple different ways, and recurring every single time you hit the \"Play\" button? If you do laugh, though, I don't blame you. At one point in our lives, we do end up kissing someone's ass so I suppose we can start now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Why is it a common anime element to fill the protagonist's head with air? The only reason you'd want to is if you wanted to take a ride in him (or on), or if he really angered you that much (and at times, he really did). People are not THAT stupid. You can be the biggest moron on the face of this planet (literally and figuratively) and you'd still be able to pick up ALL of those hints. Think about it. A girl wants to get close to you, she does, and she becomes your friend, now she's your best friend, and suddenly you get a confession from her. If you act surprised, or if you haven't taken a hint by then, either you have amnesia, you've been dropped on your head, or you've been hit by a bus.\\n\\n\r\nOtani probably had all three.\\n\\n\r\nCome to think of it, I really don't get Risa either. I remember one instance where Risa was really serious about giving up on Otani for being a complete blockhead within those first few episodes (and it drags on into later episodes as well), but if that were the case, she'd have given up her pursuit of him and chased after someone else, preferrably of her same height. She fell in love with him in two episodes, without any proper backing aside from touching him. If true love worked that way, all the 40-year-old virgin neckbeards in the world would do their best to touch every ten-year-old girl they saw as a part of their strange little harem they've got going on. In their world, it's quite possible that it did happen, so I'm not too surprised.\\n\\n\r\nI think I went a little off-topic. What I'm trying to say is, in reference to the \"OOH IM LIEK SOOO OVARR OTANI-BAKA-SAN\" (however you Japanglish majors say it), I think there's too much unnecessary drama. Yes, it's a rom-com, and they tend to have drama, but don't you think the drama the type you see in a soap opera, where a poor sucker scratches his $1,000 shoes and throws a fit about not having them cleaned? Hopefully you see where I'm going with this.\\n\\n\r\nWait, that's a reality show. Oh well, there's really no difference.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did laugh somewhere at the end, the last episode where the \"All Hanshin Kyojin\" were supposed to deliver a speech and ended up tearing the paper, but that was about it. The rest of the comedy was like watching a 12-year-old desperately try to make an 18-year-old Internet troll crack up. Let's be real, that will never happen unless he fell flat on his face so that the troll could make a meme about it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in this case, Lovely[star]Complex didn't quite do that. I'm a bit mad about it.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the show, I was counting the minutes that passed by as I watched with a straight face the show that didn't seem to live up to its expectations. I was sidetracked from time-to-time and I would wake up discouraged, keeping in mind I still had to complete Lovely[star]Complex, but I managed to finish it within two weeks.\\n\\n\r\nFor reference, I finished all three seasons and the OVA's for Shakugan no Shana in a week. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really wonder how this show managed to get an 8.35/10. I have to say, I'm authentically surprised that a show with an appearance this awful, from storyline down to characters, has managed to deceive the majority of its viewership into thinking they stumbled over the next best thing. There's really nothing special I can see about Lovely Complex, aside from being an overhyped animated sitcom with nothing to offer. And over time, I had hopes that it would turn into a show like Lucky Star, which is an acquired taste and will only appear humorous to fans of the show who have had it grow on them. Unlike Lucky Star, Lovely[star]Complex took no time to grow, now time to develop, and in the end, nothing was left. There's no taste to acquire here. It is what it is; terrible.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's a recurring thing for me to rant on anime shows that are generally popular and well-received, but if that were the case, I authentically dislike Lovely[star]Complex. I respect that others like this show, and by others, I mean, most of the people here. But it didn't grow on me, and it won't be anytime soon.",

            "content": "I very nearly dropped this anime after the first episode. The animation style threw me off, the characters and story didn't seem interesting and I didn't really like it. I decided to watch one more episode and if I didn't like it, I would move on to something else. Well I did watch that 1 episode after... and the one after that... and the one after that... and the one after that... until I had stayed up to 4 in the morning to get to episode 20. Yeah, boy how wrong was I.\r\nThe story centers around a girl who is 170 cm tall and aboy who is 156 cm tall. This dynamic is directly contrasting the typical formula where a man is taller than a woman. The \"lovely complex\" is the complex both of them have about their height, both tall and short. As Risa is taller than most of the boys, she considers herself unattractive and undesirable. This belief is reinforced when the guy she falls for happens to fall for her friend who is much shorter. Conversely, Otani falls for that same girl... but she doesn't see him as a potential romance because... and I quote... \"Otani is easy to talk to, its probably because he is the same height as me that I don't see him as a guy.\" Ouch. So its clear where both of them get their issues from. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this anime that I was confused by, as much as I did end up liking it, was just how many times Risa went back and forth. \"I like him... now I'm giving up on him... now I like him again... now I'm giving up again... now I like him... now I'm giving up again... now I like him... now I'm giving up again... now I like him...\" Its like GEEZUS, make us your mind. That aside, it does lead to some pretty funny scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is spectacular and definitely worth a watch. It is hilarious and at times very moving. Nothing too deep here, no tragedy or huge depressing thing... I'm looking at you Clannad... >__>\\n\r\nIts just a fun romantic comedy that manages to hit all its notes well with a cast of characters that while, mostly forgettable past the blonde girl, are still very likable.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the lessons learned about not giving up on an anime and the amazing nature of this series. Virtus Signum gives this a 10/10. Watch it.",

            "content": "My first girlfriend was actually taller than Risa, so RIP.\r\nLove comes in all shapes and sizes, quite literally and figuratively. Nothing is a better example of this than Lovely Complex, a show joe series sporting quite possibly the most touching of love stories!\r\nWhen people say opposites attract, they really mean it. Lovely Complex is a story about just that: how when it comes to love, it doesn't matter who you are, whether you be short, tall, popular, anti-social, boy, or girl, everyone feels the same emotion, that is love. And with that, comes a buttload of romantic tension.\r\nDid I mention romantic tension? Because Lovely Complexmay have the largest amount of romantic tension in an anime! I mean, what do you expect when you have a overly hardworking girl trying to win the affections of one of the most dense male characters ever conceived? However, despite their differences, these two characters have probably the cutest and most down to earth relationships in anime. They are basically the bestest of friends, not afraid to tease and fight with each other, having each other's backs when it counts, and having fall outs like any other friendship. It's how they make their friendship into something more that made this love story incredibly heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nNow take all this romantic tension, add a crap load of slapstick comedy, and you got Lovely Complex, a beautiful show joe series filled with emotion and love!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Incredible relationship and development between the two main characters.\\n\r\n- Beautiful depictions of love!\\n\r\n- Romantic tension is through the roof!\\n\r\n- Beautiful OST, really made some of the scenes incredibly emotional.\\n\r\n- Absolutely hilarious! Extremely well executed slapstick comedy and facial expressions!\\n\r\n- Great lessons on how love is for everyone, as well as how important hard work and determination is!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Main male is dense as balls. You'll want to punch him at times.\\n\r\n- Due to how dense he is, sometimes it feels like the same things are being repeated due to how hard the heroine has to work to win him over.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nTruly a gripping love story, the story of Lovely Complex is a dream for shippers. Due to the extremely high amount of romantic tension between the two main characters, it really makes you care and root for the main heroine! This story made me cheer when the heroine did something right, boo when the male lead's density kicked in, cry when the heroine failed, and smile like a dork when the two characters were interacting with each other. This story doesn't just dive into the inner workings of building a relationship, but it really expressed the emotions, blood, tears, and sweat as a result. This story is chock full of feels, and you'll be on a rollercoaster for a while.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art, although not high quality, really supported the mood of the show. During comedic moments, the slapstick quality and the facial expressions were absolutely golden. There were times when a funny facial expression was more than enough to make me laugh my ass off. However, the art isn't afraid to tug at your heartstrings too, as during sad and romantic scenes, the character designs really express their emotions well, and you could see the sadness or the happiness radiating from them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nHoly crap, this OST is absolutely beautiful. It made some of the scenes so tearjerking, I swear I was watching some Clannad level melodrama. The OST is truly breathtaking and is more than enough to express the emotions behind each scene tenfold. Another highlight when it comes to sound is the voice acting. I'm not Japanese, but I'm sure the characters have some kind of accent, and their exaggerated way of talking during comedic moments really added to the slapstick comedy! The voice actors/actresses performed so well that they could even make not-so-funny jokes absolutely hilarious!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe main characters of this show are absolutely brilliant. They are the opposites of each other, but even so, they match each other extremely well! Their differences led to their similarities, and that is why they connect so well! The relationship between the two is really refreshing and endearing, as they were basically known as a slapstick comedy duo in their school, and comedic they were! The interactions that these two had were absolutely side shattering hilarious! But it's the development between the two that made this series so impactful. The two started off as \"rivals\" who didn't really care for each other into an amazing duo that helps each other out. The heroine, Risa, is probably one of the most hardworking individuals in anime when it comes to romance, all so she can win over Otani, who is so incredibly dense, he would give harem leads a run for their money. Watching the relationship between this unlikely duo was heartwarming, heart shattering, and absolutely hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI was hooked to this show incredibly early in the first episode, and it never failed to make me laugh. I really felt the love in the air!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nA brilliant love story that really showcases how far love can go! To all you show joe fans out there, this is a must see!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: NANJA SORE???",

Even the characters height differences couldn't add much to these two very bland characters. The comedy was all slap stick and you can already tell by the anime's description the jokes mostly revolve around short stack and giant similies. \r\nSeiko's introduction kicked up the story for a couple of episodes and there were a couple ofsure-to-be heartwarming moments thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nDon't fret if you've passed up the chance to watch this anime.

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThere's a common phrase when it comes to love, \"opposites attract.\" What does this mean exactly? Men fall for women? Innocent girls go for the bad boys? An outgoing person finds the quiet, reserved type attractive? Whatever the case, these types of relationships form all the time. And with the Lovely Complex, it is no different. But as an anime, the show is not as good as people make it out to be.\r\nSTORY\r\nLovely Complex stars Ootani, the short (and short-tempered) guy, and Koizumi, the tall (and equally short-tempered) girl. Due to their antics, they are usually seen asa comedy duo. But as their time together increases, Koizumi begins seeing Ootani in a new light.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is comprised of about four separate arcs: All-Hanshin Kyojin (their nickname in school) acting as friends, Koizumi realizing her feelings for Ootani, pursuing him, and the conflicts that arise between them. The show starts off strong but by the halfway point, it devolves into repetition and ultimately weakens.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc helps to demonstrate the comedy of the show. Relying mostly on funny reactions and gags between Ootani and Koizumi, it worked to get a laugh out of me every now and then. Their relationship was filled with \"idiots\" and other relevant names. They seemed more like brother and sister with the way they acted towards one another; hostile yet you know that they care about each other. At this point, it is also becomes apparent how fast the shows pacing is. It should not be taken lightly when I say that the show progresses very quickly through events and time. By the end of the show, it has covered the entirety of their high school lives, meaning about one year per eight episodes. This doesn't necessarily hurt the show, but it does leave many details either left to narration or skipped over.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc deals with Koizumi coming to terms with her feelings for Ootani. This was the strongest part of the show for its sense of realism. The show doesn't have the couple come together immediately. Instead, it plays off the relationship they have currently and sets up a believable situation in which Koizumi learns that falling in love and having that person love you back are not the easiest things to have at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc consists mostly of Koizumi attempting to woo Ootani. However, it is at this point that the show starts to degrade. Where it had a nice sense of realism beforehand, it throws this out of the window in place of illogical choices and repetition. As stated before, the pacing of the show is quick. Therefore, Koizumi's advances actually last for quite a while. So long, in fact, it goes against sanity. I can believe having a crush on someone for a long period of time, but when that person doesn't reciprocate your feelings after having yours known for an extensive period of time, it starts to become a little ridiculous on the part of the confessor. Going back to repetition, much of this arc consists of the same thing over and over: Koizumi loving Ootani, attempting to sway him, her failing, her wanting to give up, then her realizing she can't. It gets rather annoying quickly that she comes to the same conclusion constantly while still holding out hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe final part of the show involves many complications that arise between Ootani and Koizumi's relationship. By this point, I was getting perturbed at their sometimes stupid choices that they were making, and this portion was no exception. A lot of the comedy had been removed and was replaced by their high school romance drama. A part of me wanted to like the romance that was happening but their was just something about the relationship that just never really felt as if the two really cared about one another. Whether that is Ootani's apprehensiveness or Koizumi's baffling decision making, whatever it is, I never felt myself rooting for them to finally end up together.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWatching Lovely Complex is somewhat rough. The art style for the show makes it look as if it was created in the mid-90s, despite being created in 2007. The environments and locations are pretty average and the character designs are pretty plain if not forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the show is also pretty bad. For the animation that is present, it is not executed properly and usually pretty choppy. Furthermore, the show loves to employ repetition even in its frames; it constantly uses previously aired material through flashbacks. Again, this starts to happen more in the second half where the show begins to go downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThe show could get detailed when it wanted to, especially when drawing the character's faces during key moments, but for the most part this never occurred. Instead, the show mainly stuck to drawing the characters in joke poses or ways.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSomething interesting I found about the Lovely Complex was that I actually preferred the side cast to the main cast throughout much of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKoizumi starts off being a rather loud and abrasive girl looking for love. And this is pretty much the extent of her character. Yes, her feelings for Ootani change over time, but beyond that, nothing else does. Having so much time elapse, there should have been more development on her part outside of \"I can't live without him.\" It's sad because she is quite unique when it comes to main female leads; she isn't super nice and pretty. She's pretty much the atypical lead girl, both in personality and growth.\\n\\n\r\nThe same argument can be had for Ootani. He begins as the hot-headed shorty but outside of coming to terms with his own feelings, he doesn't grow either. This is a big problem when you are the star of a show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found Koizumi and Ootani to at least be okay characters, I actually quite liked the rest of the cast. Characters such as Nobuko, Seiko, and Haruka not only provided more laughs than All-Hanshin Kyojin did, but they also were the ones to provide us with plot points and character insight. And while they may also have only one trait attributed to each of them, that's fine; being side characters, I wasn't expecting huge progress from them. But even so, the show does look at each of them, if only for a bit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this was the issue with them; outside of Nobuko, the character was usually introduced, used for a few episodes, then discarded. He or she might make a cameo later on, but for the most part, he or she was forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP is at least okay. It sounds older than it probably intends to be, but it is fun and fits with the first half of the show nicely. The second OP, however, is not good. It has a mix of rap and pop to it that doesn't feel appropriate for the show. The first ED is actually pretty good. It has a jazzy and mellow feel to it that complements nicely with the antics that take place before it. But like the second OP, the second ED is just bad. It sounds like it came from a boy band; its too much pop and does not go with the shows feeling at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is pretty bad as well. There is nothing memorable from it or even anything worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, Akemi Okamura's role as Koizumi and Akira Nagata's role as Ootani were nicely done on their end. Their voices sounded pretty unique and the different tones and inflections they used throughout the series were done well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nYou will be hard pressed to find another guy who likes romance in anime as much as I do. But as I said previously, I just could not get fully invested into this one. Perhaps I just did not like Koizumi and Ootani's characters enough to care about them getting together. The romance elements are definitely there but it just never felt as if they really had feelings that complemented each other. Koizumi would always let us know due to her narration but Ootani seemed as disinterested with everything as I did with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy itself is good during the first half, as said previously. A lot of the jokes fall flat during the second half, and I distinctly remembering shaking my head at the \"Grandma joke\" for how completely unfunny it was, despite the characters thinking so. I think that may have been the problem that the show created for itself. By focusing so much on comedy to begin with, it becomes harder to appreciate the romance introduced later down the road.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Lovely Complex's appeal comes from its characters, simply because it is lacking in almost every other department. But since I didn't particularly enjoy All-Hanshin Kyojin, my experience with the show was just not as enjoyable as it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, experiences a harsh half-life\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, art style is old and the animation is lacking\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, weak main cast but strong side cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, split on OPs and EDs, bad soundtrack but good VAs\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, better comedy than romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "\"Similar to ToraDora! - Lovely Complex\"\r\nThat's how i found out about Lovely Complex. I fell in love with ToraDora! (TD) right on the first episode, and i am still planning on re-watching it. Hearing a lot of good thing and the compatibility of these two anime, i decided to watch Lovely Complex (LC) . I can honestly say that TD and LC have similarities and both are very enjoyable.\r\nThe female protagonist (Risa) and the male protagonist (Otani) don't hate each other, they just find each other irritating since the whole school call them the comedy duo, and their height difference is just an extra thingfor other students to laugh at. Guess which one of them is 172 cm tall and which is 156 cm ? 99% got it wrong. What happens when Risa falls in love with Otani, a stupid guy who is too dense to realize it ? \\n\\n\r\nMy ratings of LC are as below,\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 10\\n\\n\r\nI have been on  serious anime trips and i needed to watch something light but heartwarming and funny.  Call it cheesy young romance or typical  high school life , but to me, LC is very unique in its own kind of way. I was hooked right on the first episode. The story line was not once boring and i was very entertained. I laughed way too hard so many times, i lost count. The jokes, the humor, the comedy, whatever you call it, they keep playing in my head even when i have moved on to the next scene, i ended up pausing the episode just to laugh all over again. You might think that it's just like other high school based anime and you might be right, but LC has its own charm and attraction \\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nDid i really just give it a 10 ? even though it was released in 2007 and the quality isn't as good as others ? Yes, i just did. I give it a 10 because the art is one the reasons why Love Complex is very entertaining. The face the characters make when they're making jokes, mad, shocked and feeling gloomy, they look almost inhuman. If i get a dollar every time i chuckled just by looking at their faces, i'd be really rich by now. The art isn't flawless and that's what i love about it, it makes delivering the comedy more effective.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors ? Perfect. Nothing i can complain about. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm in love with the characters, especially Risa, Otani, Haruka and Nobu. Risa and Otani are both stubborn, love to annoy each other, but Risa is more open about her feelings while Otani is more dense and shy to wear his heart on his sleeves, and together, they're indeed the comedy duo. Haruka is a cool guy in other girls' eyes but he  gets weak when it comes to Risa. He felt irritated every time Risa and Otani hang out together and his reactions are always priceless. Nobu is a tough girl who always motivates Risa to confess to Otani, and she becomes Risa's love sensei.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nAfter all the positive reviews, i couldn't possibly give it an 8. I have a stupid smile on my face every time i watch an episode, and there were times i laughed way too hard i can't make a sound, i ended up clapping like a sea lion. i do enjoy Lovely Complex as much as i enjoy ToraDora!, the similarities are there, the only thing is, ToraDora! is more depressing but of course, in a beautiful way. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't say this is everyone's cup of tea, but would i recommend others to watch Lovely Complex ? DEFINITELY.",

You almost think it's impossible, it can't happen (or at least I thought that). But once the characters develop into more honest humans, you realize that height doesn't HAVE to matter.

The petite but lion-hearted Atsushi plays foil to tall, energetic Risa in many a slapstick gag and friendly insult. Always played for laughs and never mean-spirited, heightaside the two are more alike than different, and this is richly explored in the slowly expanding narrative of their mutual romance.\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat simple\u2014or less delicately put, dated\u2014art subtracts just a little from this animated (in the descriptive sense) story. Kansai accents provide an ever-amusing foundation for the protagonists' banter. A nicely fleshed out supporting cast helps the various twists and turns of the story along, and provides for perhaps the most touching moment among the myriad in the series, briefly but assuredly overshadowing the drama of our heroes.\\n\\n\r\nRealism is typically not a key feature in the soap opera-like undulations of romance anime. Lovely Complex must be commended in this regard for its expert adherence to the various dramatic facets of real-life relationships. Save for one rather predictable, even out-of-place development in the show's latter half, you are never left feeling that Risa and Atsushi behave differently than would any other newly formed couple deep in the throes of hormonal conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe full season's worth of episodes rarely drags. It comes close to succumbing to \u201cwill-they-won't-they\u201d syndrome in the intermediate arc of blooming love, but the adorable mental monologues of Risa and pervasive believability of the romance keep the story alive and well past this point, straight into the perfectly packaged and satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe brief missteps of Lovely Complex are given more text than they deserve in this review. No series is perfect, but these incredibly minor deviations only serve to highlight just how lovely (ha ha) the underlying adventure is.\\n\\n\r\nFull of charisma and laughter, Risa and Atsushi's journey through romance, school, and life will leave you aching for a second season\u2014but knowing their undeniably happy future is best left to your imagination.\\n",

This has been, in my opinion, the best shoujo series I\u2019ve ever watched and I\u2019m sure most people who have would hesitate to disagree (hopefully!).\r\n[STORY: 8/10]\r\nIt is a pretty relatable issue in the real world which has been introduced as the initial driver of this series. There are many factors which can contribute to feelings of love and to some, height is definitelyone of them. I mean, no short dude would want to be with a tall girl, would he? Well, this series breaks the duck in trying to bring such a couple closer together. Obviously it\u2019s always going to be hard, but did they succeed in the end? WATCH to find out! :D\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 7/10]\\n\r\nWell, considering this series aired in 2007 and here I am watching it at the end of 2013, I did not let this bother me that much. The series is so good that you can afford to forgo this bit, I assure you. Besides, it isn\u2019t that bad to be fair, the girls looked pretty good and the guys were\u2026 well, standard I guess\u2026 \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 9/10]\\n\r\nSuperb character development done for the female protagonist, as expected of any shoujo franchise.  Through the three years of high school illustrated within this 24-episode series, we get to see how the characters grow as they learn to overcome hurdles in relationships as well as acknowledging their own feelings. Another pointer to touch on would be the supporting characters. The supporting characters in this series were really well made and thought of to integrate into the plot itself. Unlike certain series where supporting characters are created merely for the sake of doing so, they actually played vital roles in this series and I can\u2019t think of any support which had no meaningful purpose. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT: 9/10]\\n\r\nI\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed this series throughout. A very good mix of romance and comedy, which is integral for creating an ideal RomCom. For all those facing relationship problems or are having issues regarding love, this series would provide some respite for you and maybe even inspire you to do things you\u2019ve not done before. I\u2019ve experienced it and I approve of this message! (;\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nNormally I would give this a 9, but because it\u2019s SO good, I think it absolutely deserves to be overrated one more level. For those who haven\u2019t watched it yet, I recommend that you start now and be immersed into the lovely romantic world of Lovely Complex! A must-watch for any shoujo fan!",

            "content": "I usually do not write many reviews but felt the need to pen my thoughts on this anime. Lovely complex deals with the relationship between the tallest girl and the shortest guy in the class. The two are perfect for each other and everyone know it except the two main characters. \r\nThe good: \r\n - The characters themselves, both Koizumi and Otani are pretty good and avoid the conventions found in other romcom animes. The chemistry is clearly present between them. \r\n - The humour is pretty good. \r\n - The story for the most part avoids classic cliches and annoying \"what did he/she meanwhen he/she said this\" found in other animes. That said this is still present to a small degree. \\n\r\n - The animation is kinda old school. Reminded me of some old 90 animes. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad: \\n\r\n - For an anime with complex in the title, it spends about 2 episodes dealing with said complex and then forgets about it altogether. \\n\r\n - The supporting cast are essentially one dimensional cut-outs with noone being particularly memorable. We have a silent guy 1, silent, gentle, caring guy 2, bossy girl and a silent girl. None of them get any character development. Some semblance of a story is cobbled together towards the last two episodes but for the most part they are nothing more than comic relief. \\n\r\n - Multiple triangle love situations are teased but nothing ever happens. New characters are introduced 20 episodes in as potential love interests and it feel shoehorned. \\n\r\n - One big issue I have is with its length. Nothing really happens between episodes 7-17 and we see the same thing get repeated over and over again. While funny at first, get very annoying after a couple of episodes and characters never move on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rate it 6/10. Would have given it more if the anime was of a shorter length or if some of the side characters were developed better. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING, MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS!\r\nLovely Complex\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nLovely Complex shows how complicated love can be for kids. There are heartfelt moments, but there are also heart-breaking times. Distorted facial expressions and imaginative situations are used to express how these poor high schoolers feel at times. For example, during one heart breaking moment, a battleship appears with the person\u2019s face on it, and a cannonball is fired to sink the ship. This is the type of comedy used throughout the anime, so if that is the type that you enjoy, check it out.\r\nFun for high school/slice of life/romance fans.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: Youwant a love story that takes the scenic route. Will they date each other and end up together? Who knows\u2026\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a storyline that constantly progresses. They could have completed the season in 12 episodes instead of 24.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Be prepared for Risa to be all over the place emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nEXPANDED REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nSLC Anime reviewed Lovely Complex this month. There was a general consensus that it was a good anime with more pros than cons.\\n\\n\r\nIt was mentioned by several people that it is an enjoyable slice of life anime, even for those people that do not particularly enjoy slice of life. The characters were believable. The way that they acted made sense for kids in high school. There was distorted faces when someone would go right or wrong, or when a character was feeling particularly emotional. The way their faces would distort made sense for the situations and helped portray how they really felt. The characters were cute and sweet, while they still had there flaws. This helped make them more believable as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses a lot on the height difference of the main short guy and tall girl, and the tall girls in the SLC Anime group said that they could relate to that feeling of towering over a boy in high school and how rough that could be to the high school mentality.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive to the anime\u2019s credit is how they break from Japanese norms for anime by having a transgender character that is accepted as an actual character instead of being a comedic side character that gets made fun of.\\n\\n\r\nThe last positive note was how Lovely Complex struck a chord with one of the SLC Anime group members because they mentioned how the relationship of the two main characters in the anime reminded them of their high school relationship with their now-wife. One of them was chasing the other throughout high school while the other had no idea, and then they ended up together at the end of high school. I know, very sweet story indeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe down side to Lovely Complex was the slow progression of the storyline. There were several episodes that would pass and feel like filler episodes. There were several episodes that felt like the same episode, only set in a different location. There were several episodes where Risa would confess her love to Otani, and then in the next episode it would be like the confession never happened. It felt like they could have made this 24 episode anime in 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SLC Anime enjoyed and approved of Lovely Complex.",

            "content": "I have to begin with saying that Lovely Complex is my favourite anime of all time EVER, but I'll try my best to make this a 'fair' review and not too biased. \r\nFirst off, the characters - probably my favourite part about this anime. The two main characters both have 'height complexes' - the guy is way too short and the girl is way too tall. They're both very self conscious about this, causing them to always fight with each other but in a friendly kind of way. Risa then realises she is in love with Otani, and the anime basically revolves around her tryingher best to get him to recognise her feelings. But it's not that simple. Otani, is completely and utterly oblivious to Risa's feelings even if she comes out and says it bluntly. \\n\\n\r\nRisa is a great character - she's hilarious, stubborn, always throwing tantrums and getting angry at Otani because he is so dumb. But she's also really cheerful and talkative, and her and Otani get on really well as friends because they share the same interests e.g in music.\\n\\n\r\nOtani is also a fantastic character - he's also funny, arrogant (he always acts like he's really cool when everyone disagrees), defensive of his height, he gets embarrased easily but this is just him on the surface. Underneath this, he's really really sweet and a genuine, caring person - and I think I like him so much because he reminds me of myself (???)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is seriously so funny, I've rewatched it many times and from the first episode it has you laughing and smiling and you never want to stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the two main characters is really, really interesting for me. They hate eachother one second then the next second they're best friends. And when they finally get together (not really a spoiler, you knew it was coming) they're such a cute couple in their own way!\\n\\n\r\nTo just add on - some people don't like the art, and I can see why, because at times its not amazing, but I find the characters are cute and I actually love the soft, natural colours used. The facial expressions are so over the top making them hilarious. The opening and ending songs are catchy and I loved them, having said, they're nothing special to be honest - but the lyrics relate to the anime so it's cute.\\n\\n\r\nI seriously doubt you'll find an anime like this one - the characters, the story, the jokes, the romance, the EVERYTHING is unique and just great. I enjoyed every second of it. If you're looking for an anime like this - look no further! You have to watch this one!\\n",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\nThis is a very pure romantic comedy, which is perfectly fine.  The story is simple, and easy to follow, and while there aren't a lot of twists, there clearly aren't supposed to be.  Its supposed to be small story of two people, and how their relationship develops, and grows.  And it works in that way.\r\nThat said, there are points were the rom-com tropes hold the story back.  Occasionally, events can be engineered to throw another wrench into their romance, and it can get somewhat overdone at times.  Obviously one of the primary jokes of the series is the strongdiscrepancy in height between the two of them, and while that joke can get somewhat overplayed, particularly as the story drags on, its not the only thing about their relationship, which makes it all the more authentic.  In addition, the story, intelligently, also describes the personal issues the characters face because of their height, particularly with Koizumi.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe show has a very distinct, and very recognizable style, and its a good one too, allowing for a lot of colorful expressions and visual humor.  I particularly like the character designs, and the colors they use on different characters that give them clear identities; like the pinkish red for Koizumi, and light brown for Otani.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe real strength of this series is with its characters, particularly the leads. Their relationship is very authentic and believable, and one can clearly see its development from the series start.  That said, Otani can be a little too dense at times, not wising up to Koizumi's feelings for maybe a little longer than necessary, and the reason given for why he initially turns her down is rather weak (I get what the story is going for, but it could've been more clear).  The other cast is fine, but they are mostly fairly one note, mostly existing to offer support, or complicate the leads' relationship some more.  But they aren't the focus; the focus is where it should be, on the leads, and to that end, it really does work.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThere is a lot to enjoy in this, with it again primarily lying with the characters and their relationships.  But that said, there can be a little too much teasing throughout the story at times, particularly in the first half, before they become a real couple.  You know from the first five minutes that the two are going to end up together, and to be fair, the show doesn't really try to pretend that they aren't.  But there is a degree of patience needed when approaching this anime, and it can be frustrating at times when how much they tease it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nRomantic comedies are not for everyone, and to that end, this series is probably the same.  But there is some good writing, good art, and really good characters to enjoy here.  Give it a try if one has time.",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is about a girl(Risa) whose height is above average and a boy(Otani) whose height is below average. These two have always been friends and are often mistaken as a comedy duo. That is until one day Risa start's to look at Otani in a different eye.\r\nIt's story sounds very simply, which it is. However it is executed extremely well. The height difference is handled with care and is never made really awkward. The story itself is a romantic comedy and it holds up to it's name. This has to be one of the funniest anime's I have seen. From the bickering between Otaniand Risa to the amazing sarcastic nature of the their friends. I have never laughed so hard at something before in my life. Comedy however isn't the only thing that this anime brings to the table. No it brings some very well done drama into the mix. There will be several moments that will have you reaching for the tissue boxes.\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex's characters make the series. Koizumi Risa is someone you can't help but love and cheer for her throughout the series as she try's to get her love across. Her perseverance throughout the series is truly inspiring, she overcomes many obstacles and no matter what she always keep's pushing forward. We can't forget our main male lead Otani Atsushi. Otani come's off as incredibly stupid, and I mean incredibly stupid. But he isn't in the least bit, he is just really innocent. He is just your average high school boy who has yet to realize his feelings and thus causes him to act the way he does. The series is more of Otani trying to find himself, and while it is a long bumpy road it is definitely worth the wait. \\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex's art isn't something extraordinary or ground breaking. The character designs are really well done and there is a lot of attention to detail in the environment. But the main success of it's art is just that it is easy to look at. You have a lot of great color's that come out and support the characters well. Nothing new, but it's done well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track in Lovely Complex is simply amazing. It's songs like the art isn't something really new or anything along those line's. But it just highlights the scene's and adds so much more emotion to the each and every single detail. I honestly don't believe I would've enjoyed this series as much as I did without the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Lovely Complex is a great anime. It's a prefect balance of Comedy and Drama, it will have you falling out of your seat laughing while at the same time jerking at your heart strings. Lovely Complex may have some faults throughout the series, but they do not stop this series from being truly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd i thank you for reading my first review. I am sorry that you had to struggle with my awful grammatical errors. If you notice any mistakes or ways i can improve please send me a message and again thank you.",

            "content": "Lovely Complex always kept popping up whenever I'd search for a relaxing romance anime. For some reason, though, I kept prolonging its viewing but, after watching it, I don't know why, to be honest. I guess, at time, I had some better priorities. \r\nThe first thing I want to talk about is art - for me, it took at least 3 to 4 episodes to get used to it, to be honest. I'm not sure whether that'll be the case for you, but I just wanted to spill it out. As other reviewers stated, it has the vibe of Bokura Ga Ita but only whenthe art is actually serious. The animation, at least at the beginning, seemed stiff and lacking but it grew on me as the episodes passed. The backgrounds were actually pretty decent, which struck me by surprise. All the characters are different, with their own, unique traits. \\n\\n\r\nAt the other aspects, Lovely Complex really took me in. It's funny - no, it's REALLY funny. I kept laughing episode after episode, which I didn't do ever since I watched School Rumble. That's why I said it's relaxing at the very beginning. It has drama, mind you, but it's not something that will make you want to kill yourself. It's kind of a self-study drama, allowing you to learn without some massive effects on its viewers. I really appreciated that since that's exactly what I've been looking for. While other reviewers are stating that this is somewhat different and unique look at romance, I must disagree there. You have a girl and a guy and the obstacles - there's nothing unique to it but the execution is near to flawless as it can get. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story itself, it's your pretty standard \"girl must win over a guy's heart\" type of thing. There aren't many twists (I'm not certain if there are any, to be honest) and it's somewhat straight-forward. Still, what I liked is the pacing - it was actually pretty fantastic and after watching Kimi ni Todoke this looked like a super-sonic fast train in compliance. The story follows our comedian duo, Risa & Ootani. They're always bickering and teasing each other, but even after the first episode you realize they're a perfect match. If only the things were that simple, aye? \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I can't say there's a whole load of them, but what's there is unique and somewhat extravagant. You have Risa, hyperactive tall girl (I was really surprised to learn that girl in Japan is considered too tall if she's over 170) who never had a boyfriend in her life. Then you have Ootani, probably the most dense high school kid you will ever meet but also caring and daring at the same time. Then you have two other couples, one all lovey-dovey and one all shy. There are also some other sub characters with some decent personalities, but most of the story is resolved around those 6 people (well, mostly 2, but other 4 get their screen time). All characters are fresh and, while it took me some time to get used to their VA, I quickly fell in love with them. They do overkill on every topic, they over-think everything, they dare dream and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex might not be perfect and it might not be epitome of rom-coms, but it's amazingly well-crafted, hilarious,  sweet and loveable. While it has strong beginning and ending, middle part is not as good; still, it doesn't take away from overall enjoyment of the series. I watched all 24 episodes in the course of 3 days, and the thought \"Oh God, please end\" never popped up in my head. As the matter of fact, after finishing it, I wanted more. It leaves you with a sweet taste and the ending provides great satisfaction to all they've been through. \\n\\n\r\nRemember guys, height doesn't matter - as long as the girl isn't taller than a guy! \\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDED",

Reading most of the reviews it didn't sound bad, but for me it was.\r\nBiggest problem for me is that it had fit into ~12 episodes, but not 24. Too long did it look like the producers streched it.\r\nStarting with the chars, beside the two MC's no other char got a development at all. After the two first episodes they are all still standing the same way. Some got dumped, some showed up later but it doesn't gave something for the story whatsoever.\r\nTalk about chars, let's get the maleone first: Not only dense, a total assburger. Shoving the girl away ~3 times and still don't break up with her, what a mess. He just pissed me off so much, i needed to FF sometimes.\\n\r\nNow the female char: Running for a guy at ~3 jeahrs, gets dumped repeatly and still goes for him? I know it is not RL, but still, this is an alternate universe.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, sometimes i like that kinda shows, but this just dissapointed me.",

            "content": "Ever watched a rom-com drama where you are tearing your hair out in agony, mixed with anticipation, mixed with joy, over the leads getting together?  That's the emotion evoked by the lovably dense, starring characters of this remarkable anime.\r\nLovely Complex (also know as LoveCom) is the story of two high school \"frienemies\" know as Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani.  These two butt heads in everything, yet are so similar they can't avoid becoming friends.  The problem?  They have a massive height difference.  With Otani clocking in 16 centimeters shorter than Risa, the friends are an amusing laughing stock to therest of the school and are likened to the famous All Hanshin Kyojin comedy duo.  From there, I'll let your imagination and curiosity do the rest.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, the story follows a typical highschool rom-com, but does it as well as it can be done.  The characters are ultimately where this show shines the brightest.  Risa and Otani are intensely stubborn individuals who can't pick up the basic signs put off by the other when it comes to romance.  The supporting cast is also perfect and bolsters the leads in ways that fit where they perfectly need to.  (This show is a great basic example of gender difference and how females and males give/read signs poorly when it comes to infatuation.  It's extremely amusing if you look to it on that level as well.)\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the show has a great first opening/ending theme that embodies perfectly the awkward fun and romp you are going to experience.  That being said, the second opening is lacking.  When episode 14 hit and the change happened, I have to say my first reaction was extremely disappointed.  The best that can be said about it is that it shows the progression into the \"second act\" of the story from that point on.  Other than that, it's just a poppy tune that doesn't do the anime's overall \"body\" and feel justice like the first did (the second ending is decent, not much to say there).  The in-show music pieces are very soothing to the ear and I enjoyed hearing the familiar tunes when they played (e.g. much like Maid-Sama! if you know where I'm coming from).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very spastic (if I had to pick a word to embody it).  When it wants to be extremely ridiculous and funny, it nails it.  When it wants to be dramatic, serious, or romantic, it nails it.  (I especially like how Risa, as a female heroine, is portrayed as very naturally beautiful by going from hilariously ugly in the comedy bits to being very naturally cute when the artists want her to be.)  All in all, the art is exactly what it needs to be and captures the show's moods perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't consider this show for a rating of 10.  It accomplishes exactly what it wants to and is compelling when it comes to its character development.  I felt very satisfied by the end of this journey and was able to leave with a good sense of closure.  However, as I only use 10 for total \"flawless\" masterpieces (beyond just the category of enjoyment), a more level-headed rating is to be given (if a 9.5 rating was possible, I'd give it).\\n\\n\r\nThis show definitely ranks with the greats when it comes to the romantic drama genre (Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, Kimi ni Todoke, Toradora!, Clannad, etc.) and deservedly so!  The anime packs a punch on the comedy level, but also can get easily sentimental when it needs to.  It truly is just what it claims to be.....a lovely, lovely complex.",

            "content": "The first time that I watched Lovely Complex was arguably three years ago. Since then, it's been my go-to anime whenever I don't have an anime to watch. So if you're asking me if this anime has rewatchable-status, I'd say: \"Yes; yes it does. Plenty.\" \r\nStory: 8\r\nI've seen (what I'd consider) a good amount of romance based, shoujo, and (reverse) harem anime. Although the story's are all unique in their own certain light, most of these anime take a very conventional approach. Of course the boy likes girl/ girl likes boy, they (possibly) get together is inevitable, but what happens in between is what initiallyshapes the story and makes it memorable. Lovely Complex is surely a unique jab at the genre. For those of you who don't know what the story's about, it's about a girl named Koizumi Risa who happens to be taller than the average female, and a boy Otani Atsushi who is shorter than the average male. Because of their height complexes, they find it difficult to find someone who will accept them, and they find it daunting to do a lot of things in life because they're constantly made fun of. These two constantly argue about their height amongst other things. They're usually referred to as All Hanshin Kyojin because of this. Behind their bickering they have a lot in common and complement each other very well. This may seem conventional to boot, and yes: it's a pretty basic plot. But it's the story that's unique. Unlike most shoujo's, Risa realizes her feelings very quickly, and it all just goes uphill from there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThere's really not much to say about the art. If you want some glossy art style, this anime isn't for you. Go watch Special A if that's really what you desire. It's not glossy, but it's charming. I'm a big fan of the character design, I think it matches their personalities really well. This anime is really comedy based, which makes for a lot of... \"bizarre\" faces and reactions. When you come to terms with the fact that this isn't just an anime about love, you'll begin to accept it. I'll admit, it took me a little to get over it, but it certainly wasn't important. It added to the humor of the show, which is initially the whole point.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n\"Kimi + Boku = Love?\" has to be one of my all-time favourite theme songs. There are a few that come close (Nana, Death Note) but no theme song can make me get up and dance like an *cough* AHO (if you've seen LoveCom or heard someone from Osaka speak, hopefully you get my reference hehe). If I'm not dancing around in my underwear, I'm singing along. Most of all, I like the lyrics. Usually when lyrics are translated they end up making no sense whatsoever. But these lyrics really correspond to the show. The second theme song I have finally warmed up to. At first it threw me off, but now I find it sort of fun. I liked both of the ED's, and the corresponding images. The in-show score can sometimes get repetitive, but if you're not going crazy marathoning, it shouldn't be too bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI think that this is the first time in an anime that I have ever -- like ever -- given a perfect score. I cannot express how much I enjoy these characters. Sometimes they're a bit fickle and simple minded, but who am I to complain? When I've liked a guy, I'm often thinking, \"I'm done. Wait, no. Actually, yes. I don't like him. Okay, I do. He pisses me off. He makes me so happy.\" It's just what high school students do. Of course these characters have their flaws (Risa is somewhat of a crybaby and Otani is dense as hell) but even with that weighing them down, they're great characters. I'm so tired of watching shoujo's with mindless bishies. Bishies, I find, are usually only there to look hot and be mysterious. I don't know what kind of girls actually find that endearing, but I find it fucking annoying. Get a personality. Luckily, Lovely Complex doesn't have that. Risa and Otani are so different than anything that I've seen in an anime. They act like real people. They're not broody, mysterious and secretly sad inside, waiting for someone to knock down the walls that they spent building. They're just people. That's the end of it. As for the secondary characters, they're really only there to be secondary characters. There is only one episode that doesn't completely revolve around Otani and Risa. But that's all right. Even though their friends are not the main focus, they still have plenty of personality. Nobu-chan is probably one of the best friends that someone could ever have. She's kind and modest, but she'll kick you in the ass if she has to. Chiharu is timid and quiet, but her friends really mean a lot to her. As for their boyfriends, I prefer Nakao. He's such a minor character with a limited amount of lines, but when he does speak, it's usually simplistically funny. As for the other characters that get introduced, I can only think of one that I reallllly didn't have a hankering for. The chemistry between all of these characters is seriously flawless. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI think the fact that I've told every one of my anime-watching friends, forced my sister, and my mom to watch it, says something. I've at least seen this anime 5 times through. I'm usually trying to find a new anime that I can watch to pass the time, but rarely do I find one that I'm so wrapped up in. The dynamic between the two main characters is really unlike something I've seen before. This anime also does a very respectable job of balancing the comedy and the romance. Usually an anime can specialize in one well, but very rarely does an anime do both of them well. I can finish this anime in a day, no problem. I laugh, I cry, I feel happy, and I feel sad. A problem that a few people have with this anime is that the ending is anti-climatic. And to he honest, it is. But why is that bad? I think for something outstanding to happen  on the last episode would just be unrealistic and too expected. The ending is exactly how it should be in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is, without a doubt, one of my favourite anime ever. My anime watching career was spoiled since I watched this anime early on. Every time I watch a new romance I'm left thinking \".___. this isn't as good as Lovely Complex.\" Seriously, it messed me up. But I appreciate this story so much. It gives me hope for future shoujos. If you want a great rom. com, I heavily recommend this one. As cliche as it sounds, it has everything AND MORE. It's great for all audiences, and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me. I hope you give it a chance!",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is my favorite rom com anime by far.  \r\nSTORY : Best friends.  Girl is tall and boy is short.  Girl likes boy.  Boy likes girl as a friend.  It's nothing really special, but most plots in anime are boring but can be so enjoyable.  This is one of those.  Most of the series is just the girl trying to get the guy.  \r\nART : LOVE THE ART.  Everything is so bright and sunny.  I think Risa is such a pretty character.  Otani is pretty cute, too.  The rest of the casthas kinda weird looking characters.  It reminds me of Bokura ga Ita.  \\n\\n\r\nSound : Koizumi's voice is decent, although I wish she didn't say Otani they way she did.  It fits her character.  I really like Otani's voice.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Risa and Otani are practically the same person in different bodies.  They are super quirky and crazy.  Tbh, I didn't care for anyone else besides those two.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : This anime made me laugh and cry. It's mostly comedy, but there were a few parts I got teary eyed for Risa.  She's a really relatable character.  I stayed up until 3 just to finish marathoning it because it was so good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : Wasn't a cheesy rom com.  It had good character development. Also, you could see the feelings develop through out the episodes.  Most rom coms just have the characters like each other right off the bat.  It's a lot about unrequited love, which I think is somewhat uncommon in animes.  Watch it, it's a lot of fun.",

            "content": "The most annoying thing about this anime is the Kansai-ben that starts to grate on your sensibilities if you have been watching anime spoken in standard Japanese for a while. The other annoying thing is the use of too much slap-stick during the inital parts of the anime . \r\nHowever, once you adapt or ignore these aspects, the story itself is quite engaging and somewhat interesting even if you couldn't care about romance and the like. The humor is mildly entertaining even if it is too base in its methods. \r\nOn the characters side, there are some inaccuracies that are disturbing. The male characters areall pretty much 2-dimensional and dry while the female characters are more detailed. This could be because the anime is aimed at female audience but even that fails to compensate for lack of character depth. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime is a passable 7/10 .",

            "content": "Lovely Complex Review\r\nStory : Koizumi Risa, a 170cm taller-than-the-average-girl, asks for the help of Atsushi Otani, a 150cm shorter-than-the-average-boy for help with her love affairs, and vice versa. Unfortunately, and quite predictably, this is a disaster, especially when, horror of horrors, Risa realises she's falling in love with Otani! What follows is Risa's heartwarming quest to get the guy of her dreams to fall in love with her.\r\nArt : The art is brilliant. I love Risa's changing hairstyles and the little touches and changes that showing them growing up, but so slightly that it's only when you're presented with flashbacks you can actually tell. \r\nSound: I loved the soundtrack. My favourite was the piano/strings in 'World's End' and also 'Dry Tears', a piano track. Even the opening and ending music was mirroring the feel of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Each character, even the rivals, are likable. Watch out for Haruka and Nobu-chan as two hysterical characters you won't be able to stop laughing at. Risa is a brilliant heroine and Otani is the type of guy you'd want on your arm. Brilliant heartwarming characters who you will love and miss once you've finished the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I couldn't pull myself away from this anime for even a minute. It starts off with 170cm taller-than-average girl, Koizumi Risa, joining forces with a 152cm shorter-than-average guy, Atsushi Otani, to get the girl and guy they like.\\n\r\nWhat happens in the next 24 episodes will have you laughing, crying, and clutching at your chest as you watch them, and their friends (watch out for Nobuko, Risa's best friend, and Haruka as golden characters) grow up and fall in love. You can't help but love every last character, even the rivals like Mimi-chan. Each episode is well worth watching and the whole anime wastes no time in trivial matters, throwing itself into each minute with abandon. And you, as you watch it, will probably do the same.",

But anyway this anime made an impact on me and that's why i'm writting a review about it.\r\nI'm not the kind of person who will get hooked on an anime due to itspopularity or because it ranked high on MAL. If your not a big fan of romance and considering trying the genre anyway just like me, Lovely Complex will not disappoint you. I guarantee you that much even though im new to this reviewing thing. \\n\\n\r\n*minimal spoilers- Read at own risk*\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story it self is brilliant and amazing. The pace has been set perfectly and you dont feel rushed and the need to catch up like other romance anime out there that has alot of scenes from the past but it still makes the same impact on you. As a guy i find it hard to get into romance anime but if im writting this and your a girl who havent watched the series yet then i suggest you do because if i manage to enjoy this, then theres no reason why you wouldn't. The main protagonists characteristcs in the anime makes the story it self unique. A lot of people can relate to the story, as the saying says \"Love is Blind\". We don't know who were going to fall inlove with and this anime in my opinion truly shows that. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nArtwise not one of the best art out there as this came out more than half a decade ago, But it has its special touches that works with the anime. To me the art looks very chilled and you dont get that feeling that the anime is trying to hard to connect with the audience and to me that is special and impressed me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is incredible one of the best i've seen so far because the anime doesn't leave and have a side-story but focus more on them and allows the main characters to grow on you. For me this is the most important part of an anime is the character growth not in the anime but on the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime more than i expected. I thought this was going to be one of the anime that will need to be dropped at the first few episode. But no its the complete opposite! Lovely Complex got me hooked already in the first episode and that rarely happens to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm giving it 9/10 as there is space for improvement but not enough bad comments i can say to have it lower than what I have given to it so far.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you have stuck with me on this review! Just give it a go if you havent already watched it! \\n\r\nAs this is my first review i am open for comments about it and how to make it better! Thank you :)",

            "content": "Overall\t\r\nI must say I really fell in love with this show during the very first episode. Sadly, it didn't last. The first few episodes are great and promising, but pretty soon the story gets stuck and never really gets anywhere.\r\nThis show is very reminiscent of ToraDora and School rumble, but where the former is cousy and heartwarming and the latter is darn funny, \"Lovely complex\" turned out to be neither, but just a tedious waste of time.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nI really love this art style, all the characters are wonderfully designed with a pretty non-standard-anime look, and there are plenty of hilarious facial expressions.\r\nToo bad the animators failedbig time with making the characters move and interact with their surroundings. The animation is is stiff and generally bad.\\n\\n\r\nStill, a high score for marvellous character design.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: The drawing style reminds me a lot of the \"Power!!\" manga, btw. Could be made by the same people, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nOP/ED suck (plus, the animations during the songs are mostly just cut-and-paste from the epidodes). Voice acting is not great but not bad either. I guess the bad animation adds to the feeling of akwardly performed voices.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nLike School rumble (and most other high school romantics) the story consist entirelly of nervous hesitating people trying to confess their love for each other. It gets really tedious, and the story could have been compressed into 12 episodes at most. As it is, most of the episodes are fillers and everything is generally very slow paced.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason for the yawn-factor is that the series focuses on only two people and their love story. If the side characters had gotten more screen time and interesting subplots this could have worked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nMost of the characters are likeable and nice, but the only ones that really get any attention are Risa and Otani. Despite their 26 episodes of screen time, they hardly manage to develop at all. Neither do the supporting characters (well, in the last few episodes they actually get to show some interesting sides of themselves), and they are mostly there as a background.",

            "content": "This is a completely girly shoujo anime and I love it! It's about a super tall girl who falls for a really short guy and it's done in a really sweet and funny way and to me,  does feel the way high school love felt, full of doubt, confusion, desire, and DRAMA. I think what I like best is that their romance is not based on love at first sight, they actually dislike each other quite a lot to begin with, but then come to see that they have a lot in common and their personalities are really good for each other. When Otaniis down, it's Risa who shouts him into shape and when he needs help, she never lets him down. Whenever they forget that they hate each other and let their guards down they end up having a really great time. And falling in love isn't easy at all; Risa is the one who likes him at first, and he doesn't immediately love or hate her, he just doesn't know what he wants and it drives her crazy. I think when I was in high school, life was like that, nothing was really that simple. I also really love the humor, especially the hilarious faces they make. I think it's funnier than it is romantic, and I like it. \\n",

It provided me with a lot of laughter!\r\nStory:8\r\nThe story was interesting as they went through high school with their friends. Throughout the whole story there was just enough romance to keep me interested and fangirl-ing over the lovey dovey side but often made me laugh throughout the anime. However the story at times frustrated me as it was slow paced and was on and off with the romance. The plot was interesting as well as the concept of a tall girl and short boy!\r\nArt:7\r\nThe art couldhave been better in this anime but it was unique as the female protagonist was not a bishoujo (in my opinion anyway). I however found the scenery rather intriguing especially the fireworks that was a very memorable part. I believe the art was made to be funny as throughout the  anime the expression of each character was very dramatic and really made me laugh. This is only a personal opinion but I would have rather the characters be better looking but that may only be my fangirl side. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme was catchy but not really my style. The voices of each character was distinctive and at times hilarious! The sound matched with their dramatic expressions was really interesting to watch during this anime. The small background music was good and was rather fitting towards the situation nothing unnecessary! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons why i absolutely loved this anime! Each character was different and had their own little perks! I loved the concept of a small boy and a tall girl it was really adorable to watch! Otani and Koizumi were both strong characters and the way they interacted with other characters caused a laugh every time! Following their adventures made me want to cheer them on!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEvery episode caused me to laugh I think I even cried laughing! Even when I re-watched this anime I still laughed even though I saw everything coming! I enjoy my comedy a lot but sometimes I needed to see the romance (as you do as a teenage girl) and the anime delivered! At times my heart ached for the characters!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nIf you love comedy with a dash of romance you will love this anime! If you're sick of all the cliche romance animes this is definitely for you. It's pretty unpredictable. The concept is interesting and unique so if you're looking for something different but still following the genres of a romantic comedy! WATCH LOVELY COMPLEX! (3 TIMES OVER!!!!)",

Out of ALL of the anime i have seen, I may consider this my favorite. Its beyond funny, has the perfect plot-line, anyone can get into it. Its simply about a tall girl and a short boy (The opposite of what people think is normal) And they try to help each other get a romantic life. In the process they slowly (And I mean slowly) fall in love. I would recommend it to ANY type of anime lover!",

            "content": "As a male sometimes it can be difficult to find a good shoujo romance. In general I find them more mature and reasonable than shounen romance, but some of the targeting affect miss the mark on me. However, Lovely Complex is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time. In fact it was on my top 10 a year or two ago. It is a very relaxing, funny, and cute show that avoids many of the pit holes I see in other romantic comedies.\r\nThe story follows Risa and Ootani, whose nicknames are 'Amazoness' and 'chibi' (midget) in reference to their height. They are knownin school for being a pair of comedians despite their best efforts to avoid acting as such. To this I can testify that the two of them are indeed a perfect pair of comedians. The show had a really good sense of humor: Good enough for even the serious person I am to admit it. While the show has a similar amount of drama to other shows, the comedy really helps to prevent the drama from overwhelming you by keeping the show bright and happy.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things in this show is that Risa is as active in the story as Ootani. I find it frustrating that many female leads in shoujo shows let the male interest take the spotlight, and do most of the 'things' to make the show what it is (this is obviously vise versa in shounen). However, this show does a good job of making both sides proactive, and letting all the characters carry weight in the show. Perhaps that wasn't well phrased so I will reword it as neither of the leads outshines the other. They are a very good fit together, and it is hard to get tired of seeing the two of them interact.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show play an important role as well. I felt like all the characters acted really real, aka not making really illogical mistakes, and fit into the story well. Overall, I think the characters possessed the necessary amount of depth to make the show a blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is simple, after all it is a drama, romantic, comedy. The arcs are very well executed, so that I never felt irritated at the characters actions nor felt as if the situation was dragging on too long. Being twenty four episodes long, they fit all the story and comedy together very nicely. It is hard to elaborate more than saying that I can only recall loving this show for it. The art style is pretty modest especially being made in 2007, but I think it is also somewhat unique and fits the show really nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, even after years I fondly recollect this show as possibly my favorite shoujo anime. I have thrown the weighted word 'shoujo' around, so I would like to clarify that was for comparison purposes. In fact, I think that this is a romantic comedy that almost anyone could enjoy, thus I suppose I should completely disregard tagging the show to a target demographic. As a very funny and cute romantic comedy I think this is a must see for those interested in a relaxing romance story.\\n",

We get together, rumors, we break up, we get together, and so on.\r\nLovely Complex focuses more on the insecurities of teenage romance and is extremely relatable, especially for girls, but maybe even so for boys...\r\nThough the art isn't always top notch and the character development is a little minimal, you're drawn to not even think about it as you laugh at \"All Hanshin Kyojin\" ever-so-funny Otani and Koizumi, who always either have theother's back or at each other's necks. Or drawn by the passion of Nobuko and Nakao, or the adorable shy atmosphere of Suzuki and Chihara. \\n\r\nOtani and Koizumi, along with their height complexes, are extremely unique and Lovely Complex is defiantly worth watching.",

If you're a sucker for romance and comedy, then I highly recommend this anime to you.\r\nStory:\r\nA slightly smaller from the average height guy(Otani) and a slightly taller from the average height girl(Koizumi) are classmates in a high-school and keep on teasing and insulting each other. Therefore, they're called The All Hanshin Kyojin, after a pair of comedians with a similar height difference. They become good friends when one day, Koizumi suddenly realizes she sees Otani more than just a friend, though she doesn't admit it at first...Is it possible for a girl be together with a guy smaller than her?..\\n\\n\r\nI think the story is very unique which is the main reason why I give this anime's storyline 10 points. This anime breaks (so to speak) lots of &quot;society rules&quot; or &quot;stereotypes&quot; or &quot;idealism&quot; such as, when you have a boyfriend, he must be taller than you and etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm quite picky when watching anime: the art must be bearable for me.. and I just think the art here is good, although there are times the characters are oddly drawn, that's why I give it a nine for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background sounds are always PERFECT TIMING,adding an effect to what's happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nBoth characters' personalities are simply outstanding for me. I think the character development is good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, if you're a BIG SUCKER for romance/comedy animes with a slapstick humor, then this is the jackpot for you. Lovely Complex is the perfect anime for romance fans. It's sweet, funny... and extremely enjoyable! :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWell, I'd give it a ten... 'coz I'm a huge sucker for romance.",

This anime was just completely enjoyable and heartfelt.\r\nStory: It was great, not like most animes where the guy and girl fall in love immediately.It shows the steps and hardships that each go through to realize their feelings. It was comedic, lovable, and unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art wasn't the best, but it was great for this type of anime. It didn't need to be super artistic to tell the story the way it was. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Uh, it's sound. You can turn on the volume up if it's not loud enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You're going to grow to love every character. Even though the female protagonist is a bit of a baby, she plays it off well.

You have a good mix of chracters as you would have in a school, and the drama and romance was quite evident through the chracters, one would empathize them from time to time and would laugh at them at other times. They are an important factor that makes this anime so great.The flaws of the character also makes the shows more believable and enjoyable as it provides new twists in this complex story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a romantic comedy, and i personally feel that this anime fulfills the requirements of being so. It contains a huge amount of comedy as well as drama. It also has more romance then your typical romantic comedy which make it very enjoyable for me since i'm a Drama-romance anime fan.\\n\\n\r\n Lovely Complex is a romantic comedy not to be missed, probably one of the best, next to bokura ga ita.

            "content": "I usually try to find anime that I feeling peckish for. Sometimes I want to watch a comedy, other times a school romance. And sometimes, I give an anime a go and if I don't like it, I drop it. This anime was once of the rare instances that I watch an anime, I get hooked on it and in the middle of the show makes me want to get rid of it, but I keep on going because I'm very hooked. For that, I really enjoyed this anime! \r\nSure, at first glance, it's a typical school romance with a girl that likes a boyand the the boy likes her, but really it's more than that. I ran into this beautiful anime when I was done watching Toradora. I loved that anime so much I had to try this one too! And I found it very relaxing and hilarious. The main characters start out as friends, which made me very hooked because it's basically like real life. Most anime romance school stories are more the girl automatically loving the guy to death, when really in reality, it's not like that. As they go on in the school years together, they start to realize their feelings. Of course, without the obstacles a long the way, they start that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, it was a beautiful story with good ideas that went well. Good for you Lovely Complex! ;3\\n\\n\r\nOkay, enough of that, let's get on with business.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I guess I incorporated that in the intro of this review. xD But once again, it may seem like your average school romance, when it's may be some of that, it is much more. It gives new insight on how a anime can go, some realism in it and it can still be the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love the art in this anime. Very beautifully drawn and good color choices. I also love when they start going into chibi or some other form of parody. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Good music, I liked the opening and close songs, very well put in. And the background music was awesome as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I liked the character development in this story, not only as growth development, but also the romance development between characters. The characters personality were to die for and made this anime successful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved it so much, I laughed, I got angry and I cried with the characters. That rarely happens to me in some animes, but this is one of them that did. and for that, I give it a high score. And also it made me a fan of it that I actually saw the movie based on this anime, which I enjoyed as well. :3\\n\\n\r\nOverall: awesome anime! Good story and art. Combined with the characters development and hilarity, gives it a good anime. And it even makes me want to go see it again. So I say, YAY! :3 So watch and enjoy peoples! Enjoy!\\n\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10",

The story was touching and yet doesn't fail to keep you laughing for hours.\r\nLovely Complex is one of your typical high school romance comedy series. The story revolves around Otani Atsushi and Koizumi Risa, through-out the series, you will see how Risa have tried so hard to get Otani to love her, despite him claiming that they are too close to have a relationship.\r\nThe drawings are just exceptionally beautiful, and the scenes were all very well done. The voicing were just awesome! =) it really puts you in the picture, and lets you feels what the characters are feeling and what they are going through.

            "content": "I'd gotten plenty of recommendations for Lovely Complex in the beginning, however, my first impression of the details of it weren\u2019t great - it seemed like it'd be a very clich\u00e9 rom-com shoujo leaving not very much emotion or originality. However, once I had started watching it, my opinion completely changed, and I can say that this is one of my favourite shoujo animes.\r\nThe story focuses on the main two protaganists - Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani - and their friendship and how it eventually develops into a relationship. The story handles the romance aspect very well. Unlike other shoujos, which often have love thatseems unrealistic by happening too quickly, or having the characters confess at the end of the series, Lovely Complex had a very realistic pace to the relationship. It begins with their strong friendship by being known as the 'comedy duo' - and friends are all they are in the beginning. Koizumi realises her feelings, and puts up a fight to get the often dense Otani to realise them. The story is not predictable; at many times I found myself eager for the outcome of a situation which in any other anime would be obvious. This is a result of the dynamic character cast. The plot doesn't feature huge, overdramatic love triangles - opposing love interests enter the anime, but their stay is never out welcomed and they leave when due, never causing you to become really annoyed at the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this series is fantastic. I more often than not prefer dramatic romances over comedic romances, because I don't always find shoujo comedy to my tastes and find the themes overdone. However, the comedy in here often had me laughing out loud. Even if you're not a huge fan of the rom-com genre, you'll definitely enjoy the humour in Lovely Complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a realistic feel to it. Unlike other animes which have a lot of story progress over a short amount of time, this anime happens at a great pace. It takes place over 3/4 years of their high school life. It often has a slice-of-life feel, and I don\u2019t think there were any clich\u00e9 filler episodes. Aside from the romance and comedy, it deals with other coming of age issues like deciding on future plans, exams and physical insecurity, although it never gets over serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a very strong point in Lovely Complex. Koizumi, the main girl, isn\u2019t overly cute, clumsy and whiney, nor is she tsundere. Instead, she is very realistic \u2013 she can be funny, optimistic, friendly, strong-willed and brash, but she can also be emotional, insecure, indecisive and dramatic. Koizumi is extremely easy to relate to, particularly if you\u2019ve been in a similar situation to her character. Her character matures over the course of the series once she realises things and gets help from her friends.\\n\\n\r\nOtani\u2019s character is somewhat similar to Koizumi\u2019s in the way that he is also funny, friendly and insecure. However, he is also determined, caring and clueless, especially when it comes to Koizumi\u2019s feelings for him. Although he often seems carefree and dense, he also has a deep and mature side to him, often worrying about Koizumi even if he finds it hard to admit.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are also great. Nobu, Koizumi\u2019s best friend, is girly, helpful and assertive. She is a great best friend, often helping Koizumi, despite the fact that she can seem annoying at times. The rest of the supporting cast are also great \u2013 ranging from the quiet couple of Chiharu and Suzuki to the annoying but comedic Haruka and Seiko. \\n\\n\r\nThe art took me a little while to get used to, though once I did, I really enjoyed it. The changing clothes, hairstyles and individual fashion senses (in the girls mainly) were really interesting to see. The guys were all good looking in their own right without being the typical shoujo hero with floppy hair, pointy faces, shiny eyes and lanky bodies. The bright colours reflect the feel of the show and its characters. The opening themes were both quite nice and upbeat, and the background music throughout the show fit in perfectly. I really liked how all of the cast\u2019s accents reflected them living in Osaka and how noticeable their Kansai dialect was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Lovely Complex is a very good shoujo anime. It\u2019s the perfect mix of realistic romance and comedy, also showing great friendships. If you\u2019re looking for an anime that isn\u2019t too serious and focuses mainly on one couple rather than a love triangle with great characters, Lovely Complex is one to check out.\\n",

You might think that it\u2019s one of the typical anime that boy-meets-girl story but you are wrong. I love how the story was well-written and how the events evolve to another. Since this is romance comedy, I can assure you that it will really touch your heart and make you smile throughout the series. I also like the part that unlike the usual type of anime will just hug and hug and look at each other,this one has actually has kissing scenes, yet executed very cute and romantic. The struggles for both Risa and Atsushi were well shown that viewers can really adapt. \\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\r\nNice characters, very well drawn. They have justified the differences between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\r\nTo be honest, I forgot about the opening and ending songs, after listening to it for sometime, I just forward it immediately because I am so excited to see the next episode. But nonetheless, it still something that we can listen to. The background sounds definitely suits the mood makes it more romantic or dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime worth watching are the characters. They really made the story interesting, not just the two main cast, but also all the characters supporting around them. I am pretty sure that if you have watch this, you might relate yourself to one or two characters in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s a 10! I truly enjoyed this anime. I was just hoping that it\u2019s a little longer since it has only 24 episodes. I want to see more of the two main characters on how they will struggle their everyday life as a couple. \\n\\n\r\nOVER ALL - 10 \\n\r\nDo I need to say more? As my reviews from above, I am pretty sure you get the idea that I do love this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[A/N: You might agree or not with all the things I wrote down here, but of course, this is my opinion, I would love to hear you opinion as well. =)\\n\r\nPlease excuse any incorrect grammar, etc. And thanks for reading!\\n\r\n-black faerie, Yui]",

And dont just give me a \"This was not helpful.\" because it's short, i told you it was short, didn't I? Exactly. Anyway.\r\nLovely Complex is probably the best shojo anime I've ever watched that has a high school setting. Although some scenes are undoubtedly cliche, they have realistic twists that have actually made me weep a tear or two. (I d-didn't cry! There's a difference!) The characters are all people we can connect to and like, and theyare voiced perfectly. The music was great, and the art was also wonderful. If you're tired of extremely predictable romance animes but want something still cute, this is for you. \\n",

            "content": "First off let me say that I enjoy watching romantic anime, I've watched quite a few, including some of the highly rated ones and according to the score here on MAL, this show should be among them.\r\nI believe most of the good things about Lovely Complex were already said in other reviews, I'll just share what I didn't like about it.\r\n1. The two main characters get annoying real fast. \r\nSeriously, the heroine (Koizumi) cries literally every or every other episode, usually for no reason (period?) and her Japanese voice over (squeaky, high-pitched) started getting on my nerves within a couple episodes. I didn't have thatbig of a problem with to-be boyfriend Ootani's voice actor, besides that super fake laugh (almost robotic \"hahahah\"). \\n\\n\r\n2. Very slow story progress.\\n\r\nThis is a problem with most romantic anime(s), since there's just not enough \"content\" when it comes to love between (only) two people. Ever since you start watching the show, you know they get together sooner or later, what matters is the path towards their relationship, rather than the actual result. Now that would be completely fine, if so many romantic shows didn't have this many filler episodes. Every single time it almost seems like the pair might become a couple, some \"coincidence\" happens and all the progress characters made gets scratched. \\n\r\nShe tells him she loves him? Nope, he isn't paying attention at the moment or he's too dense to realize. He kisses her? Nope, that's just a misunderstanding. He tells her he feels the same way about her as she does about him? Nope, she falls asleep. \\n\r\nThe only result of that is the show acting like nothing happened and all that indicates any progress in the story are flashbacks and pointless monologues or thought processes that only act as another filler and have no meaning whatsoever.\\n\r\nThe solution? If the show is as straightforward as this one - only one possible love interest, no major plot twist, etc. - then there's no point at making it to 24 episodes (or even more). 12-13 eps would be more than enough.\\n\\n\r\nHalf of the show is about Koizumi trying to figure out her feelings / trying to figure out Ootani's feelings / trying to date Ootani / crying about everything / about Ootani being dense and playing hard-to-get even though it's obvious he likes her, and so on.\\n\\n\r\n3. It's really nothing special.\\n\r\n\"Complex\" because their heights are different, I get it. Is that enough to make the story interesting to me? No. What makes the show interesting are the characters and I really did like them at first, but as I said, 24 episodes is way too many and I got tired of them. The last couple episodes were pretty entertaining (18-24) and so was the beginning (before Koizumi sharing her feelings), but the empty spot in between 10th-ish and 18th episode was super boring, sadly.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, it's still somewhat decent anime with a couple of funny moments and \"feels\" moments, definitely not a 8-9/10, but a solid 6,5 for sure.\\n\\n",

It was sooo touching with the love between them. It surely is complex because of their heights but this also proves that it doesn't matter what kinks the person has like height or if hes like some punk weirdo, it only matters if you love the person forwho they truly are. Thats pure love right there.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the characters are funny. i like how they are always getting at each others nerves about their heights. \\n\\n\r\nSo anyways great anime you should watch it!",

            "content": "LovelyComplex was a spur of the moment watch for me. I didn't really expect anything out of it when I first started and I really didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did.\r\nLovelyComplex follows around the two main characters Koizumi Risa and Ootani Atsushi showing progression as their relationship being a Comedy duo that start trying to help each find a significant other. This ends up being difficult and problematic since Koizumi-san is around 180cm tall or around 5.6 feet where on the other hand Ootani-kun is on the other side of the equation being only 152 cm or around 5.1 feet significantly shorterthan majority of his classmates and a pebble compared to Koizumi-san.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I feel that the anime did okay in terms of telling the story, I have read bits of the manga and I know there are a couple things extra you get out of the manga compared to the anime and those would've added more depth to their relationship. Also, at the same time I can definitely see its flaws if your someone with a little less patience when it comes to story telling it may get a little difficult towards the middle and may feel a bit dragged out, which if you can suffer through I would say is worth it.  7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style being a little strange at first, you quickly get used too. It has its uniqueness to it for sure. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: There are moments in the anime that the background music or even the sound effects to add more to the scenes exist, but they really didn't get my attention and are not really remember-able. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters is where I think this anime shines in a good way and in a bad way. The supporting characters to both Ootani and Koizumi are good, but I feel they leave something wanting. They have nice personalities and they are relevant to majority of the story. But, again I feel its going back to not having much depth or background to them as I would've perfered, unfortunate cause I really enjoyed the cast of characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would say watch it, if you can deal with a little drag in the middle. But otherwise I would say the anime leaves off at a good place. Also, there is the manga to go too, if you feel a little un-satisfied. I have only read the last two chapters of the manga since its not really long and I can say there are somethings in the manga that I would definitely would've liked to see in the anime. I really did enjoy this anime and I think its a nice addition to the plethora of romance animes and comes with a bit extra with its sense of humor.",

Well if you want good drama and some heat warming romance you just can't ignore lovely complex.\r\nThe idea about a tall girl and a short boy is a very unique one and there are only a few anime or manga that fit these categories..\r\nThe story line and the plot of lovely complex are just amazing. The drama and romance are not overly unbalanced. The story line is a bit complex and also progresses at a slow pace. For me the ending was a bit satisfying but I'd like more from this show.\r\nThe art of lovely complexis just right and it syncs with the storyline. As for the sound, the characters voice actually syncs very nicely. I say this because when i saw the art i thought there will be flaws with the sound but I find it really good.\\n\r\nThe characters of lovely complex as I mentioned above are unique.... A romance between a short guy and a tall girl .... Problems faced by them because of their short and tall stature ..... You'll hardly find these sort of shows.\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed this show and recommend it as a must watch.",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is, as others have said, an incredibly sweet show. However I found it sweet for reasons other than the heart-melting romance and unbearably cute scenes between Risa and Otani. \r\nI think anyone can relate to Risa's character. Those who haven't experienced love may idealize it, and equate a perfect romance with something tangible like physical appearance. Risa is initially no different. She's never been in a real relationship and all she wants is to experience love- and she finally does, and in the most pure way. \r\nRisa and Otani learn what it means to like a person for who that person is, nomatter how much others may laugh or try to bring them down. The show demonstrates something very important: love isn't fulfilling in giving you the perfect person, but erasing the need for perfection.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series for anyone who knows what it's like to have something you're insecure about- and that's going to include a large amount of people. If you think, for whatever reason, that you don't deserve love, this show will teach you a lot of things. It'll make you feel gratitude for the smallest of moments, and the most unlikely of people.",

I usually forse myself the watch the first eps. But this one was amazing from the beginning until the end.. It`s a love story. Not from that type with lots and lots of tears and broken hearts and suffer.. Wait. I`m not right. There sure is such a thing but...that`s how it is with love stories...what i want to say is that here it`s in the perfect dose - not too much, not too little...It`s really funny andall of Risa`s problems are put in such a manner that you understand, u feel for her and in the same way u laugh at or with her. If you are a fan of the love animes than that`s one thing u MUST watch...and if you're not - don`t waste your time...people that don`t like the gender at all  will find it annoying and boring and too much like a soop opera...but the ones that DO enjoy it...they`ll find it at least as amazing as i did\\n\\n\\n\r\nSooo...

But... this anime tweaks a few things which makes it intresting and enjoyable to watch.\r\nStory: 8 - This story revolves around the Risa and Ohtani as the former is taller than average while the latter is shorter than the usual and as time goes by Risa realises she feels more for him than as friends. I liked this anime a lot because despite having an unoriginal story, it proves to us that by adding a few extra things can have a impact.\r\nArt: 8 - At times I found the arta bit sluggy but overall it was a good job as it fulfills its duty.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - I liked the soundtrack because it had a refreshing and youthful feeling which is necessary for this type of anime which is why I found the it good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - I think the main characters were done quite well as they contrasted and fulfilled each other perfectly even though I found the other characters a bit stereotypical but they are bareable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - Though i'm not up for rom-com shoujos as I find all of them them almost the same but if you're bored then you'll enjoy it. This anime is suited for people who can bare slow-paced series but overall you'll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Kimi Ni Todoke,\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Overall I liked this series for it's original element of troubles.

The art is no FANTASTIC but drawn this way it fits the comedic style, it was good. I so much enjoyed this series alot. This puts alot of other romance comedy animes to shame.

All the characters that we are introduced to are all very well developed and while we don't get a backstory on them when the time does come when we hear about their past it's all something we can closely relate to. I went through something incredibly similar in high school so this hit home for me. I've watched this series 4 times and enjoyed it every time. This anime tells you not togive up on someone or something. Always try your best and give it your all. Honestly with the way the world is now it is still true to this day! Try your best and don't give up at all! It told us that love can happen even in the most awkward situations even though it takes time. You just have to be willing to put the effort in. Easily one of the best anime around if you like rom com anime! The only thing left is for me to own this anime and my life is set. It tells such a in depth story that isn't seen these days! Enjoy life while you can and always give your all! There is someone out there for you, all it takes is time. This will show you that! Lovely Complex is one of the greatest of all time! This anime had a perfect ending so that no one is left disappointed and everyone leaves on a happy note! I highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys rom com's or just love those high school anime because this is perfect! Lovely Complex gets a 10/10 every time!",

It's a shoujo anime, with LOTS of comedy moments and romance, and some drama too. It's a light comedy, fun to watch and so innocent, without any sexual content. \r\nLet's begin... Story 8/10. \r\nIt's not really original. Lovely Complex tell us the story of a boy and a girl. The girl's name is Koizumi Risa, that is 172 centimetres and the boy, Atsushi Otani, is 156 cm. Because of their heights, they are called \"All Hanshin Kyojin\", a popularcomedy duo, that like them, have a similar height difference. That's basically what it is. I'm not really good explaining stories, sorry... \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art in LoveCom is simple and cute. The personages are very well drawn, but nothing really excepcional. Hot bishounens, like Maity-sensei and cute girls, like Chiharu and Mayu. Something I like about the art in Lovely Complex are the way their faces are designed, but I think it's just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe songs in Lovely Complex are great! They envolve you and are perfect for the story, especially the second opening, \"Hey!Say!\" by the group with the same name. The first opening is actually pretty good too and fun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nNot totally original, but they envolve you and in sometimes you feel the same they feel. When Risa is sad because Otani's stupidity, or when she is rejected, there is no way, you feel sad for her. Otani is a moron sometimes, but you learn to love him and he is just so cute. The others characters are pretty good too, like Risa's friends, especially Nobu-chan (I want a friend like that too!) and Nakao, Nobu-chan's boyfriend. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI gave a 9 because I think Lovely Complex is that much, it's really good. If you are a shoujo fan and even a romantic comedy fan, watch it, I'm pretty sure you will like it. The characters, the sounds, the story and the other things really make me love this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI cannot describe so good this anime and give something less than a 9. I don't have anything more to say. I just reccommend you: go and watch it! Because Lovely Complex is one of the greatest anime ever. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you like it!",

Unlike a lot of other romance involving the school scenario, this anime actually happens to show the span of their relationship through the entirety of high school.\nThe two main characters have great chemistry together, even though vastly different in physical aspects, they really have a lot in common allowing for them to be thrown into some really enjoyable scenarios. The supporting characters aren't really well made and I think they would really just linger around the two main characters.\nThe music for this anime is pretty good and sometimeshad me nodding my head to the beat, and the opening is great as well.\\n\\n\nThe art style is also very good its not a masterpiece, but at least it didn't have me thinking whether or not it was drawn by a 7 year old. \\n\\n\nAll in all, this anime is very enjoyable and if you like romance comedies you will love this one, but if not, still give it a shot, it's totally worth it.",

            "content": "My second review gonna try to keep it brief here since my first was pretty lengthy..... but dont count on it i have a tendency to go on. (FINAL COPY HAD TO RE EDIT so i deleted the previous they are just about the same though)\r\nLovely Complex\r\nStory- A love story between a boy(Otani) & a girl (Risa Koizumi) basically the story is between these two. Risa tries to find a boyfriend who she can love she has never dated or kissed anyone prior to that shes not the avg girl shes 172 cm tall which is tall for the avg highschool girl in japan.Otani is a person she walks home with they are like a comedy duo and best friends, he stands at 156 cm so Risa ends up falling for him eventually when they start to get closer and not as a comedy duo he rejects her at first and the story truly begins from their and her rocky 3 year journey to make Otani fall in love with her the same way she fell for him.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was decent nothing too special but the expressions in characters faces at times were really well done and overall i thought the art was good but nothing special stood out. I give the art an 8/10 because again the anime was made in 2007 or so and back those years ago things werent looking all great as they do now it looked good for its time.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The music is ok never really won me over or anything so i thought it was decent for the entire anime. Although the music never won me over or anything mainly cuz i was paying more attention to the story the music goes with the scenes throughout the show. The opening is really nice as well.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter- The characters that really glue you in are otani and Risa so im gonna talk about them entertaining comedy duo funny alot throughout the show Risa goes through plently of character development when it comes to trying to be with otani failing and changing the way she thinks failing and not giving up and failing and just moving on shes also clumsy talks alot, cheery, funny.and hides her inner feelings. Otani is kinda static throughout the series he doesnt really change a whole lot but as hes pressed with questions and all his character changes to suit the scene which is always important and it turned out to be quite decent. Their are other characters but these where really the only two that glued you in the other supporting characters perform their roles well.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- i enjoyed the anime quite a bit not a top 5 favourite probably a top 10 im a fan of romantic comedy animes as well as shoujo even though its not really \"guy stuff\" the show is enjoyable just for the fact that you want to see Risa get through the tough times and finally get what she deserved. Drama, suspense, laughter, the feels.\\n\\n\r\noverall- 10/10 honestly its a suprise to me to the art is outdated because the anime is like 8 years old sound is good but not the greatest although the categories are not all 10's overall i thought it was the perfect romance anime and when you become emotionally attached to something thats when you know that it is really good.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL JURISDICTION- Not your typical comedy, romance anime its alot deeper the story is really dang good and keeps you interested to see whats gonna happen next and really excells in the story area a somewhat kinda slow paced show when it comes to the love portion but fast paced in how they portray the years you will understand what i mean when you watch it and that  is what really makes it stand out compare to other romantic animes while others jump to having love at first sight Lovely Complex's story gives you a great feeling when its all said and done and when hard work pays off you have nothing left but good things to say because you put in all your effort and received the outcome you deserved. I feel like calling it a masterpiece but im not gonna go there its just a really outstanding story that builds and builds and then gives you exactly what you want by the end.\\n",

Others I enjoyed had weak endings or weak parts in between, but Lovely Complex was strong all the way from episode 1 to 24, I've even been recommended the manga from a friend as well.\r\nThis had me laughing out loud every episode, always put me in a great mood, and had me fall in love with each of the characters. \r\nThe animation is hilarious from the facial and body expressions to how a character can be romanticized one frame and quickly shown as comical in thenext.\\n\\n\r\nEvery time I finish an anime like this I like so much, I think I can't find something that will hit me the same way, but I'm always proven wrong and this anime did that for me.\\n\\n\r\nLovely Complex is about a short student and a tall girl who are a comedy duo, but things get complicated when the tall girl falls in love with the short guy. Each character is very flawed and its great to watch them argue with each other. One narrative the show talks about are the types of relationships students have with each other, and how other people can't see them dating each other, when neither of them cares about the height difference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like shouju anime, definitely check this one out, you won't be disappointed!",

Risa, a girl that is 172cm(tall for being a japanese girl). Otani, a boy that is 156cm(short for being a japanese boy). They have a very funny relation ship. they are frends, but allways want to beat the other one(only the first 3 episodes), andallways fighting for some reason. later on, Risa is getting strange feelings for otani. That otani is too dumb to understand(shame on you a-chan>:c). We follow their high school journey through risas eyes.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun with the anime ! I promise you! You will love it :D",

But dont let this stop you from watching, rather enjoyable. I hate the dude though!\r\nThe story, as i just explain, well half of the story anyway, is about some thick as hell boy who is dense as steel (is steel dense, i dunno, but something really dense, wait carbon, carbon is dense, diamond), and some needy as hell girl trying everything at her disposal to get him to love her. (if i were here i would have smashed that facewith a rolling pin, but then again the rolling pin would probably break because of the denseness of his brain). In the end its all happy though :)\\n\\n\r\nBut what peed me off about this anime was the fact that the guy was stupider than in most romance animes. In most romances it takes the guy about a few episodes, and even then its not very obviouse the girl likes the guy. \\n\\n\r\nIn this anime, the girl makes this so obviouse, i literally want to grab the guys face and ram it against a wall till his teeth break. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art i thought was ok, i mean not the best of art, but hey, i dont really care about art as long as the actual series was good. It had some pretty weird faces too. \\n\\n\r\nsound, i dont remember too much about sound but i know it got stuck in my head, and at first i liked it, then i started singing it (-_-), and then i started hating it. But it was all good. The sound was very good infact :) Oh yeah and i really liked the outro\\n\\n\r\nThe series was pretty enjoyable, especially the latter half of it, the first half was very, VERY, VERY fustrating! (Hate that dude). Seriously though, the dude is so ignorant of others feelings. Hes so stupid! Probably got dropped as a baby or something. \\n\\n\r\nBTW i have nothing against midgits, infact one of my friends is rather short, and i dont like calling him a midgit, but when someone is that dense, it agrivates me!\\n\\n\r\nAnwyays, so yeah, the series wasnt bad. Just the guy pissed me off, when he really came round to it, it was pretty good. But i suppose all of that denseness paid off when he finally realised. \\n\\n\r\nIf they could improve this series in anyway, LOVE TRIANGLE! That would have spiced it up a bit. I mean like a proper love triangle, not some crappy 1-2 episode one. \\n\\n\r\nBut thats just me. Others will probably disagree. (lol that rhymes)\\n\\n\r\nBye.",

The storyline felt so realistic that I worried about the characters like they were my friends! I can't understand how they did that,but the story just grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let me go. Even after I finished watching it, I've been thinking about the anime for a couple of weeks.  \r\n   I must mention that it is one of the funniest,if not theonly anime that is so hilarious!   Honestly, I laughed 90% of the time! 10% were me crying:)\\n\r\n    The development was very good, it didn't feel rushed or slow,but I wish there were more episodes!\\n\\n\r\n  Art-  the art style is very similiar to Ouran High School Host Club. At first, the drawing style seemed a bit odd.p,but I got used to it super fast.   The way the characters were drawn definitely showed their personalities and also all of the emotions that were depicted suited perfectly and made the process of watching even more enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\n  Sound-  all of the voice actors did a great job with making the characters very lively and fun. \\n\r\nI am not a big fan of the opening and ending songs, but they still suited the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\n   Characters-   I don' think it's possible not to feel connection to the main characters. Koizumi and Otani were absolutely outstanding! They seemed like real people and that's what I love about Lovely Complex!  All of the other characters were on point too! Each of them played their role in the development of a story. None of them felt unneeded,they all made sense and made the story even more captivating.\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment- this anime gave me so many emotions! I am so happy thet I watched it and I recommend it to everyone! Not only it's incredibly funny, it also shows life situations and can even teach you how to behave in certain situations. Since the story is very real, I think a lot of people can either feel connected to it or learn something.\\n\r\n  I am going to rewatch this anime,but I will give it a year or so,because I want to watch this with a fresh mind and feel all of the emotions again! \\n",

The characters are very energetic, you really see how they grow love for each other and are perfect together. I also like the idea that their affection aren't love at first sight but acctually develop with time, overcoming insecurities and the stigma that they don't \"look goot\" as a couple. \r\nThe thing that I did not like - Risa's development. At the beginning she was so funny and enjoyable.... as she was aware for her real feeling for Atsusi she became desperate following him around....",

Too many animes nowadays contain a lot of ecchi and sexual innuendos and while most may like that, I don't. To me it just seems lazy when people try to draw you in with big boobs and super cute/hot girls etc. But this anime is totally different. Like the main girl isn't your typical anime girl as she doesn't have the huge boobs, hour-glass figure, or lolicon cuteness. She's just down-to-earth, normal, and tall. The very premise of this anime is very well thoughtout. A non-typical relationship between a tall girl and a short boy, which is rare especially in a high-school in Japan.  \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime is the comedy between the relationships, it's just freaking hilarious. I especially love the facial expressions! Even though the main actor & actress's relationships are the main focus of this anime, I love how all the other relationships are also shown and how they developed. All in all, a perfect anime in my opinion. Especially since it ended well unlike most of the Animes I have seen.",

In some case it can get pretty frustration on how naive a character can become, but despite all that swagger and people being to picky it still is very exciting to watch. Dont get me wrong, this anime clearly changes the natural thought of romance. Most romance animes are very cliche, but this somehow didnt feel very common to me. So it really made me wonder while i was watching this series, hmmm what can the girl doto show her feelings to the boy. the girl is little less than 20cm taller than him. \\n\\n\r\nTo really put it into perspective, if you like animes that are realistic and all about realism, do not watch this. this is farfetched and is really far from being realistic. first  of all being 180 cm is not that bad for a girl. the boy being 153cm is kind of short, but not bad at either. if it was real life and i really loved the person, the height really wouldnt be a issue; especially is she is like only 6 inches taller than me. and this story will not make too much sense in realism wise. \\n\\n\r\nbut if you like to watch animes for the character and how the character bond, grow, build relationships, and their feelings; more of the human relation style, this anime will definetly will be suitable for you. I loved this anime. it is one of my top5 animes. Why did i love it? it was just plain adorable and heart warming anime. and i love those animes. :)",

            "content": "A show with a couple minor flaws that are (mostly) overshadowed by the stellar main characters.\r\nLet's get to get the negative points of Lovely Complex out of the way. The story at times was a bit repetitive. Particularly in the middle as Risa seemed to constantly ping-pong back and forth between \"I like you Ootani, deal with it\" and \"you know what, no, let's stay friends, just pretend I didn't say anything\". There was a lot of that and not enough happening outside of the pair to carry the show.\r\nThe second negative are the human plot devices that were Ootani's next door neighbor Mimi andRisa's coworker Kazuki. Not only were neither believable as viable romantic rivals, but I found it a bit contrived that Mimi just so happened to be very tall (you know, like Risa) and Kazuki just so happened to be very short (you know, like Ootani).\\n\\n\r\nNow that the bad is out of the way, let's talk about the good, specifically the main couple. Risa, the \"towering\" protagonist, in particular, is my single favorite MC in a romance anime. She's super funny and sweet, kind of a nerd, and with more determination than you might think. You see, she was initially friend-zoned pretty hard by Ootani, but with the occasional push by her (also quite funny) best friend Nobu, she persevered until Ootani's feeling came around. Overall, I found Risa so incredibly endearing and easy to root for. I was genuinely happy when things went well for her.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the other half, the vertically-challenged Ootani. To me, he is the quintessential, and somewhat rare, \"male tsundere\". With that, combined with the height, he reminded me of a certain character from one of my favorite romcoms, Toradora. Even though his words are often harsh, deep down, he clearly cared deeply for Risa, and showed it at several key moments. I also appreciate the little guy making it happen on the basketball court too, because if you know anything about that sport, you know it's usually one dominated by people much, much taller than Ootani. My only minor complaint was how dense he was at times. Like half the school, including Risa, told him she liked him and it took like 2 full episodes for him to realize it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made them great, though, were the interactions between the two. Whether they were doing their comedy duo bit, bickering, or geeking out over their shared love of the musician Umibozou, it was consistently entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters go, the only one that really stood out was Risa's best friend Nobu. She was constantly giving out advice to Risa, and it was oftentimes legitimately funny.\\n\\n\r\nI know I went on about the characters, in particular the two main characters, but to me they were foundation of the show, and I honestly don't have a ton to say about the story, art, or sound. They were all adequate for the genre and year. The voice performances of Risa and Ootani were standouts though.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \\n\r\nNegatives: Slightly receptive with unnecessary \"other\" love interests. \\n\r\nPositives: Risa and Ootani are fantastic together, and Risa is my favorite MC in a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 really good shoujo anime",

The anime was not just your typical BOOM they fall for each other and everything ends up together getting married and everything but just sit back and enjoy this amazing story! SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 9/10: The story isn't your typical love story thrown in with a few comedy moments.. The story is a roller coaster of emotions which will either have you laughing your ass off or crying in the corner wishing it was you! I'd love for alot more backstory to eachcharacter but it never came but I still liked it! It was good how the paired them together showing not your typical good looking/perfect pairing that will always be together in a show and actually made them different to each other! The comedy in the show was average at best and it made me laugh some times! It was overly funny and the faces they'd put on sometimes were amazing! The one thing I disliked about the whole thing and I know it's supposed to be a rom-com but at sad/romantic moments they'd try to make everything into a comedic moment which would ruin it sometimes! The story wasn't over barely dramatic with a few exceptions every now and then but it was still enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: I definitely was thrown off of the anime due to the art/animation for this show and I was hesitated to watch it even when it started but I still gave it a try! The anime is pretty much awful but it still has it's time here and there and it's still a good watch! The anime is years old and I wouldn't expect it to be a work of art but I still really enjoyed it at romantic/happy moments!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Nothing really stood out that much but it also never sucked! Nothing really popped out at any points to make me thing \"Wow this is a great soundtrack\" but maybe that's because I was more concentrated on the art style and what was happening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Each character is unique and is seemed to stay that way the entire way through! It was really well made how they made each of the main characters developed their emotions.. It was good to see him reject her twice first before actually realizing his feelings! If it would of been \"Oh I suddenly like you now because you like me\" would of made it less amusing and would of made it kind of awkward for me to watch seeing them suddenly sprout a romance from thin air! The supporting characters seemed to have a fairly big decent part in everyone coming together and they weren't overused nor were they barely ever used.. They were used to a decent amount where it affected the story and each of them getting together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The story and characters were fairly decent and very enjoyable for a person to watch whose looking for a good story line which will have a happy ending along with a strong romance type that is not appearing out of thin air! I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance! I can not say this enough but LOOK PAST THE ANIMATION! TRUST ME! :D",

            "content": "Lovely Complex is a personally important anime for me.  It didn't just expand my horizons in anime, but in all forms of entertainment.  This anime was the first piece of entertainment that ever showed me that you could be enthralled in a story that didn't have guns, kung-fu or explosions.  10 years ago, I thought that liking an anime like this was too \"girly\", but I figured I'd give it a try and was drawn in immediately by the humor and characters.  Risa, in an odd way, reminded me of an ex that I had just separated from. (She was alsotall and insecure about her height. She was 6'2\".).  I think that's what drew me in, as well.  But, thanks to the awesome story, the comedy and the feel good moments, I realized there was much more to Anime than just adventures and magic.  This anime is what paved the way for me to enjoy other great animes like Nodame Cantabile, Suzuka and Ouran High School Host Club.  Looking back, I realize how much amazing anime (and even movies) I would've missed if not for this anime.   \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to anyone, especially younger guys who pass up this kind of anime thinking it won't be good, because of the genre.  Give it a shot.  Trust me. It's an all time great.",

The reason for this is most everything is perfect except the art at the very beginning.  At the start is is very poorly done I thought and they did a lot of silly drawn skits and faces.  I did not like this so much after first episode or two I dropped it first time I tried to watch this a couple years ago.  This time around watched it with someoneand it was very good after the first couple episodes as art can be silly at times but not nearly as constant.  I would watch until the fifth or sixth episode if you like the those or the later parts of those you will love the anime.",

I think that is probably why it works so well, it is abundantly clear within the first episode that this series doesn't make the mistake of taking itself TOO seriously like so many others.  \r\nThe humor is something caught in the middle of outright slapstick and surprisingly clever...which isfairly impressive, as it is beyond rare imo, for slapstick to be this funny.    \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters had a great chemistry together(imo, thanks to how well the voice actors, who were great, played off of each other)  and I couldn't help but be charmed by Otani and Risa's relationship.  The supporting cast doesn't make quite as large an impact, but it's not that they aren't loveable characters... so much as Otani and Risa steal the show entirely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Lovely Complex is a very enjoyable, albeit simple,  light-hearted series, that should almost certainly keep a smile on your face from start to finish.",

Worth a watch if you enjoy a comedy with interesting love situations.\r\nStory: \r\nI found it to be a very simple formula with interesting twists that keep the viewer interested. Even though it was obvious at times Lovely Complex never disappointed me. With the best developing plot and evolving complications the story never got old.\r\nArt:\r\nI really liked the color in this Anime, it just seemed brighter than most of the ones I have watched. Somewhat simplistic but complimented the scenario quite well.\r\nSound:\r\nI havenever seen an anime where the sound seemed to outperform others, other than perhaps Nodame Cantabile. Most of the sound depends on the site and equipment used for quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters and scenario was fairly average but it seemed to fit the story extremely well. What made it unique was the height, which is what the show is about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI watched this show on a mediocre streaming site and still had a great time watching it. Its shows like this one, where everything seems to come together very well that stand out. I actually plan to make an effort to watch this one over again in the future, and when I do it will be the first one that I have re-watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNot too long, great art and a nice relaxed setting makes this the perfect anime to watch. Although it could have a second season the story played out nicely. \\n\\n\r\nThe only people that I do not think would enjoy this anime would be ones that do not like romance or strictly stick to an action anime diet.",

            "content": "Story \u2013 9\r\nLovely Complex or LoveCom\u2019s story is a really funny love story. It demonstrates the immense joy and pain one usually feels when falling for someone, confessing, getting rejected, and getting back up again to live another day. In addition, all the awkward and hilarious moments are done in excellent fashion. Not to mention, it tackles an oddity: tall girl falls for a short guy and is actually making the moves towards the relationship. My only qualm about the story is the small fillers near the end of the show which kept it from getting a 10. Nevertheless, I was truly impressed with thestory and direction.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation fit in really well with the series. I really like the character designs, especially for Koizumi. As the main character, her facial expressions displayed the emotions needed for each scene. The same could be said for the other characters to a lesser extent, but Koizumi\u2019s art style stood out the most and brought this show to another level in terms of emotion and comedy. It was the driving force that meshed well with whatever the situation was at hand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Koizumi and Otani, are extremely fun to watch. There is not much in terms of back story for either character, but what they do during the story add to their great personalities. With the characters going back and forth, there is never a dull moment. The other characters are great too and add to the humor and emotion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP and ED are much better than the 2nd ones. Tegomass\u2019 \u201cKimi + Boku = Love?\u201d (OP) manages to create the charming atmosphere of the show while \u201cKiss ~Kaerimichi no Love Song~\u201d (ED) is a great song in and of itself, with its soft melodies and easy listening feel. In addition, the background music did a great job in reinforcing and portraying emotions and funny situations throughout the show. Koizumi and Otani\u2019s voice actors were perfect for the job and had amazing chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nI was really impressed with the show overall and it was a lot of fun to watch. I\u2019m glad I picked this series as I was searching for something different to watch from what I normally do. Every episode is genuinely funny, and charmingly non-clich\u00e9 (fresh, to me anyways \u2013 with the tall girl liking the short guy and doing something about it, completely opposite of what we think today!) Definitely a must watch for those who like a natural good comedy, and those who like love stories.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating \u2013 9.2 \u2013 Excellent",

Lovely Complex is one of those rare unpolished gems.\r\nWhat Lovely Complex  lacks in luster it makes up for ten fold in story and humor( some of which you might need to be a bit knowledgable in japanese culture for). The Characters have a true depth that leaves a person to wonder if they might be based on someone the writer knows.\r\nAll in all, a suprisingly enjoyable series. If you are looking for flash and glimmer look elsewhere, but if youwant to experience something that has side spliting antics, touching romance, and a soul that is a bit  real and deep Lovely complex is worth investing some curiosity in.",

            "content": "LOVELY*COMPLEX (or Love*Com) the anime was first aired in 2007. There are 24 episodes all together. This anime is actually adapted from a popular shoujo manga (2001 - 2006) by Nakahara Aya with the same title. In 2006, the manga was adapted into a live-action movie.\r\nThe very first thing I notice about this anime is the way the characters speak. Obviously, since the setting of this anime is in Osaka, so they are actually speaking in Kansai-ben. The tone is a bit melodic and sometimes it sounds a tad harsher that the normal standard Japanese dialect.\r\nBy and large, the strengths of any anime series dependon two core elements: story-lines and characterizations. Plot-wise, this anime has a simple yet unforgettable story lines. I like how the characters struggle in developing their relationship. There are scenes that have, apparently, etched in my mind. There are scenes that make my heart skips a beat (duhh... what's new?). In fact, there are even several scenes that leave a strange 'tingling' in the pit of my stomach. Ahh... the stolen kisses... and who could forget those...\\n\\n\r\nNext, I really adore the portrayal of the two protagonists in this anime. Koizumi Risa is not your typical Japanese girl. She is taller than any of her peers and in fact, towering at 172cm, she is way taller than any of the typical boys. Well, Otani Atsushi is her exact opposite. He is way too short even for a normal boy. His height is 156cm (that IS short. Even I'm taller than him). Obviously, he is way shorter than Koizumi. To make thing even worse, Koizumi always addresses him as chibiko (midget) and Otani always refers her as Amazon or sometimes Totem Pole. Since they bicker like nobody's bussines, they are dubbed by their homeroom teacher All Hanshin Kyojin, a famous Japanese comedy duo who differ in heights. But, on one fine day (it's night, actually), somehow, they are destined to watch a concert together. That's how the bittersweet romance begins...\\n\\n\r\nApparently, after watching this anime, I do believe love is not simply physical. And I do realize, wholeheartedly, that opposite does attract! It is definitely sweet, insightful, funny and endearing. Hence this anime is absolutely recommended by moi.",

Risa is a high school girl, having trouble finding a boyfriend due to being abnormally tall (170 cm). Otani is a high school boy going through the same problems, buthe can't seem to find the right girl (standing around 156 cm last I recall). The two agree to help each other overcome this and search for the right person, but it takes a while for them to realize that the right person might be standing right in front of them. \\n\r\nThe story line is great, and there are some interesting twists that keep you hanging. What seemed weird to me right up until the ending was the whole 'a girl liking a guy shorter than her', like it completely irked me. But I went through with the entire  anime and I fell in love with the characters. What I loved best was the determination Risa shows in this anime, it was truly inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was appropriate for this anime. I don't think it was anything amazing that struck at me and stood out, but I do think it was very well done and it fit. \\n\\n\r\nSound: My favorite song from this anime was the ending to the first half of the series, because the mood of the song falls perfectly with it (I'm adding it to my ipod :)). During the anime the sound didn't strike out much either, so it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything amazing either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are what make this anime amazing. With such a generic story line (don't get me wrong, it was an amazing anime, but clearly not the first time we've heard of a high school romance with issues). However, these characters were inspiring, and when you've gotten into this anime you fall in love. Risa's determination to be together with the boy she likes really inspired me to try harder in the future and I'll certainly keep her in mind when I meet someone special. Otani was the frustrating character here, but his character was played perfectly and I wouldn't have had him changed any other way. The supporting characters really helped with this story and help move the plot along.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you've read until here you should be able to tell I enjoyed the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend this anime especially if you love high school anime, romance, or anything in between. It was fantastic and I congratulate the authors who wrote the script for it! I haven't seen an anime this amazing since, well, Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge which had wonderful characters as well.",

I tend to watch a lot of these sorts of anime but none of them really seem to stick with me. But this one definitely did! I did find, however, in some parts it was a bit slow.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI loved the animation for this anime. The art is exactly the sort I tend to go for when I look for shows in this genre.\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nI loved the sound in this anime. The music was happy, sad, and even tense at all the right times. I didn't think there wasa single moment where the music was off. Was very helpful for setting the scene. I also loved the beginning and ending music very much. As for the sound effects, they were all spot on! The chosen voices for the characters we're perfect as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis was my favourite part about the anime. The characters behind Koizumi and Otani were brilliant. Koizumi's a very outgoing, strong girl, but she's extremely timid when it comes to her feelings, which most girls watching can relate well to. Otani's just as outgoing, however, rather than being timid towards his feelings, he's just confused about them and can't understand, which relates to some guys. I loved how the characters are constantly fighting, and teasing each other, and I loved the \"All Hanshin Kyojin\" aspect of their relationship. It was great how all that didn't change as their relationship grew.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI had put off watching this anime for about 2 years, just because I didn't think I would enjoy it. But it was actually probably one of the most enjoyable anime's I've experienced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is great! I'd recommend it to anyone, especially if they enjoyed \"Ouran High School Host Club,\" it has the same teasing friendship relationships.",

The in depth complexity of Risa is so well done, and her feelings are completely relatable.  When she cried, I cried too.  When she laughed, I laughed too.  When anything romantic happened, I was squealing like a schoolgirl.\r\nThe plot isn't something that is very predictable, like many romcoms.  I was always pressing the next episode because I wanted to know what happened next.\r\nSomething I found interesting is that thewhole series was done with kansai dialect.  I cannot understand everything they said, I needed the subtitles for that, but I could hear the difference in the way they talked from most other animes.  I enjoyed the change.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I enjoyed is that Risa's hairstyle was constantly changing.  Something I find irritating after awhile is that almost no anime characters change their appearance from day to day.  Seeing her hairstyle change, as well as her clothes, was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this series and recommend it to anyone that enjoys romantic comedies.  Happy watching!",

It was referred to me by my sister's friend so I decided to give it a chance.\r\nThe story, although filled with a few cliche moments, was extra adorable. I will defiantly never forget the story. But the chance of me watching it again any time soon is very slim.\r\nThe animation bothered me a lot in this anime. I don't know what it is, I just can't put my finger on it.\r\nThe characters were all so easy to love which I really enjoyed. I've never been a fan of having that one guy in an anime that irritates you so muchyou want to punch your computer. Luckily I did not have that issue.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime quite a bit and suggest that others give it a try!",

The thing with this is, it's also amazingly funny.\r\nIt's characters are likeable, its hilarious, and its also tear-jerking as well. You find yourself rooting for the main characters love, and just want to hop into the screen and get the two to kiss! It's that emotional! \r\nIt's also unique, because this time the girl is taller than the guy, and it may give you some advice for those of you out there who are best friends with someone and may consider dating them but are too afraid to ask! \r\nAllin all, I really liked the anime, and I recommend it to people who like romance comedy because it definitely has enough of both of those!",

This seems interesting..\r\nI talked with two persons about that anime and \"complex\" and their opinion I'll present you!\r\n\"How it is possible??! - stereotypical point of view\"\r\nSo this is Lovely Complex hm? Wait... what the heck? Why man is tiny and girl tall? I usually see that boy is taller than girl.\r\nOk, maybe it won't bother me because this anime has goodmusic and line, but still... You know what? I can't stand that main heroes\\n\r\nare together despite their size. Even when they might be with persons of their size... Don't get me wrong, anime is good, but that \"complex\" little bothered me.\\n\r\nIf that won't be problem for you, I can recommend you that title.\\n\\n\r\n\"A lot of sweetness in one anime - typical fan's of romanse point of view\"\\n\r\nAnother romance and another cute and sad moments... ahh... I love romances!\\n\r\nLovely Complex... how nice... so cute... Oh, I pondered little. I'm going to watch it now!\\n\r\nGirl is taller than guy... how cute... If I could be like that woman I would hug my boyfriend to death. \\n\r\nI would like to live like that... What? Review? Oh crap I forgot about it!\\n\r\nI recomend it for everyone who loves romances like I do. The line and music are awesome!\\n\r\nHm... where I finished? Ah love.... I would... *zzzzzzz*\\n\\n\r\n\"Anime like other romances, but with comedy stuff - my point of view\"\\n\r\nSince that from romances fan we didn't learn anything useful(stereotypical person was more helpful) I'm going to tell you about that anime precisely.\\n\r\nLovely Complex is for me very good anime. The fact of \"complex\" don't bother me, there is couple like others.\\n\r\nNo one earlier mentioned about comedy stuff... what a pity because this is main part of anime. That \"Complex\" is perfect for making fun of each other\\n\r\nand there it takes place! I laughed all the time while watching it. The character of heroes owes much. Line was pretty good. Music was climate especially opening!\\n\r\nAdventures of Koizumi and Otani was full of feelings and fun! I can't tell much about other characters because protagonists played first violin.\\n\r\nThe end of anime is pretty much same like other romances so I won't tell you about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell \"Lovely Complex\" is very good anime for romance fans and others. I promise that you'll have fun while watching it!\\n\\n\r\nIs arguing with giraffe\\n\r\nWatashizashi",

This one made a clear gesture to that kind of story.\r\nI've thought about how to describe the tempo of the story and the development of the characters. You know how the change the tires and tank the car in racing in less than a minute? They went in and thought \"Right! We have to do this cliche this episode! LET'S GO!\" And Hey ho they went and did it, what usually takes 3-4 episodes or in some romcoms a whole damnseason. It puts a veil on the anime bullshit logic that exists almost everywhere and the little is shushed over by the plot saying \"WE AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS\" and it moves on. However, it's not completely flawless in this tempo and that can put you off. But 8/10 times, it's good.\\n\\n\r\nYou might recognise the main female character as she is the voice actress behind Nami from One Piece. The tempo suits her perfectly and you might think of early day one piece when Nami were new and her anger refreshing. If you enjoyed that you might enjoy this even more so. Another thing that works well is the use of art. It's not meant to be pretty, it's meant to show exactly what the characters feel. You might find some mess ups or flaws that bother you but mostly it flows very well with the characters and conflicts in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nReally the only real criticism I have is the sound. At some parts, the background noise feels like the background noise of a shit Visual Novel game. It kept bugging me at certain scenes but otherwise, it's just good. When they got the tempo right and their ideas straight this anime is one of the most enjoyable I've seen",

            "content": "Ah Lovely Complex, it is perhaps at the top of my favorites list when it comes to Rom-com anime, it is endearing in ways that you wouldn't expect, but above all: it's... really hilarious.\r\nStory - 8\r\nSo at the heart of any masterpiece is a good story, this is no different for Lovely Complex, while I do think the mind-numbing drama in the later episodes can certainly put a casual viewer through their paces, it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Without giving too many details about the plot, it's love-sick comedy driven by two people who are very vertically-conscious of themselves, and while the mundane obligatory dramadoes drop the score a bit, the high points that it hits are done in a way that capitalizes on it's strengths.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nSince art is at the center of animation, it's very important that you're staring at something you enjoy looking at, and Lovely Complex doesn't disappoint on this front, I find it is notable that the female lead: Koizumi Risa often changes her hairstyle from day-to-day, I find this to be a welcome dynamic change from the otherwise unchanging static cling of most female leads/protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nWith bursts of vivid color, it is lovely to look at, without being too overbearing, the only problem I could potentially foresee with the casual viewers  is the deformed state the characters devolve into while expressing comedy... but then again, that's part of it's charm.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't make it a point to focus on sound when it comes to most anime, but I have no shame in admitting that I got as giddy as a school-girl every-time I heard the opening theme for the series, it's nothing that's balls to the walls amazing, but it's a nostalgic type of calm music that you don't see too much nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nOn the flip-side of this coin, the ED was pleasing enough to my ears that I didn't see fit to just leave when the episode was over, opting instead to listen to it all the way through, the various OST's and BGM's sprinkled throughout the series did well in setting the mood/tone, the voice-acting was also quite superb\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't think you'd get an argument from anyone who watched this, if you were to say that the characters were the main deciding point on the debate of whether or not to watch Lovely Complex, the side-characters such as Nakao and Nobu are endearing and receive some actual focus/development, while adding to the comedy-driven antics of our male and female leads, and they do all of this without detracting attention from the stars of the show! I find the balance refreshing and a decent change of pace from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to describe our leads with a phrase, it would be this: comedy gold-mine. I don't think I'm being too generous when I give this anime credit for being one of (if not the most) funniest things I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing, the comedy will leave you clutching at your sides for days on end, were that not enough we also get a surprising amount of character development sprinkled with some very tender heartwarming moments. You'll fall in love with at least one of the cast, I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not pissing yourself with laughter, you're too busy crying (along with our female lead) or swooning, you experience such a wide range of emotions when it comes to Lovely Complex, I tend  put a big stress on re-watch ability when it comes to anime dealing with comedy, and this anime gets the gold star in that regard, despite watching it at least twelve times, I still laugh at every joke, and still partake in all the sappiness that ensues.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nI would fully endorse this product for consumption for any anime fan that loves romance as a genre, especially people who enjoy their romances with comedy on the side, you'll find that Lovely Complex has an abundance of both, with a satisfying conclusion that will leave you wanting for nothing (except for a continuation, it's just that good!)",

It was enormous and marvelous because of a not typical love story between uncommon individuals who suddenly fall for each other. In every episode, I absolutely enjoy it for each unexpected scene and charm of all the character even they are not for real. I definitely like the anime; it is worth watching for its clever portrayals of emotions. :)\r\n*PERSONAL IMPLICATION*\r\nWhat is the most unforgettable about Lovely Complex is the attitude of Koizumi, who never gave up in her love for Otani. I just admire her persistent and dedication.\r\nIt is true that in love,you can do everything. You will not easily complain and surrender as long as you have that romantic feeling in you because for sure at the end you will reap what you sow. you cannot see it as a wasteful thing to do. It will give you inspiration, motivation and encouragement to be a better person. In love, nothing is impossible.\\n",

            "content": "This is probably my top top TOP Romance Comedy Slice of Life anime I have ever seen. EVER.\r\nBeginning with the story. It's so unconventional (neither character has feeling for one another due to height and personality differences) then Koizumi develops feelings for Otani and the comedy just increases. That may sound typical, and in some ways it (which only works in its favour) but Love*Com takes its time in developing their relationship. Not a single breath of it feels rushed. I have many friends who don't really like this genre much but really thoroughly enjoyed this anime because the comedy far outweighs the romance, butwithout sacrificing that romantic, cheesy gooey happy feeling you get from typical RomCom anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all extremely well developed and the group of friends all play a fairly integral role to the story development.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is second to non. It does a wonderful job of setting the scene, be it comedic or absolute heart wrenching. OH THE FEELS.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga art is as always will be, more detailed than the anime. Both are wonderful. Especially when you consider the contrast between characters expressions (Koizumi and Otani often pull very very funny faces) - Don't expect any amazing out of this world special effects or colours or anything truly unique. It's just done well. Easy on the eyes and not afraid to be \"ugly\"\\n\\n\r\nI don't often re watch anime but I have re watched this three times and have read the manga twice.\\n\\n\r\nI urge everyone to give this one a shot even if the genre doesn't sound like your cup of tea, it truly is a wonderfully hilariously, light hearted and unbelievably heart warming show.",

            "content": "Short Summary: \r\nThis show is as jaw-dropping-funny as an anime will get, but in fact a surprisingly heartwarming tale. Main characters taller-than-your-average-girl Risa, and short-for-his-age Otani as a couple? That already spells disaster (disastrously funny that is) right off the bat! Complemented by superb voice acting and consistent story and character developement, Lovely Complex is, in short, a Rom-Com done right!\r\nI'll try to be as vague and as short and sweet on the categories because like me, I'm sure you also absolutely hate spoilers in reviews.\r\nStory: \r\nI found that one of the biggest reasons I liked Love-Com so much was because its consistency to progressin its storyline, every episode is very relevant and vital to the main plot, and keeps you locked in and wanting more. Overall, with its ups and downs, at the end of the show, you'll be truely satisfied with everything that happened and would'nt want it to end any other way.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting: \\n\r\nGreat, the leads were perfectly casted in everyway and never fail to deliver in every episode. One thing I have to nit-pick at is (this pertains to the story too) that the supporting characters were surprisingly weak and barely matter in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot your usual huge-eyes small-mouth cuties in this show, but again (I know I'm repeating myself) very appropriate, especially during the hilarious scenes where the characters' fantasies are shown with shimmering eyes and wide open mouthes.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a guy, watching a show with labeled in category shoujo is a huge taboo, especially considering that the story is seen through Risa, the female lead's point of view (although Otani is present 90% of the time anyways), but if skipping out on great things is what it takes to be manly, then you've got it all wrong. After all,  it's been years since I've seen a show that actually makes me laugh so hard (and so often) that my stomach starts hurting. I recommend anyone, male or female, at almost any age group to watch this show and get a great kick. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy.\\n\\n\r\n-Flash",

            "content": "Lovely Complex has just became on of my favorite romantic comedies.  The scenario in which romance develops on is unique and teaches us the boundlessness of our emotions.  One of my favorite aspects is that this anime is half and half romance and comedy, there's always a sense of comic relief to any seriousness and vice versa, but that still doesn't take away from the captivating emotion inspiring or the hilarious humor (seriously this anime made me laugh so much).  Furthermore, all the characters are great in a variety of ways.  They are unique, entertaining and funny, but also complex whichis really seen in how character relations are grown.  The romance in Lovely Complex centers on actual growth and development of the relationship and feelings, and I think that is splendid.  You will actually view the sentiment and connection between the two main characters flourish to feel a sense of progress and growth that you may be able to relate to.  The anime does time well, it really captures the essence of future, past, and character development, and not only captures our emotions but empathy of separation and love.  Anyways, overall I enjoyed Lovely Complex for how it made me cry in laughter, happiness, and sadness.  Watch it.",

A friend recommended this one to me and it sounded just up my alley ... but it wasn't.\r\n***SPOILERS***\r\nSee the problem is the characters, well not all of them only a select few.\r\nThe guy that comes in on episode 5 or something being Raisa's long lost childhood friend and then he disappears and only shows up when things are starting to get good. Like really? we just suffered through 3 GOOD-AWFUL-BORING episodes and now you show up?? *sigh*\r\nSo obviously I didn't finish the series but if there's no point in him then bye-bye.Thank you. The other person is Raisa the main character. You start off the anime and she is freaking hilarious, she is bossy and obnoxious and is a total hoot, I mean if she were my friend I would always be laughing, and then she goes and gets a crush and becomes sappy and depressed and it totally changes her personality from one of spunk to well. \"BOO GET OFF THE STAGE\" .... \\n\r\nOkay so the last character that is a real shit is the \"best friend\" going through the episodes she is constantly harrassing Raisa and messes everything up like all the time. I understand in an anime you need someone there to help push it along but there has to be a limit. When she is constantly holding her hand and telling her what to do, myself as a viewer, start to wonder if she actually still has a crush on him or if this is now just some big game that will end soon with her going. \"Oh well that didn't work, onto the next person.\"\\n\r\nI would have liked the anime, I should have liked it really but, I can only handle so much stupidity, when Raisa keeps kicking a dead horse (metaphorically speaking) it gets real old real fast because no matter how hard she kicks it feels like it is going nowhere.",

            "content": "This is going to fail but w/e.\r\nAs a person who doesn't likes the romance genre I can say that I enjoyed this anime. I began to watch it to chill out with something light and not so complex and I though I would watch half of every episode, but I found myself watching the full episodes until 5 A.M.\r\nStory\r\nIt's your regular storyline with a girl and a guy slowly falling in love, one of the two is dense and the other doesn't give up on him/her. Nothing special as the story goes. But the idea of a comedy duo was really good. At a timesI was laughing way too much, loved the sad moments ending with a stupid joke, they caught me of guard. The few romance animes that I watched were bringing me a lot moody feelings and I was bored as hell. The only thing I get irritated by was Risa crying too much in the second half of the show. As comedy duo those two were hilarious, not just attempting to be as in most of the animes, as couple they're complete fail and their lovey-dovey moments were boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI guess it's typical for this genre. I actually enjoy this kind of art, makes the characters cute or cool. Movements are stiff sometimes though and the hairstyles were bad. At some point it was said that Risa got style, bit most of the clothes she was wearing were awful, that I guess was the try to hide all of her body parts well. There's a lot ugly faces too, but they helped making the whole thing funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI enjoyed the opening and ending songs, the voices not that much. The laughs were at a times so fake that I was wondering if they aren't overdoing it. The crying as well, it was a job not so well done, so I was watching with my speakers almost on mute. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWith the beginning of the show the two main (Risa and Ootani) hated each other, then they suddenly started helping each other and Risa was running after the guy on the 17 minute of the first episode, so I guess they aren't that complex. Their comedy moments were interesting and funny with their personalities so close. As the show goes on Risa became more and more irritating with the crying thing, though I liked her in her other states of mind. But even that was showing that they're changing at some point. Despite of been rejected twice and misunderstanding a lot of the situations she's really stubborn. Both Risa and Ootani were made kinda realistic, they look like they can't made their mind whether to give up or not, which every one does.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters on the other hand were pretty boring. They got some kind of development but in just a few episodes. Seiko-chan was a shock to me, I didn't like that character a lot to begin with, because of all that cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI gave that a 9 & 8 of 10 since I was laughing most of the time and I was in this kind of situation with my boyfriend (on Ootani's side though, but that's other thing). I liked it so much because it was so close to what happens in real life, not just in mine. It was willing to bring happy feelings, not only romance and crying over some girl who was rejected twice. Nowadays most of the anime have the point not to give up, but putted in a example real-life situations make you actually see, that's not so easy thing and bringing a super power won't help.",

I've seen so may animes already that I've lost track of the stories and characters... \r\nI'll start reviewing the animes I've seen starting July2011...\r\nMain Characters: Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Otani\r\nI wasn't all that sold out on the drawings at first since I'm into those cute anime art/drawings... but just watching the first episode made me change my mind... \r\nCharacters were detailed... from Koizumi's different hairstyles to Otani's clothes... Risa is actually very pretty and Otani is very cute...\r\nWhat I loved about this anime is the chemistry of the 2 main characters... I believe that the lead voiceactors have a lot to do with how Risa and Otani became lovable... they complimented each other perfectly! I was already laughing at the 1st 10mins of the 1st episode...\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it was nice... it had its twists... there were heartbreaking moments - the \"Bear Curry\" and the \"almost breakup\" of the Darlings really got to me... But my fave romantic moment will still be the Birthday Fireworks Kiss... I kept repeating the same scene over and over with a silly smile on my face... :P\\n\\n\r\n1 thing I wish that they improved on: Otani's change of heart... I know he cares for Risa but it would have been better to really have his side of the story... if there is really a spark, why he fell it love etc...\\n\\n\r\nStill, Lovely Complex will be one of my favorites... 1 that I can and will recommend to my friends and 1 that I will definitely watch again...  :)",

            "content": "The story is about the tallest girl in her class that starts to fall for the shortest guy. This in itself is a little more unique and different from other romances. It has a lot of comedy mixed with some drama and of course romance. I found it hit the nail on the head on every aspect, especially the comedy, was quite funny. I found myself laughing and then suddenly stopping once it hit it's dramatic moments. Really did good in those fields.\r\nYou will get a lot of \"rivals\" throughout the series to shake them up when Otani and Risa get closer together. Was finefor the start but they do it a lot and it seems to drag the series on longer and you think to yourself \"did I just watch this?.\" None the less, you can easily see pass that since they do a lot more than that as well. Though the ending you will find it was all worth it, since Risa works so hard to make Otani like her.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art work is nothing like Clannad or Kanon, etc. It's like looking at let's say One Piece or maybe even a bit like Hunter x Hunter in some areas. Older styled kind of. But you can appreciate how they used the art for their comedy sketches and the dramatic moments it shows. Using pretty colors and dark auras to show their emotions and that was always great to see. Some of the faces the characters made was just too funny and some even tugged at your heart strings a tad when it got sad and more intense.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was great, I preferred the 1st set of opening and ending songs rather than the second, due to how much more smooth it was and how it made me feel when I was watching it. They do well also with how they add sounds to the atmosphere of a scene as well. The sound track is pretty decent if I say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSome can argue that the characters could be found annoying, especially Otani for being SO dense. Sometimes you sit there and think how stupid can a person really be? Risa is slightly indecisive but you can't disregard her determination to get Ontai's love (Or you could call her a stalker.) \\n\r\nThen you have your supporting characters such as:\\n\r\nNobuko\\n\r\nNakano\\n\r\nTanaka\\n\r\nSuzuki\\n\\n\r\nNobuko was hilarious, she really gave Risa a kick in the ass whenever she was losing hope and it worked out amazingly.\\n\r\nNakano helped Otani, though it was pointless because Otani was just so damn dense.\\n\r\nTanaka was just there really, she wasn't much to anything, same with Suzuki. They are what starts it though, but after that they just sit back and act along.\\n\\n\r\nEnding\\n\r\nThe ending was everything I wanted and more. Why? Because it actually gave you an ending and didn't leave you on a stupid cliff hanger, hoping for another season or something. You get what you want and it's a cute, happy ending and even funny as well. Puts all the genres that are included in this anime into one decent ending.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating here:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 9 because the story was great, just dragged on at some parts and I HATED how dense Otani was and Risa came off as a stalker and kept \"giving up\" but keeps trying again, was kind of getting old after a few episodes. It is highly recommended though for any romance lover.",

Although the storyline is generally the same as many anime romances (girl loves guy, guy is a little dense, but they end up together in the end and everyone is happy etc. etc.), the anime had some unique features since some of the problem they encountered originated because of the unusual pairing. I think Koizumi's reactions are hilarious and I had fun watching the All Hashim Kyojin (did I get the spelling right?) banter with each other. In fact, all the charactersare amusing to me. (the lovey-dovey couple, the shy couple, even the boy who's easily fooled)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was the perfect anime to watch if you just want to unwind and have some brainless fun.",

(Sorry for the spoilers or something.) the story is all about a young girl who has this problem about her height. She is tall. She is the tallest of all the girls in her class. Or maybe in her school, while the lead boy is the shortest. So, in short, there are some kind of a mix up about their heights. But because of this, their friendship sprouted. The two of them get well along.But the two doesn't seem to notice it. Until one day the girl realized she fell in love with the boy. But the boy was too uhh, what do you call him.. weirded out. Something like that. Because of their \"height\" problem. But the girl, keeps on pushing and pushing herself to the boy until one day, the boy, too, fell in love with the girl. Happy Ending :)) Anyway, this is a good comedy-romance anim\u00e9. You'd really enjoy this. If you have time, try watching this. It's unique ideas and plot is exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the art is not that good. But you'll find the characters adorable. Most especially Otani, the male protagonist (well, for me, he is cute :3)\\n\r\nThe sound is okay but it can't bring you into tears or whatever. It just adds this \"awww\" moment whenever the two are confessing their love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very enjoyable. If you do not know what to watch next, then I must say to you, WATCH THIS NEXT! :))",

I think of myself as reasonably intelligent and though my experience happened in my 20s I remember a girl falling for me and I having no clue.  You have to reorient your whole way of thinking especially if they are a good friend.The dynamics of how both Risa dealt with Otani's initial denseness, and later once he had clued in, how both interacted were the best parts of the series.  But the whole series was really incredibly watchable.\\n\\n\r\nBut for this to really work the voice acting had to be spot on and it was.  Risa was voiced by a truly gifted seiyu and Otani wasn't far behind.  I believe this series is undubable (if that's a word).    \\n\\n\r\nThe graphics are very good, close to outstanding sometimes, and the music never got in the way.

I had to watch it only when I was feelng well or else it gave me a headache, that and the fact that the characters are all very loud. Its a good comedy and love story even if Otani is a complete idiot and so slow you just wanna bang your head into the wall sometimes. It was good and if you enjoy loud fast paced anime you should definitely give it a try.\r\nStory 7: The story was ok I guess. I mean it just seemed like something that I have seenbefore thats just me though. The score is also kinda low because Otani angered me, he made me want to drive my fist into the wall. He was so slow and dumb, I mean he is literaly stupid. Dont let him discourage you though he gets a bit better towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6: I gotta admit I wasnt crazy about it. Some of Risas facial expresions scare me. I have nightmares about them. Other than that it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: I loved the music it was all very good and well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: I thought all the characters were extremely well done. They always did things that matched their personalities and thats a good trait for an anime to have. I have to say all of the characters were very funny and did the plot very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: The only reason the show is a 7 for enjoyment is im not a very big fan of fast and loud anime and most of the time I felt like I was forcing myself to watch it. But if this is your type of anime then knock yourself out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: This anime was very good and very funny. I think its definitley good to watch if your that person with that guy out there and your totaly inot him but hes not into you in that way. Risas determination and future are encouraging and you might just find strength in it.",

A few episodes later, I was pleasantly surprised to find it actually went much deeper than that. My sister asked me a few times, \"are you STILL watching that anime about the tall girl and the short boy? How much plot can they really make out of that?\". Well, actually, quite a lot. The whole series is 25 episodes and somehow the whole height difference gimmick never gets boring and actually continues to be funny throughout. It even gets really quite touching and emotional attimes, and only resorts to typical romance cliches in the last few episodes (this isn't enough to ruin the series though -- it resolves itself pretty well). Any girl whose ever had a crush on an oblivious and tactless boy will be able to identify with Risa, and Otani's feelings are pretty understandable and realistic too. The banter between them and their natural ease with one another is what makes the show so fun and different. If you have even the slightest interest in shojo anime, I highly recommend this.",

My favorite episode was 18, it was so darling. I also liked the theme songs, I sang along to them every time they played. It is probably my favorite right now. I hope everyone who watches this loves it as much as I did. I mean after the anime ended, I felt like crying because it was over. THIS ANIME ROCKS!!!!!",

            "content": "When I first started to watch Lovely Complex, I felt no small amount of trepidation. However, after the first five or so episodes, I found myself pleasantly surprised by just how much charm such a - dare I say - cheesy rom-com had. \r\nThe characters two main character, Otani and Risa, are a perfect fit for each other apart from their heights. This leads to some very comedic moments. The story line works so well because both Otani and Risa can be so in tune in one scene and then have a massive fall out the next... and it's believable. \r\nSuch a vast contrast inemotions that display themselves in each 20 minute(ish) episode never lets the ball drop. There is barely a dull moment in any of the 24 episodes that seem to be \"filler space\". Every episode can be watched singularly but, as a whole, it reaches a whole new dimension which warms your heart to the characters.\\n\r\nThe art style does show a little weakness, at times, when it over exaggerates a certain shot. This, however, is only a matter of opinion that will vary as much as anything else from person to person. \\n\r\nA very strong series that needs to be watched, if only once.",

            "content": "Lovely Complex if you liked Kimi ni Todoke there's no doubt you will enjoy this romantic comedy. I was pleased that the story took place over the MC's entire high school life. Seeing them move from one grade to the next in the manner presented is something not that often seen in these types of shows. My biggest fault with the show is that the last 6 episodes are heavily filled with drama. Of course we love that drama but there was so much going on they were jumping from one thing to the next in the blink of an eye it was kinda hardto keep up with it all. Plus since they moved it along so fast things sometimes were resolved in a WTF manner. I just think they should have spread these last 6 episodes out into an extra 4 or 5 to give the drama time to build more. Other then that it was a really enjoyable love story 8/10",

It flows perfectly and has its high's and also its lows its one of those anime which you watch and episode and easilly get carried away and watch 3 or 4 at a given go. the style is not the best i have ever seen but its still ok if you can deal with the (Strange Expressions) that they use then you will really enjoy this, im not sure on what else tosay it has everything, a top story, nice charatcer development and love development and a great ending all i need to say is if you have not watched this series you HAVE NOT LIVED lol.",
