            "content": "Kaze no Stigma is a fun anime if you're interested into this genre. Battles, magic, comedy, kick-ass moments, KnS has it all.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is fair, not really impressive since for me it was predictable towards the end. The \"main\" plot starts later in the series as the first 3/4 is filled with random missions and somewhat fillers like hotspring episodes and so on. Even though the lack of main plot overall disappointed me, I found the story overall satisfying.\r\nArt\r\nThe characters are very nicely drawn, you can clearly see this is a 2007 anime. Effects are good, from flames to wind and other unleashed powers; plusthe characters are drawn good enough for any fan to enjoy the art.  Even though it's no better than other 2007 animes, it clearly has it's own attractiveness for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot much to comment on this area, the sound is fair enough, soundtrack fits the mood all of the time and the opening song is quite catchy once you listen to it. I liked the idea of two ending songs/sequences since it changed with the atmosphere of the episode. Overall it was fine with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were great, I loved them. KnS has it all: the tsundere, the athlete, the rich lady (from America, though speaks English like hell), the lolita and so on. To my surprise, the guys have cool personalities as well, the main lead taking the title of one of the most kick-ass characters, you're gonna like his style. Nothing else to say here, the characters are probably the strong point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWell, as I said, unless you're into magic, combat and ecchi shots from time to time, you're probably not gonna find anything interesting. However, if you like magic battles you'll find this anime cool, plus the characters and some of the situations make the 24 episodes worth the time. I really enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rounded up to around 8. I think it was pretty great and I don't regret seeing it. The main lead remains one of my favorite characters. It's a good thing they have an open end so I really hope for a sequel. That's about it.",

            "content": "I started this thinking \"alas, another predictable action anime which I may end up dropping\" but it had me sucked in to the very end. The reasons? I'll try to explain:\r\nStoryline: 8.5/10\r\nMost action fans would see the storyline as very cliched and predictable, having seen it all played out before. It's storyline does lack, with some filler episodes (such as amusement park visits and hot bath days), and random bad guys which pop up, get defeated, and so moves on to another scenario. However, even though it does lack originality, it's done well and to a good enough standard to enjoy watching it all unravel.\r\nArt:7.5/10\\n\r\nIn one angle, the characters are done well, as your average anime. Not brilliant, but not too bad either. However, sometimes the backgrounds (such as on a busy street) are at a stand-still which is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nAgain, your average action themes running though it, which aren't brilliant, but not too bad either. At the very least they don't get annoying or anything, and stay well positioned in the background.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\r\nAt this point, you're probably thinking why the heck you should watch this anime. Well the secret to it all, which sets it apart from others and keeps you watching, is the characters. The characters themselves are likeable and fit in with the general mood of the anime (some-what cute comedy moments but gets serious when they need to). In one angle they do seem a bit cliched, the average stubborn bad-tempered in-denial girl with the cheeky cold-yet-nice guy but has a dark past, plus the extra nice-but-serious-when-needs-to-be little guy. But the development of the characters, and the development of the romance between the two main protagonists is what really sets it apart. You are kept glued to the screen and get awarded appropriately in the little delightful developments in every episode, and you grow to love every minute. Not to mention the various twists and turns as well, (with added drama) which keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nSure it's all been done before, sure it's not mind-blowingly good, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It was a secure anime to watch and enjoy ~ having everything from love triangles, nice friendships, happy-happy-days-of-fun, comedy moments, love; but also drama, action: all balanced perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nOverall, it was a good watch, and those who are into romance/action types will surely enjoy this.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma I believe had a lot of potential. It started off interesting, not entirely compelling but interesting. Then it went downhill faster than I could write this review. There was also another thing that bothered me, which was the way they handled deaths. When someone not particularly important died, the main characters just shoved it past their shoulders and act like nothing happened. Human life doesn't seem to hold much importance here(particularly to the heroine). Then again what was I expecting? It wasn't entirely an disappointment, I didn't expect much from it but I didn't expect it to be this bad. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nItdoesn't exist. There was a few tidbits of potential at the story but I have to say it just dragged on to different story lines that ended predictably. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nKazuma to me was the only likable person there. If I looked past the fan service and pretty art, he was the only one remotely interesting. Everyone else seemed like filler characters. \\n\\n\r\nAyano to me, was extremely annoying. Whenever something went wrong, it was automatically Kazuma's fault. Especially at the first episode when she disobeyed orders and followed Kazuma which had two people killed. She is irrisponsible, short tempered and incredibly flawed. I did not find a single redeeming factor about her character. And really, screaming Kazuma at pretty much every single episode was not an attractive trait what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nRen is someone I wanted to like, and I admired his peaceful personality in contrast to Ayano's. But he ended up somewhat annoying with his seriously childish antics, and the only time I appreciated him was when he was being useful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nAverage, the OP and ED were truly nothing special. I could forget them and not miss them one bit. That said they weren't that bad, could be a lot better but if it had been any worse, I might have started crying. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nProbably the highlight of it all, and even then it's not that entirely impressive as it lacks personality. Shiny art is shiny, but shininess doesn't mean it's amazing.  Like a higher quality of a mediocre show. While the characters are pretty, the backgrounds are really unmemorable. The action scenes are visually pleasing but not very engaging.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI really did not enjoy it very much. It lacked so much that even if I didn't take it seriously, it was still rather bad to me. The execution of the story was terrible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI would not recommend it. That said I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy this type of anime. It has magic, romance and all the shoujo elements that tweens would like. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I couldn't take it seriously and even the funny parts weren't all that funny, I found myself smiling at best but most of the time I was just waiting for the episode to end.",

It didn't match up to the high recommendation I had received. However, I do appreciate the fun, entertaining aspect.\r\nStory: It was interesting, but not well done. Many things were highly predictable, but I do love the concept of element magic-users and whatnot. \r\nArt: Fair art; some things did not flow well, and just in general, the art is simple. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't enjoy all the fight scenes dueto animations. \\n\r\nSound: Nothing amazing, nothing to complain about. (:\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters didn't connect with me much. They felt too shallow. Nevertheless, they were likable.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it enough to be happy about finishing it, but it's not very memorable. It's a good anime to watch if you're looking for a simple entertainment anime. Just don't expect for it to be a favorite (in my opinion, at least).\\n\r\nHope I helped!",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma has been brought up by me several times as one of my most despised anime, but I've never really had a chance to say why, partly because it came out during a time when light novel adaptations were considered good and any that actually weren't were purged from the collective hive mind that is anime fandom - barring the occasional fanboy who still tries to claim that Kazuma is someone that protagonists should look up to. I saw it during a time when Bakemonogatari was airing, so you can imagine it took a lot to make me hate something when I wasstill buying Kanon and Shana DVDs unironically. I don't remember how I found out about the show beyond random Youtube searches back when you could actually watch anime there, but I remember thinking it seemed like a cool urban fantasy and instead got \"why why why WHYYYYYY?!\"\\n\\n\r\nWhilst Sword Art Online and Mahouka are now considered the poster-boys for \"Gary-Stu fanfiction/wish-fulfillment LN crap that's not even well-animated\", Kaze no Stigma was doing everything it did back in 2007 aka \"the golden year of anime that wasn't actually so golden when you look at it closely\" and whilst I'd hesitate to determine if it's worse than either, it's the one that I hate the most largely because of the \"shock\". You know what I mean. The \"shock\" when you're a newbie who's optimistic about everything, unaware of what the dark side is truly capable of, and when you go in without any preparation you get backlashed so hard to the point that you can actually press charges against the creators. This is why I go into practically every anime with no expectations whatsoever. Because quite frankly, the \"shock\" is something I can do without for the rest of my already miserable life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is centered on Kazuma, a kid who was banished from his family because his female cousin was able to wield magic without setting herself on fire and burning all her clothes off - which isn't nearly as positive as it sounds - and thus goes away for a few years only to return as a stock cocky douche who wields wind magic like Jesus on steroids. His reunion coincides with another wind user killing off his family and rather than do much to clear his name, he arrogantly takes them on, including his cousin (Ayano) who has grown into a beautiful sword-wielding babe so you know what's going to happen to her before the first half of the premiere even concludes. Other characters include Kazuma's brother (Ren), who sounds like a prepubescent kid who smoked too many marlboros, and his dad (don't remember the name and don't care to look it up), who gets hospitalized very early on due to father/son differences that I refuse to describe because I don't want to spend much more effort into hating this show than the creators did in its overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nThis admittedly is difficult to do because the main problem with this show, along with the reason I hate it so much, is that it's completely unimaginative in every single way imaginable (no pun intended). The anime was made by Gonzo post-Welcome to the NHK and that's pretty much all you need to know regarding the production values as well as the overall quality. But even if Kenji Nakamura was set to direct this show, you'd need a complete overhaul of the original source material to make up for writing this phenomenally bad. That story premise I mentioned above gets resolved within the first four episodes and then succumbs to light novel syndrome of padding out the time with lower quality story arcs, and considering how awful the first story arc, that's saying a whole lot. Now I never actually finished this show - get your mouse cursor away from that \"x-mark\" - but I have had some exposure to what I never gave a proper chance and my god it's like the writer wasn't even trying to make the very premise of their story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne story arc is centered on a girl wanting to kill Kazuma to the point that she'd sell her own soul to darkness, which made her the most sympathetic character on the show until her redemption at the end because she was nice to Kazuma as a kid and he even confirms himself that yes, that little thing was all she needed to do for him to care about her. Another one focuses on Jun trying to protect a girl he fell in love with after a five-minute at best playground romp only to discover she's an artificial human with limited time, leading to another vomit-inducing conclusion. There's even an arc where an American chick comes and falls for Kazuma because she's under the impression he has a nine-inch cock when in reality, it's (censored, but I assure you it's a small number) inches long. If mediocrity was an Olympic event, it'd get unanimous tens all across the board.\\n\\n\r\nThere's even an arc where Kazuma has to suppress a super powered dark side, which is meant to be the overlying plot that connects the various stories together, that has no weight to it because A) it actually makes him weaker, so I dunno why he has it to begin with B) he's so much of a hypocritical asshole as is that there's practically no contrast. Literally every second he's on-screen is a second that I want to steal his powers and go all Texas Chainsaw Massacre with them on his face, because the writer just can't seem to write his \"loner with a heart of gold who gets all the ladies, seems to always know what's going on, and never gets so much as a scratch on him throughout the entire show\" character consistently and decide whether his facade is an act or not. Not that the other characters are much better, being shallow stock stereotypes who wear the same outfit to the point that Ayano had to decide between four identical school uniforms to wear to a date, but at least they're straight-forward and actually get dirt on their faces (which says a lot about the show's quality when that's the best you have to say for them).\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course it wouldn't be a wish-fulfillment Gary Stu story without awful action scenes that looked like they were conceived and choreographed by interns for the janitor position. They use the same stock footage of Ayano summoning her sword almost every single episode and it doesn't even work on the bad guys 95% of the time, which makes her even less competent than Asuna or Miyuki and ain't that a sad truth? Kazuma's wind powers are so cheap both in practice and in a visual sense that he doesn't even have to move in order to use them, which is pretty much the triple-threat of boring action right there.\\n\\n\r\nNot that he moves during the non-action scenes either. I recall one episode where he, Ayano, and a bunch of her friends explore the school late at night and make the girls perform lame comedic routines whilst he just smiles without revealing the truth because we needed the plot to go on for an entire episode because we have two cours to fill and we don't have the brains to fill them with anything more meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nWell I refuse to be the kettle that calls this show black, Gonzo, so I'm ending this review of your uninspired mess right now before my own imagination is sucked dry from this black hole (I don't see myself as a kettle, so I feel no hypocrisy in calling Kaze no Stigma that) of banal story, characters, animation, music, and even author existence - the writer of the original light novels passed away before he could finish the series - that in retrospect, I shouldn't have rediscovered in the first place.",

Kaze no Stigma uses the slightly underused approach of magic users and ninja clans in modern times, but, surprisingly, it's not meant to be wacky or childish like other anime of its genre.  This gave me high hopes, and I remember catching myself thinking, during the first few episodes \"this will really have to take a turn for the worse to prevent me from finishing it\".\r\nAfter sitting through clich\u00e9 episode after clich\u00e9 episode, I finally dropped it.  While I like the main hero, Yagami Kazuma, the heroin, Kannagi Ayano is what ruined theseries for me.  Not only does her Japanese voice actress kinda suck in this role, her 'burn run time transformation-esque' summoning of Enraiha against every little thing really pissed me off.  She never fights using just fire magic, and, despite an early youma kill that was supposed to display her adept fighting abilities, she spends 90% of her time being a decoy, getting defeated, getting caught, and, like any romantic comedy anime, blaming the male lead for her shortcomings.  She's childish, weak, poor-sounding, but well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is up to par, but everything else could have been done so much better; Kaze no Stigma is a testament to the old saying \"All that glitters is not gold\".",

            "content": "A somewhat decent Action, Romance with demons and the 4 elements. This anime is enjoyable to watch but it really lacks originality. ^_^\r\nFrom the very first episode, the story is really easy to understand because there is nothing all that new about the premise. It is just the typical story of a boy and girl that team up to defeat the bad guys that randomly show up. From here it continues with the random mini adventures and it doesn&rsquo;t really try to do anything special about it, so hardcore anime fans will feel like they have seen it all before. You may begin to wonderwhy you should even continue watching this anime if it is just like this however the story does kick off, in the latter half of the series. Even the pointless episodes are really fun to watch but what&rsquo;s better are the little developments in some characters, though the ending is somewhat predictable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters we have Kazuma Yagami, a sort of anti-hero who became incredibly strong after being disowned by his dad. He is probably the most interesting character in the series; because he is a very understandable, with a distinguished personality that is brought out by the superb voice acting. And this cannot be an action romance anime without the typical &quot;Tsundere&quot;, Ayano Kannagi. There are more characters but they are really insignificant that they can be easily overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of Kaze no Stigma&rsquo;s animation is pretty hard to judge. At one stand point we have: some well animated fight scenes, some well-placed CG and good ecchi moments. Yet half the time the animation looks cheap with: some poor character designs (mostly bad guys), tacky effects and no movement coming from the background. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really weak and there are only a few notable tunes that allow it to redeem itself. Although during the fights, or even in normal conversations, there is two female characters that can be both funny and annoying to listen to (Ayano &amp; Katherine).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this proved to be a very enjoyable anime with plenty of laughs, most of those laughs are thanks to the great odd couple. Nevertheless there is nothing about this series that allows it to stand out, in the action romance category; unlike the popular Full Metal Panic! or the Shakugan no Shana series. But don&rsquo;t let that deter you from watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Imagine an anime where certain people have discovered how to magically control fire, wind, earth and water. One of them is Kazuma Yagami, a former member of the Kannagi clan, a group that uses fire. After being abandoned by his family, friends and clan for his inability to use fire, Kazuma returns to his clan, now a wind magic user. Believing him to be a traitor for his use of wind magic, the clan falsely accuses Kazuma of killing off members of their clan. It is now up to Kazuma to clear his name and hopefully regain the trust of his family. Add this storywith a voice casting of screaming people, storytelling that leaves you with pointless information, the most unlikable cast of characters seen on the screen and you get the wretched project known as Stigma of the Wind, Junichi Sakata's latest entry (and failure) in the anime library.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story starts off with an interesting premise, it takes a nosedive after the third episode. It unfortunately tries to be a mystery, romance, drama, action, horror and comedy at the same time, causing lots of confusion and missed plot opportunities. Whether it be some random guy pretending to be an angel (I'm serious), or a guy licking wine off of someone's cheek, the show seems to reject anything normal in favor of complete chaos and anarchy. This wouldn't be a problem, except that nothing about these moments are funny. It's just insulting to the viewer's intelligence, since they paid the insane price of $50 for part one of the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are annoying and overacted, with the exception of the main character, Kazuma Yagami, who is calm and collected. A perfect example would be Ayano Kannagi the truth. Ayano reluctantly becomes an ally of Kazuma. Unfortunately, the first few lines in the pilot episode is her shouting, \"I hate the wind!\", giving the viewer a clear indication that she is going to be overacted in every possible sense of the word. Kazuma's relative, Ren Kannagi, is also a bit batty, but it's shocking when the viewer discovers halfway throughout the series that he is in fact a boy. Everything that Ren does, from the way he looks, to the feminine personality he has, gives you the false impression that he is a girl in the first place. Top all of this off with the fact that each character has their own annoying voice, making this one of the worst gang of animated characters ever to grace DVD.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one aspect the series gets right, it's the artwork. Each frame of animation is extremely polished, with impressive animations, solid character design and a very clean look. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything remotely unique, which is a missed opportunity, as the clean animation would have allowed plenty of successful innovation.\\n\\n\r\nStigma of the Wind isn\u2019t the worst anime I have seen, but it sure is a messy one. The director really should have spent more time developing each character. Instead we get characters that scream at each other for no reason, constantly whine annoyingly and act in an incredibly illogical manner. It's not like this is cheap entertainment either, as it cost $100 for the first season, stopping me from ever recommending this to anyone. Please stay away, as dissatisfaction is the only result that will occur after wasting money on this lamentable product.",

            "content": "Well, first let's be honest, I have only watched 1 episode of this anime so in the end I could change my overall rating to the entire different location. From a 7 to a 1 for instance, hey! It could happen! Making a review is pretty hard to do when there was only 1 episode which I have watched.\r\nStory:\r\nLet's look at the basic shall we? First there is a clan, called the Kannagi family. This are all Fire Mages, but one of them isn't cut out to become a Fire Mage. And seems to have better use for the Wind instead of Fire. So far,the story I given a 7... as I think if it is progressing quit a way it could become really interesting. But so far, I haven't really counted this one in the Overall Score as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nWell, animation is pretty hard to describe every time in my opinion. I think that an anime serie where you can see what is going on scores high in animation, also if the looks of the characters are good (most important in anime; EYES). In the serie &quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; you instantly see everything you are suppose to see. There is no: &quot;What the f*ck is going on, I can't see anything&quot; and the light is good enough to enjoy. So it get's a 8, since it is very good. (not perfect, so far, there hasn't been a single anime I found perfect animation)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSounds are fair, I guess ... but nog enough for a 6 however. The OST is good and has some extra atmosphere in the serie. When it's talking you see, you hear a mysterieus tune, when it is action you see you also hear a good background music to match with the action. I found the background music almost as appealing as another anime called &quot;Claymore&quot;. I give it a 7 in this mark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the thing that is absolutely impossible to rate like this after seeing 1 episode. You haven't know the characters quit as good, for to know a character you need to watch about 10 episodes (or 5 if it is a miniserie such as Hellsing). I just give it a 7, as I predict these characters will become pretty awesome at the end... but this is just A GAMBLE!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime &quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; a lot. So hey... why I given it a 9? Because it is simply that fun to see. But again, it is in most of the time the first episode is the most best one. So I counted this out of the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n&quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; is fun to watch ... I don't think I have nothing else to tell you about why I given this anime a 7. So I just leave it with this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso again, keep in mind that I only watched 1 episode! Maybe there is already episode 2 out and becoming avaible for download, but I wrote it at the time there was only 1 episode. But still, this anime could become REALLY interesting. My opinion on the end is that if you liked Claymore... I think you can also enjoy this anime. Except this one isn't in the middle ages.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*In the style of Ichimaru Gin from Bleach*\\n\r\n&quot;Byebye!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nEdits:\\n\r\nDate: 24 april 2007\\n\r\nChanges: Reread it and fixed some mistakes. For instance, the overall rating was 7, not 8 as I said in the intro at the time. This problem is removed!\\n\\n\r\nDate: 24 april 2007\\n\r\nChanges: Finally found the codes to make it bold, italic and/or underline... I was always trying [B] and [/B] ... seems like it could only work in lower case.",

            "content": "I can\u2019t tell, why exactly I picked up this show. No, seriously, why did I? Maybe I wanted to see a big load of crispy action paired with a bit of romance and some comedy. I can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t receive all of that. I had my fun with Kaze no Stigma, but I actually should\u2019ve avoided this show. I\u2019m going to tell why.\r\nStory  (5/10)\r\nThe story of Kaze no Stigma is divided in a few arcs. We got to see some entirely comedic episodes, some episodes focused on investigation and few ones with a highly serious undertone. Yep, there is pretty much nomajor story arc in Kaze no Stigma. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is slightly someone bigger in there who might actually be the \u201cend boss\u201d, but\u2026 that\u2019s all? Come on now. \\n\r\nSo, the story. The beginning, pretty much the first half of the series is pretty good \u2013 easy to watch and really entertaining. The show is throughout great at not taking itself too seriously. Well - at first, because the second half is the total opposite of the first episodes. While still not being too serious about itself, Kaze no Stigma now feels like an old chunk of bread \u2013 chewy and unbearable. The comedy factor is pretty much dead while the drama is being forced out of literally nowhere. It feels like Kaze no Stigma is not working anymore in its own pace. The execution of the so-called plot twists is downright ridiculous, just like some strange and long passages which are completely meaningless \u2013 but we still get to see them.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nThe show is pretty old, I understand that. Yeah, so is the art in there. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t bother me too much at this point, I don\u2019t need a show to be an artistic masterpiece. But still, while some effects are pretty good, the majority of the art we see looks pretty unattractive today.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nThere is not really much to say about the sound part. The opening and closing songs are fine, they fit the idea of Kaze no Stigma in a good way. Sadly I couldn\u2019t find any memorable music in the show itself, the number of the songs is small, but at least it\u2019s not getting annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\r\nOh boy. That\u2019s pretty much the weakest point of Kaze no Stigma. I have to agree, Kazuma might be a really good character. Might be, because the basic approach is fine, the later execution\u2019s not. Kazuma starts off pretty damn cool, being a badass mage out of nowhere. As the show advances, he is getting completely soaked in into the mash of generic and poor characterization. But, oh well \u2013 there is the rest of the characters in there already! Seriously, we can completely forget about the character cast \u2013 they\u2018re all highly generic and replaceable, not a single one of them is somewhere near unique. Character development? Little to zero. I don\u2019t intend to make it look bad, but what we get here is not much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and final rating (6/10)\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma is not great. There are weaknesses all over the place and it could\u2019ve been much, MUCH better.  BUT \u2013 it\u2019s not that bad at all. So, let me leave a little advice here: don\u2019t take this show too seriously and you might find your peace in it. Or just a little piece of enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, with the wonderful story of Kaze no Stigma fresh in my mind, I believe now is the perfect time to write a review for how I wasted my day.\r\nStory: 5\r\nWell, the story, nothing special, but not too bad. Mediocre is the perfect word to describe it. I'm not going to go too in depth with it, but I had high hopes upon reading about an overpowered person who comes back to a family who disowned him. To me, sounded pretty good, so I gave it ago. A few flaws. Earliest flaw I noticed was the fights, which might just be me, but the fightseither took three quarters of the episode or thirty seconds. Now, I don't like fights where it takes a long time, but I certainly don't like thirty second over-hyped moments. The second flaw I noticed with the story is that later in the story, which may be a spoiler, is that when Kazuma goes hatred mode and is suppose to get more powerful, which they showcase well, as soon as Ayano interferes, Kazuma is super weak. I just... I just don't get it. Alright, spoiler over. There were a few more minor flaws I had with the story, but they weren't necessary to add.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure how to rate the art, but compared to earlier ones it was mediocre. The reason it's a four and not five is because the fanservice they tried to add was a miserable failure. There's really no other way to put it. They had quite a bit of pantsu shots, and I don't mind fanservice. As a male, I even encourage it. Just kidding, for the most part. But the problem with this particular fanservice was that the panties were just kind of like... there. I don't think I am allowed to post links here, so I won't, but the panties didn't have any... what's the word, I guess, depth. The creators could have just added another line in the middle to make it slightly arousing, but no, nope, nah.  The other thing that bothered me about Ayano was her clothes. I think she's seen once out of her generic school uniform.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nPersonally I didn't like the opening, or the outro, which both sounded as generic as the characters, but it's really just an opinion, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nYou know, this was one of the most \"okay\" things of the show. Like, generic overpowered main character? Alright. Generic tsundere? Hm, okay. But then there was one that brought back trauma to me specifically. That character was Ren. What trauma, you may ask? Only the scariest of scary. It was... Boku no Pico. I mean seriously, I was willing to sweep the fact that Ren looked almost identical to Pico under the rug. But no, f**king no, they had to make two, I repeat, TWO, scenes of Pico, I mean, Ren, massaging Juugo, which wouldn't have been too bad if it wasn't for him grunting and Ren straddling him and rubbing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show, with an exception, which I will discuss below. This show, again, I genuinely enjoyed it. There were moments of actual hype and whatnot. I did enjoy the romance, until it was super forced with that McDonald girl. Why give a character the last name McDonald when she eats in a WcDonald? She came from America? Is Japan getting at something here? Well, I'm getting off track, so I'll skip to the overall now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nNow, if you've made it this far, you're probably wondering, why is the overall a four? I'll tell you why. The ending. If the ending wasn't so bad, I would easily give this overall a six. Let me tell you why the ending was so bad.\\n\r\n***SPOILERS BELOW***\\n\r\nFirstly, the ending battle, the giant shadow hole? A demon climbing out of it? A giant magic circle? Where have I seen this before? Secondly, the romance, one of the few things of this show that I really found good. I was hoping that they would kiss on the final episode. Did they? Nope. What did they do? F**king generic overpowered character summons a wind to push her hair back towards him. Could have been really cute, I guess. What does Kazuma do with Ayano's hair? He grabs it, and during this whole time Ayano is blushing like crazy, and smells her hair. And he gets into it, man. He goes f**king hardcore. He follows it up by a pat on Ayano's butt. Who says romance is dead? The closest thing they get in this show to a kiss is a lick on Ayano's face.\\n\r\n***SPOILERS ENDED***\\n\\n\r\nYeah, so, in needless to say, if you're bored and have the entire day to do nothing, watch it. Otherwise, go watch somethin' else.\\n",

By the same token the look of the magic used especially the elements of fire make it awe inspiring to watch...nearly artistic in my opinion\r\nCharacters:\r\nWhat made me fall in love with this anime series is the english dub for the Kazuma and his choice of sarcastic words,very commonly main protagonists that have super power but either look clueless or dumbfounded when a situation occurs and rely on luck to pull through; however Kazuma's character I think is perfect since I like how he teases some of the other characters, pull off some awesome attacks and still have time to show a heart to those he cares for....despite his sarcasm\\n\\n\r\nI loved it all and I hope there are a few more like it out there in the anime world\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Kaze no stigma is a decent anime but it's hard for me to say that it was an excellent or even great anime. The only reason I could think for telling someone to watch it would be if you were really bored and had nothing else to do.\r\nStory:\r\nDespite ending the series leaving a lot of questions unanswered I just personally couldn't get myself to care that much. It's very predictable but I feel that way about the majority of the anime that I watch so if that sorta thing doesn't bug you, you'll enjoy this. On the other hand I felt like the cousin datingwas really unnecessary. ignoring that their related, trowing in romance doesn't make you story any better and to me it sorta felt lazy. almost like a what should we do, well I guess we'll make them date situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI felt like the art work was decent, nothing really all that wrong with it. I personally wish there were less panty shots mainly just because of the timing (I want to see character fight when they fight not their underwear). Despite the panty shots this anime isn't any worst than really anything else out there (Fairly decent I'd say) so don't let that keep you from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasn't anything memorable but your ears will be safe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: No one was original. all the typical stereotypes you tend to find and for most people that shouldn't really upset you. I found it very hard to care about them personally but very few anime get me to care about the whole cast even with very original characters so I believe the majority of you will feel different.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime, there's nothing special about it but it's short enough that I didn't really mind. I like shorter animes, you may feel differently but I've noticed the longer something goes on the more filler there will be and quite frankly I hate filler with all my heart. This show does not have pointless episode after pointless episode and that's normally enough for me at lest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll give it a seven. I feel like most people who would watch this anime on their own will enjoy it and that is good enough really. It is not the best but it's not bad. On the other hand if you hate story's with unanswered questions and incomplete endings  you should probably stay away. I didn't realize the anime was incomplete and was going to stay that way or I probably wouldn't have watched it. Normally I'd avoid such a thing but the lack of an engaging plot made me realize I only care about the ending if I care about the story.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say there is no need to go out of the way to watch this anime but there is also no reason for most people to avoid it.",

            "content": "Kaze no stigma is an Action/fantasy anime that got some of my attention, but it has some flaws. \r\nStory (7.2) - Not amazing. Its just an average story. In my opinion lacks originality, as this story is very cliche. It has some fillers, some episodes with no sense at all that appear out of nowhere and where nothing important really happens. In the final episodes, it gets a little better in this aspect, but still story is not an aspect that got my attention.\r\nArt (8.4) - The characters are well designed, and the effects are pretty good. You can see it when the characters usetheir powers, the flames and wind, and other powers, its really nice. Not the very best art from all times, but still is a nice aspect this anime has to give. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.0) - Another not so impressing aspect. The sound sure give some atmosphere and isnt anoying, but its definitively nothing great. Just and average in my opinion. Enough to keep some interest in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.9)- I liked this aspect. Well develloped characters and looking cool.\\n\r\nThe main character, Yagami Kazuma is definetively very good, it gave an extra interest to this anime. Another aspect i liked was the variety of characters this anime have, where you clearly see many differences between them, and their relations with each other, that keeps the show interesting during some moments where the story lacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.0) - A fine anime, not the best, but a good one to watch and pass some time. It has a lot of action in some moments, also we you can find romance and comedy in this anime. A nice way to spend time, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8) - For a tittle that didnt said much to me at start, it was really a nice surprise. Ok, its not fantastic, but surely is a good anime and if you like magic and battles stuff, then you should give it a try.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boy, oh boy, trying to advertise, let alone making a solid case as to why one should watch this dinosaur stab at the light novel adaptation romp is an amusing enough attempt for anyone to humor I would say.\r\nA Relic of its Time?:\r\nMake no mistake, my case isn't so lofty since it's down to this reality: In riding the trend that more or less started from the Rie Kugimiya/J.C. Staff works (Shana, Familiar of Zero, Index, Toradora, etc), Kaze no Stigma was one of the few cases that got all the raw basic components to bounce off each other in juuuust the right chemistry balance.The result being a rather straightforward power fantasy that invokes honest cool factor appeal without much of grating aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nSuch basic ingredients (and subsequent welcome tweaking) are as follows,\\n\\n\r\n1. A protagonist who, in the framing of the premise, technically an underdog (but he's actually a stone-cold badass because the story is actually about him one-upping his past instead of the usual \"I will be better than them all!\" BS).\\n\\n\r\n2. You get your then standard red-haired obstinate obligatory heroine who is both a foil and a means for the \"romance\" - light novel romance was mostly ball-busting back then marketed as a cuteness (but she actually serves as a reminder of just how cool the protagonist is, reversing the then typical dynamic of such shows).\\n\\n\r\n3. Story arcs that paint broad strokes for main character layers/world building to excuse later stuff (but said story arcs are generally low-key enough to not overextend anything beyond the core appeal of watching the protagonist being a thug bro).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, previously mentioned J.C. Staff anime usually bit off more than they could chew, especially if they skewed the supernatural/fantasy department, very often losing focus of why audiences were watching them in the first place.\\n\r\nAnd let's be honest, if this rather seasoned anime consumer has learned anything from light novel stuff, is that they are trashy, shameless guilty pleasures displaying no more depth or accountability for their writing than they are at furthering stagnant character shipping.\\n\\n\r\nEnter a Humble Confidence:\\n\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma has no such shackles in-comparison. It knows you are watching the show because the hero is legit, that you find a brazen tsundere  more annoying than endearing but also wants you find their rapport work out because... gosh darnit, this is still a light novel anime and we're all looking for that one sweet example that provides us our metaphorical cake and lets us eat it too.\\n\\n\r\nBut what else does the show provide beyond that? Seriously, don't ask that, it's about a badass being allowed to do what he wants, go away if that's not enough. I mean, there's a wimpy brother to remind us who the protagonist would typically be if this were your ordinary light novel show so... be grateful for the in-show reminder that you could always do worse? I guess?\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of opportunities for numerous character arcs to rub in the tsundere's face how much she is attracted to the protagonist even when she's too dense to realize it herself-shtick. That's not exactly new, but it's more fun here since it's turned on its head, usually giving the protagonist means to flirt with her which is great. Cuz... he's a badass.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else... oh, yeah I mentioned world building. Honestly, the scope of the story doesn't go beyond one central location that is never really broadened upon but even that's okay since most other crap do their best to have every new arc take place in the same boring city no matter how long or extreme the stakes rise.\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma doesn't bother with all that noise since it already establishes that nothing can touch the badass; rather than find ways to debunk that greatness, it prioritizes on introducing as few new characters as much as possible (admittedly, that's as much as a weakness as this show shares with its peers), in exchange for having about 4-5 primary arcs investing us with the leads.\\n\r\nI swear this basic, down-to-earth storytelling is so effective you almost wonder if other shit kept introducing stuff because they were trying to hide how shameless their respective bad writing was.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Kaze no Stigma knows what it is and owns its appeals instead of drowning it. And it's about a badass, in case you forgot.\\n\\n\r\nIs it Pretty? Well.... Ehhhhhh?:\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I should say something about music and art huh, this being visual storytelling and, as a buddy of mine says, \"if you aren't watching anime for pretty visuals, what are you watching it for?\" True words, but this was made dark horse studio Gonzo, notorious for a lot, not least of which their clunky use of CGI.\\n\r\nFortunately enough, KnS doesn't flaunt that aspect but keeps a rather decent grip on its action budget. You get your lazy-off screen editing from time to time but it's choreographed alright; keeps you interested to see how everyone pales against the badass ultimately, so I'll give the animation pass since it's not jarring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are standard as hell; nothing too much to say here. Gonzo articulates enough relevant body language among the limited characters, and some obligatory trash light novel humor (jealous fits, attempts at battery - oh ho ho ho, so funny!) but, as I said, it all works here because there's an unflappable main character for once who shuts it down for the silliness it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly just... there, does enough to set the mood but I can't exactly pinpoint any notable tracks or OST themes that demand deification. \"meh\" is the word. The OP and END tracks are extensions of this claim too. Passable and forgettable, but not damning.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, I think whoever's reading this gets me by now. This is a fairly older series but it's aged well in that most genre stabs made nowadays want a rather blank slate for their male heroes instead of giving them a palpable personality. Personally, this doesn't help those shows' immersion any further than if they had classic goobers from KnS' generation, we all watch this crap for the gratification so why be blase about the execution?\\n\\n\r\nGotta hand it to you Gonzo, you may have gotten stuck with a series that ended in eternal limbo, but at least it's indicative how much fun the genre can be when you take pride a lil'. \\n\\n\r\nNumber Grades\\n\r\nStory 5/10 - In actuality, it's a 4, but since most of the time is spent playing around with the characters painlessly, if not shamelessly fun, it gets a bump up for fidelity.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10 - Nothing special for a TV show of its era. Coherent, capable and consistent, you aren't watching an action show needless to say, but's easy enough on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 -  I mean... it's there. Seriously, what do want me to say? Not every anime needs a grossly inflated production. It's presence so prosaic in implementation that I am too indifferent for it to matter honestly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 - Ahah..... here we are, the real meat and potatoes of the show's value. Character tropes handled with unusual finesse and underrated ownership, I could almost boast that watching this gives you all the excuse one needs to never watch another light novel anime again (some exceptions of course...) Rare to find a show who reminds a jaded person why and how cliches can be comfort food staples of quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 - So this is a tricky scenario. The entire time I mentioned how there's this badass main character who makes up LITERALLY ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL OTHERS, but let me give some proof: The english dub. Funimation, through some divine guidance, picked THE best guy to voice Kazuma. Robert McCollum. Seriously, he makes the character drip with more charisma than any part of the show's modest budget can allow, which essentially means that HE is the show! Cherami Leigh does a solid take on Ayano, capturing her feisty arrogance while downplaying any of the usual obnoxiousness that no doubt would be in the Japanese. Seriously, the dub is so choice for this show that I can never rewatch this show in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 - Light novel power fantasy romps are hard to come by without any grimacing or eye-rolling involved, but KnS is a treasure in this regard. It may not have an identity beyond that quality but like a tasty classic meal you've had countless times over with just a teensy little spice for rejuvenation, once you've tasted Kaze no Stigma, you can't help but smile at the simple pleasure it offers.",

            "content": "Alrighty, here it goes, my second review:\r\n*Story* 8/10\r\nThe story for Kaze no Stigma (KnS) in my opinion was going to be stereotypical: cool awesome guy, possible love interest girl, his brother, a vengeance type plot relating to his family, etc etc... save the world and the anime gets 5/10... however after watching the anime can i say wow... sure it had some plot holes, for example the Stigma of the Wind is never really explained, and Kazuma's past seems rushed, however this does not really matter, because the story has enough twists and turns to keep you watching, and of course the usual love/romantic sidestory between characters always adds a comedic side, overall i found that although it was a bit stereotypical, i thoroughly enjoyed this solid anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Art* 7/10\\n\r\nArtwork in KnS was solid throughout the anime, wind was a major highlight of this anime, and the way the effects were done for the wind was a highlight, nothing really defied the laws of physics, and the wind seemed realistic. The main problem i had was with the fire artwork, to me it seemed as though the creators got lazy with fire and decided to just re-use the same boring fire image all over again, a bit a variance and realism would have been nice. However what really uplifts this anime is the character artwork, Kazuma looked cool, Ayano looked great, and ren looked loli-shota =P In my opinion the character artwork was above average for a 2007 anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound* 7/10\\n\r\nThe special effects sound was ok, i felt that something was missing in the fight scenes however, the anime needed more of a boom factor, and at times it seemed as if was lacking in BGM as well as the needed sword clashing sfx. The seiyuu's in this anime were fair, nothing outstanding, however well done to the Fujimura Ayumi, her voice acting for Ayano was one of the great things in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Character* 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the highlight of this anime, although it may seem  stereotypical, it is their construction that really outshines anything else. Kazuma's dark past really gives his character a Light Yagami sort of feel and i thoroughly enjoyed it, Ayano and Ren were great to, Ayano was a great tsundere/moe type character and the Ren side story really moved me close to tears, it reminded me of the FSN ending ;(.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* 8/10\\n\r\nNeed more be said? The characters pulled this anime through, and even though the sound wasn't anything new and the story wasn't all that amazing, i stil thoroughly enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*OP and ED* 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP was constant for all 24 episodes, and it was a bit bland at times, but not to the extent that i had to skip it. The ED's on the other hand were on opposite ends of the scale, the first ed Hitorikiri no Sora was in my opinion dull and boring instead of reflective, the second ed Ayumi Fujimura Matataki no Kiwoku was far better, and in my opinion a great ED to remember. However one song struck me, and that was Kanako Sakai Tsuki Hana no Inori, the ED for episode 12 and also an insert song... that one song has made my list of most memorable reflective songs after a significant event rivaling songs such as Hikari by Jyukai.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 7/10\\n\r\nA nice solid anime, not a must see, but one you should definitely take a glance at. The ending is very enjoyable, and it is worth the watch, the climax in the middle of the anime is fantastic, and like i said before the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\n~Savage the Fate/Stay Night Otaku~",

Well.... to be truthful, this is a lot like both of those anime. And to be frank, the red-haired tsundere in this anime (Ayano) doesn't measure up to the leads in the others. She's not nearly as badass as Shana and not nearly as adorable or lovable as Louise. However, it's Kazuma, the other lead, that really makes this show fly. It's really refreshing to watch a show wherethe main lead is a total freaking badass and the conflict is not him trying to become more powerful, but rather struggling with his control of it. There are so many cliches his character could have fallen into but it never happened. The first test was when he faced his dad in battle a few episodes in. The cliche would have been for him to lose only to beat him later. NOPE! Kazuma took that old guy out! I won't spoil anything more (although it's hardly a spoiler. Their battle lasted like a minute.) but Kazuma is the reason to watch and really enjoy this show and he never disappoints. The ending was garbage as far as the romance goes (a warning for you out there looking for magic-girl romance), but the rest of it was satisfying and there's good reason to hope for Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSolid anime. I would recommend it to anyone.",

The first half of the series are just assignments and later on in the series is where most of the major plot elements begin. However, I would have liked It If they have gotten deeper into Kazuma's past because It seems like they don't explain as much. Overall, the story of Kaze No Stigma kept It interesting till' the end.\r\nArt: 7.5/10\r\nI'm overall impressed with the Artwork for a 2007 Anime, but the animations and/or effects could have been better. Mainly, where Ayanouses her fire magic and It seems like the creators just kept re-using those scenes  rather than changing It up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.7/10\\n\r\nMusic is impressive, effects are decent. For this portion of the Review, I would like to say that I watched the dub version than the raw version. In any case If you wish to watch the dub and thinking whether or not the English Voices are done well, I will talk about It here. Now, I am impressed on how well this anime was dubbed. My favorite one would be Kazuma's voice actor because of his ignorant and jerky attitude really suits him quite well. Ayano's voice actor is high pitched, It can be an annoyance sometimes, but that's pretty much Ayano's personality for the most part, so I can't really say much about the pitch of her voice. Ren's voice actor is also decent. It suits him pretty well, I can't complain anything about that. Just overall, the Dub isn't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nGotta say, I love the characters introduced in this series. My favorite would be Kazuma. I just love his personality. He is funny at times and of course his jerky attitude. Ayano is also another interesting character to point out as well as Ren.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nConsidering this is my first time entering a new genre of Supernatural or \"magic\" animes, I gotta say that I enjoyed Kaze no Stigma. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.0/10\\n\r\nOverall, Kaze no Stigma is one interesting anime. It has a mixed of Comedy, Action, and depressing moments. Pacing is decent, not too fast, not too slow, just in the middle. But If your the type of person who decides to look into more anime that have superpowers, Kaze no Stigma won't be a disappointment.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma is a fun anime if you're interested into this genre. Battles, magic, comedy, kick-ass moments, KnS has it all.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is fair, not really impressive since for me it was predictable towards the end. The \"main\" plot starts later in the series as the first 3/4 is filled with random missions and somewhat fillers like hotspring episodes and so on. Even though the lack of main plot overall disappointed me, I found the story overall satisfying.\r\nArt\r\nThe characters are very nicely drawn, you can clearly see this is a 2007 anime. Effects are good, from flames to wind and other unleashed powers; plusthe characters are drawn good enough for any fan to enjoy the art.  Even though it's no better than other 2007 animes, it clearly has it's own attractiveness for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot much to comment on this area, the sound is fair enough, soundtrack fits the mood all of the time and the opening song is quite catchy once you listen to it. I liked the idea of two ending songs/sequences since it changed with the atmosphere of the episode. Overall it was fine with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were great, I loved them. KnS has it all: the tsundere, the athlete, the rich lady (from America, though speaks English like hell), the lolita and so on. To my surprise, the guys have cool personalities as well, the main lead taking the title of one of the most kick-ass characters, you're gonna like his style. Nothing else to say here, the characters are probably the strong point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWell, as I said, unless you're into magic, combat and ecchi shots from time to time, you're probably not gonna find anything interesting. However, if you like magic battles you'll find this anime cool, plus the characters and some of the situations make the 24 episodes worth the time. I really enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rounded up to around 8. I think it was pretty great and I don't regret seeing it. The main lead remains one of my favorite characters. It's a good thing they have an open end so I really hope for a sequel. That's about it.",

            "content": "I started this thinking \"alas, another predictable action anime which I may end up dropping\" but it had me sucked in to the very end. The reasons? I'll try to explain:\r\nStoryline: 8.5/10\r\nMost action fans would see the storyline as very cliched and predictable, having seen it all played out before. It's storyline does lack, with some filler episodes (such as amusement park visits and hot bath days), and random bad guys which pop up, get defeated, and so moves on to another scenario. However, even though it does lack originality, it's done well and to a good enough standard to enjoy watching it all unravel.\r\nArt:7.5/10\\n\r\nIn one angle, the characters are done well, as your average anime. Not brilliant, but not too bad either. However, sometimes the backgrounds (such as on a busy street) are at a stand-still which is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\r\nAgain, your average action themes running though it, which aren't brilliant, but not too bad either. At the very least they don't get annoying or anything, and stay well positioned in the background.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\r\nAt this point, you're probably thinking why the heck you should watch this anime. Well the secret to it all, which sets it apart from others and keeps you watching, is the characters. The characters themselves are likeable and fit in with the general mood of the anime (some-what cute comedy moments but gets serious when they need to). In one angle they do seem a bit cliched, the average stubborn bad-tempered in-denial girl with the cheeky cold-yet-nice guy but has a dark past, plus the extra nice-but-serious-when-needs-to-be little guy. But the development of the characters, and the development of the romance between the two main protagonists is what really sets it apart. You are kept glued to the screen and get awarded appropriately in the little delightful developments in every episode, and you grow to love every minute. Not to mention the various twists and turns as well, (with added drama) which keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nSure it's all been done before, sure it's not mind-blowingly good, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It was a secure anime to watch and enjoy ~ having everything from love triangles, nice friendships, happy-happy-days-of-fun, comedy moments, love; but also drama, action: all balanced perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nOverall, it was a good watch, and those who are into romance/action types will surely enjoy this.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma I believe had a lot of potential. It started off interesting, not entirely compelling but interesting. Then it went downhill faster than I could write this review. There was also another thing that bothered me, which was the way they handled deaths. When someone not particularly important died, the main characters just shoved it past their shoulders and act like nothing happened. Human life doesn't seem to hold much importance here(particularly to the heroine). Then again what was I expecting? It wasn't entirely an disappointment, I didn't expect much from it but I didn't expect it to be this bad. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nItdoesn't exist. There was a few tidbits of potential at the story but I have to say it just dragged on to different story lines that ended predictably. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nKazuma to me was the only likable person there. If I looked past the fan service and pretty art, he was the only one remotely interesting. Everyone else seemed like filler characters. \\n\\n\r\nAyano to me, was extremely annoying. Whenever something went wrong, it was automatically Kazuma's fault. Especially at the first episode when she disobeyed orders and followed Kazuma which had two people killed. She is irrisponsible, short tempered and incredibly flawed. I did not find a single redeeming factor about her character. And really, screaming Kazuma at pretty much every single episode was not an attractive trait what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nRen is someone I wanted to like, and I admired his peaceful personality in contrast to Ayano's. But he ended up somewhat annoying with his seriously childish antics, and the only time I appreciated him was when he was being useful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nAverage, the OP and ED were truly nothing special. I could forget them and not miss them one bit. That said they weren't that bad, could be a lot better but if it had been any worse, I might have started crying. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nProbably the highlight of it all, and even then it's not that entirely impressive as it lacks personality. Shiny art is shiny, but shininess doesn't mean it's amazing.  Like a higher quality of a mediocre show. While the characters are pretty, the backgrounds are really unmemorable. The action scenes are visually pleasing but not very engaging.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI really did not enjoy it very much. It lacked so much that even if I didn't take it seriously, it was still rather bad to me. The execution of the story was terrible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI would not recommend it. That said I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy this type of anime. It has magic, romance and all the shoujo elements that tweens would like. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I couldn't take it seriously and even the funny parts weren't all that funny, I found myself smiling at best but most of the time I was just waiting for the episode to end.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma has been brought up by me several times as one of my most despised anime, but I've never really had a chance to say why, partly because it came out during a time when light novel adaptations were considered good and any that actually weren't were purged from the collective hive mind that is anime fandom - barring the occasional fanboy who still tries to claim that Kazuma is someone that protagonists should look up to. I saw it during a time when Bakemonogatari was airing, so you can imagine it took a lot to make me hate something when I wasstill buying Kanon and Shana DVDs unironically. I don't remember how I found out about the show beyond random Youtube searches back when you could actually watch anime there, but I remember thinking it seemed like a cool urban fantasy and instead got \"why why why WHYYYYYY?!\"\\n\\n\r\nWhilst Sword Art Online and Mahouka are now considered the poster-boys for \"Gary-Stu fanfiction/wish-fulfillment LN crap that's not even well-animated\", Kaze no Stigma was doing everything it did back in 2007 aka \"the golden year of anime that wasn't actually so golden when you look at it closely\" and whilst I'd hesitate to determine if it's worse than either, it's the one that I hate the most largely because of the \"shock\". You know what I mean. The \"shock\" when you're a newbie who's optimistic about everything, unaware of what the dark side is truly capable of, and when you go in without any preparation you get backlashed so hard to the point that you can actually press charges against the creators. This is why I go into practically every anime with no expectations whatsoever. Because quite frankly, the \"shock\" is something I can do without for the rest of my already miserable life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is centered on Kazuma, a kid who was banished from his family because his female cousin was able to wield magic without setting herself on fire and burning all her clothes off - which isn't nearly as positive as it sounds - and thus goes away for a few years only to return as a stock cocky douche who wields wind magic like Jesus on steroids. His reunion coincides with another wind user killing off his family and rather than do much to clear his name, he arrogantly takes them on, including his cousin (Ayano) who has grown into a beautiful sword-wielding babe so you know what's going to happen to her before the first half of the premiere even concludes. Other characters include Kazuma's brother (Ren), who sounds like a prepubescent kid who smoked too many marlboros, and his dad (don't remember the name and don't care to look it up), who gets hospitalized very early on due to father/son differences that I refuse to describe because I don't want to spend much more effort into hating this show than the creators did in its overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nThis admittedly is difficult to do because the main problem with this show, along with the reason I hate it so much, is that it's completely unimaginative in every single way imaginable (no pun intended). The anime was made by Gonzo post-Welcome to the NHK and that's pretty much all you need to know regarding the production values as well as the overall quality. But even if Kenji Nakamura was set to direct this show, you'd need a complete overhaul of the original source material to make up for writing this phenomenally bad. That story premise I mentioned above gets resolved within the first four episodes and then succumbs to light novel syndrome of padding out the time with lower quality story arcs, and considering how awful the first story arc, that's saying a whole lot. Now I never actually finished this show - get your mouse cursor away from that \"x-mark\" - but I have had some exposure to what I never gave a proper chance and my god it's like the writer wasn't even trying to make the very premise of their story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne story arc is centered on a girl wanting to kill Kazuma to the point that she'd sell her own soul to darkness, which made her the most sympathetic character on the show until her redemption at the end because she was nice to Kazuma as a kid and he even confirms himself that yes, that little thing was all she needed to do for him to care about her. Another one focuses on Jun trying to protect a girl he fell in love with after a five-minute at best playground romp only to discover she's an artificial human with limited time, leading to another vomit-inducing conclusion. There's even an arc where an American chick comes and falls for Kazuma because she's under the impression he has a nine-inch cock when in reality, it's (censored, but I assure you it's a small number) inches long. If mediocrity was an Olympic event, it'd get unanimous tens all across the board.\\n\\n\r\nThere's even an arc where Kazuma has to suppress a super powered dark side, which is meant to be the overlying plot that connects the various stories together, that has no weight to it because A) it actually makes him weaker, so I dunno why he has it to begin with B) he's so much of a hypocritical asshole as is that there's practically no contrast. Literally every second he's on-screen is a second that I want to steal his powers and go all Texas Chainsaw Massacre with them on his face, because the writer just can't seem to write his \"loner with a heart of gold who gets all the ladies, seems to always know what's going on, and never gets so much as a scratch on him throughout the entire show\" character consistently and decide whether his facade is an act or not. Not that the other characters are much better, being shallow stock stereotypes who wear the same outfit to the point that Ayano had to decide between four identical school uniforms to wear to a date, but at least they're straight-forward and actually get dirt on their faces (which says a lot about the show's quality when that's the best you have to say for them).\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course it wouldn't be a wish-fulfillment Gary Stu story without awful action scenes that looked like they were conceived and choreographed by interns for the janitor position. They use the same stock footage of Ayano summoning her sword almost every single episode and it doesn't even work on the bad guys 95% of the time, which makes her even less competent than Asuna or Miyuki and ain't that a sad truth? Kazuma's wind powers are so cheap both in practice and in a visual sense that he doesn't even have to move in order to use them, which is pretty much the triple-threat of boring action right there.\\n\\n\r\nNot that he moves during the non-action scenes either. I recall one episode where he, Ayano, and a bunch of her friends explore the school late at night and make the girls perform lame comedic routines whilst he just smiles without revealing the truth because we needed the plot to go on for an entire episode because we have two cours to fill and we don't have the brains to fill them with anything more meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nWell I refuse to be the kettle that calls this show black, Gonzo, so I'm ending this review of your uninspired mess right now before my own imagination is sucked dry from this black hole (I don't see myself as a kettle, so I feel no hypocrisy in calling Kaze no Stigma that) of banal story, characters, animation, music, and even author existence - the writer of the original light novels passed away before he could finish the series - that in retrospect, I shouldn't have rediscovered in the first place.",

Kaze no Stigma uses the slightly underused approach of magic users and ninja clans in modern times, but, surprisingly, it's not meant to be wacky or childish like other anime of its genre.  This gave me high hopes, and I remember catching myself thinking, during the first few episodes \"this will really have to take a turn for the worse to prevent me from finishing it\".\r\nAfter sitting through clich\u00e9 episode after clich\u00e9 episode, I finally dropped it.  While I like the main hero, Yagami Kazuma, the heroin, Kannagi Ayano is what ruined theseries for me.  Not only does her Japanese voice actress kinda suck in this role, her 'burn run time transformation-esque' summoning of Enraiha against every little thing really pissed me off.  She never fights using just fire magic, and, despite an early youma kill that was supposed to display her adept fighting abilities, she spends 90% of her time being a decoy, getting defeated, getting caught, and, like any romantic comedy anime, blaming the male lead for her shortcomings.  She's childish, weak, poor-sounding, but well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is up to par, but everything else could have been done so much better; Kaze no Stigma is a testament to the old saying \"All that glitters is not gold\".",

            "content": "A somewhat decent Action, Romance with demons and the 4 elements. This anime is enjoyable to watch but it really lacks originality. ^_^\r\nFrom the very first episode, the story is really easy to understand because there is nothing all that new about the premise. It is just the typical story of a boy and girl that team up to defeat the bad guys that randomly show up. From here it continues with the random mini adventures and it doesn&rsquo;t really try to do anything special about it, so hardcore anime fans will feel like they have seen it all before. You may begin to wonderwhy you should even continue watching this anime if it is just like this however the story does kick off, in the latter half of the series. Even the pointless episodes are really fun to watch but what&rsquo;s better are the little developments in some characters, though the ending is somewhat predictable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters we have Kazuma Yagami, a sort of anti-hero who became incredibly strong after being disowned by his dad. He is probably the most interesting character in the series; because he is a very understandable, with a distinguished personality that is brought out by the superb voice acting. And this cannot be an action romance anime without the typical &quot;Tsundere&quot;, Ayano Kannagi. There are more characters but they are really insignificant that they can be easily overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of Kaze no Stigma&rsquo;s animation is pretty hard to judge. At one stand point we have: some well animated fight scenes, some well-placed CG and good ecchi moments. Yet half the time the animation looks cheap with: some poor character designs (mostly bad guys), tacky effects and no movement coming from the background. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really weak and there are only a few notable tunes that allow it to redeem itself. Although during the fights, or even in normal conversations, there is two female characters that can be both funny and annoying to listen to (Ayano &amp; Katherine).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this proved to be a very enjoyable anime with plenty of laughs, most of those laughs are thanks to the great odd couple. Nevertheless there is nothing about this series that allows it to stand out, in the action romance category; unlike the popular Full Metal Panic! or the Shakugan no Shana series. But don&rsquo;t let that deter you from watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Imagine an anime where certain people have discovered how to magically control fire, wind, earth and water. One of them is Kazuma Yagami, a former member of the Kannagi clan, a group that uses fire. After being abandoned by his family, friends and clan for his inability to use fire, Kazuma returns to his clan, now a wind magic user. Believing him to be a traitor for his use of wind magic, the clan falsely accuses Kazuma of killing off members of their clan. It is now up to Kazuma to clear his name and hopefully regain the trust of his family. Add this storywith a voice casting of screaming people, storytelling that leaves you with pointless information, the most unlikable cast of characters seen on the screen and you get the wretched project known as Stigma of the Wind, Junichi Sakata's latest entry (and failure) in the anime library.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story starts off with an interesting premise, it takes a nosedive after the third episode. It unfortunately tries to be a mystery, romance, drama, action, horror and comedy at the same time, causing lots of confusion and missed plot opportunities. Whether it be some random guy pretending to be an angel (I'm serious), or a guy licking wine off of someone's cheek, the show seems to reject anything normal in favor of complete chaos and anarchy. This wouldn't be a problem, except that nothing about these moments are funny. It's just insulting to the viewer's intelligence, since they paid the insane price of $50 for part one of the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are annoying and overacted, with the exception of the main character, Kazuma Yagami, who is calm and collected. A perfect example would be Ayano Kannagi the truth. Ayano reluctantly becomes an ally of Kazuma. Unfortunately, the first few lines in the pilot episode is her shouting, \"I hate the wind!\", giving the viewer a clear indication that she is going to be overacted in every possible sense of the word. Kazuma's relative, Ren Kannagi, is also a bit batty, but it's shocking when the viewer discovers halfway throughout the series that he is in fact a boy. Everything that Ren does, from the way he looks, to the feminine personality he has, gives you the false impression that he is a girl in the first place. Top all of this off with the fact that each character has their own annoying voice, making this one of the worst gang of animated characters ever to grace DVD.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one aspect the series gets right, it's the artwork. Each frame of animation is extremely polished, with impressive animations, solid character design and a very clean look. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything remotely unique, which is a missed opportunity, as the clean animation would have allowed plenty of successful innovation.\\n\\n\r\nStigma of the Wind isn\u2019t the worst anime I have seen, but it sure is a messy one. The director really should have spent more time developing each character. Instead we get characters that scream at each other for no reason, constantly whine annoyingly and act in an incredibly illogical manner. It's not like this is cheap entertainment either, as it cost $100 for the first season, stopping me from ever recommending this to anyone. Please stay away, as dissatisfaction is the only result that will occur after wasting money on this lamentable product.",

            "content": "Well, first let's be honest, I have only watched 1 episode of this anime so in the end I could change my overall rating to the entire different location. From a 7 to a 1 for instance, hey! It could happen! Making a review is pretty hard to do when there was only 1 episode which I have watched.\r\nStory:\r\nLet's look at the basic shall we? First there is a clan, called the Kannagi family. This are all Fire Mages, but one of them isn't cut out to become a Fire Mage. And seems to have better use for the Wind instead of Fire. So far,the story I given a 7... as I think if it is progressing quit a way it could become really interesting. But so far, I haven't really counted this one in the Overall Score as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nWell, animation is pretty hard to describe every time in my opinion. I think that an anime serie where you can see what is going on scores high in animation, also if the looks of the characters are good (most important in anime; EYES). In the serie &quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; you instantly see everything you are suppose to see. There is no: &quot;What the f*ck is going on, I can't see anything&quot; and the light is good enough to enjoy. So it get's a 8, since it is very good. (not perfect, so far, there hasn't been a single anime I found perfect animation)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSounds are fair, I guess ... but nog enough for a 6 however. The OST is good and has some extra atmosphere in the serie. When it's talking you see, you hear a mysterieus tune, when it is action you see you also hear a good background music to match with the action. I found the background music almost as appealing as another anime called &quot;Claymore&quot;. I give it a 7 in this mark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the thing that is absolutely impossible to rate like this after seeing 1 episode. You haven't know the characters quit as good, for to know a character you need to watch about 10 episodes (or 5 if it is a miniserie such as Hellsing). I just give it a 7, as I predict these characters will become pretty awesome at the end... but this is just A GAMBLE!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime &quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; a lot. So hey... why I given it a 9? Because it is simply that fun to see. But again, it is in most of the time the first episode is the most best one. So I counted this out of the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n&quot;Kaze No Stigma&quot; is fun to watch ... I don't think I have nothing else to tell you about why I given this anime a 7. So I just leave it with this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso again, keep in mind that I only watched 1 episode! Maybe there is already episode 2 out and becoming avaible for download, but I wrote it at the time there was only 1 episode. But still, this anime could become REALLY interesting. My opinion on the end is that if you liked Claymore... I think you can also enjoy this anime. Except this one isn't in the middle ages.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*In the style of Ichimaru Gin from Bleach*\\n\r\n&quot;Byebye!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nEdits:\\n\r\nDate: 24 april 2007\\n\r\nChanges: Reread it and fixed some mistakes. For instance, the overall rating was 7, not 8 as I said in the intro at the time. This problem is removed!\\n\\n\r\nDate: 24 april 2007\\n\r\nChanges: Finally found the codes to make it bold, italic and/or underline... I was always trying [B] and [/B] ... seems like it could only work in lower case.",

            "content": "I can\u2019t tell, why exactly I picked up this show. No, seriously, why did I? Maybe I wanted to see a big load of crispy action paired with a bit of romance and some comedy. I can\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t receive all of that. I had my fun with Kaze no Stigma, but I actually should\u2019ve avoided this show. I\u2019m going to tell why.\r\nStory  (5/10)\r\nThe story of Kaze no Stigma is divided in a few arcs. We got to see some entirely comedic episodes, some episodes focused on investigation and few ones with a highly serious undertone. Yep, there is pretty much nomajor story arc in Kaze no Stigma. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is slightly someone bigger in there who might actually be the \u201cend boss\u201d, but\u2026 that\u2019s all? Come on now. \\n\r\nSo, the story. The beginning, pretty much the first half of the series is pretty good \u2013 easy to watch and really entertaining. The show is throughout great at not taking itself too seriously. Well - at first, because the second half is the total opposite of the first episodes. While still not being too serious about itself, Kaze no Stigma now feels like an old chunk of bread \u2013 chewy and unbearable. The comedy factor is pretty much dead while the drama is being forced out of literally nowhere. It feels like Kaze no Stigma is not working anymore in its own pace. The execution of the so-called plot twists is downright ridiculous, just like some strange and long passages which are completely meaningless \u2013 but we still get to see them.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nThe show is pretty old, I understand that. Yeah, so is the art in there. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t bother me too much at this point, I don\u2019t need a show to be an artistic masterpiece. But still, while some effects are pretty good, the majority of the art we see looks pretty unattractive today.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nThere is not really much to say about the sound part. The opening and closing songs are fine, they fit the idea of Kaze no Stigma in a good way. Sadly I couldn\u2019t find any memorable music in the show itself, the number of the songs is small, but at least it\u2019s not getting annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\r\nOh boy. That\u2019s pretty much the weakest point of Kaze no Stigma. I have to agree, Kazuma might be a really good character. Might be, because the basic approach is fine, the later execution\u2019s not. Kazuma starts off pretty damn cool, being a badass mage out of nowhere. As the show advances, he is getting completely soaked in into the mash of generic and poor characterization. But, oh well \u2013 there is the rest of the characters in there already! Seriously, we can completely forget about the character cast \u2013 they\u2018re all highly generic and replaceable, not a single one of them is somewhere near unique. Character development? Little to zero. I don\u2019t intend to make it look bad, but what we get here is not much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and final rating (6/10)\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma is not great. There are weaknesses all over the place and it could\u2019ve been much, MUCH better.  BUT \u2013 it\u2019s not that bad at all. So, let me leave a little advice here: don\u2019t take this show too seriously and you might find your peace in it. Or just a little piece of enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, with the wonderful story of Kaze no Stigma fresh in my mind, I believe now is the perfect time to write a review for how I wasted my day.\r\nStory: 5\r\nWell, the story, nothing special, but not too bad. Mediocre is the perfect word to describe it. I'm not going to go too in depth with it, but I had high hopes upon reading about an overpowered person who comes back to a family who disowned him. To me, sounded pretty good, so I gave it ago. A few flaws. Earliest flaw I noticed was the fights, which might just be me, but the fightseither took three quarters of the episode or thirty seconds. Now, I don't like fights where it takes a long time, but I certainly don't like thirty second over-hyped moments. The second flaw I noticed with the story is that later in the story, which may be a spoiler, is that when Kazuma goes hatred mode and is suppose to get more powerful, which they showcase well, as soon as Ayano interferes, Kazuma is super weak. I just... I just don't get it. Alright, spoiler over. There were a few more minor flaws I had with the story, but they weren't necessary to add.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure how to rate the art, but compared to earlier ones it was mediocre. The reason it's a four and not five is because the fanservice they tried to add was a miserable failure. There's really no other way to put it. They had quite a bit of pantsu shots, and I don't mind fanservice. As a male, I even encourage it. Just kidding, for the most part. But the problem with this particular fanservice was that the panties were just kind of like... there. I don't think I am allowed to post links here, so I won't, but the panties didn't have any... what's the word, I guess, depth. The creators could have just added another line in the middle to make it slightly arousing, but no, nope, nah.  The other thing that bothered me about Ayano was her clothes. I think she's seen once out of her generic school uniform.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nPersonally I didn't like the opening, or the outro, which both sounded as generic as the characters, but it's really just an opinion, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nYou know, this was one of the most \"okay\" things of the show. Like, generic overpowered main character? Alright. Generic tsundere? Hm, okay. But then there was one that brought back trauma to me specifically. That character was Ren. What trauma, you may ask? Only the scariest of scary. It was... Boku no Pico. I mean seriously, I was willing to sweep the fact that Ren looked almost identical to Pico under the rug. But no, f**king no, they had to make two, I repeat, TWO, scenes of Pico, I mean, Ren, massaging Juugo, which wouldn't have been too bad if it wasn't for him grunting and Ren straddling him and rubbing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show, with an exception, which I will discuss below. This show, again, I genuinely enjoyed it. There were moments of actual hype and whatnot. I did enjoy the romance, until it was super forced with that McDonald girl. Why give a character the last name McDonald when she eats in a WcDonald? She came from America? Is Japan getting at something here? Well, I'm getting off track, so I'll skip to the overall now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nNow, if you've made it this far, you're probably wondering, why is the overall a four? I'll tell you why. The ending. If the ending wasn't so bad, I would easily give this overall a six. Let me tell you why the ending was so bad.\\n\r\n***SPOILERS BELOW***\\n\r\nFirstly, the ending battle, the giant shadow hole? A demon climbing out of it? A giant magic circle? Where have I seen this before? Secondly, the romance, one of the few things of this show that I really found good. I was hoping that they would kiss on the final episode. Did they? Nope. What did they do? F**king generic overpowered character summons a wind to push her hair back towards him. Could have been really cute, I guess. What does Kazuma do with Ayano's hair? He grabs it, and during this whole time Ayano is blushing like crazy, and smells her hair. And he gets into it, man. He goes f**king hardcore. He follows it up by a pat on Ayano's butt. Who says romance is dead? The closest thing they get in this show to a kiss is a lick on Ayano's face.\\n\r\n***SPOILERS ENDED***\\n\\n\r\nYeah, so, in needless to say, if you're bored and have the entire day to do nothing, watch it. Otherwise, go watch somethin' else.\\n",

By the same token the look of the magic used especially the elements of fire make it awe inspiring to watch...nearly artistic in my opinion\r\nCharacters:\r\nWhat made me fall in love with this anime series is the english dub for the Kazuma and his choice of sarcastic words,very commonly main protagonists that have super power but either look clueless or dumbfounded when a situation occurs and rely on luck to pull through; however Kazuma's character I think is perfect since I like how he teases some of the other characters, pull off some awesome attacks and still have time to show a heart to those he cares for....despite his sarcasm\\n\\n\r\nI loved it all and I hope there are a few more like it out there in the anime world\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Kaze no stigma is a decent anime but it's hard for me to say that it was an excellent or even great anime. The only reason I could think for telling someone to watch it would be if you were really bored and had nothing else to do.\r\nStory:\r\nDespite ending the series leaving a lot of questions unanswered I just personally couldn't get myself to care that much. It's very predictable but I feel that way about the majority of the anime that I watch so if that sorta thing doesn't bug you, you'll enjoy this. On the other hand I felt like the cousin datingwas really unnecessary. ignoring that their related, trowing in romance doesn't make you story any better and to me it sorta felt lazy. almost like a what should we do, well I guess we'll make them date situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI felt like the art work was decent, nothing really all that wrong with it. I personally wish there were less panty shots mainly just because of the timing (I want to see character fight when they fight not their underwear). Despite the panty shots this anime isn't any worst than really anything else out there (Fairly decent I'd say) so don't let that keep you from watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It wasn't anything memorable but your ears will be safe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: No one was original. all the typical stereotypes you tend to find and for most people that shouldn't really upset you. I found it very hard to care about them personally but very few anime get me to care about the whole cast even with very original characters so I believe the majority of you will feel different.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime, there's nothing special about it but it's short enough that I didn't really mind. I like shorter animes, you may feel differently but I've noticed the longer something goes on the more filler there will be and quite frankly I hate filler with all my heart. This show does not have pointless episode after pointless episode and that's normally enough for me at lest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll give it a seven. I feel like most people who would watch this anime on their own will enjoy it and that is good enough really. It is not the best but it's not bad. On the other hand if you hate story's with unanswered questions and incomplete endings  you should probably stay away. I didn't realize the anime was incomplete and was going to stay that way or I probably wouldn't have watched it. Normally I'd avoid such a thing but the lack of an engaging plot made me realize I only care about the ending if I care about the story.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say there is no need to go out of the way to watch this anime but there is also no reason for most people to avoid it.",

            "content": "Kaze no stigma is an Action/fantasy anime that got some of my attention, but it has some flaws. \r\nStory (7.2) - Not amazing. Its just an average story. In my opinion lacks originality, as this story is very cliche. It has some fillers, some episodes with no sense at all that appear out of nowhere and where nothing important really happens. In the final episodes, it gets a little better in this aspect, but still story is not an aspect that got my attention.\r\nArt (8.4) - The characters are well designed, and the effects are pretty good. You can see it when the characters usetheir powers, the flames and wind, and other powers, its really nice. Not the very best art from all times, but still is a nice aspect this anime has to give. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7.0) - Another not so impressing aspect. The sound sure give some atmosphere and isnt anoying, but its definitively nothing great. Just and average in my opinion. Enough to keep some interest in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8.9)- I liked this aspect. Well develloped characters and looking cool.\\n\r\nThe main character, Yagami Kazuma is definetively very good, it gave an extra interest to this anime. Another aspect i liked was the variety of characters this anime have, where you clearly see many differences between them, and their relations with each other, that keeps the show interesting during some moments where the story lacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.0) - A fine anime, not the best, but a good one to watch and pass some time. It has a lot of action in some moments, also we you can find romance and comedy in this anime. A nice way to spend time, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8) - For a tittle that didnt said much to me at start, it was really a nice surprise. Ok, its not fantastic, but surely is a good anime and if you like magic and battles stuff, then you should give it a try.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boy, oh boy, trying to advertise, let alone making a solid case as to why one should watch this dinosaur stab at the light novel adaptation romp is an amusing enough attempt for anyone to humor I would say.\r\nA Relic of its Time?:\r\nMake no mistake, my case isn't so lofty since it's down to this reality: In riding the trend that more or less started from the Rie Kugimiya/J.C. Staff works (Shana, Familiar of Zero, Index, Toradora, etc), Kaze no Stigma was one of the few cases that got all the raw basic components to bounce off each other in juuuust the right chemistry balance.The result being a rather straightforward power fantasy that invokes honest cool factor appeal without much of grating aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nSuch basic ingredients (and subsequent welcome tweaking) are as follows,\\n\\n\r\n1. A protagonist who, in the framing of the premise, technically an underdog (but he's actually a stone-cold badass because the story is actually about him one-upping his past instead of the usual \"I will be better than them all!\" BS).\\n\\n\r\n2. You get your then standard red-haired obstinate obligatory heroine who is both a foil and a means for the \"romance\" - light novel romance was mostly ball-busting back then marketed as a cuteness (but she actually serves as a reminder of just how cool the protagonist is, reversing the then typical dynamic of such shows).\\n\\n\r\n3. Story arcs that paint broad strokes for main character layers/world building to excuse later stuff (but said story arcs are generally low-key enough to not overextend anything beyond the core appeal of watching the protagonist being a thug bro).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, previously mentioned J.C. Staff anime usually bit off more than they could chew, especially if they skewed the supernatural/fantasy department, very often losing focus of why audiences were watching them in the first place.\\n\r\nAnd let's be honest, if this rather seasoned anime consumer has learned anything from light novel stuff, is that they are trashy, shameless guilty pleasures displaying no more depth or accountability for their writing than they are at furthering stagnant character shipping.\\n\\n\r\nEnter a Humble Confidence:\\n\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma has no such shackles in-comparison. It knows you are watching the show because the hero is legit, that you find a brazen tsundere  more annoying than endearing but also wants you find their rapport work out because... gosh darnit, this is still a light novel anime and we're all looking for that one sweet example that provides us our metaphorical cake and lets us eat it too.\\n\\n\r\nBut what else does the show provide beyond that? Seriously, don't ask that, it's about a badass being allowed to do what he wants, go away if that's not enough. I mean, there's a wimpy brother to remind us who the protagonist would typically be if this were your ordinary light novel show so... be grateful for the in-show reminder that you could always do worse? I guess?\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty of opportunities for numerous character arcs to rub in the tsundere's face how much she is attracted to the protagonist even when she's too dense to realize it herself-shtick. That's not exactly new, but it's more fun here since it's turned on its head, usually giving the protagonist means to flirt with her which is great. Cuz... he's a badass.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else... oh, yeah I mentioned world building. Honestly, the scope of the story doesn't go beyond one central location that is never really broadened upon but even that's okay since most other crap do their best to have every new arc take place in the same boring city no matter how long or extreme the stakes rise.\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma doesn't bother with all that noise since it already establishes that nothing can touch the badass; rather than find ways to debunk that greatness, it prioritizes on introducing as few new characters as much as possible (admittedly, that's as much as a weakness as this show shares with its peers), in exchange for having about 4-5 primary arcs investing us with the leads.\\n\r\nI swear this basic, down-to-earth storytelling is so effective you almost wonder if other shit kept introducing stuff because they were trying to hide how shameless their respective bad writing was.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Kaze no Stigma knows what it is and owns its appeals instead of drowning it. And it's about a badass, in case you forgot.\\n\\n\r\nIs it Pretty? Well.... Ehhhhhh?:\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I should say something about music and art huh, this being visual storytelling and, as a buddy of mine says, \"if you aren't watching anime for pretty visuals, what are you watching it for?\" True words, but this was made dark horse studio Gonzo, notorious for a lot, not least of which their clunky use of CGI.\\n\r\nFortunately enough, KnS doesn't flaunt that aspect but keeps a rather decent grip on its action budget. You get your lazy-off screen editing from time to time but it's choreographed alright; keeps you interested to see how everyone pales against the badass ultimately, so I'll give the animation pass since it's not jarring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are standard as hell; nothing too much to say here. Gonzo articulates enough relevant body language among the limited characters, and some obligatory trash light novel humor (jealous fits, attempts at battery - oh ho ho ho, so funny!) but, as I said, it all works here because there's an unflappable main character for once who shuts it down for the silliness it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly just... there, does enough to set the mood but I can't exactly pinpoint any notable tracks or OST themes that demand deification. \"meh\" is the word. The OP and END tracks are extensions of this claim too. Passable and forgettable, but not damning.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, I think whoever's reading this gets me by now. This is a fairly older series but it's aged well in that most genre stabs made nowadays want a rather blank slate for their male heroes instead of giving them a palpable personality. Personally, this doesn't help those shows' immersion any further than if they had classic goobers from KnS' generation, we all watch this crap for the gratification so why be blase about the execution?\\n\\n\r\nGotta hand it to you Gonzo, you may have gotten stuck with a series that ended in eternal limbo, but at least it's indicative how much fun the genre can be when you take pride a lil'. \\n\\n\r\nNumber Grades\\n\r\nStory 5/10 - In actuality, it's a 4, but since most of the time is spent playing around with the characters painlessly, if not shamelessly fun, it gets a bump up for fidelity.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10 - Nothing special for a TV show of its era. Coherent, capable and consistent, you aren't watching an action show needless to say, but's easy enough on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 -  I mean... it's there. Seriously, what do want me to say? Not every anime needs a grossly inflated production. It's presence so prosaic in implementation that I am too indifferent for it to matter honestly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 - Ahah..... here we are, the real meat and potatoes of the show's value. Character tropes handled with unusual finesse and underrated ownership, I could almost boast that watching this gives you all the excuse one needs to never watch another light novel anime again (some exceptions of course...) Rare to find a show who reminds a jaded person why and how cliches can be comfort food staples of quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 - So this is a tricky scenario. The entire time I mentioned how there's this badass main character who makes up LITERALLY ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL OTHERS, but let me give some proof: The english dub. Funimation, through some divine guidance, picked THE best guy to voice Kazuma. Robert McCollum. Seriously, he makes the character drip with more charisma than any part of the show's modest budget can allow, which essentially means that HE is the show! Cherami Leigh does a solid take on Ayano, capturing her feisty arrogance while downplaying any of the usual obnoxiousness that no doubt would be in the Japanese. Seriously, the dub is so choice for this show that I can never rewatch this show in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 - Light novel power fantasy romps are hard to come by without any grimacing or eye-rolling involved, but KnS is a treasure in this regard. It may not have an identity beyond that quality but like a tasty classic meal you've had countless times over with just a teensy little spice for rejuvenation, once you've tasted Kaze no Stigma, you can't help but smile at the simple pleasure it offers.",

            "content": "Alrighty, here it goes, my second review:\r\n*Story* 8/10\r\nThe story for Kaze no Stigma (KnS) in my opinion was going to be stereotypical: cool awesome guy, possible love interest girl, his brother, a vengeance type plot relating to his family, etc etc... save the world and the anime gets 5/10... however after watching the anime can i say wow... sure it had some plot holes, for example the Stigma of the Wind is never really explained, and Kazuma's past seems rushed, however this does not really matter, because the story has enough twists and turns to keep you watching, and of course the usual love/romantic sidestory between characters always adds a comedic side, overall i found that although it was a bit stereotypical, i thoroughly enjoyed this solid anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Art* 7/10\\n\r\nArtwork in KnS was solid throughout the anime, wind was a major highlight of this anime, and the way the effects were done for the wind was a highlight, nothing really defied the laws of physics, and the wind seemed realistic. The main problem i had was with the fire artwork, to me it seemed as though the creators got lazy with fire and decided to just re-use the same boring fire image all over again, a bit a variance and realism would have been nice. However what really uplifts this anime is the character artwork, Kazuma looked cool, Ayano looked great, and ren looked loli-shota =P In my opinion the character artwork was above average for a 2007 anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound* 7/10\\n\r\nThe special effects sound was ok, i felt that something was missing in the fight scenes however, the anime needed more of a boom factor, and at times it seemed as if was lacking in BGM as well as the needed sword clashing sfx. The seiyuu's in this anime were fair, nothing outstanding, however well done to the Fujimura Ayumi, her voice acting for Ayano was one of the great things in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Character* 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the highlight of this anime, although it may seem  stereotypical, it is their construction that really outshines anything else. Kazuma's dark past really gives his character a Light Yagami sort of feel and i thoroughly enjoyed it, Ayano and Ren were great to, Ayano was a great tsundere/moe type character and the Ren side story really moved me close to tears, it reminded me of the FSN ending ;(.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* 8/10\\n\r\nNeed more be said? The characters pulled this anime through, and even though the sound wasn't anything new and the story wasn't all that amazing, i stil thoroughly enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*OP and ED* 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP was constant for all 24 episodes, and it was a bit bland at times, but not to the extent that i had to skip it. The ED's on the other hand were on opposite ends of the scale, the first ed Hitorikiri no Sora was in my opinion dull and boring instead of reflective, the second ed Ayumi Fujimura Matataki no Kiwoku was far better, and in my opinion a great ED to remember. However one song struck me, and that was Kanako Sakai Tsuki Hana no Inori, the ED for episode 12 and also an insert song... that one song has made my list of most memorable reflective songs after a significant event rivaling songs such as Hikari by Jyukai.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 7/10\\n\r\nA nice solid anime, not a must see, but one you should definitely take a glance at. The ending is very enjoyable, and it is worth the watch, the climax in the middle of the anime is fantastic, and like i said before the characters are great.\\n\\n\r\n~Savage the Fate/Stay Night Otaku~",

            "content": "When I read the summary of this anime and saw the characters, I thought it was going to be a ripoff of Shakugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima, two excellent anime in their own right. Well.... to be truthful, this is a lot like both of those anime. And to be frank, the red-haired tsundere in this anime (Ayano) doesn't measure up to the leads in the others. She's not nearly as badass as Shana and not nearly as adorable or lovable as Louise. However, it's Kazuma, the other lead, that really makes this show fly. It's really refreshing to watch a show wherethe main lead is a total freaking badass and the conflict is not him trying to become more powerful, but rather struggling with his control of it. There are so many cliches his character could have fallen into but it never happened. The first test was when he faced his dad in battle a few episodes in. The cliche would have been for him to lose only to beat him later. NOPE! Kazuma took that old guy out! I won't spoil anything more (although it's hardly a spoiler. Their battle lasted like a minute.) but Kazuma is the reason to watch and really enjoy this show and he never disappoints. The ending was garbage as far as the romance goes (a warning for you out there looking for magic-girl romance), but the rest of it was satisfying and there's good reason to hope for Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSolid anime. I would recommend it to anyone.",

The first half of the series are just assignments and later on in the series is where most of the major plot elements begin. However, I would have liked It If they have gotten deeper into Kazuma's past because It seems like they don't explain as much. Overall, the story of Kaze No Stigma kept It interesting till' the end.\r\nArt: 7.5/10\r\nI'm overall impressed with the Artwork for a 2007 Anime, but the animations and/or effects could have been better. Mainly, where Ayanouses her fire magic and It seems like the creators just kept re-using those scenes  rather than changing It up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.7/10\\n\r\nMusic is impressive, effects are decent. For this portion of the Review, I would like to say that I watched the dub version than the raw version. In any case If you wish to watch the dub and thinking whether or not the English Voices are done well, I will talk about It here. Now, I am impressed on how well this anime was dubbed. My favorite one would be Kazuma's voice actor because of his ignorant and jerky attitude really suits him quite well. Ayano's voice actor is high pitched, It can be an annoyance sometimes, but that's pretty much Ayano's personality for the most part, so I can't really say much about the pitch of her voice. Ren's voice actor is also decent. It suits him pretty well, I can't complain anything about that. Just overall, the Dub isn't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nGotta say, I love the characters introduced in this series. My favorite would be Kazuma. I just love his personality. He is funny at times and of course his jerky attitude. Ayano is also another interesting character to point out as well as Ren.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nConsidering this is my first time entering a new genre of Supernatural or \"magic\" animes, I gotta say that I enjoyed Kaze no Stigma. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.0/10\\n\r\nOverall, Kaze no Stigma is one interesting anime. It has a mixed of Comedy, Action, and depressing moments. Pacing is decent, not too fast, not too slow, just in the middle. But If your the type of person who decides to look into more anime that have superpowers, Kaze no Stigma won't be a disappointment.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma is exactly what you expect from a new age adventure anime.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story itself is a little lacking, it starts off with a little randomness where each episode is its own small mission. The true story begins later in to the series. It's a satisfying plot and doesn't leave an overwhelming amount of unanswered questions and is well prepared for an encore season.\r\nArt: 8\r\nIt's a recent production and it's obvious to see. There's solid detail that is shown especially well in the fight scenes. The fighting styles use natural elements which are well shown through the art.\r\nSound: 8\r\nFor me, the only wayto truly have a satisfying soundtrack is if I don't notice it all that much. That rule only applies to invideo music of course, the sound effects and transitions should be smooth enough that nothing is noticed. As for the themes, the opening theme is pretty good, it's enjoyable but doesn't exactly get you pumped for the episode. The Ending themes are actually really nice and the music fits perfectly with the art that is shown in the ending.The 3 songs also serve well to give closure on the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the characters. I thought that they were well developed, and showed some emotion. People will say that the characters were your average adventure folk but that really doesn't matter, obviously if you like the genre enough you will realize that all characters are basically the same. As predictable as it is, the characters are still enjoyable and worth following through their adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe series is a very enjoyable set of episodes. It's a great representation of a classic adventure series. It's a must see for any adventure fan, and of course it includes its spa bath trip as any modern anime does. If that doesn't entertain you than I don't know what does.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThe series was well done and nicely put together. It's one that I got into and decided to watch quickly, I watched in with original subs and then re-watched a few eps with dubs, personally I recommend the subs. It's a solid series and I would recommend it to others.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback about the review is welcomed, also any other comments or questions you have I will openly field.",

            "content": "\"Eyes as blue as the azure sky... that is the symbol of the Contractor, entrusted by the Spirit King of the Wind by the powers of his domain. I bear this mark: the Stigma of the Wind.\"\r\nA purely enjoyable show, Kaze no Stigma is an anime that lets you explore elemental powers with a modern twist and comedic touches without providing too much depth.\r\nThe story was split up into separate arches that did not tie together to form a solid plot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I enjoyed each of them even though they weren't connected. A few fillers were installed here andthere, but they were good and gave a little bit of character development. The action caught my attention because of its usage of magic and nicely coordinated fighting. A little bit of drama didn't hurt, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were fresh and crisp. I enjoyed looking at them from a decent distance. When the camera panned out from the characters, detail lacked. Facial expressions were sometimes awkward with them frozen in place or misshapen. Also, sequences such as Ayano calling forth her Enraiha and Katherine conjuring Metatron were reused several times. However, flame and wind animations were excellent. Backgrounds were okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was great. When my brother and I first started watching the show (this one being one of the first for us), we rocked out secretly to the full version. The soundtrack playing in the back was fairly unnoticeable but did its job. The two endings were fair, and I liked how they alternated. I watched the Funimation dub, and Kazuma's and Ayano's voices fit well with their characters. The supporting cast was fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were the strongest asset to Kaze no Stigma. Kazuma was portrayed superbly, and Ayano gave us a unique illustration. Kazuma and Ayano were both polar opposite personality-wise. They created an impressive relationship through little moments and I savored every second, wanting more. They were certainly the deepest characters and the strongest part of the anime. Supporting characters were above average and performed their roles well.\\n\\n\r\nI love watching anime. I rarely dislike watching a show. Kaze no Stigma certainly did not disappoint. An enjoyable story and lovable characters made for a good time in my book.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend passing this one up. As one of the first anime I had watched, it encouraged me to explore more of this new world. It might not blow you away, but it will certainly light up your day.",

            "content": "The way Kaze no Stigma\u2019s looks, sounds, as well as how it plays out; are all generally the same as any normal magical/action show. Its definitely not a new concept, but it\u2019s done rather well to the point where its enjoyable. However there are some small differences in this anime that I would like to bring attention to that pulls this anime apart from its predecessors.\r\nPlot 6/10: The plot isn\u2019t going to win any awards for \u201cthe most original anime plot\u201d anytime soon. However it does its plot well enough that it comes out being enjoyable. It follows the main three characters Kazuma, Ayano, andRen along their journeys in the magical world they live in. While there are not particularly any plot holes, it didn\u2019t  explain many of the things about the magical powers themselves. This would not be a problem if they hadn\u2019t mentioned them at all, but they do; they just do not flesh them out. It has themes about family and loved ones that play out well. However, it can be really predictable at times if you have ever watched another anime in the genre before.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The OST of Kaze no Stigma is again, par for the course. It does its job well, but there are no stand out tracks. The OP was in my personal opinion not very good and didn\u2019t fit the show, and the ending was again average. The voice actors do their job well, and there are really no miscast in the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: For its time, the art was average and does not stand out much. The fight scenes are animated well and the character models are fitting for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: Ah, here is where we get to those \u201clittle differences\u201d that I mentioned earlier. This is the main thing that makes this show stand out at all. The main character Kazuma is...a boss. That\u2019s how his character can be summarized in a short amount of time. He voice actor does an awesome job portraying his cool, calm, and collected attitude that he has 24/7(in the dub at least). He has a fleshed out background and motives, and is really the only character besides Ren that was memorable. Ayano was a little disappointing. She is an unoriginal tsundere that falls into many anime cliches, and can come off as just arrogant.The relationship between her and Kazuma can be funny at times, but feels a little forced. The side characters are, for the most part, done well. Most serve some purpose to the plot, and not many were annoying (except for McDonald).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Without Kazuma, this show would have been just your average magical action show with a normal tsundere heroine. However, I think that even without Kazuma, the show would not have been bad. In fact, I still think it would have been a pretty good show. The execution of the plot, sound, and art is\u2014while unoriginal\u2014well done. I would recommend it to anyone that likes shows in this genre.\\n",

            "content": "Despite this show looking nice and I guess sounding okay (Sound? there's not too many ways to fail on sound) it lacks a lot of essential points like good characters and writing. Here's what I feel was wrong with the characters, Kazuma is so godly powerful that no one can beat him (yeah that's what I want to watch, a show where there's no reason to believe that the characters will ever lose) I know your saying but what about . . . Well stop because no character in the show could beat Kazuma for real and that makes the show boring. Where's the tensionthe drama the what's going to happen? Every episode I found myself saying, doesn't matter Kazuma will win. I'd go on about the other characters that matter but there aren't any. (Doing this without spoilers is quite annoying) My problem with the story is that it was pretty basic Girl falls in love with guy but won't admit to herself because he's a asshole. The rest of the stuff like the magic and circumstances are pretty second nature in this series. Enjoyment is low because the action boils down to dbz/harry potter I'm going to throw energy/magic at you till you pass out. God forbid somebody know some martial arts in an anime. This show is also bad because of the villains reasoning at the end I can't say what it was but it involved the word COWARD, worst villain ever. Recap: this show makes me cry myself to sleep at night because I wanted it to be good because it looked so pretty. I learned something important from this show: Sometimes you have to look past the great breast on the outside and see the great breast on the inside.",

The characters really draw you in, art is beautiful for its time, story is on point without fillers, and right when you get comfortable the mood changes. This one I personally believe had a bright future seeing as how I certainly wanted more. I watched this a number of years ago yet even still I occasionally return even for the brief 24 episodes. Now.... The sad truth is that NO it WILL NOT be continued. The creator sadly passed away and his lastwill was for this not to be touched. Lastly I'll say this is still a great body of work I'm sure you'll enjoy should you decide to give it a look.",

I have seen similar plots like this before, so its a bit clique. It's your typical action kind of anime where each episode definitely has one monster or something like that. It does have an underlying plot which draws people in to someextent but it is still not captivating enough, the action in myopinion was very suttle and the attacks are the same. Also the lead male character's past is not brought out very clearly so its a bit confusing, you'll keep wondering like who is that girl and what are these contractors.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good i guess, nothing bad but also nothing exceptional either.\\n\\n\r\nSound had nothing special either, no insert songs to bring out the mood so i don't really find that the studio did their est for the sound department of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe charaters have a little depth as you get to see the past of the characters to grasp a better understanding but the lead male's past as mentioned earlier is a bit confusing and unclear. There is very little romance in the show, but its not really a romance anime so that doesnt really matter, but i was constantly hoping that they fall in love or something along that line.\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable to the extent that it did make some effort to add comedy to the show and to see the female lead get all flustered over the male lead which is why i wish they would have added more romance into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is worth atching for those action and fantasy genre fans but do not have too high expectations for this show because its not one of those animes that will keep you glued to the screen or blow you away its just normal...",

            "content": "At first sight, Kaze no Stigma might look like something along the lines of a Shakugan no Shana rip-off, judging by both its cover and MAL's tag listing. However, one would be surprised by how different it is compared to any romantic action anime out there. I, for one, was caught off guard - and I'm very happy it turned out this way.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nOne could call me generous for giving this show a 7. And I will partly agree to that statement. In terms of story, there's really not much to this show. For a good amount of the series, the plot isn't apparent andis mostly based around fillers with a few minor arcs that last up to 1-3 episodes each, usually introducing a new character. Only at the end of the show does the main plot make it's appearence - and it delivers, hence my high rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBy now, the anime is kind of old and the artstyle doesn't seem like anything super fancy. However, it is pretty well done for its time and it is not eye-soring in any way; it's actually quite nice to look at - more specifically the flames emitted by the characters. The characters and scenery are not overly detailed, but a good amount of the spells in this show is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things I did not enjoy about this show is the sound. Usually when you think about swords clashing, magical explosions and raging wind blowing, you think about the sounds of it. Unfortunately, the anime does not deliver on this. While you might be seeing one hell of a explosion, there's not enough sound to cover it -  it literally sounds like you threw a mini rocket on the ground.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, however, and that is why I give the sound a number higher than 4. It fits the situation well, and you can tell by the soundtrack playing what you are about to witness - like it should be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really shines - and makes it really unique compared to other shows of the same genre. Usually in fantasy oriented anime, the main protagonist gets progressively stronger as the show goes on after having a terribly weak start. This is not the case with this show, our protagonist is among the strongest right from the start - if not THE strongest. This makes him interesting because you can take away the \"weak shounen protag\" attitude and replace it with something else... and they did. Our protag is a total badass who is not afraid of anything, and LOVES messing with people.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters in this show are not really worth mentioning, other than the protagonist's little brother, who's a young boy - but he's not acting like one. This one is actually useful in every scenario. The female protagonist however, is just your ordinary tsundere heroine with really strong powers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of this show's enjoyment comes the protagonist being himself. His character is hilarious and incredibly badass at the same time, and he always have something up his sleeve to make sure that you're still watching - be it in a battle or for a comedic situation. The fillers are also made pretty well to keep you entertained. However, the real enjoyment kicks in at the end of the show, and you'll be crying that there unfortunately is no season two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma is overall a great fun anime to watch, with lots of cute romantic moments that are not really hidden, but very visible. The show can get predictable at times, but honestly, that is not an issue with this one, because YOU WANT your speculation to happen - because it's probably related to the main protagonist and everything he does turns into something amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLike stated before, the show lacks in some areas, but it makes up for it in the end. While the ending is a bit unsatisfying for most, that is only because there is no season 2 to continue the story. However, we really cannot blame anyone for that, because the author of this show died.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended to anyone who just wants to sit down and watch some really amazing battles and romance.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, I'm not going to describe every part of the anime in individual paragraphs... I'm just going to give to you in one.\r\nFor starters, I give Kaze no Stigma an overall score of 5/10\r\nThe beginning story was great. It drew me in right away. However, soon after the beginning, it totally lost my interest. After about the first 5 episodes (give or take...) I only watched it hoping that I would get to see some good fighting action. The story could have been sooo much better! I did, however, love the anime's version of magic. ((because every anime's magic is a little different)) BUT, Iwas sooo confused about the two main characters! Ok, I totally got that they liked eachother and everything, but it was sooo lame! NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if someone watched this and didn't understand that Kazuma and Ayano were supposed to be love interests. I didn't like Ayano at all and I barely like Ren. Kazuma was probably the only character I really liked. \\n\r\nOk, I know I've been saying how awful this anime is, but there were, admittably, some good things about it. The art was pretty good, except there was some pretty stupid 'fan service' that was slipped in there every once in a while. For me, 'fan service' isn't horrible in every anime, but I definitally don't love it. I think the reason it annoyed me in this anime was because it just didn't fit into the flow of Kaze no Stigma. This is probably the only thing in this anime that I truley liked: the action. There wasn't much of it, which was really dissapointing, but when there was action, it was awesome. The drawing of Kazuma's wind and Ayano's fire was really good, which made the fighting scenes all the better.\\n\\n\r\nI might recommend this to people, but I would warn them of things I thought weren't all that great first.\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: I didn't watch the subbed version, I watched the dubbed version. Therefore, I don't know how good the subbed version is, but the dubbed version is TERRIBLE. The only good voice is Kazuma's and Ayano's is really bad... really really bad. So, even though I haven't seen it, I RECOMMEND THE SUBBED VERSION.\\n\\n\r\nHope the review helps. :)",

It was recommended to me, it started off pretty good then just started free falling.\r\nThe worst part about the show is the two main characters.  \r\nKazuma is the try hard laid back type of character, well all except that one instance when he fought his father and was trying to impress him.  But, other than that everything he says and does is trying extremely hard to be cool and it's honestly just the complete opposite.  Also, come the second \"problem\" for him it seems like he's just looking to start trouble.He didn't actually kill someone but, he claimed he did? And for no apparent reason all to send a girl he cares about(?) on a frenzy of revenge against him.  Yea, really stupid plot and that's about where I dropped this show.\\n\\n\r\nAyano on the other hand is annoying simply because she's obsessed with Kazuma, not in an adorable or funny way like the best character on the show Ren.  From the very beginning for no apparent reason she's just been determined to go after and follow him and it's just annoying.",

            "content": "There are a lot of stories to be told with a similar pattern: a world of magic, monsters, and spellcasters exists just beneath the surface of what would be recognized as our modern Earth.  These urban fantasy stories are usually pretty easy to make interesting, since they have both the high-flying adventure of fantasy, and the relatable nature of being set in something at least like the modern world.  However, while there are a lot of advantages to telling this kind of story, you still need the basics of fantasy storytelling down, putting a decent amount of thought and effort into your supernaturalelements while building likable, engaging, and dimensional characters.  As with any other genre, some stories do this well and others do it poorly.  Kaze no Stigma is, in my mind, a frustrating little misstep in that while it executes some of those elements competently if not well, it fails at others that leave it kind of hard to get through in the end.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take the story first.  Kaze no Stigma is not entirely certain what it wants to be; the first half of the show consists of three major arcs, each of which represents a 'case' or whatever you want to call it where something nasty is going on in the supernatural band, and our characters get drawn in to try to stop it.  It's basic, but it's also an entertaining sort of pattern that lends itself to a lot of opportunities.  However, as soon as the show gets its feet under it with that, it decides that, no, it would rather be something else.  The next few episodes try to be a sort of zany slice of life arrangement, where nothing really has to connect and the magic and powers in the setting are used more for slapstick humor than for life-and-death struggles.  On its own, this would also be fine; I'd welcome a lighter, funnier sort of Urban Fantasy story, but coming on the heels of these dark tales about mass murder, sold souls, and human sacrifice it doesn't quite fit.  After trying out the lighter stuff for a bit, the show changes its mind again, and launches into an arc long and intricate enough that it easily could have covered an entire season worth of material.  It's a mishandled attempt to change gears from monster of the (not quite) week to a straightly told epic, with wacky hi-jinks acting of the segue, and it doesn't land.\\n\\n\r\nThe individual arcs can, actually, be good.  The first couple are probably the high point of the show for me, and the big arc at the end could have been really good if it got the setup it needed to actually work.  This would have been a stronger product if it was one thing, rather than three... but that alone wouldn't have saved it, since Kaze no Stigma has an even more critical problem in the form of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOur leading character is Kazuma, and... this really should have been the easiest guy to make interesting.  At the beginning, he's encountering his family again after four years.  Four years that, at the beginning of which, he was kicked out of said family for being a powerless failure.  In that time, he's gone through some sort of harsh trial (which is only hinted at for most of the show) and gained power, not just on the level he was expected to have, but at an incredible level that's hard if not impossible to match.  And because of that, he's put in a position to save the family that scorned him.  What he does, and why he does it (especially the latter) should be really powerful stuff; you'd think the drama would write itself, especially when the romance genre included in the show's makeup suggests he might start developing positive feelings for his cousin, Ayano.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the core conflict involved in his presence in the story is seldom addressed, and he's written in a very inconsistent manner.  Even by the end of the story, you don't really have a sense of who Kazuma is as a person.  You get flashes here and there, but they seem to contradict each other, and it's not in a smart enough way to come off as dimensional rather than simply as a mess.  He doesn't grow or change, he just has moments at the whim of the plot.  He's not a harsh person, he has a harsh moment because the story needs him to act harsh.  He's not noble or principled, but he'll have a noble moment because the story needs him to not act in a mercenary manner for a little while.  A lot relies on Kazuma as a character, but he's not enough of a defined character for any of it to pay off.\\n\\n\r\nAyano, meanwhile... how to describe Ayano?  How about a recipe: take every hot-headed, loud-mouthed tsundere-ish character you know, put them in a blender and puree until there is no longer any distinction between them.  Strain the result to remove anything deep, interesting, or twisted that was part of any of those other great (or not-so-great) characters.  Once you have the murky essence of the character archetype, add just a dash of pride and garnish with magical powers that don't have too much of an impact on the character as a whole.  Then freeze it to make sure it can't grow, change, or otherwise develop into something deeper or more meaningful.  That's our Ayano!  \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't complain too much if she were a bit character, since her writing and acting is far from the worst tsundere type I've seen.  At least Ayano has an indoor voice she uses sometimes and only detonates when honestly provoked.  But Ayano is our leading lady; she gets about as many scenes as Kazuma, and the show as a whole is, at least in theory, as much about her as it is about him.  In fact, Kaze no Stigma has another character made with a fairly similar formula (though easier on the tsun), Kathrine McDonald, who's a latecomer to the story and much more of a minor character, and she actually comes off as a better character because at least the writing for her knows what her role is and she can fill it decently well.  Compared to Kazuma, at least Ayano is a character, even if a very flat one, but she doesn't have the chops for a leading role, and I couldn't really tell you much about her as a person outside of plot-relevant facts.\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious from that, the romance between the two (if you can even call it that, it's so phoned in) never really works, and certainly never works enough for the fact that, in the end, there's actually critical story moments that rely on your ability to believe in the feelings that bind the two.  To her credit  (and the credit of her voice actress), I can at least sort of believe that Ayano might harbor some feelings for Kazuma, though I would be at something of a loss to tell you why, but Kazuma never at any point seems to care about Ayano in the way that the story wants \u2013 nay, needs \u2013 the audience to believe that he does.  Like Ayano herself, this weak element would be more forgivable if the focus of the show didn't fall on it, and draw attention to how deficient it really is.  There are shows with weaker romantic subplots, or at least a similar lack of chemistry between leads that are canonically supposed to get together, but in most of those cases the romance is just a bone thrown to those who want to see it, not something that's important to the main story being presented.\\n\\n\r\nThe last really major character, Ren, is a little better.  He's not a masterpiece of writing, but he has a definite personality, some legitimate struggles, and learns and grows from his experiences, changing as a person thanks to the trials we see him overcome.  In essence, he actually has the backbone of what makes a good character down \u2013 good thing he gets way less screen time than the \u201cleads\u201d.  Similarly, bit characters who are only around for an arc, an episode, or maybe occasional brief appearances can be pretty alright; I mentioned Kathrine earlier, and she's not alone in the list of characters who are fine as what they are, but would need to be more if they were forced into a starring role.\\n\\n\r\nYet, for all the problems I have with Kaze no Stigma it's... mediocre at worst.  I have no desire to watch it again and wouldn't recommend it, but there's enough good stuff that I could see why someone else, who's looking for a different experience out of the show, might like it anyway.  For one, the action is pretty good \u2013 it's not the best of its sort, but the fight choreography, the mixture of superpowers and melee combat, and the design for various magic and monsters are all creative and engaging.  It's a pretty show to look at in general, actually, with some good backgrounds and character designs as well.  And the voice actors, I can't fault.  They're doing their best with the script they were handed, and while I don't care about or believe what they're saying, I can believe that the characters care and understand, which is a mark in the show's advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE BREAKDOWN\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5.8 (6)\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nHm?  Why is the review still going?  Because I have more to say about a topic that approaches where Kaze no Stigma went wrong, but that is more a philosophy-of-writing matter than something that weighs heavily on what an average viewer might take away from Kaze no Stigma.  Specifically, I'd like to talk about powers, powerful characters, and what has to be done in order to write for them.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it's a difficult task.  Typically, one of the elements of a good story is that the leading character or characters has to face some sort of challenge that's difficult to overcome, that at least in some way pushes them to their limit or possibly even beyond it.  Characters don't always have to be challenged directly, head to head, on their main strengths, but if their main strengths are legitimately top-tier within their setting (not just at the level of being a prodigy and above their peer group, but at the highest level of what their world could throw at them), you have to get creative and take care in order to properly challenge or threaten such a character, compared to one who's more capable of being outclassed.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the fact that truly great power is usually the sort of thing that should come with strings attached.  They don't always have to be big strings, but because it's not terribly engaging to watch a character \u201cdo the sensible thing\u201d when that's defeat all their enemies in the same way, the top end of powers within a setting should typically come with some sort of restriction, price, or even just complication that forces a character who taps into that to struggle at least a little.  If you do give someone an unstoppable superweapon, make sure there's a reason they don't just lead with it.  To a lesser extent, magic in general tends to be more interesting when it isn't the kind of power that does just about whatever you need free of cost.  That isn't to say that powers can't be useful while still being engaging; in Fullmetal Alchemist, for instance, Alchemy is a pretty awesome power; but Equivalent Exchange means it's not always easy to get what you want with it.\\n\\n\r\nManaging a story where a character's powers are top-tier, versatile, and unrestricted or nearly unrestricted is a daunting task... but not impossible.  If you take great care, especially to write your characters as people who have needs that aren't met by blowing away their enemies, even the most godlike of characters can be fully engaging.  Since it should already be clear what I think of the characters in Kaze no Stigma, particularly Kazuma, it should be evident that we're not looking at a work here that's managed said daunting task.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to be clear, it is Kazuma, specifically, who I have a beef with on this score.  Ayano and Ren have much more constrained suites of abilities, with a narrow focus and a limited power that frequently leaves them at least potentially in over their heads when facing their foes.  Kazuma, however, is almost never threatened, and if he is then it's not typically when going all-out.  Part of the problem is in the very terminology they use for Kazuma's top end powers \u2013 he's a Contractor.  That is, he gained his abilities by entering into some sort of contract with the Wind Spirit Lord.  This could easily have been used to introduce some of the complications that I mentioned earlier.  A contract, by its nature, is an agreement between two parties, typically for some sort of mutual benefit.  We know what Kazuma got out of his contract, but... how about the Wind Spirit Lord?  What did Kazuma pay, or what does he still have to pay, in order to fulfill his end of the contract?  Kaze no Stigma never answers this.  It wasn't important or relevant to the show's writers, it was just an excuse for a former squib to now be magically amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's especially grating because even if you don't agree in abstract with the idea that great power should come at a potentially great price, the setup is such that it should have been that for Kazuma.  We come to understand, fairly shortly into the show, that he finally sought out power not because he wanted it for its own sake, but because he suffered some sort of trauma while he was powerless and has a strong desire to not have to lose something dear to him again.  Granted, he actually shows this motivation only a couple times, and acts somewhat at odds with it at other points, but that's just down to the inconsistent character writing in the show \u2013 the basic facts of Kazuma's setup are such that he became a contractor out of desperation.  In a low point, with a dire need, he entered an agreement with an otherworldly being to gain strength.  Basic narrative logic says that such a deal shouldn't be trivial or free.  What makes Kazuma, and his suffering so special that he was actually able to gain his contract?  The only hints we have suggest it should have been his devotion, and willingness to go as far as he might have to in order to fulfill the need his background left him with... but we never, not once, see anything either in him or about his contract that suggests that only Kazuma, or someone with Kazuma's dedication could have managed the incredible feat that he managed before the show started.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose even that could have been forgiven if Kazuma was smartly written, and challenged as a person so we could understand his pain and trials and get to know him as a person, but... he's not.  There's a point or two in the final arc where the writing tries, but it tries very briefly, and in a few ways that don't agree with each other.  When finally faced with something that's a good challenge for him (even if not a combat challenge) he reacts... actually, I don't understand how he reacts, he has to react more than once and he has a different reaction every time and there's not really a rhyme or reason for why he moves between his reaction when he does.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, this is the biggest failing of Kaze no Stigma \u2013 not that it just didn't manage to navigate the trouble of having a heavyweight magician with a lot of utility for a main character, but that it did actually come close, only to have critical failings at every point along the line keep it from actually paying off.  The material with the character Lapis could have been not just good material, but legitimately great material... if it came earlier in a story devised by much better writers.  It's a powerhouse setup, worthy of a really great show, and it's entirely, 100% squandered by how badly supported it is in this.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma is a fun anime if you're interested into this genre. Battles, magic, comedy, kick-ass moments, KnS has it all.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is fair, not really impressive since for me it was predictable towards the end. The \"main\" plot starts later in the series as the first 3/4 is filled with random missions and somewhat fillers like hotspring episodes and so on. Even though the lack of main plot overall disappointed me, I found the story overall satisfying.\r\nArt\r\nThe characters are very nicely drawn, you can clearly see this is a 2007 anime. Effects are good, from flames to wind and other unleashed powers; plusthe characters are drawn good enough for any fan to enjoy the art. Even though it's no better than other 2007 animes, it clearly has it's own attractiveness for me. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot much to comment on this area, the sound is fair enough, soundtrack fits the mood all of the time and the opening song is quite catchy once you listen to it. I liked the idea of two ending songs/sequences since it changed with the atmosphere of the episode. Overall it was fine with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were great, I loved them. KnS has it all: the tsundere, the athlete, the rich lady (from America, though speaks English like hell), the lolita and so on. To my surprise, the guys have cool personalities as well, the main lead taking the title of one of the most kick-ass characters, you're gonna like his style. Nothing else to say here, the characters are probably the strong point of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWell, as I said, unless you're into magic, combat and ecchi shots from time to time, you're probably not gonna find anything interesting. However, if you like magic battles you'll find this anime cool, plus the characters and some of the situations make the 24 episodes worth the time. I really enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rounded up to around 8. I think it was pretty great and I don't regret seeing it. The main lead remains one of my favorite characters. It's a good thing they have an open end so I really hope for a sequel. That's about it.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma got my attention with its Airbender-esque story and seemingly cute heroine. However, I went into thinking that it was going to be like every other action romance: the guy is going to be a complete pansy trying to impress the heroine through being reckless and stupid, and she will somehow fall in love with him. I was actually quite mistaken and was quite pleased with what actually did happen, but there were some things I was not quite hip on.\r\nLets start with Ayano. She is the cute heroine I was talking about, except I was a little naive. She actually is notcute at all, and is quite rude. A tsundere, if you will. I figured the main hero would be a boy of a man that does whatever he is told because he's scared. NOPE. Enter Kazuma, one of those cool guys you just wanna slug. He's good looking, smooth, has ladies all over him. He is everything I wasn't expecting, and this turned the story into something different. She begins hating him like they usually do but as she starts to fall for him, he could seriously give a rats behind. He's frickin Kazuma! So even though the story centers around him most of the time, the romance comes from Ayano wanting him instead of the other way around, which is a nice change in pace for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe action side of the series is okay, but nothing special. Kazuma is a powerful wind user while Ayano and his girly brother Ren are powerful fire users. The fighting scenes are acceptable, but it struck me as those kind of scenes that are only used to lead into the drama, not necessarily to be the selling point. The drama however was quite good at times, and the final arc for me was actual quite entertaining. However, the presentation and storytelling was lacking the excitement I was craving, and most of the time it felt empty.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not really eye-candy. Everything is just right so there's no complaints, not any compliments either. The character designs are decent as well, with nothing out of the ordinary that I would call special.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs were actually very good. The OP was very nostalgic and set the mood very nicely, and the multiple endings fit the closing situations successfully. The BGMs however were not memorable for me, and nothing comes to mind as a gem. But it does its job for moving the story, so I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading a synopsis, I was really looking forward to watching Kaze no Stigma because it sounded like The Last Aiirbender with a bit more drama and romance. I'm not quite sure I'd say that's what I got from the show. If anything, it lacked the drama and romance it needed, making it someone of a bad copy of something we've seen before, and nobody likes that. It is utterly average, and if you want to watch something you have no intention of becoming a favorite or think I may be wrong, by all means watch it. But in my opinion, the series fell short when its potential had the means of taking it farther then where it went.",

            "content": "When I became a \"full-time\" AnimeGirl I was kinda just searching for anime that involved powers (It was a period of \"After-Avatar-depression\").There were anime like: Code:Breaker, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and the best of all and my favorite \"Four-element-powers\" anime Kaze no Stigma or in English The Stigma of the Wind. So for you, on this lovely Monday afternoon, a review on Kaze no Stigma. \r\nPlot and Story-Line\r\nI'll begin right away with the plot. In the middle of the story we have the Kannagi family. A respected family of fire element users. Eighteen-year-old Kazuma was originally part of the Kannagis, but after he showed noaffinity to fire as a power and after the defeat by his four year younger cousin Ayano he was banished and cast out from the family. Four years passed, and Kazuma finally decided to come back to Japan, under the name Kazuma Yagami stronger than ever. While he was away he made a contract with the Wind-spirit and became an extraordinary wind user. With his arrival several murders in the Kannagi family occurred, and as expected, they all accused Kazuma. As a result he is confronted by various members of his former family and forced to prove his innocence. Yet, the only person Kazuma wants to fight is his father, the strongest Enjustsu (power to control flames). After he defeats his father, and goes back to the hotel, he meets his younger brother Ren, also an Enjutsu user. Later on Ren was taken by a powerful demon and in wish to help his little brother he decides to meet the head of the Kanagi, Ayano's father, and convince him that he is innocent. Once again Kazuma is reunited with his brother Ren and cousin Ayano, and yeah...That's when the whole story turns into an action loaded, little romance-comedy, that has a cute little background story that reveals it-self in the very end of the show. \\n\r\nI told you in the beginning, the main reason why I like this anime are the powers. I love element-based powers. The action in this anime is awesome. And although the fights are a little bit predictable they are still catchy and really give you the promised entertainment. I liked it. \\n\r\nIn some parts of the story, Kaze no Stigma becomes a \"slice of life-romance\" anime, but it is not such a big waste. It is funny and entertaining especially in the Kazuma/Ayano moments. It's mostly funny because of Ayano's tsundere personality, but more of it in the character section. \\n\r\nThe thing I found most interesting in this anime is definitely the background story of Kazuma while he was away, and how it affects his present. The story about his character development, about finding him-self, about moving on and letting go of the strings from the past. That's definitely the message of this anime \"Let go of the past, and live in the present\".\\n\r\nThere is really not much to talk about the story, because it is not that special. Mainly predictable but gets entertaining from time to time. Still, I liked it and would give the whole story a 7,67. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI loved KAZUMA. He is one of that strong, main characters that still have some flaws in their personality. There is something that can be developed in the story, and that's the thing characters are there for. The fight with his own past was so interesting and kept you on tenterhooks the whole time. It got a bit emotional in some parts, but not too much, and that's exactly how I like it. Kazuma is strong, funny, cool and amusing. Nothing special but awesome for the story. \\n\r\nOh there she is, AYANO. She was so amusing because of her tsundere-like personality. I found them always funny. The way she wants to hide her feelings for Kazuma, oh come one, we can see that one. Kawaii. Ayano is a strong and independent character that hates to say when she needs help. And stubborn btw. Yet, she knows her obligations, and although she is a bit childish she can be mature if needed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style \\n\r\nAmm...there is really nothing special I could say about the animation. You can clearly see that it's still 2007. It is not bad, just like the animation of every other anime. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the style I have to say that the makers did a great job. The different powers were so awesome. I mean the basics were there air and wind for instance. But Ayano's crimson flames and then the black wind power of Kazuma, epic. The style got a 8,79. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIf you want some action and you miss Avatar: The Last Air-bender this is an anime for you. It is catchy, amusing and entertaining. I really recommend you to give it a try because I think you won't regret it. You have some awesome characters, some epic fights and interesting powers. Not that unique but definitely good. \\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "So this is my very first review. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, although I am heartbroken about the death of the author and the story lacking closure, I can still easily consider this series a favorite. \r\nAfter over ten years of watching anime, I have a hard time of finding animes/manga's that are mature enough to keep my interests. The story had everything I was looking for, a strong female lead, a focus on romance with actual development, quality fight scenes, entertaining bad guys, and last but not least a wonderful blend of traditional Japan and modern Japan.\r\nI even found the filler episodes tolerable especiallywhen compared to most popular series. There's a little bit of something for everyone in this show. I loved the main character Kazuma for not being your typical hero, he's kind of an asshole but you can't help but love him for it; a charming scoundrel. Another awesome thing about this anime is that I didn't completely hate the English speaking voice cast, and I almost always watch with subtitles.The art is fantastic, I really loved the extra emphasis on eyes. The fights scenes and magic are well done. I also appreciated that all of the supporting cast all had distinct features.\\n\\n\r\n I am sad that this story had phenomenal potential, I can't help but think if the author had lived longer this could've been in the ranks of Naruto or Bleach. I am rather obsessed with endings, it can make or break and story or film for me. I was at episode at 13/24 when I found out about the death of the author, and was absolutely dreading the ending. But I strongly advise not to avoid this series, the ending was good enough that I was totally satisfied. Kaze no Stigma was fantastic overall.",

Bernhardt did say that they would meet again, so they already have a way to start the second season. Plus they need to finish the development of Kazuma's and Ayano's relationship, which they left open to interpretation. It looked like things would work out, but then it ended with Ayano chasing Kazuma with Enryha (?) and I am not satisfied with that ending. If they don't make an entire second season, they could make severalOVA episodes and make it more complete.",

            "content": "If you go into this anime expecting to be surprised by the plot or drawn in my the characters, expect to be disappointed. However if you are tired of watching anime that get too deep and just want to kick back and watch a solid reliable anime with some neat fights and good animation, then you could do a lot worse than Kaze no Stigma. This is an anime that does very little that is original but it presents itself well and hits all the right notes. It doesnt deserve to be called great but to call it anything less than good just isnt fair.\r\nStory:\r\nWithoutspoiling anything let me just say that I am not convinced that the original writer (I am assuming like most anime this started off as a manga) knew where he wanted the story to end up when he began. The ending, while fun and as close to epic as this show can get, doesn't seem to connect back to the beginning much. The rest of the show is told in short story arcs that usually only last about four episodes with the occasional single episodes that are more for comic relief (like the hot springs episode which nearly all animes are now required to have by law). You have your random assortment of baddies that have little to no connection to each other (for the most part you could actually see a show in the middle and pick up most of the plot). This sounds lazy and dull but it actually works well in this show. The enemies are for the most part fairly interesting and you usually end up with an entertaining battle. One final point to address with the plot. Everyone and their dog, cat, and goldfish, knows from the beginning that there is going to be a relationship developed between the main characters by the end of the show. To the show's credit it doesn't go through the usual cliche phases of the main heroine spending most of her screen time agonizing over whether she likes the guy or not. Instead the relationship is developed slowly until near the end where it speeds up a bit too much to be realistic even by anime standards. There is a humorous subplot near the middle with a character trying to play matchmaker but I wont spoil anything. 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYou have to give this show credit, it looks good. The backgrounds are fairly standard but better than most animes. What really sells the art here are the character designs. All the characters look good and are distinct enough to be immediately recognizable which is something some animes fail to do. The animations are pretty well done to and someone got creative with the battle effects during the fight scenes. Also one final thing to note, this show LOVES panty shots and I mean LOVES them. If you took a drink every time the heroines delicates are seen through the course of the anime, you will die from alcohol poisoning. The funny part is I think there are only a few times when a character seems to notice, like when they realize high kicking in a skirt probably isnt a good idea. 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNot much to say here. Like Art this show does a very good job with its sound. Everything from its music to the voice acting is great. I have seen better but not very often. Nothing to complain about really so lets move on. 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before the characters are not especially deep. Only the main character's back story is ever explored in any detail and even then there are some fairly big holes left by the end. Even so all of the main characters are entertaining to watch and have a clear and distinct personality and I dont recall them ever acting out of character in the show. All of the main characters are somewhat stereotypical types on the surface but really they get their jobs done well and thats really all they need to do. Still a little backstory for the main heroine at least would have helped this show out a bunch. It also would have helped if this show had some more interesting minor characters. Other than the grandfather and the heroine's two friends, the rest of the supporting cast, including the main rival (which oddly enough is an American, because all people from America have blond hair, blue eyes, and an annoying laugh right?) are forgettable at best and get in the way of the plot too much. Luckily they dont do this enough to be grating but the writer could have done a bit better in this area. 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLet me be clear, if you enjoy most anime, then you will enjoy this one. It wont leave you feeling like you just witnessed something amazing but if you are just looking for a decent solid show then this one will not disappoint. 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Well, I first found out about the anime through Funimation's YouTube page, and I was very interested. I watched the first half of the series via the YouTube page, but then I stopped watching for it for some reason or another. I did buy the DVDs, and I started it from the beginning again. So... let's talk about the actial points now, shall we?\r\nStory\r\nThe first 12-15 episodes reminded me somewhat of Naruto in the effect that if focuses on arcs... not the best, but certainly not the worst. However, once you get to the Pandemonium Arc (as I am dubbing it), you get sucked rightinto the story. At least that was what happened to me. Then I thought \"Why didn't the first half start out this epic?\". I have to say, I am overall satisfided with the story. Besides the first episode and the first arc foreshadowing, the rest of the story didn't allude to the last arc which was a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was good... certain short clips were perhaped overused which reminded me of overused transformation sequences often used in Magical Girl genres. However, the use of the effects with the magic made it interesting and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was the greatest disappointment in the series. They used the same songs over and over with the same OP and ED. Nuff said...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters very much. Especially Ayano's anger issues... Even with the serious scenes, I was able to laugh because Ayano was going nuts. Besides that... Kazuma's backstory could have been alluded to more (as said under story). Ren came off as a main character to me, but he should have been developed more if he is going to appear in almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a perfect score. Despite the lack of certain things, I was able to enjoy the anime a lot. I definitely would recommend this anime to anyone who even thinks this anime could be interesting.",

            "content": "Well, from the synopsis the anime seemed a decent one. It's only natural to expect a great anime. But, to realize a good plot idea into a good anime requires many other things to be good.\r\n1. Voice Acting\r\n~\r\nRecently, I have been paying a lot of attention to voice acting. I even picked this anime because it had Ouno Daisuke voicing the protagonist. \r\n.\r\nFrom the very start I noticed the voice acting was lacking in quality at times. Of course, Ouno-san did a perfect job. His voice acting complemented the many lackings in the script and scenario. Koyama Rikiya (Kannagi Genma), Fukuyama Jun (Serizawa) were supportingcharacters, but they lived up to their names. Fujimura Ayumi (Kannagi Ayano) did a great job. Ohara Sayaka (Tachibana Kirika) didn't disappoint, as well.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nBut, this is all to be expected. The problem is that these characters had about 60% of screen time. The rest of the time, you could tell the voices were scripted. I don't blame the actors, rather the director because he did a very poor job. Although it bothered me at the beginning, after finishing the anime I thought, \"Well, it's not that bad.\"\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n2. Script and Dialogues\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nThe anime is a mess in these regards. Example: The anime started with a very serious, dark tone and out of the blue, the characters were behaving all-cheery and light hearted. (Ayano's reaction to Kazuma after he apperntly killed 2 of her relatives). That completely ruins the mood.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n3. Story\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, good start but poor ending. The whole story can be divided into 3 arcs. Kazuma dealing with the Kannagi clan, Kazuma dealing with Ayano, Kazuma dealing with his past. The mid-part of the story where Kazuma dealt with Ayano is of light tone. So, there is nothing to say about it. But, the last arc had an extremely poor ending. A mentally snapped Kazuma raged with the urge of vengance is suddenly calmed down with a few words by Ayano. It's so pooly scripted that almost to the point where you get embarrassed at the mess. Well, see it for yourself.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n4. Art\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nWhat the hell were the producers thinking, showing so many panty shots in the middle of extreme and tensed situations!? It is just, how you Americans say, a turn off!\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n5. Conclusion\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nWell, judging everything, I agree with the MAL rating which is a rare case because MAL ratings are in most cases shit numbers. The anime is not great but it's good.",

            "content": "The best phrase I can think of to describe Kaze no Stigma is enjoyable mediocrity, which explains why the reviews are so full of polarized ratings: 2s as well as 8s. If you go into the show with moderate expectations, you may enjoy it, but overestimate, and you'll be disappointed. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe synopsis is quite inaccurate in describing the show, since it explains essentially only the first 4 or 5 episodes. The rest of the story is various sub-stories that sort of fit together, but can probably be told in isolation. The last arc is an exploration of our main protagonist's past, and how itsconsequences continue to haunt him. Sadly, the writer for the source light novels passed away before he could finish them, so you'll have to be okay with a cliffhanger ending that will likely never be completed. \\n\r\nIn terms of storytelling strength, KnS has its weak and strong moments. At times, it seemed like the story took an easy road out with a simplified and partially unexplained resolution, but at other times it delivered on its build-up and presented a satisfactory conclusion. Since there are various arcs throughout the show, some of them are done much better than others. And if you are looking for a satisfactory ending, you will likely be disappointed due to the unresolved cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI try not to let the music or animation affect my opinions of a show, but I would have enjoyed the show a lot more if these departments were improved. I'm not sure if other 2007 shows were all of this quality, but because there are many fight scenes in the show, bad animation and music significantly affects those types of scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there isn't much character development. At the end, the characters are pretty much the same people they were at the beginning. There are changes here and there, but because the show is more of a shounen, the focus is on the action. If you're a fan of overpowered characters, however, KnS will suit your tastes, and is basically the only reason I kept watching. If you're looking for anything else in this department, you probably won't get it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched and finished the show simply because it had a badass main character. In most other aspects, the show was very average, but not bad by any means. If you want something else, or something more than that, KnS is probably not for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like badassery, give KnS a try, but I wouldn't blame you if you dropped it.",

This anime compelled me to create an account to express my displeasure towards this anime. \r\nThe story is predictable. There were some memorable bits but the predictability of it made it somewhat boring. The art is well done, special effects were brought out really nicely and characters look great. The fights were also very well exhibited. The anime was visually appealing and the sound effects were great.\r\nMost of the characters are fine except Ayano Kannagi. Oh god, neverwas I so angered by a female protagonist. She is the sole reason I dropped Kaze No Stigma. Ayano is an ungrateful, egoistic, barbaric and rude girl on a short fuse. She does not think of the bigger picture and does not have her priorities right. She can lash out at her allies during dangerous situations for the smallest reasons and is headstrong. She constantly lands herself and people around her in precarious situations expecting help to come from nowhere. She never reflects on herself and blames every bad thing that happens on others. She does not think before she acts and I hate how there will always be someone who cleans up the mess she makes which causes her to be extremely spoiled. Someone with such a repulsive personality would've died a few times over in the real world. And no one would ever feel sad that she died.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\n\"Kaze no Stigma\" isn't the worst anime I've seen but it's not the best either. Instead, it falls somewhere in the middle. It has some awesome fight scenes, likable characters and great comedic moments, but unfortunately these are accompanied by an uneven story and average animation. It's far from what I'd call essential viewing, but it's still worth a look, even if you will feel that most of it has been done before.\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nThe story revolves around the Kannagi family, a family of sorcerers who have practiced the sacred art of fire magic for countless generations and are protected by the spirits of fire. KazumaKannagi, however, has zero talent for fire magic, which ultimately results in him getting disowned by his father and cast from the family. However, he later discovers that his true talent lies in a completely different element altogether, namely wind. Four years later, which is when the story begins, Kazuma (now named Yagami) returns to  Japan as an incredibly powerful wind magic user, having made a contract with the Spirit King of the Wind, just like the first Kannagi head had done before with the Spirit King of Fire. Basically, he has all the powers of the Spirit King's domain so he's the most powerful wind magic user alive. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, he is not the only main character. The story actually opens with Ayano, the future head to the Kannagis, Kazuma's second cousin and the girl who beat him in a battle for Enraiha, a sword that's been passed down to the Kannagis for generations. The two have a rough start but after being forced to work together to stop a revolt against the Kannagis, they start to become closer as they are paired together for more missions. The story follows an arc format. The first half is split into three arcs, then afterwards we have four breather episodes and once we reach episode 17, Kazuma and Ayano tackle a huge case that takes up the eight remaining episodes of the series, while delving into Kazuma's dark past. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, there isn't much new here. The whole opposing forces working together has been done plenty of times and the magic isn't gone into much detail- all we know is that someone makes a contract with a Spirit King and all their descendants inherit that power, though it's never made clear why Kazuma didn't inherit it. There's also the fact that despite tackling themes like family and power, these themes never evolve beyond window-dressing, with the series making no real effort to explore any of them. The arcs vary in quality, with the last one probably being the best as a lot of questions you've been asking over the series are finally answered. Unfortunately, the series ends on a serious cliffhanger that leaves much unresolved, including Kazuma and Ayano's growing feelings for each other. But with the novel author having passed away in 2009, the chances of ever getting a proper conclusion are slim to none.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (7.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Kaze no Stigma\" is very rough around the edges. The character models have constant jagged lines and there are plenty of gratuitous panty shots. The magic effects are quite nice but I've definitely seen better. Even considering that the series came out in 2007 (more than a decade ago at this point), the animation really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack blends into the background mostly, but there are quite a few good tracks that you will want to look up. Notably, the series uses two main ending themes over the course of the series and rather than changing the theme halfway, one plays during dramatic cliffhangers while the other plays at the end of an arc or a breather episode. The voice acting for the dub is great; if you're a fan of \"Fairy Tail\" like myself then you'll instantly recognise Cherami Leigh as Ayano and she delivers a great performance here. The standout performance, however, has got to be Robert McCollum as Kazuma. His deep, manly voice is perfect for Kazuma's cool, snarky character, and he ultimately walks away with the series's best lines. However, there's some pretty bad voice acting in the series as well, specifically Caitlin Glass as Catherine. She was clearly trying to put on a posh accent, but it comes out as awkwardly British even though the character is American and just serves to make her even more annoying than she already is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are quite good, though mostly the main ones. We'll start with Kazuma. He is frequently called a jerk by Ayano, and honestly, she's not wrong. He's brutally honest (and I mean BRUTAL), often charges money before he lifts a finger to help and always has a snarky comment ready at the expense of, well, pretty much everyone. However, he has every right to act the way he does considering all that he's suffered. Besides being disowned by his parents, he suffered a huge loss during his years away from Japan. It's hinted on throughout the series then it's revealed in the final arc and boy is it tragic! That's not to say he's a totally bad person, of course. He's still a good person at heart and there are several moments where he shows just how much he cares for others, particularly Ayano and Ren. On top of all this, he is easily the most badass character in the series. If there is any reason to watch this series, he is it, making this one of the few anime in which the male lead and anti-hero is my favourite character.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have Ayano, who is Kazuma's opposite in just about every way. Kazuma, as a wind magic user, is cool-headed and rational, while Ayano, a fire magic user, is short-tempered and impulsive. In other words, she's a literal fiery redhead, as well the main source of comedy in the series. Now, arguably this show's biggest problem is having two main characters of equal importance and having one much more powerful than the other. I know that's how anime like this normally start, but that's to give a chance for the weaker one to catch up. \"Kaze no Stigma\", on the other hand, is written in such a way that it's pretty much impossible for Ayano to catch up, so she comes off as a dead weight most of the time. Emphasis on 'most of the time', however, as she does have her moments of badassery when Kazuma's not stealing the spotlight. Then again, I don't mind Kazuma taking the spotlight so much, as Ayano can get very annoying at times. Sometimes, her temper and attitude are funny, other times, not so much. She's a very stereotypical tsundere. Thankfully, I can say she gets a lot better in the last few episodes, earning her a rightful spot as my second favourite character.\\n\\n\r\nThe third character is Ren, Kazuma's younger brother who practically worships him. With Kazuma and Ayano often bickering, he serves as the series's moral centre- the heart, if you will. He practically has the third arc dedicated to him, and his story will probably make you shed a tear or two. He largely exits the spotlight after that, but he still plays a prominent role throughout, and does a good job and rounding out the main cast. The supporting cast is alright, but they tend to be in the background for the most part, and there are a couple of characters I really didn't like. Notably, however, Ayano's friends, Yukari and Nanase, turn out to have hidden depths late in the series, making them their own characters rather than 'those two girls who hang out with the heroine'. That's a very rare thing for any anime, so to see it in one like this, which doesn't have much originality to begin with, is both surprising and welcome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\n\"Kaze no Stigma\" is a fun series, but it's not a particularly exciting one. There are some good fight scenes, but there isn't really anything you couldn't get from a number of other, better anime. And while the comedy is great throughout, as I said, there are times when it can get rather annoying. It's entertaining, definitely, but I wouldn't blame you if you stopped watching at some point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Kaze no Stigma\" is the type of anime that's good fun while it lasts, but in the end fails to leave any kind of lasting impression. It's not horrible by any means you can think of, but it doesn't really stand out in any meaningful way either. And after watching the very similar but much better \"Shakugan no Shana\", I can definitely say you could probably give this one a miss.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n7+7.5+8+7+7.5=36.5/50=7.3/10",

            "content": "This anime is one example that is really desperate to keep the audience entertained by making use of a lot of cliches. We have Ayano Kannagi who yields a flame sword and a tsundere just like Shana in Shakugan no shana. We also have Kazuma Yagami whose name was derived from Death Note \"Yagami\". By the way, Yagami means God of Night in Death Note. \r\nThe director of this anime is Junichi Sakata who passed away. I gave my condolences to him. \r\nThe premise starts of interesting but then it gradually fell apart and become so much annoying more than before. Again, Kazuma Yagami wasdisowned by the Kannagi family but came back as a Wind master. In fact, he was so powerful that nobody could beat him. He is arrogant, stoic and cold-hearted but he has a calm, friendly and collected personality inside him. The problem is that the anime didn't develop Kazuma enough for me to root for him. He just comes off as another Edward Cullen. Ayano Kannagi is the worst character in this anime, she is like Louise from Familiar of Zero, so demanding, arrogant, loud-mouth. I could go on forever. In fact, she is the worst tsundere I ever came across.\\n\\n\r\nCatherine Mcdonald was also as annoying as Ayano Kannagi but she was featured in few episodes. Basically, the entire cast is so god awfully annoying that I want to stop watching this anime for good. I don't understand why people betray one another just over small thing. Of course always misunderstandings, ugh.\\n\\n\r\nThis whole anime is really about arguments and fighting, nothing else, no character development at all. This anime really expect me to care more about Kazuma Yagami because he had gone through worse things than everybody else. Okay, I have seen a lot of characters who had gone through worse situations than them and yet they remain as optimistic and caring. Kazuma Yagami is another Edward Cullen. His personality is bland even though he is badass.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want me to sympathise with the characters, then I want to see the characters learn how to trust and care one another like Special A. Special A starts off as annoying characters but then slowly they become great and likeable characters who learn how to trust and care for others. In fact, this was a good anime. But Kaze no Stigma is a great letdown with characters who whine and complain a lot until my ears bleed. \\n\\n\r\nOne example from episode 23, after Kazuma regains his memory, he kicks Ayano. Basically, the cast consists of people who are sore losers and they never learn from their mistakes. The fights are way too terrible and boring. I am not gonna say anymore. This anime is really a lot like the worse version of Zero no Tsukaima. \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I hate this anime, the ending was terribly executed. The anime ends with Kazuma beating Ayano and Ayano chasing him around. I cannot describe in words how bad it was. The art is also very dull which deserves a 3/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will give it a 2 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nJunichi Sakata, I am so sorry I didn't like this anime.",

I doubt I will come across another anime where the MC doesn't get abused by the heroin.\r\nThe first few episodes were really amazing and got you hooked into the series, as cliche the plot was somehow the writer presented it with commendable skill. Like I said Ireally enjoy Kezuma and I'm sure everyone else does to, and can even unanimously agree that Ayano sort of wrecked the series. She is the second most annoying heroin in anime history *my anime history which sadly is pathetic* only to be topped of in bitchieness by Sakura Haruno with a whopping 10.0 in the scale *everyone I would like to take 5 minutes of your time to give our condolence to Naruto for dealing with her and think back on how many times she was pathetic*.\\n\\n\r\nMidway through the series Ayano was super annoying and for once I can feel the folks who dropped the series because of her. However, during the middle this series was also plagued with pointless and sort of bad fillers that which although had some interesting parts, were still majorly crap.\\n\\n\r\nFInally after bearing through the hell of fillers we reach the end, where if your memory is that bad, Kazuma goes apeshit and snaps on the world popping a bunch of blood vessels in his eyes turning them to hello kitty punch red. This by far redeemed the series a lot and truly recommend everyone who quit the series to watch the final episodes. Once again rather cliche but presented elegantly to bring (even though it was artificial) some sort of renewal in plot.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE EPISODE!!! If you stuck to this point of my review either you have a lot of time to spare in your mums basement or you want to list all my grammar mistakes and errors in my review to start a never ending comment war. I am really dissappointed on how Ayano kicked Kazumas butt and felt betrayed by Kazuma OPness so far topping at a 9.0. Also the final boss fight against Beliel was honestly really pathetic and meaningless. I'm sure I wasn't the only one thinking \"Oh damn son true determination shite wans again screw this man where is the power\" I was honestly only staring at the colors.....\\n\\n\r\nRating : 7\\n\r\nReasoning: Ayano is a whiny annoying and frustrating hello kitty turd.\\n\r\nEnd boss fight was sad.\\n\\n\r\nFinal remarks:\\n\r\nHonestly in the first half of the series this anime was going to make it in my top 10 even my top 5 but sadly it got worse as it went on but redeemed it self to end with a pathetic ending.\\n\\n\r\nThank you and I hope you may one day get a job.",

            "content": "This is my first review so i might be a little bias. I really like the series so much that i watched the series three times. \r\nStory:\r\nIf you look at the core of the story you'll see that its not that bad. Maybe not original but its not bad. One of the problems i find with the story is that their are too many fillers. I say about a third of this series is fillers. Another problem is they don't try to create much suspense or cliffhangers. If you watch just the first episode of the series and analyze it you can tell a lotabout the characters and story. The makers of the anime really knows how to squeeze in 3 or more episode worth of story into just one. The first episode doesn't really hook you in and make you want more since you already know most of what you want to know. For example the reason why Kazuma was exiled is pretty much revealed in the first episode. I think if gonzo did a better job in execution by leaving cliff hangers and more mysteries that actually make us go crazy because we want to know than this series would be much much better. The story could also be stretch out a little more for us to soak it all in. Then they wont have to have all those fillers.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is good. It isn't bad but then it isn't absolutely gorgeous with little to no eye candy. There is some fan service in this. I personally don't mind it. The fan service isn't really over the top so it won't annoy a lot of people. \\n\r\n8/10 Art wasn't good yet it wasn't bad\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP and ED not really special. Again it isn't bad. I haven't watch the dub before but for the sub the voice actors do a pretty good job. I think the voices represent the characters in a good way.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love the characters. They are generic but i still love them. The main character Kazuma is pretty much a badass. The very reason why i watched this three times is because how much of a badass he is. I was getting tired of the repetitive formula most action anime main character goes through. Meet villain, Fight, Struggle, Win, Get stronger. I wanted to skip the struggle and get stronger part. The other characters like Ayano (Girl main character)\\n\r\nand Ren (little bro of kazuma) might annoy you and they might not. Ren though he is a boy he acts girlish. Well this is an anime so that is normal. Ayano is like a tsundere so if you can't stand a lot of yelling for no reason then she might annoy you. The other characters are pretty generic. I also loved the characters because you know a lot about them if you think about it. I thought we could've had better and more of a character development for each character though.  \\n\r\n7/10 Characters are good might annoy some of you but their not bad\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\ni loved it. I am a fan of the genre and it had everything i wanted. Fantasy, badass character, tsundere, assholes, pretty much everything i want in an anime. The little thing that bugged me was whenever Ayano pulled out her sword their would be this magical transformation like scene that gets played over and over throughout the series. Some people might enjoy this series like i did others might not.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\ni loved it. They could've presented the story better and had better character development though.If gonzo did a better job with execution they could've stretch this anime into 4 seasons at most and made it way better.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\n i would recommend this to everyone since i loved it but if you love magic and fantasy and a badass character watch it.",

            "content": "Kaze No Stigma appears to be a typical save-the-world-get-the-girl/boy kind of show. Well, it's not. Do keep in mind, however, that the series itself is unfinished because the producer passed away while developing this (and several other) titles. And it looks like no one plans to pick up their works where they were left off at.\r\nThe story is rather roundabout - episodes are typically filled with seemingly pointless missions or adventures. Hot springs, theme park, etc., are part of this category. However, they all help to show the developing relationships between the characters, namely, Kazuma and Ayano. It becomes obvious, and is pointed out assuch by Ayano's father, that the show curves to a standard romantic/battle style anime. However, parts of Kazuma's past are constantly being brought about (and other interesting tidbits of information), which helps to give the overall story some flair. The last episode makes it obvious that there would have been a second season (won't say anything as to why for spoiler reasons, but you can guess if you've watched it).\\n\\n\r\nI think, personally, that what makes Kaze No Stigma so captivating is the constant addition of new things, flashbacks, omnipresence thoughts, and tide-turning events that occur rather frequently in the show. However, I could see it as a cliche and empty anime like I'm sure some people would react to it, but remember, the show is unfinished and will sadly remain that way. So you must think of it in that light as an unfinished work.",

            "content": "Well lets get straight to the point-\r\nPlot (7) KnS is pretty much like the other animes which has empty plot and is mostly made up of fillers. I didn't expect much from KnS so I never really was dissapointed. KnS is not something I would call brilliant  or great or very clever either, it is basically average. The plot wasn't horrible but it was olay. There wasn't much of a plot really, but its kind of a typical laid back anime that a person can watch when they have spare time. At the beginning of the show I thought it would lead to amore interesting conculsuion as it had a catchy theme (four elements thingys fighting off demons), but the mangaka didn't put the theme to good use sadly. I was also hoping for some better fighting scenes. And the biggest mistake was we get to know the actual villan of the anime at the last few eps where the plot finally turned up, the previous eps were all fillers.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8) The colors are bright and eye catching. The character lining could be better and they could have been more well drawn but since its from 2007 its pretty much the best someone can hope for at that time. The fire effects could have been a lot better too. The details are 50/50.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7) -1 because ayano's high pitched voice ticks me off. The op is really good, the eds should have shown more than just pictures of the characters. The ed songs also didn't fit the anime well. But other than that the chracters voices fit them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6) The characters didn't have depth and had a one-sided personality. One word could describe all the characters perfectly. Like-\\n\r\nkazuma- composed and cool\\n\r\nayano- angry and irritated\\n\r\nren- childlike and soft natured\\n\r\ndo you see now? these characters have no personality beyond the words I described. Sure kazuma had a twisted past and all, then suddenly he became murderous but it really didn't change his persona it just changed his emotions.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment(7) It was fun, the anime. And it was relaxing and not too serious like death note etc. And its one of those plain and simple 24 ep animes. Besides I watched this anime a long time ago and it was one of my first animes so I couldn't judge it really well. But I did enjoy it for sure ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7) I recomend this anime to anyone who wants to watch it. Its not deep and there are more than some plotholes, and if you can ignore those missing sortylines and cliches then I am quiet sure you'll enjoy it. \\n",

            "content": "\"I will not forsake anything this time\" \r\nKaze no Stigma in a few words is about a man named Kazuma who had no talent to control fire, losing the right to wield the legendary Kannagi family sword Enraiha, Kazuma is banished by his father. 4 years later, with a mound of unknown events in his past, Kazuma returns to Kannagi territory as a powerful wind user. The events that occur between the troubles of his past four years, and his standing with the Kannagi family, play out the story that Kaze no Stigma presents.\r\nKaze no Stigma was a different anime for me. Though I haven'treally seen other anime that were released in 2007 (that I know of), I can say from my perspective that it was well done for its time. The story felt as if it was going at a calming pace, not too slow that it felt like I was watching a Korean drama, but also what satisfied me is that the story didn't get rushed at all. The fact that the main things that drove Kaze no Stigma didn't result in a rushed ending in my opinion is something worth high respect. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: The story overall wasn't too streamline, in other words, in the beginning it really didn't have a main goal. The beginning was composed of little missions from episode to episode that allowed for character development and the presence of themes to be revealed. Aside from the beginning, which had its own little main arc, until the main goal was shown near the last third of the series, the story kind of played out as a comedic, slice of life, romance anime. The setting was also interesting for me, I have yet to see an anime that included a somewhat similar feel of dominating families, loyalty, pride, and spell casters that relied on the elements. This makes me think of the Avatar Airbender series which I never really watched, maybe just the first season, but Kaze no Stigma puts a more \"gang\" feeling to it. With Japanese families competing with each other, while each having their own specific element, it differs from the Airbender series' of rebellion and overcoming a dictating empire. The setting was definitely a unique aspect to Kaze no Stigma, and the main plot line that was shown was pretty well done. The anime never totally lost the main reasons or origins, so the ending or the events that took place from beginning, middle, and end didn't feel out of place. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Since I didn't watch anime back in 2007, I can't compare the art to other anime specifically. However, I've never had to complain about an anime's art production before. Mainly what I look for in anime is decently drawn pictures while having a smooth flow from frame to frame. Kaze no Stigma didn't disappoint, not once did I feel something was going too slow, or the actions seemed a little edgy. The sound wasn't a big part of the anime, since none of the tracks from the OST blatantly said \"Download me\", I won't say that the OST was amazing, but the music was well picked, done, and added to accompany Kaze no Stigma. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were also well done. Clearly differentiating between the main characters and the supporting, the main comedy aspect came from the romance that occurs between Kazuma and Ayano. While providing sincere heart tugging romance between characters, there was a well put balance of conflict between the mains and supporting characters as well. This can also be seen through the main families of the Kannagi and the Branch families. I'll have to say, the fathers in Kaze no Stigma made me laugh with joy. Each character had their own personality, which is mainly what I look for in characters. The main character was well done and when the plot line started his actions were somewhat predictable, but done in a acceptable manner. The other characters' personalities can be seen elsewhere, either as, Yandere,Tsundere, devoting, etc...Each character to my enjoyment wasn't fully controlled by those main basics of anime character personalities. The main thing to look out for in these characters of Kaze no Stigma is their conflict, romance, and interactions with one another. Kaze no Stigma wasn't character driven since it had a main overall plot line, but had a well balance between the two main categories. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series well, I recommend it to any who are into the supernatural/romance/drama/action genres, or who have seen anime such as: Code Geass (both seasons), Hataraku Maou-Sama!, or Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou (although Damilou's plot development is awful, way too rushed.) \\n\\n\r\nHave fun,\\n\r\nNebarto\\n\\n\r\nStory:7\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\nOverall:7 (Good)",

Not  only did they have the  voice  actor  matching the roles   spot  on , the voice  acting  was professionally well  done and of the highest quality.The  fact  i didn't rush to hear  the  subbed version  speaks  volumes in and of   its self.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion ,  - yes this is really worth your while , and no  you will not be disappointed",

The second they met I instantly started wanting them to be together, I have never wanted two anime characters to be together this much since Bleach when Orihime promised Tatsuki that she would come back to her... *Cough cough* Moving on...\r\nThe second reason is because of Kazuma's attitude during the entire anime (Other than one part in the last couple of episodes) He is so calm, cool, and collected and always seems to know what's going on. Well except when he see's hisfather, which brings us on to reason number three.\\n\\n\r\nReason three is the relationship between Kazuma and his \"Old man.\" Seeing as his father is the one who kicked him out of the family in the first place, it's only natural that Kazuma would be angry. But you soon find out that not only is Kazuma angry, he also wan't to surpass him and will try to fight his father every time they see each other , you'll figure that out in the spa episode :)\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this isn't a solid ten is because of the lack of season two. I know that Takahiro Yamato (Author of Kaze No Stigma) passed away and I was very upset when I found that out, but I do wish that they would at least end the anime with something more...Endyer?\\n\\n\r\nIt's not my top concern, because I was okay with how it ended, but many people don't watch Kaze No Stigma, solely on the fact that the story is not finished. But I highly recommend seeing this anime despite the loose ending. This really is a fantastic anime :)",

The art and story are good, but I don't care about that in this anime.\r\nFirst character, and my personal favorite, is Yagami Kazuma, why? Well, that is simple, because he is kinda an asshole, like me. Kazuma seems to hate everyone, except his ex-brother (Is that really what it would be called?) Ren, his ex-cousin Ayano, and some chick named Tsui Ling(although, to my dismay, he doesn't actually hate everyone else). His ability to pisspeople off into throwing the first punch then opening i giant can off whoop ass with their face while constantly maintaining composer makes him a bad-ass.\\n\\n\r\nNext Character! one I don't really like, Kannagi Ren. He seems to by a little whiny, dosn't he? anyway, he is a direct descendent of the head Kannagi line. he fits the description \"obsessed sibling\" quite well. Other than that, he has no real traits.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Kannagi Ayano. This one I like, why? Well, she isn't like Kazuma, but she is similar. how similar? Ok, I lied, she is not similar, she has less control over her temper, and she quickly resorts to violence, sounds like my last girlfiend, *cough* sorry, I mean girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nnow, for those of you who HAVE to see the rest of the review, the story is a little used but it is still good, the art is good bit it could easily have been better, the OP is terrible and the end song is ok, happy?\\n\\n\r\nwell, there you go, the harem king... sorry, that is someone else's line.\\n\r\n The asshole report is over, don't cry to much about it, I don' want to have to swim to my computer.",

The plot line for me grew stronger and better. I believe I finish this series in 3 days. What I liked about this show is the main character Kazuma because of what he went through growing up and who he became as an adult. Made me appreciate this character and think that no matter if your different and not able to be what your suppose to be you can find your way if youset your mind to it and be better than you expected. So in a way I got something out of it. All the characters in this show are amazing( maybe not so much Ayano) I have to say she was quite annoying. But I liked her to I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo I recommend to watch this show if you haven't maybe you will enjoy or maybe you wont. And if you have well I'm sure you enjoyed it as well as I.

            "content": "If you were abandoned by your father for not being strong enough, would you give up? Or would you fight back?\r\nKaze no Stigma is a story about the heir of the legendary Kannagi's, who are well known throughout the world for being the most powerful fire-type mages in the world, due to their ancestor becoming a contractor one of the great 4 spirits, obviously the one of fire. However, Kazuma Kannagi lacks the ability for fire-type magic. His father expels him from the family, telling him to never return. \r\n4 Years later, Kazuma returns as one of the most powerful wind mages to ever roamthe land. I can't go much deeper without spoilers, but the plot is extremely well done.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10: If you read the above, you probably think you can see what's going to happen in the anime. However, there are many greater in-depth stories within the story, including what happened within the last 4 years that drove Kazuma to become the badass he is. Definitively a strong point in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art isnt horrible.  However, there is one picture that constantly shows up every episode after the \"commercial\" that I absolutely hate, as it's shown every time one of the main characters pulls out her sword. Otherwise, the anime is very well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The op for this anime never changes throughout the entire run, which is disappointing since it is a 24 episode anime. However, the sound effects are well done, and the music in the anime itself accompanies whats going on very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Some major character development, but only for about 2 characters, and maybe even 3. The growth that goes on in the anime is outstanding, and the characters end up completely changed at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: Maybe it was because I was watching it at 2 am, but the anime doesn't really stick to me, except toward the end, where Kazuma's missing years are explained (kinda). However, it kept me watching until the very end, which is a plus, considering I drop a lot of anime within a few days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: Overall it's decently well done, but a few shortcomings bring it down to an 8. However, if you enjoy strong main protagonists and requited  love, then this is a great anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nReview #3",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma, or Stigma of the wind in english. A series that's popular but doesn't have much positive reviews. And for that reason, it intrigued me.\r\nStory : 7\r\nThe story is about a clan named Kannagi clan. They're knows as Fujutsushis(a clan that specializes in using fire techniques.). Kannagi Kazuma one of our main protagonist is one of the first-born child in the clan, therefore he has the chance to be the next clan leader. But he doesn't have the ability to use any kind of fire techniques and was beaten by Kannagi Ayano on a duel determining who would be the next clan leader.So, Kazuma's scumbag father banished him from the clan because of his failure. He made him leave the Kannagi household, and told him not to set foot on the Kannagi household anymore. And after four years, Kazuma who was weak became a strong Fujutsushi(a wind user). He came back to Japan to take revenge on what the Kannagis have done to him. So that's basically what happened on the first couple of episodes, don't want to end up telling the whole story on you. Its not that quite original though, since a lot of shounen series were focused on things like revenge or some sort.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nDecent art. Major characters were drawn pretty. Although some scenes were quite messy. Backgrounds are well drawn too. Action scenes were quite good too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nKannagi Kazuma, a greedy-womanizing-arrogant-bastard-asshole character. NOT! Well half of it was true, I said that because I kinda envy this guy. I mean he has the looks, the power, the girls(?). Too bad he's just a fictional character! Eat that you piece of s*** character! Oh sorry, got a little bit off topic there. Well, kidding aside. Kannagi Kazuma is an arrogant guy, and he can be quite greedy at some point in the series. Kannagi Ayano, Shana in disguise. Just kidding, but yeah, she does quite resemble Shana a lot. Since she uses a fire sword, wears her school uniform pretty much all the time, and she has a little bit of a tsun-tsun side on her. And finally Kannagi Ren, Kazuma's lil' bro. He looks like your submissive little brother who's a lot cute. In short, a shoutacon's fantasy. These three are your main guys in the story. I'd say the characters are pretty good. Minor characters were somewhat good too. Even though they're just minor characters they had they're own personalities, making them stand out on certain scenarios.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nIn 24 episodes, I enjoyed it. But not that much, there were episodes that shouldn't have been added. I think I'd enjoy it more if they'd made the series shorter, like 13 episodes. If they only made 13 episodes. They'd be able to focus on the main plot a lot more. Well that's my opinion though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7\\n\r\nKaze no Stigma, I sure hoped it was shorter than 24 episodes. A lot of unnecesary episodes were added to the series. But its totally not that unnecesary though. Its just that, I think they added those episodes to prolong the airing of the series. Because most of it didn't have any relation to what's going to happen later on the show. And I thought this series won't have any fanseevice at all. It does have! And there were quite a lot too. But! Stop your fapping hand! This ain't To-love-ru or Sekirei! Kaze no Stigma certainly had fanservice, but for a guy like me? Quite frankly it didn't have any effect at all. It was like seeing Barbie on her undies. Or maybe it really wasn't fanservice? Because fighting monsters wearing mini skirt will totally unveil the piece of cloth under it, right? Well anyway. They didn't put a lot of effort drawing undies, since the show is not about pervertedness. All in all, Kaze no Stigma is watchable, and quite enjoyable too. I bet they were planning to make a sequel on this one. And I sure do hope that if they make a sequel on Kaze no Stigma, it'll be a lot better than this one.",

            "content": "Story: The story is pretty simple. There's a boy, Kazuma, who was banished from his family because he couldn't possess the ability to use fire. When he returns as an adult, he has learned the wind element, which is supposed to bring shame, but doesn't with the family's head, his cousin's father. The cousin, Ayano, defeated Kazuma in a battle as children to see which one will be the future head of the family. And to her, possessing another element under the family name is a disgrace. However, Kazuma's little brother, Ren, looks up to him, so she can't hate Kazuma that much. With thesethree, it's up to them to keep the world at peace. Okay, the plot is not that creative, but like Devil is a Part-Timer, it is cut short and the manga is supposed to be longer. I will say that the plot points will make you cry and shiver because it does get intense. I can't rate it too harshly, so I'll go with 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The fighting scenes are pretty cool, but that's all the art does for me. It's pretty generic shojo art mixed in with fantasy. I mean the character designs are pretty good, but nothing really stands out at all except for the fighting moves and such, which was the design of the story. I guess the scenery's really pretty, but that's it. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: You have no idea how much I love the opening to this. It's a pretty riveting song, and it fits with the theme of the show very well. However, my favorite song from this anime has to be the third anime. Without spoiling the show, let's just say that I'm a sucker for sad songs, and the anime does get really sad at one point. The other endings are pretty good, too. The music is done really well in this anime. 10/10 for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'll admit that the characters are the weaker ones except for a few. My personal favorites are Ren and his girlfriend, Ayumi (who you will meet later in the series). Ren is the adorable sidekick, but he can actually kick ass when he has to. Ayumi is the sweet girl who will do anything for the people she loves, and her backstory will make you cry. Kazuma is a pretty decent character, but he's your god character who really doesn't lose a fight, and he gets pretty dull at times. Ayano is your bitch. She probably improves in the manga, but there's nothing appealing about her except for the fact that she hates Kazuma. Uh, personality check? The side characters are pretty decent; I have no complaints about them. So 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There were certain arcs of the show I really enjoyed and others that I didn't. Expect a few filler episodes here and there. They are mostly Ayano's father's attempts to get her and Kazuma to kiss, and you know what's gonna happen...(seriously, guess what happens). I promise it's not all boring, but it does lag a little at certain points in the show. I would rate this part 7/10 because of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Like Devil is a Part-Timer, if you have read the manga before this, you would most likely not enjoy this anime. If do you end up watching this, read the manga afterwards. It's most likely a lot better than this. Only watch the dub if you wanna hear Kazuma and Ren's voices. Ayano's gets very annoying, but it doesn't ruin the anime too badly. With that said, I would round this up to 8/10.",

It had just the right amount of modern problems as well as magical ones. I love the chemistry that Ayano and Kazuma had between each other. It was obvious by the end of the last episode that more were supposed to be created.\r\nStory: overall very good. Almost all of the fighting scenes gave me chills and I've watched it twice!

In fact, the only let-down feeling is that it was only made up to 24 episodes. \r\nI think  this anime is quite underrated by the top anime list on this site. It rates a 7.68 only, if Irecall correctly. Honestly, I have enjoyed it more than a lot of anime  rating above an 8.5.

            "content": "Kaze No Stigma is enjoyable, it really is. It has a good balance of humor and action, plus the setting of the story is quite intriguing and unique. Problem is its nothing out of the ordinary, its mediocre in almost every way. Its nothing bad , however it doesn't revolutionize anything either; it follows a good equation, but it doesn't do anything to make it its own.\r\nStory (7):\r\nWell its decent, nothing bland or controversial. You can't hate it and you usually would want to find out what happens next in the story arc, but its nothing besides find bad guy, kill bad guy, one linerat the end. The story consists of 'arcs' or 'cases' that take place in a few episodes, discounting the filler episodes which only take up 1 episode. The cases are given an interesting setting and challenge in the beginning of each arc, however it follows the same equation and so the story ends up falling a bit flat.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nIts pretty, enough said. They do it well, however this fact is only for the main characters and for people you might actually remember or like in the show. Small time villains and everything else are somewhat blurry or created in this weird fish-faced manner.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7):\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending songs are decent, they're nothing to dance to or party with, but it doesn't make your ears bleed or create desires to go and grind your head on a concrete wall either. However some of the voice acting is actually quite nice and the rest of the cast don't sound too annoying either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6):\\n\r\nMost of them are bland, except for the 3 main ones, however they don't develop too much out of their original character at the beginning of the series. They mostly become much braver, stronger or go crazy, like in most action series. An exception would be Kazuma, who is actually one of the more relate-able people in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a decent series to look into, if you're looking for something that isn't too thought provoking or just looking for mindless fun, this is a nice little series to look into. However if you're looking for deeper meanings and the answers to the secrets of life, you'll probably find two lessons that might fit into that criteria in this anime and in other words please look somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nProfessional score: 7\\n\r\nPersonal score: 8",

            "content": "Kaze no stigma is one of those action, romantic, comedic animes with a semi-cliche plot, but makes up in terms of its execution and character personalities. Perhaps one of the more defining elements of this anime is you have a solid male protagonist and a relatively useless female protagonist, which seems to be a bit rarer in animes nowadays (where the male protagonist is usually tossed around/dominated by the heroine). Anyways, to the more detailed review:\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe whole series kind of flows in a U (high action beginning, decent end). You have an really solid beginning, perhaps the amongst best introduction arc I have seenin action animes. The first episode alone establishes the setting, character relationships, character personalities, abilities and context of the story. Then some would argue that the anime kind of slumps with \"filler\" arcs, but really, for only 24 episodes, the middle arcs are rather amusing and adds to the comedy of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is top notch. The characters are hot, the scenery is well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music is decent all in all, but nothing particularly appealed to me. The soundtracks for this anime is not what made this anime stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime stands out. Kazuma is one of your most badass male protagonists in all of action animes. He is not your standard knight in shiny armor as in many action series, nor does he allow himself to be knocked around as in many other action series; he is blunt, cold, cool, and has an overall won't-back-down, doesn't-give-a-damn, but \"will save everything because I can\" attitude. Ayano, on the other hand, is a tough cookie, but in comparison she definitely doesn't steal the spotlight as much. As amusing as she is at times, she has her own personality (fiery and short tempered, but means well). In combination with all the character relationships established early on, Kaze no Stigma has a fairly entertaining cast to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI have seen this anime 2.5 times over because it is very amusing and easy to get into (especially because of its stellar introduction arcs). It is short enough to have a high rewatch value and long enough to continually be entertaining.\\n\r\nAlthough not perfect, I would strongly recommend this anime to anyone who likes a tad of romantic comedy in their action genres, and to anyone who is tired of the TRITE-3 that so many modern animes fall into - a useless male protagonist, a dominating heroine, and a school setting, because kaze no stigma opposes all 3 of those.",

But with 24 episodes, some story arcs were rushed or the ending was not satisfying enough. I was left somewhat frustrated or wanting more in some of the endings. \r\nThen there are the backstories, there is not enough of it. Lots of explanations that needed to be there to clear up any confusion. i.e. What Kazuma actually do in his exile period? (other than him acquiring some power). \r\nArt:\r\nThe monsters and minions used in here look good. Though some scenes justlooked very awkward. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kazuma, is competent and able to compose himself in what would be stressful situations. (well until someone connected to his past comes along). And he does lose his cool sometimes and goes all out rage mode. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main protagonist, Ayano, completely the opposite. She's a hot headed (quite literally as well) rocket that could pop at any time. Though she is able to occasionally become competent and able to think of a strategy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, the story was interesting enough for me to forgive the writers for hacking the story a bit to fit it into the 24 episode constraint. And was satisfied with the open-ended ending. \\n\\n\r\nI'm prepared to re-watch this in the future once I have read the source. (light novels).",

The art is fancy considering the time it came out, and the soundtracks are verry enjoyable. However, the story development over all is complete trash because of certain protagonists that kinda hinder the you from experiencing the MC going through a crisis, just because the studio tried to pack this into one singleepisode. I dont recommend this anime, except you're like completely into tsundere romances. \\n\\n",

I thought they were almost all well thought out. I enjoyed it! every single episode n_n so i give that a 10. and overall i would have gavin it a freaking100 but the highest was a 10 n_n I loved it!!! I would recomend it to anyone who likes the story plot where theres an underdog and the underdog turns powerful and is no longer much of an under dog. its nothing like Naruto >_> so DO NOT compare it hahahah. Hmm also i recomend if you liked Darker Than Black n_n even though its not really much similar i feel that the action sequences are both outstanding in either of them. Well.... i guess thats all i can think about this. I definitely would recommend it. And if you're thinking about watching don't just stop 1st episode. you have to at least watch 3 n_n that's when i was hooked. Let me end this by saying \"It was so good that when it was over, I was wishing there were more than 24 episodes.\" n_n\\n\r\n-Vixen-",

All except for her cousin, Kazuma. After he was defeated by Ayano, his father banish him from the house in disgrace. Kazuma runs off and changes his surname to Yagami. He forms a contract with the spirit of wind and becomes a powerful wind user. 4 years later, he returns.\r\nPersonal Opinion\r\nSo the promotional picture for this anime shows a girls with fire red hair andeyes and holding a sword that's ablaze... hmm i wonder if that sounds familiar... *coughShanacough*\\n\r\nOh well... so i decided to watch this series on a whim... it was getting decent reviews and since i liked Shana, it seemed like a logical choice of anime.  Indeed the first few episodes were quite engrossing. It had some great animation (especially when Kazuma was using his wind mage powers). However... by episode 12-13, it got quite slow. 4-5 episodes were solely on attempting to advance the relationship btw Kazuma and Ayano... and they got nowhere. The final arc had a really good idea... but poor execution. The ending was a cliffhanger of sorts, so it's likely that this isn't the last we see of Kaze no Stigma.\\n\r\nOverall... this is a show that you can watch and forget. Be in awe of the animation... but not care about the characters\\n\\n\r\nAlso... what's up w/ japan and having cousins fall in love w/ each other.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n-Bleach\\n\r\nFlashy fights... taking hits that would normally kill you\\n\\n\r\n-Busou Renkin\\n\r\nSame as Bleach\\n\\n\r\n- Shakugan no Shana\\n\r\nLead girl is fire sword wielding warrior.

            "content": "Hmmmmmm! All I can say is that I'm not all too entirely impressed with this series. Maybe because I made the mistake of reading some reviews before I actually watched the series, which created expectations....not that I expected this series to be THAT much beyond mediocre. But besides the attractive characters, special F/X and the fanservice there was still a very crucial ingredient missing: a good story.\r\n~Art\r\nI love the art....as usual. This is always the way I get suckered into watching anime. I love clean lines and bright colors with attractive characters. This show does not disappoint in this regard....the special F/X are moderate.\r\n~Sound\r\nMost ofthe songs are terrible. \"Tsuki Hana no Inori\" the ending song for episode 12, wasn't too bad....but I still didn't like it. The reason being, it's so very obvious that they were trying to get viewers to cry and be moved with all of these feelings, I think that was a cheap tactic on their part and so I don't like it. I don't like being emotionally manipulated...especially when it's so blatantly obvious. \\n\r\nI watched the show in English dub, and I was happy with the work that was done. No one's voice was mismatched or annoying.\\n\\n\r\n~Story\\n\r\nThere really wasn't a story here. I don't know if they're using a manga or light novel as the foundation for this anime but if they are then it was either a terrible manga or this is one horrible adaptation. This story did not properly blend the dramatic and comedic elements well, one minute the mood seems tense and serious with some pretty strong and violent scenes but then it become humorous and plain wacky.....then it gets serious again. \\n\r\nThere were SOME good parts, some pretty good dramatic parts near the end but everything  was just so very predictable and that really hurt the value of the story. Also to me, a lot of the times just seemed like lame reasons to pair up the two main characters and that whole [I hate you \u2014 but I secretly like you] thing was a pretty transparent and tired way to go about defining their relationship, what was the point of it exactly? I'm not super crazy about the fanservice either, I understand it exists and there are an overwhelming majority of viewers out there that love it...so I understand WHY it exists, but it would be more tolerable if there were realistic reasons why the girl's outfit always gets shredded and not the guy's. Like, really, the excessive panty shots and that school uniform got on my nerves. \\n\r\nHonestly, they could have made this one of those 12 episode animes or a full-feature movie/OAV and that would have been great.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters\\n\r\nThe characters a pretty nice looking, but I don't think they were developed well. For example, who are the Kannagis? They seem to have a feudal mentality and operate on that feudal level but the story clearly seems to take place in more recent times. So what do they do for a living? And how are they rich? They don't look like the corporate type so are they just some \u201cGhost Hunter\u201d family? \\n\r\nKazuma's relationship with his father is one of those things that's confusing, one minute it's supposed to be this tense and volatile relationship...then the next minute it's kinda comical. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think the principal characters were developed [for the most part], with Kazuma being the best developed character. His story and personality seems to line up correctly, given his personal background, it makes sense for him to be somewhat reserved, brooding and distant from people. \\n\r\nBut Ayano I'm not too crazy about, she suffers from the \u201crandomly angry girl syndrome\u201d there's an official name for these types of anime girls....but I forgot. The point is that her entire personality is a clich\u00e9. Some might argue that it's necessary to be a hot-head to use fire power...but then, explain Ren? He's way more level-headed then Ayano and his powers seem to pack quite a wallop. Which is why I like Ren and Kazuma, they seem logical....Ayano, not so much. \\n\r\nThe majority of the supporting cast are just too random [by random I mean to say their personalities are VERY predictable, but they just seem show up at random just to be an adversary for the main characters], the Tsuwabuki Family [the earth family] were the worst perpetrators. It baffles me how Mayumi was so very repulsed by Ayumi and contributed to her frequent abuse, yet she offers up a feeble apology [after all this hatred and abuse] as she lay dying.....ridiculous! The eldest brunette sister, was just randomly evil and died just as randomly.....she was just there to basically be the villainess for that chapter.\\n\\n\r\n~Verdict\\n\r\nThis is a good anime to watch if you are new to anime and have nothing to compare it against or you are graduating from the DIGIMON-kiddie-type genre. But Kaze no Stigma is still Anime for Dummies. This anime gets a \u201c5\u201d because I did like the art and the English dub.",

            "content": "As said, Kaze no Stigma had potential but upon rewatching I was disappointed.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt was decent. Had potential at the beginning- royal families with corresponding powers, distinguishing class and making it a plot point, that all was fine and dandy if more had happened with it. I didn't feel like there was anywhere the plot was GOING, though. Kazuma comes back, big disruption, great and all- and then it's just this I-hate-you romance story that I've never been able to really GET, especially because there's this constant division in Ayano's feelings towards him.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nFor 2007, pretty good. The characters looked great, although I ALWAYS hatereused animations, especially when there aren't even minor edits for the scene. Very vibrant, though at the beginning I was surprised by the paleness of the characters' skin.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nDon't remember anything memorable as far as soundtrack goes. In the dub, I didn't like Ayano or Ren's voice much, although Ren's seemed to match his character, so to each his own and such and such. But Ayano's seemed to have some hidden Southern quality or something that came out every now and then (like when she wailed \"Kazumaaaa!\") Haven't seen the sub so I have nothing to compare them to, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI really wish there had been more development, at least for the two mainies. You got the general feel for each- Kazuma's the cool, collected hottie outcast and Ayano is...whiny. Annoying. \"Cute.\" (I have bias towards cutesy types though, so again, to each his own.) Geezer dad's intentions were kind of skewed to me- it's obvious he wants those two to get together, but I never understood WHY. Although the whole \"lost lover\" thing helps you understand Kazuma more, it's SO generic and still leaves him, like the rest, a pretty shallow figure. And as for Ren, I hated him from the moment I laid eyes on him, but I'm not the pretty-boy type.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'll be brief- I liked it at the time because I could have used some angsty romantic nonsense. I couldn't even get through the first episode after I straightened out/slapped myself. Holds your attention if you like this kind of genre. At least the ending was satisfactory, more or less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, it was a good shot. Other people might appreciate more, but I ended up not liking this that much. It could have actually been a little bit shorter to cut out the unnecessary chunks. If this was only 12 episodes, that alone would have raised it to an 8 for me.",

Because I was so vehemently disappointed with the animu industry's inability to make likeable male leads, and I was so sick of the US anime licensing companies' promoting (i.e. lying in order to sell crap to everyone).\r\nThe only reason I'm starting to watch this again? Someone over at 4chan's /a/, along with pictures to back it up, having a nasty tirade against Kazuma Yagami and the fact that he's not just like every other animu male lead.\r\nI WILL agree that Kazuma comes off as a gr... I take it back.\r\nI, too, would wannabe \"powerful\" enough to kick every other douche-bag's ass. But human beings are funny (as noted in Chromeshelled Regios); they don't wanna pay for their past douche-bag-ism. In fact, the effects are negative; they want more \"power\" so they can come back and kick YOUR ass.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Spiderman's Peter Parker being told by his uncle that with great power comes great responsibility. So of course, you kick everybody's ass and they expect you to save the day. ^_^;\\n\\n\r\nKazuma's the anti-thesis of what you expect from every current animu male lead. He's straightforward, strong, unwilling to put up with $#17, and still has a heart despite being a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nAyano, on the other hand, is yet another cliched tsundere who'd do great if the male lead's a luckless pansy. Unfortunately for her, Kazuma's NOT a luckless pansy; hence she ends up becoming the nice-looking butt of the physical slapstick comedy. (Major kudos to Cherami Leigh for her work voicing her.)\\n\\n\r\nRen's the \"Larry\" of the trio; having enough power to hold his own... but always on the sidelines crying when the KazAya banter commences.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are NOT good (because \"who wants to watch a show about a shounen lead indiscriminately kicking ass?\"). But atleast it's not upskirt panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes. Pardon me for taking so long to come back to this show. It's just... The tons of pansy-ass-ness I'm seeing from the lot of shounen in the lot of animu today... I nearly lost all hope.",

            "content": "Kaze no Stigma is pretty average series. It starts us off by introducing us to the illustrious Kannagi family, a highly respected mage family renowned for hunting youma and other demons. Kazuma, one of our protagonists, is the so called \"black sheep\" of the family and has made a return to Japan after four years abroad.\r\nWe soon learn Kazuma is a \"black sheep\" because he can't use fire magic well, which is what the Kannagi clan are known for. He left Japan, apparently, to study wind magic. This brings up the pointed question, is it really valid to be considered a stain on your family'shonour when your only crime is incompetence?\\n\\n\r\nWe meet a few other main characters as well and the series does a fairly good job in fleshing them out; not much in terms of character development for most of the cast though. Kazuma starts out hating his old family but then out of the blue he seems mostly ambivalent. \\n\\n\r\nAyano, another protagonist, maintains her tsundere veneer throughout the series and doesn't really go anywhere with her character, unfortunately. It would have been nice to see her come to grips with her emotions and learn her fire magic a bit better, or at least something to give her a little more depth. That aside, her character is pretty valuable to the story and you can get a good laugh or two out of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe front half of the series gives a kind of \"monster-of-the-week\" feel as we go from one episode to the next and there isn't really an important continuity. Ayano's father, the head of the family, seeks to bring Kazuma back into the Kannagi family before it's \"too late\" but we're never given an explanation why he's so important, especially if he can't use fire magic. In order to bring Kazuma back, he plays matchmaker for Kazuma and Ayano. It's a little out of place given some family circumstances, but it's done really well and is a nice light hearted approach to a series that has potential for a darker tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is where we run into the main plot. The story gets notably darker here and laughs are fewer and far between. People around Japan are acquiring magic powers somehow, and it's up to the heroes to find out how and stop it. Not giving it away, but how they get these powers is pretty silly and feels very tacked on, like they couldn't find a better way to have this happen and keep it original. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good and you can tell they put quite a bit of effort into it, especially given the year it came out. Atleast as far as the female cast. Most of the designs for the female characters are much more appealing and colourful than for the male cast, who by and large appear very boring.\\n\\n\r\n The sound is nothing special, but the english dub has a very strong voice cast. Cherami Leigh as Ayano can get a bit grating after a while, but she adds a very nice attitude to Ayano's tsundere characterization. Robert McCollum gives Kazuma a kind of new yorker/boston accent which works very well and helps the character come across as the cool, collected type he is, while still giving a flavour of young punk.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is strongest in the first half of the series but is still just fine for the second half. The series may have been better if it had been shorter, as there is little character development. All in all a very average entry for the magic/supernatural/fantasy. You won't miss anything by skipping it. Watch something like Shakugan no Shana instead.",
