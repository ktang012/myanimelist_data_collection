            "content": "Another was one of those series which had me waiting eagerly for Mondays to arrive and wishing that the weekend would end sooner. For twelve weeks, it was my priority above all else to watch this amazing series, and to be honest, I'm already awaiting the release of the OVA in May. If I had to say what makes it so incredible, I would cite the short series length, the clever plot with a brilliant resolution, and outstanding animation as the main contributing factors, although the promise of blood will probably be enough for most people to decide whether this show is for them ornot. Although the violence means that this is not for the faint of heart (or weak of stomach), I would nevertheless wholeheartedly recommend watching it, as it is well worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHave you heard of Tantalus? (No, a knowledge of Greek mythology is not essential to watch Another, I am simply at my wits' end with trying to describe the story without giving anything away). Tantalus was a man condemned by the gods to eternity in the underworld, immersed to the neck in a pool of water which he could not drink from, and underneath a tree laden with fruit which he could not reach, no matter how hard he tried. Now, if this is not too swift and broad a leap, this is how the storyline of Another will make you feel; every time you seem to be tantalisingly close to the answer, a new development occurs, and you have to start all over again. This series never goes where you expect it to, but it manages this without being a particularly complicated story, which is quite an achievement. I've read and watched many mystery stories, and I have found that nothing ruins the story more than confusion caused by an overloaded storyline and a huge ensemble of characters. Here, it is simple: one tightly-written, carefully thought out storyline involving a relatively small number of characters, which proves surprisingly durable as a twelve episode series, having avoided the trap of the same cliff-hanger ending every time; they always manage to throw in a new and interesting variation. The resolution of the storyline was amazing; it managed to bring all the strands of information which we had gleaned and wrap everything up in a style which was paced exactly right; fast, but not hurried or rushed. I certainly didn't see the final twist coming- not many people did- but it was masterful. It was also the most emotional moment of the series; even those of you who have laughed like maniacs throughout the entire series will suddenly become sombre during the final five minutes. Being mindful of the strict limits on what I can actually say about its specifics, I shall merely say that it was a perfect ending to a brilliant series.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply beautiful. This might actually be quite near the top in terms of the best series I have ever seen art-wise. The characters aren't that different from any other series, but the backgrounds are amazingly well defined; they really are just bliss to watch. The art mostly depicts death, lots and lots of death, with some dismemberment and impending doom thrown in. In almost every scene, there's a sense of decay, everything looks decrepit and rusty, the buildings look deserted, and there's gratuitous use of deep, dark reds wherever possible. If it's outdoors, there are crows perched on the roofs, looking hungry. If it's indoors, like the hospital, then the lights are dim and flickering occasionally (and for the provision of information to those who have watched the hospital scenes and noticed the missing fourth floor, it's because four in Japanese is either 'shi' or 'yon', depending on the context, and 'shi' can also mean 'death', so they tend to avoid using four when numbering things, like we do with thirteen. Right, fun fact session over). The use of dolls, often missing limbs, is prevalent (whether they're scary or hilarious just depends on the viewer) and appears to have more significance to the storyline than I originally thought. And every so often, in case you haven't got the message, there's a split-second image of a blood-stained knife which is lying on the floor. I mean, what could possibly happen next? (This was intentionally ironic. For those of you who don't get irony, just assume that this means it was hilarious). To sum up, the art sets up the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we can't leave out the sound, as this is key (bad musical pun; I apologise) to the aforementioned atmosphere. From the start, the music creates a sense of eeriness, from simple melodies to electronic effects and string sections. As difficult as it is to describe, I would like you to imagine a full orchestra having a psychedelic freakout (think of that section of A Day in the Life) with a hair-raising selection of electronic hums and whines added, and then multiply that by about ten. That's about what it's like (or as best as I can put it into words). The music never quite goes away, unlike in other, lighter series; it drops right down to a few notes on a piano, but still gives you the sense that something's always just about to happen. The opening has some weird and unsettling vocal melodies going on, creating tension, stress, and suspense. But after a few episodes, I'll express a preference for the ending theme; it proves that strong vocals and a few chords on a piano are more effective than the aural blitzkrieg which we are usually subjected to, and it brings a sense of peace and serenity to the end of the episode.  Basically, the soundtrack works perfectly with what's on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters; obviously, we know very little about any of them right up until the end, otherwise it wouldn't be a mystery, would it? They're all quite weird and unusual, and they're all either ruthlessly blunt or very obviously trying to avoid certain topics of conversation. As you can imagine, this makes the dialogue quite awkward. Kouichi Sakakibara, our horror story loving main character, seems to have more than half a clue what's going on, which makes a nice change from the average clueless/in denial character in the horror genre. Although it cannot be denied that he is of that genus most favoured by scriptwriters lacking inspiration, the transfer student, he does actually get some background to why he transferred. Mei Misaki develops a bit from the 'weird loner' presented in the first episode to someone who is frustrated by their situation and yet cannot change it. While near-silent and emotionless girls seem to be very common at the moment, I can promise that there is more to Mei than being a mere tribute to consumer demand. If you have watched only a few episodes, she might seem a bizarre person, but she becomes more understandable as the series progresses. Izumi Akazawa, the class representative, is blunt to the point of being rude, but is quite the deceiver and manipulator behind the scenes, as it later turns out. Reiko, who was at first glance a stereotypical 'ridiculously youthful, kind and caring female relative', turns out to have quite a temper, and appears to have a few secrets. In a sentence: don't judge them too soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me (and it's quite likely if you are indeed reading this sentence), I recommend you go and watch Another now. It's only a few hours out of your spare time and you really have nothing to lose except a night's sleep if you are easily scared. If you are going to watch it, I can recommend watching it at midnight, it's surprisingly good fun (if your idea of 'fun' is the same as mine, that is). Personally, I reckon that from a fairly dull season, Another will come to shine as easily the best new release this season, and possibly one of the better of the year. \\n\\n\r\n(Author's note: I started writing reviews because decently written reviews with no spelling or grammatical errors are almost non-existent on MAL, as very few people can be bothered with such trivialities these days, and this desperately needs redressing. While many people aren't with me on this, I believe that a review is not worth reading unless it is well written, and so I have put quite a lot of effort into writing this without making it too formal or verbose, whilst avoiding flippancy, in order to inform and entertain the people in the audience who are on my wavelength. My apologies if you are not one of those people. If you do have some constructive criticism to make, PM me or just post a comment, I'm quite happy to take it under consideration when editing this. And on that note, good night!).\\n",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nWhen it comes to anime, the horror genre is a tricky one. A fatal flaw arises right from the beginning, as each person has their own definition of horror depending on how imaginative they might be. While some may immediately think of a bunch of gruesome killings, others may think of more eerie supernatural events, and the list goes on, but because of this, the genre has a high chance of failure depending on each person's perception of horror.\r\nUnfortunately, Another just happens to fall way outside my definition of horror, and seems to fit very nicely within comedy.\r\nBut hold on asecond, this anime isn't just a horror, it's also supposed to be a mystery as well. Every year we're usually greeted with at least one mystery anime per season that I only consider mystery simply because that's what they are labeled. This is because, more often than not, anime that are supposed to be predominantly mystery, surprise, have no mystery to speak of in them, and Another is no different.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, well, saying there is absolutely no mystery might be a bit of an exaggeration, but can you really consider Another a mystery? When you get down to it, it was ultimately about finding out who the \"Another\" was so that they may be able to stop the curse that has been running rampant for 26 years. The problem with this is that for the first four episodes, it was all about Kouichi figuring out who Mei was, seeing as she had the same name as the girl who died 26 years ago, which is what people believe started the curse in the first place. So when we figure out that she is just a normal girl, everything up until this point felt like nothing more than another useless time sink.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where it gets into episodes that are completely wasted in favor of cheap shock value to try and keep the viewer hooked. Until episode 10, what did they actually learn about the Another? Nothing of any value. Where's the mystery in that? I don't find random deaths to be mysterious or horrifying in any way, and this is what the series focused on the entire time. One could argue that this narrowed down the possible suspects, but the characters did nothing with this. Even though they might have not been able to do anything to stop the curse, they could've at least devoted more time to actually trying to figure out who the Another is rather than waste time with other daily activities.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire series, there were only two episodes that truly served any purpose, one of which was the beach episode. Now, where would any anime be without a beach episode? It's practically mandatory these days, however, it wouldn't be Another without a token death scene in almost every episode now would it? The only good thing this episode did was provide us with one of the bigger clues, which made it very easy to figure out who the Another might be, as it proved that deaths could happen outside of Yomiyama. Meaning that the Another had to be on the trip. The only problem is that the explanation they gave in the next episode made any speculation as to who the Another was entirely useless. It was said that the person who died actually had gotten a brain injury while still in Yomiyama, and would've died later that day regardless of him being run over and torn to shreds by a boat on the beach. With this, it was practically back to square one since you wouldn't know whether or not the information given could be trusted or not. Although, any good mystery relies on misdirection, and this is one thing I can credit Another for at times, as it did try to send you down a wrong path or two as the series progressed, but this small aspect alone doesn't make up for how horribly executed everything else was.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other episode that had any purpose was episode 9, and regardless of it being the most frustrating one, it did provide some crucial information. As the events played out, Kouichi and his band of half-wits found a tape telling them how to stop the curse from continuing. Now, here comes the frustrating part, one of the geniuses amongst the group had the brilliant idea of ripping the tape out of the tape player to stop it from playing, instead of simply pressing the pause or stop button. You seriously have to invent an entirely new level of imbecile to describe something so moronic. Considering the current standards for incompetence in modern society have set the bar so ludicrously low, this newly discovered form of stupidity deserves some kind of fucking award. The author clearly was looking for an easy out so that they could extend the series just a bit longer, which resulted in the wonder that is the final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing that was the ultimate \"Fuck you\" to all of the viewers. More so than the whole tape fiasco in episode nine, and that's Misaki Mei. Not only did they try to make her seem far\u00a0more important than she was for the first half of the series, but, in one of the worst reveals I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing, they confirm that she was able to tell who the Another was from the very beginning. So with this, anything of relevance that happened in all of the previous episodes was for naught, and that's just absurd. She could have at least tried to speak out and tell the other students that she knew who the Another was, and before you say they wouldn't believe her, take a second to think about this. All of these morons in Class 3 believed in a completely nonsensical curse that was nothing more than superstition until it was proven to be true in the final episode. Yes, nothing could've been done regardless if she told someone or not, but due to the fact that she actually knew the entire time, the mystery was already technically solved since the beginning. It was only a matter of figuring out how to get rid of the Another, which took seven episodes of cheap deaths, one episode to figure out how to stop the curse, one episode of half the class dying and/or killing each other, and half of the final episode to reveal and kill the Another.\\n\\n\r\nAm I the only one who sees a problem here? There was no actual deducting or piecing together of the puzzle. All Mei had to do was convince Kouichi that his aunt was the Another (which went over far too easily by the way), and it was over. I'm not saying that all the deaths could've been avoided, but I'll be damned if Mei isn't partially to blame for sitting around doing all of nothing for the previous eleven episodes. This is in no way a mystery. The beginning of the series could be considered an infinitely better mystery than the latter half, as you really have no idea who or what Mei is and what role she actually plays in the story until half way through the fifth episode. \\n\\n\r\nNot only was the \"mystery\" handled very haphazardly throughout, but the horror and supernatural aspects were as well. Even now, this series isn't listed under supernatural, most likely because horror usually blends with supernatural in some way, but knowing that this series has supernatural elements only makes everything far worse. From the beginning, we're introduced to the central plot point: the curse that started 26 years ago that still takes the lives of people today. The problem with this is that throughout the series, the curse felt like nothing more than superstition. Almost every single death throughout the bulk of the series, and especially the ones in episode eleven could be logically explained in some way rather than only explainable by taking supernatural elements into consideration. There was only one death that truly felt so farfetched that it could only seem like the work of the supernatural hand , and that was the elevator death in episode four. However, no matter how small the chance of it happening is, it was still within the realm of possibility. I understand that hospital elevator cables snapping may seem ridiculous, and it really is, but you can't rule out this having happened at least once in documented history. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the deaths, they're all easily explained. The umbrella death in episode three? Dying by falling down a flight stairs is entirely possible on its own, but regardless of this being in the original source or something P.A. Works changed, Dead Girl #1 falling on the umbrella was purely done for trying to hook the audience, and there is no easier way of doing that than making some over-the-top death scene which all the mindless little sheep will endlessly ejaculate over. Episode five? Heart attack. If I honestly have to explain this one, I'll probably lose what little hope I have left in humanity. Episode seven? Simple suicide. The real question here is why did the teacher who commited suicide have to make such a spectacle of his death? Here's a hint: shock value.\\n\\n\r\nAnd they aren't don't yet, oh no. Not only were most of the deaths earlier on in the series blown way out of proportion, P.A. Works felt the need to try and make episode eleven able to rival the entirety of a series like Higurashi in terms of deaths and overblown character reactions. So here we have a bunch of teenagers scared for their life each and every day, wondering if they'll be the next ones to die, and through the magic that is the adolescent mind, one of the previously mentioned half-wits lets two unstable girls listen to the tape so that they may also learn the marvelous way of how to stop the curse. Queue a ridiculous amount of jumping around between scenes that would make even Shinbo jealous of their artistic direction. To say this episode was shizophrenic would be quite the compliment. \\n\\n\r\nEven though there may seem to be a lot going on in this episode, there is absolutely nothing to it in the end. It's just a meaningless massacre where everyone is dying from a series of random events like having a pillar falling on top of them, being incinerated by flames or simply being killed by one other in some twisted way due to mass hysteria, paranoia and/or plain idiocy. This all goes right back to Mei, as this entire thing could've been avoided if she had spoken up sooner about who the Another is, instead of letting the entirety of Class 3 believe it was her. Even once she revealed to Kouichi that she in fact knew who the Another was (we heard this twice), Kouichi never bothered to ask her who it was the entire time before or after they were being hunted by everyone else in the mansion and Mei never brought it up again. Not only was there no real mystery to begin with, withholding the information that could've easily solved this \"mystery\" a couple episodes ago puts her at fault for just about everything. Not the Another.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, no matter how you look at it, every single death in this series was very highly dramatized to the point of absurdity for the simple sake of selling Blu-Rays. People like nonsensical violence, that's just how it is. Many series have success through using shock value (Madoka, for example), so I can't necessarily blame P.A. Works for this, as they were just trying to make money like everyone else in the world, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it was all completely superficial with no deeper meaning other than people dying for the sake of dying. If I wanted to see that, I would just turn on the news.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what exactly was Kouichi's role in all of this? Being the protagonist of the series, one would imagine that he would be the one solving the mystery by piecing together the puzzle; yet he's just as useless as the rest of the cast. His purpose was finished once he figured out the story of Mei and why she was being ignored by their class in the first place. After this, he, just like everyone else, was tagging along for the ride until the conclusion finally came around. Did he piece together evidence based on everything he's heard and encountered to come to the   conclusion that the Another was his aunt? No, that was Mei. The only purpose he served in the end was providing us with irrefutable proof that his aunt was the Another by recalling memories that even he forgot until Mei spoke with him about it during the final episode. While this wasn't necessarily bad, as he does get points for not being a beta protagonist like you would imagine him to be, it certainly wasn't good.\\n\\n\r\nNow, assuming you're not counting the death fodders that people like to call characters, by simple process of elimination, Mei is the only character left to go over, and she is by far the worst character in this series. Random Dead Kid #92 was more memorable and even had better characterization and development than she ever had. There was no real depth to her character, and unlike Kouichi, she served no purpose other than actually causing more problems for everyone around her, making her more of an antagonizing force than the Another was. Add in the fact that if she didn't have something unique to her design, she's completely indicernable among the myriads of Ayanami Rei clones out there. So what, she has a sad past, but who hasn't gone through something like losing a loved one nowadays? It could've been much worse, and I actually expected it to be seeing as just about everything else was expanded upon so ridiculously in this series. The only ounce of development that actually she received was during the mid-point of the series, which is arguably the only decent portion of it, and that's just because you finally learn about her as more than \"The bitch that no ones gives two fucks about.\"\\n\\n\r\nHowever, among the countless death fodders and pitiful excuses for characters, there is one who stands among the rest, simply for being one of the ones I hate to see the most in any given work: and that's the catalyst for an overdramatized event. In the case of Another, it would be the woman who owned the mansion that Class 3 went to on their trip. She had all of maybe 3 lines the entire time she was on screen, and was viewed as a side character of no importance, yet, out of nowhere, she decided to go on a random killing spree. This came on suddenly and was completely unwarranted, which just detracted from the main focus of the finale. During the final episode, they did decide to leave us with one terrible justification for her actions: she was said to be emotionally unstable due to the death of her grandson, but this should in no way trigger her actions seeing as his death happened earlier in the series, and by the fact that she went on the murdering spree BEFORE the news was leaked about Mei presumably being the Another. She merely served as a catalyst to help drive home the paranoia in the already unstable kids staying at the mansion, thus triggering a few of them going batshit insane after they found out that Mei was believed to be the Another. I don't even consider the old woman to be a character, but a horribly written plot device that was bad enough to actually be addressed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with this series is, of course, the ending. Stating the obvious, they need to kill the Another so that the curse will be stopped. The only problem with this is that, while the curse is stopped for this year, each person whose life was taken by the curse has a chance to be brought back to life the next year. So, in the end, killing the Another does nothing for anyone in the future, only for the present year. Not only is the curse absolutely ridiculous, it adds on yet another layer of absurdity to everything by giving a nonsensical reason for how it started and why it continues today. Said given explanation is that 26 years ago, the people of Class 3 decided to believe that their classmate who had recently died, wasn't actually dead. Due to this, the curse continued to run rampant each year simply because it could, and it can never be stopped. In the end, the supernatural aspect is nothing more than a terrible excuse to shovel garbage down the throats of the people who eat up pointless deaths. And that is not how horror should work.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is any credit I can truly give to Another, it's the simple attention to detail that's present in things like the background, exemplary of almost every P.A. works anime. Sadly, this is quite easily the strongest point of this series. The atmosphere was great at times, yet seemingly over done at others. The main problem with this is that an anime can't be successful with only a few parts out of the many that make it up, especially not something like the atmosphere which requires other aspects of the series to be good in such a manner that it enhances the experience. More often than not, the atmosphere was ruined not because it was actually overdone, but because the scene taking place was horribly executed. In turn this made everything that took place work against any positive aspect the atmosphere might have provided. In combination with the overbearing OST that sounded like an angsty teenager turning their stereo up to over 9000 in some apparent misguided sense of rebellion against society; it more than kills any good mood that a scene might have been giving off in record time.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I think it might be P.A. Works who is cursed. Every anime they've produced has had a strong beginning, a core that gets progressively weaker and ultimately yields a poor conclusion. This trend hasn't changed through any of their work, and Another is no different. It had the potential to be a good mystery, but started to focus on all the wrong aspects as it progressed, and became nothing more than another twelve weeks of my life wasted.",

            "content": "Notice: some spoilers will be present in this review, despite my best efforts; I've made them as vague as possible, but sorry about that anyway.\r\nAnother advertises itself as a mystery horror anime; its premise is definitely interesting and right off the bat the production values look promising. Unfortunately, the show starts to fall apart halfway through, the mystery leaves you with many, MANY questions of the wrong kind and is so serious yet so over-the-top that the \"horror\" tag might as well be read as \"comedy\".\r\nThis show is a prime example of a promising story being told in the worst manner imaginable. The beginning isstrong, then it starts going downhill in the middle, with the last stretch being just a mess. This is mostly because of how the mystery is handled: at first, Another does a good job at being mysterious and creepy. You know something's up, yet you don't get many clues or even get thrown off the path to the truth. You (may) feel on edge, yet you have no idea why. Obviously, those are the signs of a good mystery. Unfortunately, it doesn't last - pretty much everything about the mysterious curse is revealed and explained long before the final stretch. The only detail that wasn't exposed was the curse's catalyst for that year. This is quite possibly one of the most disastrous moves I've ever seen in an anime, since from that point onwards the characters get almost nothing accomplished and are just swept along by the flow. They don't even TRY to figure out the last, most important piece of the puzzle, making a considerable part of the show very boring... at least, that's what it would've been if the death scenes weren't taken up to eleven.\\n\\n\r\nLet me stop talking about the plot here for a moment to comment about the death scenes, which are probably the reason why you've heard about Another. Some are creative. Some are nasty. All of them are over-the-top, to the point where they can be hilarious. Sure, many of them serve as cheap shock value to keep the viewer interested, but I'll be damned if they didn't do their twisted, morbid little job well. As soon as the first person dies, a (maybe hidden) part of you wants to keep watching to see if there'll be an even more exaggerated and ridiculous death in the series; hell, the laws of physics seem to be altered every other moment just so this can be done.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot. Perhaps one of the show's biggest flaws is that the supernatural elements are never properly explained. Okay, so many years ago someone popular from the class died, and ever since then that very class has been subject to a devastating curse. Why does that happen? Aside from the curse's annual catalyst, nothing is ever explained about it. It just happens. There's also an issue with dead people and memories (can't talk more about it without giving a big spoiler). Again, why does that happen and how? Never explained. Your guess is as good as mine, really, and if you want to know, mine is that the Grim Reaper has enough spare time to screw around with middle school students every year. Finally, Another also commits two writing sins that really annoy me: the first one is that, in multiple occasions, cell phones will malfunction for no reason whatsoever while characters are holding important conversations. This is a blatant diabolus ex machina and only serves to cheapen the writing. Second, at one point a character we've never seen before goes nuts. The problem is that the reason for that is lazily handwaved, making it seem like a poor excuse just to up the chaos even more. Speaking of chaos, let me ask one very simple question: why is the school still open? Over half a dozen people die there almost every year, yet the authorities never did something about it? And if that's the (really illogical) case, then why in the world are people still enrolling their kids there? This isn't a question that stems from deep thought, IT'S COMMON SENSE.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is hit-or-miss. The BGM itself is not bad; while it's sometimes effectively used to create a good, tense atmosphere, it's also misused some other times, and it's not very memorable. The OP, however, is just bad. The imagery fits, but the song feels incredibly out of place and is nothing special either. Same goes for the ED. As for the voice acting, it's... OK. Nothing amazing, yet nothing particularly bad either. \\n\\n\r\nAnother's greatest weakness is its characters. I don't think they even deserve to be called that - \"amoebas\" is more fitting, as they display the intelligence and personality of a single-celled being, and that's IF the characters in question have any \"relevance\" to the plot; if not, \"death fodder\" fits the bill quite nicely. For starters, we have the protagonist, Kouichi. When the body count starts to rise and his classmates desperately tell him to lay low before someone else dies, what does he do? Keep trying to find out what's going on. Hell, at one point he thought a doll was a REAL PERSON. And guess what? Aside from his stupidity and some stalker tendencies, there is nothing remarkable about him. Even worse is Mei, who is proof that Rei Ayanami expies get carte blanche from the anime fandom no matter what they do. Not only does she have no personality to speak of, in the last few episodes she reveals that she knew the answer to the mystery all along AND withheld a piece of very important info from everyone else. Because of some stupid, never-explained power she has. So basically, everything that happened, all the chaos, bodies and paranoia, almost all of the show, ALL OF IT probably wouldn't have happened if she OPENED HER MOUTH IN THE BEGINNING. Her reason for not revealing the truth doesn't make it any less aggravating.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is just as bad. Even the named ones, some of which have quite a bit of screen time, are so forgettable I don't even remember their names. The only memorable thing about them is, as usual, their lack of brains: one guy - who looks like a girl - likely has NO common sense, as he shows very delicate evidence to emotionally unstable girls; this, surprise surprise, makes them go berserk. Then there's a girl with twintails who wants to stop the calamity; there is almost always a character like this in horror/mystery movies, and she is so loyal to that common, predictable archetype that a savvy viewer will easily know everything that she will do/will happen to her before half of the anime has gone by. But worst of all is the blonde guy. While he arguably has the most \"personality\" out of the cast, this jackass is the group's idiot, and he EARNS the title. No, seriously, you heard me right, he accomplishes such a DIFFICULT GODDAMN FEAT with ease. His crowning moment of stupidity? Forcibly removing a tape AS IT'S PLAYING from the player to make it stop. Remember: this anime takes place in 1998, when tapes weren't the ancient forgotten technology they are today. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something else.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things worse, the blonde had some TOUGH competition for the title of \"most brain-dead character\" in this anime. You see, a little over halfway through we learn that one of the old students discovered something very important about the curse. He even made a \"copy\" of that knowledge for future generations. Only one problem: HE HIDES THE DAMNED THING IN AN ABANDONED SCHOOL BUILDING. The thought of handing it over to the school's staff or the police never crossed his mind? Brilliant, just brilliant. There are plenty of more characters, but really, you're not gonna care or even remember about any of them because they're pretty much just going along for the ride to the slaughterhouse. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something that nobody can deny about Another, is that it looks good. The animation is very nice and fluid, with some obvious bumps in quality during the death scenes. The backgrounds have a great amount of detail, being sometimes nothing short of gorgeous. The lighting is good as well, which is great for creating the ideal atmosphere for each situation, something crucial for horror works. It's a shame, really; the anime didn't deserve this quality.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Another is a mess. It may be pretty, morbidly entertaining and have a strong, interesting beginning, but it is unfortunately plagued with bad, forgettable characters, a terribly mishandled mystery, half-hearted or straight up missing explanations and many other writing flaws. It serves as a great example for what not to do in the mystery horror genre, and I wouldn't recommend it - unless you like tearing apart bad works of fiction as you're watching them or find over-the-top deaths to be hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.",

            "content": "This show actually caught me by surprise. I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about it, but needless to say, I was hooked after just two episodes. Who is this girl? Why is she so special? Why is this new transfer student the only one that seems to know she\u2019s even there? A mystery indeed. The show does an amazing job leaving the audience to wonder what\u2019s going to happen next. Each episode\u2019s cliffhanger is gripping. They take things to a whole new level during the second half of the series.The character design and animation style both are top notch. Clean, sharp, and crisp. Nicely done here by P.A. Works. The opening fits the theme of this series perfectly. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better. The ending theme is up for debate. I personally didn\u2019t care much for it, but let\u2019s not make that the focus here.\\n\\n\r\n        I can\u2019t say a whole lot without spoiling the series, but I will say this: as predictable as you will probably think it is, the ending will throw you for a loop. They even recap for you, showing all of the proof from the previous episodes and it will blow your mind because it\u2019s at that moment that you realize the pieces were all there the whole time. How it all came together at the end was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n        The actual ending itself, however, left a sour taste in my mouth for some reason. Not the solution to the mystery, not how it pieced together, but the aftermath. In other words, the epilogue is what sort of made me rethink a few things. If you do pick up this series and watch it to the end, you may or may not understand what I mean, because it\u2019s hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\n        There are some points in the series where the pacing really seems to slow down. The reason I mention this as if to say it\u2019s a problem is mainly because the audience can lose interest when nothing is happening. I found myself dozing off a few times during a couple episodes, and next thing I know, stuff is going down and I totally missed everything leading up to it. Obviously, I had to rewatch those episodes but even fully awake, some parts felt like the longest 23 minutes ever.\\n\\n\r\n         If you likes psychological, gore, horror/mystery genre. If you like more serious shows that take themselves seriously, look no further this is what you looking for.",

            "content": "\"Another\" is a series that I really wanted to like.  The initial premise whilst unoriginal was somewhat promising, but somehow it never quite managed to move away from that initial premise - to the point that it never actually went anywhere.\r\nHere's the problem I have with \"Another\": the entire series is about unraveling a murder mystery but for the greatest part of the series no unraveling is done.  Almost every conversation goes over the topic of mystery, but never is there anything developed.  It's frustrating filler which has no right to be there.\r\nThe fact that conversations continuously retread the same subject matteralso means that the characters are not given any development of their own - in 10 episodes there has only ever been scant development.  It doesn't help that the characters are all cookie cutter clones from other series: the main character Kouichi Sakakibara is a sort of weak recreation of Keichi Maebara, but shorn of all personality; Mei Misaki is simply the typical Rei clone who mumbles something every now and then; none of the other characters are of any consequence whatsoever throughout the series - they are so mind numbingly dull and hastily introduced that you won't care when they die.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the deaths in this series, they are all so ridiculous that they are hilarious.  Accidentally self-impaling on an umbrella early on is the least silly death (I could go on but I don't want to spoil it for people who are genuinely interested in seeing them).  The deaths are entirely gratuitous, so if you're looking for 'edgy' grimdark this may appeal to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is excellent for the most part: backgrounds are lavishly drawn, characters are nicely detailed and animated.  It's about the only saving grace this series has, though there were a few instances where NOPE necks were evident, and there is the broader problem that the visual style borrows liberally from Higurashi (which, incedentally I would recommend instead to anyone considering watching this).\\n\\n\r\nThe audio work for the series was... mixed.  The OP theme by Ali Project is simply terrible, completely out of setting for such a series; the OST was very nicely composed, however it was extremely poorly inserted into the series itself - often score pieces seemed completely out of place, a prime example being when characters are sitting idly in a car whilst a suspense cue plays... but nothing happens.  It's entirely out of keeping, however I would recommend people look up the OST when it gets released whereupon it may be better appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give this 5/10.  It's a shame to do so, but ultimately the series is let down by an extremely weak story and a weak set of characters who undergo no development.",

I was, naturally, captivated by the visceral and beautifully displayed fates with which the characters met and was immediately entranced by the lure of a ghost story. However, there were many plot \"twists\" hinted at through out the story, most of which seemed lazily unfinished. It almost made me feel that the authors had really no concrete plot line to begin with, and hoped the masses would be entrancedwith the gore and yangire enough to not really remember the last plot point left unexplained. In my humble opinion, there was a huge chunk of the story left completely unresolved, and they tried to make Mei out to be a more bad-ass character than she wound up being at all. Ultimately, it left a very unsavory taste in my mouth and is not something I would recommend. This is a very unpleasant thing for me to have to write, as I am a huge fan of the character design artist as well as the horror genre. I can only hope for another media installment in the series that will perhaps answer my MANY burning questions.",

So, being the weak-willed man I am, I was a little apprehensive about starting Another. I shouldn't have been. Another is psychological horror done right. It\u2019s bloody, gruesome, and flipping scary, but it\u2019s also got a strong story, beautiful animation and powerful characters.\r\nThe story is good. Not great. It could have been a lot better. The first five episodes are great. It's mystery, suspense, and terror, and it's done masterfully. After that, the plot starts to crawl. The bigmystery is unraveled, and all the suspense is sucked out. The music even admits that things aren't mysterious any more. This, surprise, is the main plot, which - don't get me wrong - is still interesting enough to occupy your attention. The story picks itself back up for the finale. The final three episodes are fantastic, and it brings a good finish to all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is pretty simple. I can\u2019t say too much without spoiling it for you, but the series does a good job of keeping it interesting with good pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle school ensemble is pretty typical. We have best friend one, best friend two, the shy girl and the strong girl. Their personalities don't go too much deeper than that. The supporting characters aren't anything you haven't seen before, but they each have their share of secrets and it\u2019s interesting to watch their personalities evolve. They\u2019re a good bunch. The real strength in characters, though, lies in Misaki Mei. She's an absolutely fascinating character. The air of mystery around her is the backbone of the whole series. Kouichi, our endearing protagonist, is also a very strong character. He\u2019s the kind of guy who gets stuff done. Unlike a lot of protagonists, he\u2019s not clueless, he\u2019s not retarded, and he\u2019s very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. There isn\u2019t really any other way to describe it. Every scene and environment has meticulous detail and does a great job in capturing the dark atmosphere of the series \u2013rusting guardrails, flickering lights, and a thin layer of dust over everything. The characters look great and the animation brings life to everyone. I couldn\u2019t find an awkward animation among them. It\u2019s one of the best-looking series you\u2019ll see.\\n\\n\r\nAnother really isn\u2019t very scary. The music is. It\u2019ll freak you out. It sounds like the brainchild of an orchestra having a seizure and a drunken pianist. It\u2019s dark, gloomy, and creepy, and it\u2019s brilliant. The OP is Halloweenie pop song sung by a wannabe goth. It sounds corny, but it works pretty well. The ED is fantastic. It\u2019s a soft, beautiful piano solo, and it\u2019s the perfect ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion? Another is a great anime. I\u2019d recommend it to everyone, even if you don\u2019t like the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed Another. Well, that\u2019s enough out of me \u2013 go watch it for yourself. You\u2019ll be a better person because of it.\\n",

            "content": "What is considered a horror and what is considered a thriller? This is a subject that can confuse many, much like the difference between plot and story; the topic of whether or not something is a thriller or horror is a concept that most people have vague knowledge of, yet people often use incorrectly. The question to ask now is which does Another fall under? \r\nLet's begin by discussing horror versus thriller. Horror, essentially, is based off of basic, scenic brutality; it is typically filled with blood, gore, and 'creative' methods in which people die gruesome deaths. Think of common horror flicks like Halloween, Nightmareon Elm Street, or in reference to anime, Corpse Party. What is considered a thriller then? Thrillers tend to tap into the audience psychologically and build suspense based on anticipation, often scaring viewers without resorting to blood and guts; think Paranormal Activity, Silence of the Lambs, or The Sixth Sense. While deaths (when they happen) can be fairly gruesome, most of the anime has a more slow-paced, suspenseful atmosphere; there is a certain lingering feeling of lurking malice that is presented through an eerie environment and the ambiguity surrounding the mystery of Class 3. While peoples' view on what they define as horror and thriller differ based on their tolerance of what is perceived as \u2018scary\u2019 to them, Another should be considered a thriller.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, Another is pretty interesting in the sense of being mysterious. It delves into a very ambiguous semblance and piece by piece slightly becomes clearer. There aren't many good thriller anime out there, but Another did a great job at keeping a suspenseful mood. However, thriller elements aren't enough to carry a lacking plot direction and story. Like many plot twists in anime, if you watch closely and follow the dialogue events become predictable. The entirety of the series doesn't stay coherent and by the end of the series you\u2019ll end up angered by how disrespectful the ending is to your intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation and overall scenery of Another positively adds to the creepy, mysterious atmosphere of the show. The art and animation look good and are consistent, which is really what matters most. What's exceptional about Another is the fact that everything is utilized to create the mood; whether it be the weather, objects, or the school/environment itself, each plays their own role in building suspense and spook factor. Sound-wise, Another is decent. I liked the OP and the ED was fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Another are a strange group of people as a whole. I don't think there is a single normal character in this whole entire show. However, the abnormality in these characters goes hand-in-hand with the abnormality of the show. Since Another is supposed to be of the Supernatural genre, it makes sense that many things don\u2019t always fall into the realm of logical reasoning. This also applies to the attitudes, mental being, and personalities of the characters. Characters seemed fairly bland and lacking of genuine human qualities. People tragically die in front of the main male lead and he doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered in the slightest. It begs to question whether or not the characters are actually humans or simply moving corpses. I suppose asking for realistic reactions in a fictitious thriller story are a bit far-fetched on my behalf, but there is definitely something more to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to say whether or not I enjoyed Another. While being a somewhat entertaining thriller for the majority of the series, Another also has a horrible ending. Essentially, it takes all the suspense and build up from the first ten episodes and throws it out the window. I\u2019m not sure why the direction steered towards a \u2018Final Desination\u2019 type of ending or why it chose to disregard its thriller base and transition into horror, but it certainly left a sour aftertaste.",

            "content": "When trying to formulate a good mystery plot, the author is prone to making some loopholes; the biggest challenge is to prevent these from happening, or cover it with a literary device.\r\nIt is also easy to make a mystery plot without any loopholes at all, but with that case, it gains a risk of being bland and predictable. I have watched and read my own fair share of those kinds of stuff, like Detective Conan, Gosick, CSI, and other books and movies, and though I'm not saying that they're not enjoyable, some can be easily predicted halfway.\r\nThat is why not only I became a fanof Ayatsuji Yukito-sensei, I also respected P.A. Works (Angel Beats!, HanaIro) a lot more. Yes, some of you who watched it may argue that there were facts that were intentionally hidden from the audience, but isn't it just as well? This is one of those rare moments when it feels good to be cheated on.\\n\\n\r\nLet's proceed with the story. I'm gonna give it an 8/10. Wait what!?!?!!11 After all those praises, this newb otaku is giving \"Another\" only an 8? Yes, the scenario that it gave was really unique, in the sense that they give you minimum info at the start of every episode, then just as you are expecting a revelation, it will just leave you hanging and hungry for more (kind of like women LOL). Still, that atmosphere was not sustained for all of the twelve episodes. Also, after some realllllllllllly deep afterthoughts about the anime, I found one big loophole at the end that was not covered up well. Maybe you can find about that too, it's right at the last episode.\\n\r\nAlso, even if this was categorized as horror, caveat emptor: horror fans may not be too amazed with this aspect, unless you get easily freaked out by Saw-type movies, as this show will be a bloodbath.\\n\r\nOn a side note, I was one of those lucky people who were not spoiled, so my guesses were wrong. -_-\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just,,,, WHOAAAH! I'm gonna quote something I read from Japanator: it feels like you can pause the anime anywhere, anytime and it would always be a candidate for an awesome desktop bg. P.A. Works is just so good at this aspect. So yeah, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna include OP and ED for sound, since I'm not particularly a fan of those. Anyway, the BGM was a really well-used mood-setter for the anime. By any chance, do you know Hans Zimmer? And by any chance, have you watched The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan? Another's BGM is like TDK's: without the music, scenes are incomplete; without the story, the music is kind of useless. Now, I'm not trying to insult Zimmer here; what I'm saying that the se kind of music are meant to be a catalyst of a situation's atmosphere, and nothing else. And with Another's case, I'm gonna give it a 10, duh.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, one common characteristic they have is that they have fu**ing DUMB characters! You know, the feeling where you're yelling \"DAMN IT WHY ARE YOU STILL INSIDE THE DAAAANG HOUSE\" on the screen? Some characters in Another are like that. I guess it's a given for this genre, but still, they could have made some of the deaths more justifiable. Meanwhile, I have to commend Ms. Sakakibara, the female lead. I'm expecting a lot would be irritated by her, but try to put yourself in that situation; try to read her psyche whenever that time (i.e., the hating :P) comes. One good characteristic about her is that she's one of those characters that you can't really label any stereotypes. While most characters were static (which works well for this show), those handful of the lead roles were the opposite of that, and they were well-developed until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I also give it a 10. I was always waiting for the subbed episodes to come out as soon as possible, simply because \"Another\" always ends with cliffhangers. These cliffhangers did not leave me high and dry, and as soon as I finished an episode, it always makes me think, giving me some kind of faux intelligence. xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 10. I just really loved this show, and I would certainly watch and read other related materials, and I recommend you do too. n_nv\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, I recommend you watch the anime first before reading the novel or the manga, because as I mentioned before, a lot more facts are kept hidden, which would mean that your assumptions and guesses would have less evidence, making it slightly more thrilling. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is my first review, go easy on me guys! Hajimemashite. @_@",

            "content": "-No spoilers are contained within this review-\r\nStory (6/10)\r\n\tWhen I first got a grasp on the story in Another I was slightly surprised. I started to watch this show with expectations of a clich\u00e9 storyline, where the \u201csurprises\u201d could be seen from a mile away. The story in fact is something very different than what I would expect. Another takes the form of a \u201cslice of life\u201d show at the very beginning and evolves from then on into a thriller. The whole of the story follows a character named Kouichi Sakakibara after he transfers to a new high school. As he begins adjusting to his newsurroundings he notices a girl in his class named Mei Misaki. Mei (for reasons unknown) has been ostracized by the rest of the class so Kouichi, being a nice and friendly guy, starts talking to her and befriends her. Once strange accidents and calamities start befalling the classmates Kouichi takes it upon himself to find out what is going on. This story setting is something that I have never run into before, so, naturally, it caught my interest. Even though the storyline was unique it unfortunately seemed to be lacking. Exposition about the plot is very dry and sometimes hard to understand. The main character\u2019s investigation pretty much consists of sitting in the school library and sifting through old yearbooks. Seriously? I had to take points off for that. Where the story really shines is the situations. Many characters will find themselves time and again in very strenuous or perilous circumstances, all of which come out of the blue and give the watcher a very strong sense of suspense. This was what kept me going, and honestly what saves the show in my opinion. I will not spoil anything but I have to say that these parts are extremely well done and had me on the edge of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (5/10)\\n\r\n\tThe one thing that makes a thriller movie good is the atmosphere and on this section I have mixed feelings. The characters are drawn well enough and the animation quality fits together, but there is one issue. The key to scaring the audience is getting them immersed into the story, making them more susceptible to fear, but there are parts where immersion is broken. For instance near the ending (no spoilers) there is a scene in which a fire breaks out. One huge immersion breaker for me is the animation of the flames. To be blunt it\u2019s extremely bad. Honestly it looks like something out of an old Playstation game. To have something look so poor at the climax of the show is a huge mistake. To be honest I made the effort to try to ignore it so that the experience wouldn\u2019t be ruined. Other than that the animation is fine. The atmosphere is done effectively enough to tell the story with little interruption. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\n\tI\u2019m sure people who watch thrillers know that sound plays a crucial role in completing the atmosphere. In the case of Another they pull it off very well. The music is downright creepy, silence is used correctly, and the OP sets the tone for the show. I found that when the atmosphere was lacking or part of the animation was \u201chiccuping\u201d that the music and sounds would be enough to keep me involved. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\r\n\tThis one is hard for me to admit, but the characters aren\u2019t really well done. They are very average, bland, and plain cookie cutter. That being said, they still fulfill their roles as characters. I never found myself attached to the two main characters, as I should have been. Let\u2019s just leave it as this. There was nothing outstanding about them. There was enough to make me scared and interested but overall they leave something to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\n\tThis show is like junk food. You know it\u2019s bad, the ingredients are not up to par, but there\u2019s just something about it that you like. Apart from all of the faults mentioned above I still really enjoyed this show. There were a few parts that tested my patience and/or bored me, but they were brief enough that I still continued I think it was worth sticking out. Nothing about this show will astound you, make you think, or leave you breathless, but regardless it can still scare you. Everything comes together just enough so that the ride is still a lot of fun, and for me that\u2019s worth something. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.4/10)\\n\r\n\tLike I said before. This show is junk food. Not to say that it\u2019s total garbage. It is not all that well done but proved to be an entertaining and fun ride. Apart from its lackluster appearance and somewhat shaky atmosphere Another still freaked me out and gave me a good time. If you like thrillers that are gruesome and creepy, but you\u2019re not looking for something to overanalyze or study, this is a good two-dimensional product that may be worth your while. Even though it was slightly forgettable I had a good time and, if you pick it up, I hope you do too. \\n",

            "content": "Some horror flicks manage to work because of good pacing, unique presentation, and a genuinely unnerving atmosphere, others are just entertaining gorefests that make up for there weak writing and stupid characters with a healthy dosage camp. I genuinely enjoy both sides of the horror spectrum and came into Another looking for one or the other and instead got what seems to be a horrendously botched attempt at both. As far as being creepy goes, Another employs the most ridiculously derivative approach. A small pale chick and ugly dolls? It\u2019s about as done to death as it sounds . Plainly put, the series puts apitiful amount effort into establishing a legitimately creepy atmosphere using such cliche imagery isn\u2019t gonna put my hairs on end. The ominous music does it\u2019s best to compliment these scenes, but it ends up being overused and doesn\u2019t do much to elevate such weak material.\\n\\n\r\nOK, so Another clearly isn\u2019t very successful when it comes to being unnerving, but there\u2019s still the \u201cother\u201d type of horror I already brought up right? Well the death scenes are ridiculous, but Another otherwise lacks a fun sense of self-awareness. Any fun to be had in this show is reduced to simply laughing at an absurd death scene before the series try to make you take it\u2019s plot and characters seriously once again. I could forgive botched attempts at spookiness and some death scenes too silly and jarring to take seriously, but the underlying writing is so unrelentingly bad it\u2019s unbelievable. The mystery in Another in simple terms makes no sense whatsoever. All the reveals regarding the calamity of Class 3-3 have to do with either how it happens and what the rules are. There\u2019s never any explanation as to why it happens. It\u2019s just a bunch of rules applied to some class with no rhyme or reason. The idea behind the show was bad, but what ruined the show was excruciatingly terrible pacing. For starters, after the 1st couple of episodes, the show pretty much front-loads the viewers with most of the information through forced info-dumps, which is boring as hell to watch and doesn\u2019t really give you much to think about besides the mystery behind who the killer is. You know exactly what\u2019s going on for most of the show (minus who\u2019s causing it all) which guts the tension quickly.\\n\\n\r\n A lot of the problems with the plot could\u2019ve been mitigated if the series wasn\u2019t driven by a cast with perhaps one of the worst case of plot convenience and plot-induced-stupidity I\u2019ve ever seen in quite some time. This is where the characters come in unfortunately, whose actions seem to lack any semblance of logic whenever the script demands so. It\u2019s the type of stupidity that creates plot craters as opposed to holes. Why doesn\u2019t anyone try to do something about a curse for 30 years? Why doesn\u2019t anyone try to transfer out of a cursed class? Surely you\u2019d consider at least that much before trying to murder your fellow classmates right? The writing goes far enough to avoid aspects of the world that ought to get involved in the annual massacre of children (like parents, the police, etc) to the point where the school may as well have been teleported to a remote island. The worst part of it all was the reason they gave for why Mei doesn\u2019t just tell Koichi the identity the real undead person, it\u2019s an insultingly stupid handwave that essentially causes the show to be four times longer than it needed to be while making most of the deaths entirely preventable.\\n\\n\r\nKoichi himself as a character isn\u2019t stupid like the rest of the cast, but that\u2019s really all I have to say about him. He\u2019s essentially a blank slate \u201d hey project yourself on to me\u201d type of character. This sort of lead works OK for video games (though even then I\u2019d prefer not to have to put up with it), this degree of blandness is sleep inducing. They don\u2019t even really give him much to do besides talk, and talk, and talk, and hey that person just died, back to talking. There\u2019s not really much to say about the rest of the cast as individuals, but as a whole, they came off to me as nothing more than l mere death fodder whose names I never bothered learning or forgot after/during my watch-through of this series. Anyone who tries to drop information the writers deem to be to juicy to give up at the moment either do so by dropping very vague hints that you\u2019d have to rewatch the show to catch (fat chance of me doing that), or something ridiculously contrived and inconvenient happens to stop right exact moment where a truth bomb is about to be dropped. There was also a hint of romance between the two leads, but the writers barely gave it any attention, as will this review.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing to recommend about Another. As a serious mystery, it\u2019s far too dumb and not in a way that would make it fun to sit through.\\n",

            "content": "We all have our own expectations for a horror, and whether Another fits this genre is controversial. Its similarities to Final Destination, one of America's horror film series, makes it well-known for the countless freak accidents. It doesn\u2019t go without saying that Another has its shortcomings that declined to make it as serious a horror as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, which it desperately tried to compete with and failed. On the other hand, Another pulls through with a solid mystery, and the top-notch animation by P.A. Works enhances the suspense throughout the series.\r\nAnother revolves around a 26-year-old mystery of one particular high school classthat leads to multiple bloodbaths. The mystery itself is decent and adds onto the horror and suspense for each episode, but it may not please one who searches for complete logic in a mystery. The mystery only has a temporary solution, which makes it appear less serious. Multiple deaths of high school kids normally would cause a reasonable course of action to put an end to it. The fact that it went on for 26 years might turn one off. There was a slow start in introducing the mystery in full, but the characters\u2019 reactions to the situation was understandable. Apart from that, the mystery gradually develops as characters discover more clues for the first time. The ending brings all of the pieces together, including connections between some of the important characters with thorough explanations, and eliminates any potential for plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother\u2019s main problem is that it tries way too hard. Creators mock the viewer with quick cuts of dolls between scenes like \u201cBoo! Are you scared yet?\u201d The gloomy backgrounds and freak accidents were enough by themselves, and the dolls just overdid it. Even the OP places a huge emphasis on dolls. Dolls can be creepy when they want to be, but they have absolutely nothing to do with this show besides their relevance to Misaki\u2019s past. One or two deaths were unnecessarily dramatic as if it's Shakespeare. Dark music plays needlessly during conversations, but other scenes prove that the dialogue is enough for this anime. The gloomy backgrounds and freak accidents were enough alone, so the obsession with dolls and exaggeration in the scenes were avoidable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is literally nothing special about the cast. They only exist to either contribute to solving the mystery, die off, or both. However, they deserve an excessive amount of credit for giving appropriate reactions to calm or terrifying situations. Misaki is probably the only distinct character with her unique background, and her introverted behavior keeps her mysterious. Kouichi is your typical clich\u00e9 male character who feels the need to talk to a girl who is invisible to everyone else or desperately trying to figure out what\u2019s going on around him. Oppositely, Kouichi destroys the concept of a male protagonist in horror who constantly needs saving. He adjust to unfortunate changes very well, but it's annoying how he gulps or gets frightened before anything actually happens. The characters overall is probably Another's weakest point.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works did an extraordinary job with Another\u2019s animation. Finally, there is a show with an active background and not plain stills to just focus on the main characters. The blood splatter and gore are on key. The character design was good. Most of the body figures were distinct, except for two female characters who looked too much alike, and the characters' facial expressions brought terror to the screen. The background design is amazing with the dark, gloomy colors to fit the anime\u2019s theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good, but the problem came with the timing. When eerie music was necessary, it wasn\u2019t there at all and vice versa. There are no complaints about the seiyuu, especially Takamori Natsumi (voice of Misaki) who fit the role for a quiet yet mysterious girl. The sound effects, including the blood gushes and lightning strikes, fit the situations perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you will enjoy Another greatly depends on what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re looking for a logical mystery, you won\u2019t find it. Like other scary movies, you might find the deaths humorous or look past the over-exaggeration with dolls to get a scare. Personally, it was very satisfying for me, but it could be better. The mystery was good, and the high quality animation made the show even more attractive. Even though the majority of them had no unique personalities or anything special about them to make you care, the characters reacted appropriately towards the situations whether it is horrifying or a calm atmosphere. Since Another is a hit-and-miss anime, I suggest reading other (non-spoiler) reviews as well.\\n\\n\r\n*Regardless of whether you liked Another or just dissatisfied with it altogether, watch Higurashi no Naku Koro ni if you haven\u2019t already.",

            "content": "This is actually an updated ver of my review after watching the twelve ep of the series (already ended at that point, I guess). I thought I need to update it since I got different feeling from the first impression I had, and watching this show till the end just reducing my points.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story is one of the most intriguing idea I ever know, and it fits perfectly as the backbone of a horror. So, at first it's just incredible. However, the routine deaths in the sense of Final Destination bored me. I lost the most of the creepiness feeling on the second halfof the series since the way it presents the horror moments is rather predictable and always repeating. The only surprising moment is just at the end episode when we got to know who the dead is (Thank god it is).\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nI simply love the art of this show (more than the manga). It really fits the atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nStill  AWESOME!, especially when I knew that ALI Project sang the opening. Well, one word of advice, pay attention to the opening scene, there are some 'small' noticeable scene which surprised me, and I love it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nAgain, I really regretted that the secret of Misaki Mei revealed in rather early episodes. This was necessary for the story development though, but I still regretted it. I mean, the only character gives me creepiness is no one but her, and I just feel a big loss when her identity revealed.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is just as predictable as any other horror story : Everyone will go mad. It doesn't matter though, since the way it shows on ep 12 is amazing even some are questionable, like why the hell the inn owner goes mad like the students?.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\r\nWell, In this part I cannot avoid spoiler, since the ones bugged my enjoyment mostly are the last two episodes.\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT\\n\r\nI enjoy watching the show, even with all the predictability, however there are some questionable moments which disturb me. Firstly the death on the elevator. I just simply don't understand it since what I know is the elevator has a kind of automatic lock to prevent it from falling when an accident happen (it was what my science teacher told me).\\n\r\nThe second is the most annoying part. On the last two episodes, there was  fire set in a room inside the inn, and instead of running as quickly as possible, almost all characters (especially the mains) are just walking calmly as if nothing happened !. They even have chit-chat before evacuating ! (What the heck! a fire is under your feet !).\\n\r\nOne more thing, this show ended rather calmly and very complete. It bugged me also, since what I always wish from this kind of show is a cliffhanger ending or an open ended one. This show gave me neither one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nThis show was promising at first, another new breath after the slice-horror/thriller show like Mirai Nikki, but the repeating horror moments just cut off my admiration, and the last two episodes are just nonsense. Thankfully there was tension built up and the one who is dead is out of my prediction.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I can sum up Another in one word it would be, \"fun.\" (Of Course if you're into horror/Suspense/Thrillers) Another is a show that's not the best of it's kind, or not the greatest in it's execution but for what it's worth, nonetheless I had a GREAT time! There's was enough suspense at the end each episode that left me wanting more and even if I fully didn't understand what was going on, the events that were shown on screen were still highly enjoyable to watch!\r\nStory:\r\nThe Story of Another is pretty simple enough; A class has a curse and the characters spend the series tryingto find ways to break it. What I thought the series done really well was to slowly provide small amounts of information on the curse as possible, building tension and leaving the viewers continually invested in the world that these characters were in. The atmosphere of the series was also a high point, showcasing sceneries that were downright creepy (I'm looking at you doll house/museum!) and enough suspense that demands you to marathon the entire series!\\n\\n\r\nWhat lacks in Another however is the pacing and organization this series had. For the first two episodes we see a SLOW development in the plot. It's at the end of episode three where things start to pick up. Even still however, I found the series constantly slowing down for more dialogue heavy moments. I found this rather frustrating especially if it came after a  drastic death scene. The plot can also be convoluted at times. Because of this it can be hard to follow the plot due to all the sudden back stories and similar names (Seriously, how many misakis are there?!?) Another point I have are the deaths themselves! To me personally, I found some of these natural occurring deaths to be too bizarre! None of the deaths had no purpose and they all seemed to be either too scripted, or too random that I actually found it comedic at times! Honestly, who didn't find that death hilarious when that guy was randomly crushed by a pillar in episode 11\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art of Another is a strong point of the series. Even though the animation can be considered standard fair of today's current gen anime, what differs the series is the detail put in each animation. what really stuck out to me was how well the dolls were drawn (Even if I despise them!) as well as how visually detailed and gruesome the death scenes looked. some deaths are certainly cringe worthy, especially to the lighthearted!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Sound of Another is at times eerie, yet only adds to the mystery surrounding this whole entire series. I enjoyed the upbeat opening theme, which suits the tone of the gruesome and fast paced final third of the series. Another piece that stuck out was the piece titled, \"The Mystery Of Yomi Yama\" that played frequently throughout the series in different renditions.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did not fit however, was the ending theme. It was a slow piece that might have fitted a drama better, but after a suspenseful episode, it was especially hard on the ears! I came to watch high school students get massacred, not Les Mis 2.0 Japanese Edition! \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe Characters in Another are sadly the weakest part of this blood fest. Aside from lead female Misaki Mei, I found myself uninterested and not invested with the characters. This is also due to lack of Character development. We don't get to know much of anyone and therefore, it's hard to feel any sympathy when a character would die. Because of this, once I got to the ending, I was shocked, but not as surprised as I could have been, due to lack of interest in the characters. In turn, the characters are simply there to advance the plot or showcase the most intense ways of dying.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nDon't mistake this anime for just \"ANOTHER\" cliched horror title (see what I did there?) xD. What you get is an interesting plot that's enjoyable as well as enough death scenes that can either make you gag, laugh or even make you say, \"whhaaattt!!?!?!\" It's definitely a fun watch and a big recommendation! \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free.\r\nRecently I came to realize how much I like the horror genre, and why did I realize this? Well, a few scares are nice, and a good, gory bloodbath every so often can be enjoyable, yes, I just said that. However, the best about horror is that because it deals with the supernatural and the unreal,  the horror genre encourages the creators to create worlds, that can put us on unease and expecting the unexpected, horror is best when it tries to unnerve us rather than scare us. Unfortunately Another missed the horror class.\r\nThe first sin of Another it\u2019s theunfortunate lack of subtlety. The early episodes feature many, many, many quick cuts to ugly doll faces, as if to say, \u201cAren't these dolls creepy? I bet you\u2019re scared now, huh?!\u201d, the only thing missing would probably be big red flashing signs \u201cyou should be scared now\u201d . There\u2019s nothing wrong with throwing subtlety out the window on occasion, but the world of Another simply isn't strange enough for those types of tricks to work.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the problems don\u2019t stop there, once the mystery develops and students begin dying, Another begins to show how ridiculous it can be. Let me just be totally honest, the first death was putting it simply, ridiculously hilarious. It\u2019s so convoluted and absurd that I dare say it\u2019s impossible to take seriously. Subsequent deaths don\u2019t reach that level of absurdity, but they never feel like they fit the story, I was half expecting Light Yagami to jump out of the bushes and say \"Just as planned!\". Another could easily be the result of merging Final Destination with animation, is just that ridiculous. The show was going for big shocks, but the death scenes call too much attention to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how are the characters? Well, every good horror show needs a great protagonist, Another gives us Kouichi Sakakibara. But don\u2019t worry, Kouichi isn't a stereotype - he doesn't have enough personality to be a stereotype in the first place. If you ordered a \"Kouichi\" from a pizzeria they would send you a pizza base. That all said about him, how about the supporting cast? Well...More than being the equivalent of little pigs going to the slaughterhouse, none of them will matter in the least, you won\u2019t have the time or the reasons to get attached to either of them and they aren't in the least bit empathetic or relatable. Thankfully there\u2019s one character that stands out, not because its good, but because isn\u2019t half bad either, Misaki Mei gets some exposure, even if in small bits, but other than that acting distant and mysterious (Rei Ayanami would be so proud\u2026) she doesn't do much, apart from providing the plot with some unexplained \u201cpower\u201d, going deeper into this subject would involve spoilers so let me stop right here.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning, P.A. Works did a fantastic job with the animation and art, well, most of time, while everything from character art to background was great, the fire animation present on the last episodes of the show, seems taken from a PlayStation 2 game. \\n\\n\r\nSound is very important to the atmosphere of a horror show, so starting from the opening performed by ALI PROJECT, to the ending performed by Annabel, all I can say it\u2019s that it was rather, disappointing, ALI PROJECT performed perhaps their worst song, and the gothic tone didn\u2019t seem to find place in the opening, as for the ending, while not bad, all I can say it\u2019s that is average, sounded nice though. But, how did the soundtrack fare? Well, it\u2019s a bit hard to say, there was a track that matched each situation, but nothing noteworthy, also average to say the least, the anime achieved to provide the unease feel more without the soundtrack than with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo most importantly, how was the mystery? Well is rather decent for the most part. There is some actual interest in finding out why all the\u201d craziness\u201d is happening, and the twist at the end isn\u2019t half bad. The problem is there\u2019s far too much padding. Stupid teenagers are a natural clich\u00e9 of the horror genre, and Another takes that cue and runs along with it. Any useful information is hidden for stupid reasons. Technology fails at convenient times. When information is learned, someone comes and screws things up. This formula repeats until exhaustion. Taken alone these don\u2019t break the entire experience, but when lumped together to prolong the mystery, all these annoying elements end up damaging any tension built.\\n\\n\r\nAnother has the foundation to be interesting, but shaky execution holds it back. It\u2019s not subtle enough to be creepy, nor is it competent enough to be a compelling mystery. It\u2019s too bad that these plot problems waste another strong visual effort from P.A. Works. But there\u2019s still some enjoyment you can manage to extract from this anime, if you like gore, there\u2019s certainly some \u201cfun\u201d to be had, even if there\u2019s nothing to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nI guess in the end Another ends up being just \u201canother\u201d anime, no pun intended.\\n",

            "content": "This is possibly one of the worst excuses for a horror/mystery that I have ever seen.\r\nThe visuals were nice, the music was mediocre, and the voice acting was slightly above average...and that's where the good things end.\r\nLet me start with the plot - it was horrible.\r\nOf course, I should elaborate. \r\nIt was painfully predictable from the outset, and most \"twist\" were obvious several episodes before they happened - and I'm usually not even good at predicting what will happen in gorror/mystery stories. Do to nearly everything being so predictable, the tension needed for a horror story to function was nonexistent.\r\nThere is one \"twist\" I couldnot predict, mainly do to how stupid and nonsensical it was. The ending. I won't give it away, but let me just say that it's a false twist, because all the characters in the story - ALL OF THEM - already know this, but the information was not given to the viewer simply in order to create that false \"twist\" at the end. The piece of info is something that one would think would be rather important to the characters, but they still never mention it while struggling to solve the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the mystery is solved in the end involves this crucial piece of information that everyone knew, but just never bothered to take into consideration, plus some handy Deus Ex Machina. Really, an incredibly intricate \"mystery\" with an even greater resolution.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters themselves...oh boy. The blandest bunch of two-dimensional death-fodder I have seen in a while. Really, most of them exist simply to die in a gory and bizzare way - which might be amusing for some people, but not for me. The Final Destination type deaths just can't make up for lack of character and story - the deaths are not impactful or meaningful if I care for the characters about as much as I would for mannequins.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets any sort of development or personality is Mei, and even she ends up being a stereotypical Rei Ayanami clone, a type of character already seen many times over.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character himself is barely worth mentioning - he is the blandest of the bunch by far, in both personality and looks.\\n\\n\r\nAll things said and done, this is a predictable \"mystery\" with a horrible resolution, an ineffective \"horror\" that relies on gore as its only horror element, akin to Final Destination, and like that film series, is just full of bland characters that are there only to die.\\n\\n\r\nI am unable to fathom how anyone, in their right mind, can give this series any score higher than a 5. \\n\\n\r\nFrom me, this shitstain on the horror/mystery genre gets the lowest score possible. I was curious at the beginning, but by the midpoint that turned into sheer hatred, which was only amplified by the ending.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSince I have been on a horror anime binge lately, I may as well review the ever popular series \"Another\". This is a series that despite its popularity, is quite divisive in terms of critical rating. I will attempt to take a fair and objective look at it and separate the actual flaws from the popularity-backlash.\r\nI'm going to get this out of the way early. The plot of Another isn't very good. Not only is it absurd in its premise and character actions, but it doesn't even feel creative or like it works within its own constructed world. The basic plot and mechanics that drivethe show are VERY clearly borrowed from the shitty Final Destination movies. Another doesn't even try to cover this up. It is amazing to me that the Newline Cinema hasn't tried to sue Another for plagiarism. A curse causes character after character to die from wildly unlikely \"Rube Goldberg\" deaths in which object A bumps into object B, causing object C to fall down and spring object D into the air, ultimately concluding in a piano being dropped on a character's head and crushing them in gory fashion. In defense of Another, many horror classics don't actually have very good plots. Was \"Nightmare on Elmstreet\" a literary masterpiece? Hell No! Another can take refuge in the fact that it is clearly a horror series and horror is about generating scares regardless of logic or realism. A drama play like the works of Tennessee Williams should have a strong level of realism and complex characters, but a horror is unbound by such constraints and Another's shitty plot is therefore excusable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother has been criticized as one of those mystery series that \"cheats\" ,so not enough is revealed to the audience in order to give them a fair chance of solving the mystery in its entirety. I will say that this is a fair criticism, for Another does indeed cheat in that regard. However, that doesn't automatically make it bad. Many of the great mystery novels including the many short stories and novels of Sherlock Holmes refuse to play fair and withhold vital information from the audience. Yet the characters, prose, and enjoyability of the plot made that flaw forgivable. Keep in mind that I'm NOT trying to compare the quality of Another to Sherlock Holmes. I'm just saying that a mystery story refusing to play fair doesn't automatically make it bad and this criticism could be seen as a tad unfair towards Another.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing Another does well is that it actually DOES have a solid soundtrack that helps give it a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, the series often spoils this atmosphere with cheap jump scares, but unlike some other horror anime, Another does at times seem to sort of know what its doing. The art is also excellent! Both the character art, background art, and animation are the highlight of the series. I also love the sharp color contrast between the blood and everything else. Perhaps an homage to the cheesy, Hammer Horror films from the 1950s and 1960s? In summary, Another has a strong soundtrack, excellent animation, and at least SOMETIMES it tries to build appropriate horror atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nAnother is a far cry from being a horror masterpiece that will scare the pants off you, but it isn't actually quite as bad as some critics make it out to be. Another actually DOES do some things right and although it has a weak plot and borrows far too much from Final Destination, it is a competently made series overall.",

            "content": "Intro: Another is one of those truly horrific anime series that you'll regret setting your eyes upon. Not for the fact that it's classed as a \u201chorror\u201d series but for the reason it's truly the one most ridiculously implausible stories ever. If you are anything like me, a person who doesn't scare easily or a person well rooted in all that is sound and reasonable but capable of suspending logic for a moment of fiction. You won't like this series! I found nothing scary about dolls, nothing scary about  bloody deaths and gore or crows, whatever. Is it sick and twisted? A BIG yes!But I fail to see how this series is scary/horror. I think this series will scare only the really really young or people who only can handle happy rainbows and unicorns but a savvy down-to-earth, logic minded person will probably find this funny or annoying.\\n\\n\r\nVISUALS: I really can't complain about the art. I watched it in HD 720 and it looked really great. A lot of detail went into the settings; the dolls in the doll museum looked lovely, their hair very silky and fine, their skin smooth and white. Reds looked velvety and lush. A lot of nice outside scenes as well; crisp colours and believable textures. The animation was smooth and modern techniques were used, the CG wasn't obvious and nicely blended with the rest of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nAUDIO: I love ALI Project and all that they do but using them for the opening song wasn't the right choice for such a supposedly horror series. Some of the notes and tones do sound a bit halloween-ish but it still didn't mesh well for a horror/slasher series. Strangely enough I did think the ED Theme fit the series even though that was more of a melancholy song that scary. I watched the series in Japanese dub....no complaints, and none of the sound effects were scary.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:  The story was deffo a mystery more than anything else but instead of it being a \u201cwho done it?\u201d it's more of a \u201cwho is it?\u201d There is absolutely no credibility to this series at all, and that's because the story was a cliched trainwreck. Sure it starts out nice and slow\u2014new kid in town, goes now new school. It later builds a nice foundation of mystery and suspense\u2014weird behaviour from classmates, intriguing urban legends. Then you GASP: Shocking Death, first student dies in freak accident! Bloody! Horrific! And it's all shit from there! The behaviour and logic is unreasonable, if the urban legend has been going on for as long as they said it was going on...then what sane parent would send their kid to that school? Because not only do you run the risk of that poor  kid in that class  dying in some horrifyingly funny death,  but you as a parent could die or your other children as their siblings could die, etc.  I also found it ridiculous the reach of this  so-called curse and how it attached itself to a specific classroom....yet it spans the whole town? why not demolish the classroom? Or keep assigning students to that classroom? Or better yet why keep that fucking old ass  desk? And why is the faculty participating in this farce? Why is there not a Parent/Teacher conference about this? WTF is a countermeasures task force??? These people all seem to recover way to quickly from all these freaky deaths and that final scene with the hotel? With all that shit going down in that hotel, you have time to leisurely stroll about and politely knock on doors? WHO DA FUCK DOES THAT? And why doesn't such a big ass building have fire alarms or sprinklers? The deaths were hilarious, they were better than the deaths from the Final Destination series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Nicely drawn characters, that's it. They were completely undeveloped, one-dimensional and stereotypical: Big-breasts, brainy chick, bitchy chick [tsundere], robotic monotone girl, air-head guy, meek guy, loud affable jock-type, etc.., then they each die a gruesome death.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: Watch the series, it's great for a laugh, if for nothing else.\\n",

I've never been a fan of most long-running anime series that have 100+ episodes, with exception; because a lot of it tends to be filler and if the writers haven't told the story they set out to, they're rehashing old things or cooking up inferior ones.\r\nI love that Another has only 12 episodes and I love that the beginning of the anime was written in mind with its end. It's not an anime that needs to keep coming up withnew stuff to drag out another season. The writing is strong and the mystery is engaging right up until the end. Historically, I have not been impressed by many endings, but the ultimate climax and payoff in this one is completely worth it.",

            "content": "Another was one of those series which had me waiting eagerly for Mondays to arrive and wishing that the weekend would end sooner. For twelve weeks, it was my priority above all else to watch this amazing series, and to be honest, I'm already awaiting the release of the OVA in May. If I had to say what makes it so incredible, I would cite the short series length, the clever plot with a brilliant resolution, and outstanding animation as the main contributing factors, although the promise of blood will probably be enough for most people to decide whether this show is for them ornot. Although the violence means that this is not for the faint of heart (or weak of stomach), I would nevertheless wholeheartedly recommend watching it, as it is well worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHave you heard of Tantalus? (No, a knowledge of Greek mythology is not essential to watch Another, I am simply at my wits' end with trying to describe the story without giving anything away). Tantalus was a man condemned by the gods to eternity in the underworld, immersed to the neck in a pool of water which he could not drink from, and underneath a tree laden with fruit which he could not reach, no matter how hard he tried. Now, if this is not too swift and broad a leap, this is how the storyline of Another will make you feel; every time you seem to be tantalisingly close to the answer, a new development occurs, and you have to start all over again. This series never goes where you expect it to, but it manages this without being a particularly complicated story, which is quite an achievement. I've read and watched many mystery stories, and I have found that nothing ruins the story more than confusion caused by an overloaded storyline and a huge ensemble of characters. Here, it is simple: one tightly-written, carefully thought out storyline involving a relatively small number of characters, which proves surprisingly durable as a twelve episode series, having avoided the trap of the same cliff-hanger ending every time; they always manage to throw in a new and interesting variation. The resolution of the storyline was amazing; it managed to bring all the strands of information which we had gleaned and wrap everything up in a style which was paced exactly right; fast, but not hurried or rushed. I certainly didn't see the final twist coming- not many people did- but it was masterful. It was also the most emotional moment of the series; even those of you who have laughed like maniacs throughout the entire series will suddenly become sombre during the final five minutes. Being mindful of the strict limits on what I can actually say about its specifics, I shall merely say that it was a perfect ending to a brilliant series.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply beautiful. This might actually be quite near the top in terms of the best series I have ever seen art-wise. The characters aren't that different from any other series, but the backgrounds are amazingly well defined; they really are just bliss to watch. The art mostly depicts death, lots and lots of death, with some dismemberment and impending doom thrown in. In almost every scene, there's a sense of decay, everything looks decrepit and rusty, the buildings look deserted, and there's gratuitous use of deep, dark reds wherever possible. If it's outdoors, there are crows perched on the roofs, looking hungry. If it's indoors, like the hospital, then the lights are dim and flickering occasionally (and for the provision of information to those who have watched the hospital scenes and noticed the missing fourth floor, it's because four in Japanese is either 'shi' or 'yon', depending on the context, and 'shi' can also mean 'death', so they tend to avoid using four when numbering things, like we do with thirteen. Right, fun fact session over). The use of dolls, often missing limbs, is prevalent (whether they're scary or hilarious just depends on the viewer) and appears to have more significance to the storyline than I originally thought. And every so often, in case you haven't got the message, there's a split-second image of a blood-stained knife which is lying on the floor. I mean, what could possibly happen next? (This was intentionally ironic. For those of you who don't get irony, just assume that this means it was hilarious). To sum up, the art sets up the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we can't leave out the sound, as this is key (bad musical pun; I apologise) to the aforementioned atmosphere. From the start, the music creates a sense of eeriness, from simple melodies to electronic effects and string sections. As difficult as it is to describe, I would like you to imagine a full orchestra having a psychedelic freakout (think of that section of A Day in the Life) with a hair-raising selection of electronic hums and whines added, and then multiply that by about ten. That's about what it's like (or as best as I can put it into words). The music never quite goes away, unlike in other, lighter series; it drops right down to a few notes on a piano, but still gives you the sense that something's always just about to happen. The opening has some weird and unsettling vocal melodies going on, creating tension, stress, and suspense. But after a few episodes, I'll express a preference for the ending theme; it proves that strong vocals and a few chords on a piano are more effective than the aural blitzkrieg which we are usually subjected to, and it brings a sense of peace and serenity to the end of the episode.  Basically, the soundtrack works perfectly with what's on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters; obviously, we know very little about any of them right up until the end, otherwise it wouldn't be a mystery, would it? They're all quite weird and unusual, and they're all either ruthlessly blunt or very obviously trying to avoid certain topics of conversation. As you can imagine, this makes the dialogue quite awkward. Kouichi Sakakibara, our horror story loving main character, seems to have more than half a clue what's going on, which makes a nice change from the average clueless/in denial character in the horror genre. Although it cannot be denied that he is of that genus most favoured by scriptwriters lacking inspiration, the transfer student, he does actually get some background to why he transferred. Mei Misaki develops a bit from the 'weird loner' presented in the first episode to someone who is frustrated by their situation and yet cannot change it. While near-silent and emotionless girls seem to be very common at the moment, I can promise that there is more to Mei than being a mere tribute to consumer demand. If you have watched only a few episodes, she might seem a bizarre person, but she becomes more understandable as the series progresses. Izumi Akazawa, the class representative, is blunt to the point of being rude, but is quite the deceiver and manipulator behind the scenes, as it later turns out. Reiko, who was at first glance a stereotypical 'ridiculously youthful, kind and caring female relative', turns out to have quite a temper, and appears to have a few secrets. In a sentence: don't judge them too soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me (and it's quite likely if you are indeed reading this sentence), I recommend you go and watch Another now. It's only a few hours out of your spare time and you really have nothing to lose except a night's sleep if you are easily scared. If you are going to watch it, I can recommend watching it at midnight, it's surprisingly good fun (if your idea of 'fun' is the same as mine, that is). Personally, I reckon that from a fairly dull season, Another will come to shine as easily the best new release this season, and possibly one of the better of the year. \\n\\n\r\n(Author's note: I started writing reviews because decently written reviews with no spelling or grammatical errors are almost non-existent on MAL, as very few people can be bothered with such trivialities these days, and this desperately needs redressing. While many people aren't with me on this, I believe that a review is not worth reading unless it is well written, and so I have put quite a lot of effort into writing this without making it too formal or verbose, whilst avoiding flippancy, in order to inform and entertain the people in the audience who are on my wavelength. My apologies if you are not one of those people. If you do have some constructive criticism to make, PM me or just post a comment, I'm quite happy to take it under consideration when editing this. And on that note, good night!).\\n",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nWhen it comes to anime, the horror genre is a tricky one. A fatal flaw arises right from the beginning, as each person has their own definition of horror depending on how imaginative they might be. While some may immediately think of a bunch of gruesome killings, others may think of more eerie supernatural events, and the list goes on, but because of this, the genre has a high chance of failure depending on each person's perception of horror.\r\nUnfortunately, Another just happens to fall way outside my definition of horror, and seems to fit very nicely within comedy.\r\nBut hold on asecond, this anime isn't just a horror, it's also supposed to be a mystery as well. Every year we're usually greeted with at least one mystery anime per season that I only consider mystery simply because that's what they are labeled. This is because, more often than not, anime that are supposed to be predominantly mystery, surprise, have no mystery to speak of in them, and Another is no different.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, well, saying there is absolutely no mystery might be a bit of an exaggeration, but can you really consider Another a mystery? When you get down to it, it was ultimately about finding out who the \"Another\" was so that they may be able to stop the curse that has been running rampant for 26 years. The problem with this is that for the first four episodes, it was all about Kouichi figuring out who Mei was, seeing as she had the same name as the girl who died 26 years ago, which is what people believe started the curse in the first place. So when we figure out that she is just a normal girl, everything up until this point felt like nothing more than another useless time sink.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where it gets into episodes that are completely wasted in favor of cheap shock value to try and keep the viewer hooked. Until episode 10, what did they actually learn about the Another? Nothing of any value. Where's the mystery in that? I don't find random deaths to be mysterious or horrifying in any way, and this is what the series focused on the entire time. One could argue that this narrowed down the possible suspects, but the characters did nothing with this. Even though they might have not been able to do anything to stop the curse, they could've at least devoted more time to actually trying to figure out who the Another is rather than waste time with other daily activities.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire series, there were only two episodes that truly served any purpose, one of which was the beach episode. Now, where would any anime be without a beach episode? It's practically mandatory these days, however, it wouldn't be Another without a token death scene in almost every episode now would it? The only good thing this episode did was provide us with one of the bigger clues, which made it very easy to figure out who the Another might be, as it proved that deaths could happen outside of Yomiyama. Meaning that the Another had to be on the trip. The only problem is that the explanation they gave in the next episode made any speculation as to who the Another was entirely useless. It was said that the person who died actually had gotten a brain injury while still in Yomiyama, and would've died later that day regardless of him being run over and torn to shreds by a boat on the beach. With this, it was practically back to square one since you wouldn't know whether or not the information given could be trusted or not. Although, any good mystery relies on misdirection, and this is one thing I can credit Another for at times, as it did try to send you down a wrong path or two as the series progressed, but this small aspect alone doesn't make up for how horribly executed everything else was.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other episode that had any purpose was episode 9, and regardless of it being the most frustrating one, it did provide some crucial information. As the events played out, Kouichi and his band of half-wits found a tape telling them how to stop the curse from continuing. Now, here comes the frustrating part, one of the geniuses amongst the group had the brilliant idea of ripping the tape out of the tape player to stop it from playing, instead of simply pressing the pause or stop button. You seriously have to invent an entirely new level of imbecile to describe something so moronic. Considering the current standards for incompetence in modern society have set the bar so ludicrously low, this newly discovered form of stupidity deserves some kind of fucking award. The author clearly was looking for an easy out so that they could extend the series just a bit longer, which resulted in the wonder that is the final two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing that was the ultimate \"Fuck you\" to all of the viewers. More so than the whole tape fiasco in episode nine, and that's Misaki Mei. Not only did they try to make her seem far\u00a0more important than she was for the first half of the series, but, in one of the worst reveals I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing, they confirm that she was able to tell who the Another was from the very beginning. So with this, anything of relevance that happened in all of the previous episodes was for naught, and that's just absurd. She could have at least tried to speak out and tell the other students that she knew who the Another was, and before you say they wouldn't believe her, take a second to think about this. All of these morons in Class 3 believed in a completely nonsensical curse that was nothing more than superstition until it was proven to be true in the final episode. Yes, nothing could've been done regardless if she told someone or not, but due to the fact that she actually knew the entire time, the mystery was already technically solved since the beginning. It was only a matter of figuring out how to get rid of the Another, which took seven episodes of cheap deaths, one episode to figure out how to stop the curse, one episode of half the class dying and/or killing each other, and half of the final episode to reveal and kill the Another.\\n\\n\r\nAm I the only one who sees a problem here? There was no actual deducting or piecing together of the puzzle. All Mei had to do was convince Kouichi that his aunt was the Another (which went over far too easily by the way), and it was over. I'm not saying that all the deaths could've been avoided, but I'll be damned if Mei isn't partially to blame for sitting around doing all of nothing for the previous eleven episodes. This is in no way a mystery. The beginning of the series could be considered an infinitely better mystery than the latter half, as you really have no idea who or what Mei is and what role she actually plays in the story until half way through the fifth episode. \\n\\n\r\nNot only was the \"mystery\" handled very haphazardly throughout, but the horror and supernatural aspects were as well. Even now, this series isn't listed under supernatural, most likely because horror usually blends with supernatural in some way, but knowing that this series has supernatural elements only makes everything far worse. From the beginning, we're introduced to the central plot point: the curse that started 26 years ago that still takes the lives of people today. The problem with this is that throughout the series, the curse felt like nothing more than superstition. Almost every single death throughout the bulk of the series, and especially the ones in episode eleven could be logically explained in some way rather than only explainable by taking supernatural elements into consideration. There was only one death that truly felt so farfetched that it could only seem like the work of the supernatural hand , and that was the elevator death in episode four. However, no matter how small the chance of it happening is, it was still within the realm of possibility. I understand that hospital elevator cables snapping may seem ridiculous, and it really is, but you can't rule out this having happened at least once in documented history. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the deaths, they're all easily explained. The umbrella death in episode three? Dying by falling down a flight stairs is entirely possible on its own, but regardless of this being in the original source or something P.A. Works changed, Dead Girl #1 falling on the umbrella was purely done for trying to hook the audience, and there is no easier way of doing that than making some over-the-top death scene which all the mindless little sheep will endlessly ejaculate over. Episode five? Heart attack. If I honestly have to explain this one, I'll probably lose what little hope I have left in humanity. Episode seven? Simple suicide. The real question here is why did the teacher who commited suicide have to make such a spectacle of his death? Here's a hint: shock value.\\n\\n\r\nAnd they aren't don't yet, oh no. Not only were most of the deaths earlier on in the series blown way out of proportion, P.A. Works felt the need to try and make episode eleven able to rival the entirety of a series like Higurashi in terms of deaths and overblown character reactions. So here we have a bunch of teenagers scared for their life each and every day, wondering if they'll be the next ones to die, and through the magic that is the adolescent mind, one of the previously mentioned half-wits lets two unstable girls listen to the tape so that they may also learn the marvelous way of how to stop the curse. Queue a ridiculous amount of jumping around between scenes that would make even Shinbo jealous of their artistic direction. To say this episode was shizophrenic would be quite the compliment. \\n\\n\r\nEven though there may seem to be a lot going on in this episode, there is absolutely nothing to it in the end. It's just a meaningless massacre where everyone is dying from a series of random events like having a pillar falling on top of them, being incinerated by flames or simply being killed by one other in some twisted way due to mass hysteria, paranoia and/or plain idiocy. This all goes right back to Mei, as this entire thing could've been avoided if she had spoken up sooner about who the Another is, instead of letting the entirety of Class 3 believe it was her. Even once she revealed to Kouichi that she in fact knew who the Another was (we heard this twice), Kouichi never bothered to ask her who it was the entire time before or after they were being hunted by everyone else in the mansion and Mei never brought it up again. Not only was there no real mystery to begin with, withholding the information that could've easily solved this \"mystery\" a couple episodes ago puts her at fault for just about everything. Not the Another.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, no matter how you look at it, every single death in this series was very highly dramatized to the point of absurdity for the simple sake of selling Blu-Rays. People like nonsensical violence, that's just how it is. Many series have success through using shock value (Madoka, for example), so I can't necessarily blame P.A. Works for this, as they were just trying to make money like everyone else in the world, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it was all completely superficial with no deeper meaning other than people dying for the sake of dying. If I wanted to see that, I would just turn on the news.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what exactly was Kouichi's role in all of this? Being the protagonist of the series, one would imagine that he would be the one solving the mystery by piecing together the puzzle; yet he's just as useless as the rest of the cast. His purpose was finished once he figured out the story of Mei and why she was being ignored by their class in the first place. After this, he, just like everyone else, was tagging along for the ride until the conclusion finally came around. Did he piece together evidence based on everything he's heard and encountered to come to the   conclusion that the Another was his aunt? No, that was Mei. The only purpose he served in the end was providing us with irrefutable proof that his aunt was the Another by recalling memories that even he forgot until Mei spoke with him about it during the final episode. While this wasn't necessarily bad, as he does get points for not being a beta protagonist like you would imagine him to be, it certainly wasn't good.\\n\\n\r\nNow, assuming you're not counting the death fodders that people like to call characters, by simple process of elimination, Mei is the only character left to go over, and she is by far the worst character in this series. Random Dead Kid #92 was more memorable and even had better characterization and development than she ever had. There was no real depth to her character, and unlike Kouichi, she served no purpose other than actually causing more problems for everyone around her, making her more of an antagonizing force than the Another was. Add in the fact that if she didn't have something unique to her design, she's completely indicernable among the myriads of Ayanami Rei clones out there. So what, she has a sad past, but who hasn't gone through something like losing a loved one nowadays? It could've been much worse, and I actually expected it to be seeing as just about everything else was expanded upon so ridiculously in this series. The only ounce of development that actually she received was during the mid-point of the series, which is arguably the only decent portion of it, and that's just because you finally learn about her as more than \"The bitch that no ones gives two fucks about.\"\\n\\n\r\nHowever, among the countless death fodders and pitiful excuses for characters, there is one who stands among the rest, simply for being one of the ones I hate to see the most in any given work: and that's the catalyst for an overdramatized event. In the case of Another, it would be the woman who owned the mansion that Class 3 went to on their trip. She had all of maybe 3 lines the entire time she was on screen, and was viewed as a side character of no importance, yet, out of nowhere, she decided to go on a random killing spree. This came on suddenly and was completely unwarranted, which just detracted from the main focus of the finale. During the final episode, they did decide to leave us with one terrible justification for her actions: she was said to be emotionally unstable due to the death of her grandson, but this should in no way trigger her actions seeing as his death happened earlier in the series, and by the fact that she went on the murdering spree BEFORE the news was leaked about Mei presumably being the Another. She merely served as a catalyst to help drive home the paranoia in the already unstable kids staying at the mansion, thus triggering a few of them going batshit insane after they found out that Mei was believed to be the Another. I don't even consider the old woman to be a character, but a horribly written plot device that was bad enough to actually be addressed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems with this series is, of course, the ending. Stating the obvious, they need to kill the Another so that the curse will be stopped. The only problem with this is that, while the curse is stopped for this year, each person whose life was taken by the curse has a chance to be brought back to life the next year. So, in the end, killing the Another does nothing for anyone in the future, only for the present year. Not only is the curse absolutely ridiculous, it adds on yet another layer of absurdity to everything by giving a nonsensical reason for how it started and why it continues today. Said given explanation is that 26 years ago, the people of Class 3 decided to believe that their classmate who had recently died, wasn't actually dead. Due to this, the curse continued to run rampant each year simply because it could, and it can never be stopped. In the end, the supernatural aspect is nothing more than a terrible excuse to shovel garbage down the throats of the people who eat up pointless deaths. And that is not how horror should work.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is any credit I can truly give to Another, it's the simple attention to detail that's present in things like the background, exemplary of almost every P.A. works anime. Sadly, this is quite easily the strongest point of this series. The atmosphere was great at times, yet seemingly over done at others. The main problem with this is that an anime can't be successful with only a few parts out of the many that make it up, especially not something like the atmosphere which requires other aspects of the series to be good in such a manner that it enhances the experience. More often than not, the atmosphere was ruined not because it was actually overdone, but because the scene taking place was horribly executed. In turn this made everything that took place work against any positive aspect the atmosphere might have provided. In combination with the overbearing OST that sounded like an angsty teenager turning their stereo up to over 9000 in some apparent misguided sense of rebellion against society; it more than kills any good mood that a scene might have been giving off in record time.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I think it might be P.A. Works who is cursed. Every anime they've produced has had a strong beginning, a core that gets progressively weaker and ultimately yields a poor conclusion. This trend hasn't changed through any of their work, and Another is no different. It had the potential to be a good mystery, but started to focus on all the wrong aspects as it progressed, and became nothing more than another twelve weeks of my life wasted.",

            "content": "Notice: some spoilers will be present in this review, despite my best efforts; I've made them as vague as possible, but sorry about that anyway.\r\nAnother advertises itself as a mystery horror anime; its premise is definitely interesting and right off the bat the production values look promising. Unfortunately, the show starts to fall apart halfway through, the mystery leaves you with many, MANY questions of the wrong kind and is so serious yet so over-the-top that the \"horror\" tag might as well be read as \"comedy\".\r\nThis show is a prime example of a promising story being told in the worst manner imaginable. The beginning isstrong, then it starts going downhill in the middle, with the last stretch being just a mess. This is mostly because of how the mystery is handled: at first, Another does a good job at being mysterious and creepy. You know something's up, yet you don't get many clues or even get thrown off the path to the truth. You (may) feel on edge, yet you have no idea why. Obviously, those are the signs of a good mystery. Unfortunately, it doesn't last - pretty much everything about the mysterious curse is revealed and explained long before the final stretch. The only detail that wasn't exposed was the curse's catalyst for that year. This is quite possibly one of the most disastrous moves I've ever seen in an anime, since from that point onwards the characters get almost nothing accomplished and are just swept along by the flow. They don't even TRY to figure out the last, most important piece of the puzzle, making a considerable part of the show very boring... at least, that's what it would've been if the death scenes weren't taken up to eleven.\\n\\n\r\nLet me stop talking about the plot here for a moment to comment about the death scenes, which are probably the reason why you've heard about Another. Some are creative. Some are nasty. All of them are over-the-top, to the point where they can be hilarious. Sure, many of them serve as cheap shock value to keep the viewer interested, but I'll be damned if they didn't do their twisted, morbid little job well. As soon as the first person dies, a (maybe hidden) part of you wants to keep watching to see if there'll be an even more exaggerated and ridiculous death in the series; hell, the laws of physics seem to be altered every other moment just so this can be done.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot. Perhaps one of the show's biggest flaws is that the supernatural elements are never properly explained. Okay, so many years ago someone popular from the class died, and ever since then that very class has been subject to a devastating curse. Why does that happen? Aside from the curse's annual catalyst, nothing is ever explained about it. It just happens. There's also an issue with dead people and memories (can't talk more about it without giving a big spoiler). Again, why does that happen and how? Never explained. Your guess is as good as mine, really, and if you want to know, mine is that the Grim Reaper has enough spare time to screw around with middle school students every year. Finally, Another also commits two writing sins that really annoy me: the first one is that, in multiple occasions, cell phones will malfunction for no reason whatsoever while characters are holding important conversations. This is a blatant diabolus ex machina and only serves to cheapen the writing. Second, at one point a character we've never seen before goes nuts. The problem is that the reason for that is lazily handwaved, making it seem like a poor excuse just to up the chaos even more. Speaking of chaos, let me ask one very simple question: why is the school still open? Over half a dozen people die there almost every year, yet the authorities never did something about it? And if that's the (really illogical) case, then why in the world are people still enrolling their kids there? This isn't a question that stems from deep thought, IT'S COMMON SENSE.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is hit-or-miss. The BGM itself is not bad; while it's sometimes effectively used to create a good, tense atmosphere, it's also misused some other times, and it's not very memorable. The OP, however, is just bad. The imagery fits, but the song feels incredibly out of place and is nothing special either. Same goes for the ED. As for the voice acting, it's... OK. Nothing amazing, yet nothing particularly bad either. \\n\\n\r\nAnother's greatest weakness is its characters. I don't think they even deserve to be called that - \"amoebas\" is more fitting, as they display the intelligence and personality of a single-celled being, and that's IF the characters in question have any \"relevance\" to the plot; if not, \"death fodder\" fits the bill quite nicely. For starters, we have the protagonist, Kouichi. When the body count starts to rise and his classmates desperately tell him to lay low before someone else dies, what does he do? Keep trying to find out what's going on. Hell, at one point he thought a doll was a REAL PERSON. And guess what? Aside from his stupidity and some stalker tendencies, there is nothing remarkable about him. Even worse is Mei, who is proof that Rei Ayanami expies get carte blanche from the anime fandom no matter what they do. Not only does she have no personality to speak of, in the last few episodes she reveals that she knew the answer to the mystery all along AND withheld a piece of very important info from everyone else. Because of some stupid, never-explained power she has. So basically, everything that happened, all the chaos, bodies and paranoia, almost all of the show, ALL OF IT probably wouldn't have happened if she OPENED HER MOUTH IN THE BEGINNING. Her reason for not revealing the truth doesn't make it any less aggravating.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is just as bad. Even the named ones, some of which have quite a bit of screen time, are so forgettable I don't even remember their names. The only memorable thing about them is, as usual, their lack of brains: one guy - who looks like a girl - likely has NO common sense, as he shows very delicate evidence to emotionally unstable girls; this, surprise surprise, makes them go berserk. Then there's a girl with twintails who wants to stop the calamity; there is almost always a character like this in horror/mystery movies, and she is so loyal to that common, predictable archetype that a savvy viewer will easily know everything that she will do/will happen to her before half of the anime has gone by. But worst of all is the blonde guy. While he arguably has the most \"personality\" out of the cast, this jackass is the group's idiot, and he EARNS the title. No, seriously, you heard me right, he accomplishes such a DIFFICULT GODDAMN FEAT with ease. His crowning moment of stupidity? Forcibly removing a tape AS IT'S PLAYING from the player to make it stop. Remember: this anime takes place in 1998, when tapes weren't the ancient forgotten technology they are today. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something else.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things worse, the blonde had some TOUGH competition for the title of \"most brain-dead character\" in this anime. You see, a little over halfway through we learn that one of the old students discovered something very important about the curse. He even made a \"copy\" of that knowledge for future generations. Only one problem: HE HIDES THE DAMNED THING IN AN ABANDONED SCHOOL BUILDING. The thought of handing it over to the school's staff or the police never crossed his mind? Brilliant, just brilliant. There are plenty of more characters, but really, you're not gonna care or even remember about any of them because they're pretty much just going along for the ride to the slaughterhouse. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's something that nobody can deny about Another, is that it looks good. The animation is very nice and fluid, with some obvious bumps in quality during the death scenes. The backgrounds have a great amount of detail, being sometimes nothing short of gorgeous. The lighting is good as well, which is great for creating the ideal atmosphere for each situation, something crucial for horror works. It's a shame, really; the anime didn't deserve this quality.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Another is a mess. It may be pretty, morbidly entertaining and have a strong, interesting beginning, but it is unfortunately plagued with bad, forgettable characters, a terribly mishandled mystery, half-hearted or straight up missing explanations and many other writing flaws. It serves as a great example for what not to do in the mystery horror genre, and I wouldn't recommend it - unless you like tearing apart bad works of fiction as you're watching them or find over-the-top deaths to be hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.",

            "content": "This show actually caught me by surprise. I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about it, but needless to say, I was hooked after just two episodes. Who is this girl? Why is she so special? Why is this new transfer student the only one that seems to know she\u2019s even there? A mystery indeed. The show does an amazing job leaving the audience to wonder what\u2019s going to happen next. Each episode\u2019s cliffhanger is gripping. They take things to a whole new level during the second half of the series.The character design and animation style both are top notch. Clean, sharp, and crisp. Nicely done here by P.A. Works. The opening fits the theme of this series perfectly. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything better. The ending theme is up for debate. I personally didn\u2019t care much for it, but let\u2019s not make that the focus here.\\n\\n\r\n        I can\u2019t say a whole lot without spoiling the series, but I will say this: as predictable as you will probably think it is, the ending will throw you for a loop. They even recap for you, showing all of the proof from the previous episodes and it will blow your mind because it\u2019s at that moment that you realize the pieces were all there the whole time. How it all came together at the end was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n        The actual ending itself, however, left a sour taste in my mouth for some reason. Not the solution to the mystery, not how it pieced together, but the aftermath. In other words, the epilogue is what sort of made me rethink a few things. If you do pick up this series and watch it to the end, you may or may not understand what I mean, because it\u2019s hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\n        There are some points in the series where the pacing really seems to slow down. The reason I mention this as if to say it\u2019s a problem is mainly because the audience can lose interest when nothing is happening. I found myself dozing off a few times during a couple episodes, and next thing I know, stuff is going down and I totally missed everything leading up to it. Obviously, I had to rewatch those episodes but even fully awake, some parts felt like the longest 23 minutes ever.\\n\\n\r\n         If you likes psychological, gore, horror/mystery genre. If you like more serious shows that take themselves seriously, look no further this is what you looking for.",

            "content": "\"Another\" is a series that I really wanted to like.  The initial premise whilst unoriginal was somewhat promising, but somehow it never quite managed to move away from that initial premise - to the point that it never actually went anywhere.\r\nHere's the problem I have with \"Another\": the entire series is about unraveling a murder mystery but for the greatest part of the series no unraveling is done.  Almost every conversation goes over the topic of mystery, but never is there anything developed.  It's frustrating filler which has no right to be there.\r\nThe fact that conversations continuously retread the same subject matteralso means that the characters are not given any development of their own - in 10 episodes there has only ever been scant development.  It doesn't help that the characters are all cookie cutter clones from other series: the main character Kouichi Sakakibara is a sort of weak recreation of Keichi Maebara, but shorn of all personality; Mei Misaki is simply the typical Rei clone who mumbles something every now and then; none of the other characters are of any consequence whatsoever throughout the series - they are so mind numbingly dull and hastily introduced that you won't care when they die.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the deaths in this series, they are all so ridiculous that they are hilarious.  Accidentally self-impaling on an umbrella early on is the least silly death (I could go on but I don't want to spoil it for people who are genuinely interested in seeing them).  The deaths are entirely gratuitous, so if you're looking for 'edgy' grimdark this may appeal to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is excellent for the most part: backgrounds are lavishly drawn, characters are nicely detailed and animated.  It's about the only saving grace this series has, though there were a few instances where NOPE necks were evident, and there is the broader problem that the visual style borrows liberally from Higurashi (which, incedentally I would recommend instead to anyone considering watching this).\\n\\n\r\nThe audio work for the series was... mixed.  The OP theme by Ali Project is simply terrible, completely out of setting for such a series; the OST was very nicely composed, however it was extremely poorly inserted into the series itself - often score pieces seemed completely out of place, a prime example being when characters are sitting idly in a car whilst a suspense cue plays... but nothing happens.  It's entirely out of keeping, however I would recommend people look up the OST when it gets released whereupon it may be better appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give this 5/10.  It's a shame to do so, but ultimately the series is let down by an extremely weak story and a weak set of characters who undergo no development.",

I was, naturally, captivated by the visceral and beautifully displayed fates with which the characters met and was immediately entranced by the lure of a ghost story. However, there were many plot \"twists\" hinted at through out the story, most of which seemed lazily unfinished. It almost made me feel that the authors had really no concrete plot line to begin with, and hoped the masses would be entrancedwith the gore and yangire enough to not really remember the last plot point left unexplained. In my humble opinion, there was a huge chunk of the story left completely unresolved, and they tried to make Mei out to be a more bad-ass character than she wound up being at all. Ultimately, it left a very unsavory taste in my mouth and is not something I would recommend. This is a very unpleasant thing for me to have to write, as I am a huge fan of the character design artist as well as the horror genre. I can only hope for another media installment in the series that will perhaps answer my MANY burning questions.",

So, being the weak-willed man I am, I was a little apprehensive about starting Another. I shouldn't have been. Another is psychological horror done right. It\u2019s bloody, gruesome, and flipping scary, but it\u2019s also got a strong story, beautiful animation and powerful characters.\r\nThe story is good. Not great. It could have been a lot better. The first five episodes are great. It's mystery, suspense, and terror, and it's done masterfully. After that, the plot starts to crawl. The bigmystery is unraveled, and all the suspense is sucked out. The music even admits that things aren't mysterious any more. This, surprise, is the main plot, which - don't get me wrong - is still interesting enough to occupy your attention. The story picks itself back up for the finale. The final three episodes are fantastic, and it brings a good finish to all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is pretty simple. I can\u2019t say too much without spoiling it for you, but the series does a good job of keeping it interesting with good pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle school ensemble is pretty typical. We have best friend one, best friend two, the shy girl and the strong girl. Their personalities don't go too much deeper than that. The supporting characters aren't anything you haven't seen before, but they each have their share of secrets and it\u2019s interesting to watch their personalities evolve. They\u2019re a good bunch. The real strength in characters, though, lies in Misaki Mei. She's an absolutely fascinating character. The air of mystery around her is the backbone of the whole series. Kouichi, our endearing protagonist, is also a very strong character. He\u2019s the kind of guy who gets stuff done. Unlike a lot of protagonists, he\u2019s not clueless, he\u2019s not retarded, and he\u2019s very interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. There isn\u2019t really any other way to describe it. Every scene and environment has meticulous detail and does a great job in capturing the dark atmosphere of the series \u2013rusting guardrails, flickering lights, and a thin layer of dust over everything. The characters look great and the animation brings life to everyone. I couldn\u2019t find an awkward animation among them. It\u2019s one of the best-looking series you\u2019ll see.\\n\\n\r\nAnother really isn\u2019t very scary. The music is. It\u2019ll freak you out. It sounds like the brainchild of an orchestra having a seizure and a drunken pianist. It\u2019s dark, gloomy, and creepy, and it\u2019s brilliant. The OP is Halloweenie pop song sung by a wannabe goth. It sounds corny, but it works pretty well. The ED is fantastic. It\u2019s a soft, beautiful piano solo, and it\u2019s the perfect ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion? Another is a great anime. I\u2019d recommend it to everyone, even if you don\u2019t like the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed Another. Well, that\u2019s enough out of me \u2013 go watch it for yourself. You\u2019ll be a better person because of it.\\n",

            "content": "What is considered a horror and what is considered a thriller? This is a subject that can confuse many, much like the difference between plot and story; the topic of whether or not something is a thriller or horror is a concept that most people have vague knowledge of, yet people often use incorrectly. The question to ask now is which does Another fall under? \r\nLet's begin by discussing horror versus thriller. Horror, essentially, is based off of basic, scenic brutality; it is typically filled with blood, gore, and 'creative' methods in which people die gruesome deaths. Think of common horror flicks like Halloween, Nightmareon Elm Street, or in reference to anime, Corpse Party. What is considered a thriller then? Thrillers tend to tap into the audience psychologically and build suspense based on anticipation, often scaring viewers without resorting to blood and guts; think Paranormal Activity, Silence of the Lambs, or The Sixth Sense. While deaths (when they happen) can be fairly gruesome, most of the anime has a more slow-paced, suspenseful atmosphere; there is a certain lingering feeling of lurking malice that is presented through an eerie environment and the ambiguity surrounding the mystery of Class 3. While peoples' view on what they define as horror and thriller differ based on their tolerance of what is perceived as \u2018scary\u2019 to them, Another should be considered a thriller.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, Another is pretty interesting in the sense of being mysterious. It delves into a very ambiguous semblance and piece by piece slightly becomes clearer. There aren't many good thriller anime out there, but Another did a great job at keeping a suspenseful mood. However, thriller elements aren't enough to carry a lacking plot direction and story. Like many plot twists in anime, if you watch closely and follow the dialogue events become predictable. The entirety of the series doesn't stay coherent and by the end of the series you\u2019ll end up angered by how disrespectful the ending is to your intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation and overall scenery of Another positively adds to the creepy, mysterious atmosphere of the show. The art and animation look good and are consistent, which is really what matters most. What's exceptional about Another is the fact that everything is utilized to create the mood; whether it be the weather, objects, or the school/environment itself, each plays their own role in building suspense and spook factor. Sound-wise, Another is decent. I liked the OP and the ED was fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Another are a strange group of people as a whole. I don't think there is a single normal character in this whole entire show. However, the abnormality in these characters goes hand-in-hand with the abnormality of the show. Since Another is supposed to be of the Supernatural genre, it makes sense that many things don\u2019t always fall into the realm of logical reasoning. This also applies to the attitudes, mental being, and personalities of the characters. Characters seemed fairly bland and lacking of genuine human qualities. People tragically die in front of the main male lead and he doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered in the slightest. It begs to question whether or not the characters are actually humans or simply moving corpses. I suppose asking for realistic reactions in a fictitious thriller story are a bit far-fetched on my behalf, but there is definitely something more to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to say whether or not I enjoyed Another. While being a somewhat entertaining thriller for the majority of the series, Another also has a horrible ending. Essentially, it takes all the suspense and build up from the first ten episodes and throws it out the window. I\u2019m not sure why the direction steered towards a \u2018Final Desination\u2019 type of ending or why it chose to disregard its thriller base and transition into horror, but it certainly left a sour aftertaste.",

            "content": "When trying to formulate a good mystery plot, the author is prone to making some loopholes; the biggest challenge is to prevent these from happening, or cover it with a literary device.\r\nIt is also easy to make a mystery plot without any loopholes at all, but with that case, it gains a risk of being bland and predictable. I have watched and read my own fair share of those kinds of stuff, like Detective Conan, Gosick, CSI, and other books and movies, and though I'm not saying that they're not enjoyable, some can be easily predicted halfway.\r\nThat is why not only I became a fanof Ayatsuji Yukito-sensei, I also respected P.A. Works (Angel Beats!, HanaIro) a lot more. Yes, some of you who watched it may argue that there were facts that were intentionally hidden from the audience, but isn't it just as well? This is one of those rare moments when it feels good to be cheated on.\\n\\n\r\nLet's proceed with the story. I'm gonna give it an 8/10. Wait what!?!?!!11 After all those praises, this newb otaku is giving \"Another\" only an 8? Yes, the scenario that it gave was really unique, in the sense that they give you minimum info at the start of every episode, then just as you are expecting a revelation, it will just leave you hanging and hungry for more (kind of like women LOL). Still, that atmosphere was not sustained for all of the twelve episodes. Also, after some realllllllllllly deep afterthoughts about the anime, I found one big loophole at the end that was not covered up well. Maybe you can find about that too, it's right at the last episode.\\n\r\nAlso, even if this was categorized as horror, caveat emptor: horror fans may not be too amazed with this aspect, unless you get easily freaked out by Saw-type movies, as this show will be a bloodbath.\\n\r\nOn a side note, I was one of those lucky people who were not spoiled, so my guesses were wrong. -_-\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just,,,, WHOAAAH! I'm gonna quote something I read from Japanator: it feels like you can pause the anime anywhere, anytime and it would always be a candidate for an awesome desktop bg. P.A. Works is just so good at this aspect. So yeah, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna include OP and ED for sound, since I'm not particularly a fan of those. Anyway, the BGM was a really well-used mood-setter for the anime. By any chance, do you know Hans Zimmer? And by any chance, have you watched The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan? Another's BGM is like TDK's: without the music, scenes are incomplete; without the story, the music is kind of useless. Now, I'm not trying to insult Zimmer here; what I'm saying that the se kind of music are meant to be a catalyst of a situation's atmosphere, and nothing else. And with Another's case, I'm gonna give it a 10, duh.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, one common characteristic they have is that they have fu**ing DUMB characters! You know, the feeling where you're yelling \"DAMN IT WHY ARE YOU STILL INSIDE THE DAAAANG HOUSE\" on the screen? Some characters in Another are like that. I guess it's a given for this genre, but still, they could have made some of the deaths more justifiable. Meanwhile, I have to commend Ms. Sakakibara, the female lead. I'm expecting a lot would be irritated by her, but try to put yourself in that situation; try to read her psyche whenever that time (i.e., the hating :P) comes. One good characteristic about her is that she's one of those characters that you can't really label any stereotypes. While most characters were static (which works well for this show), those handful of the lead roles were the opposite of that, and they were well-developed until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I also give it a 10. I was always waiting for the subbed episodes to come out as soon as possible, simply because \"Another\" always ends with cliffhangers. These cliffhangers did not leave me high and dry, and as soon as I finished an episode, it always makes me think, giving me some kind of faux intelligence. xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 10. I just really loved this show, and I would certainly watch and read other related materials, and I recommend you do too. n_nv\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, I recommend you watch the anime first before reading the novel or the manga, because as I mentioned before, a lot more facts are kept hidden, which would mean that your assumptions and guesses would have less evidence, making it slightly more thrilling. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is my first review, go easy on me guys! Hajimemashite. @_@",

            "content": "-No spoilers are contained within this review-\r\nStory (6/10)\r\n\tWhen I first got a grasp on the story in Another I was slightly surprised. I started to watch this show with expectations of a clich\u00e9 storyline, where the \u201csurprises\u201d could be seen from a mile away. The story in fact is something very different than what I would expect. Another takes the form of a \u201cslice of life\u201d show at the very beginning and evolves from then on into a thriller. The whole of the story follows a character named Kouichi Sakakibara after he transfers to a new high school. As he begins adjusting to his newsurroundings he notices a girl in his class named Mei Misaki. Mei (for reasons unknown) has been ostracized by the rest of the class so Kouichi, being a nice and friendly guy, starts talking to her and befriends her. Once strange accidents and calamities start befalling the classmates Kouichi takes it upon himself to find out what is going on. This story setting is something that I have never run into before, so, naturally, it caught my interest. Even though the storyline was unique it unfortunately seemed to be lacking. Exposition about the plot is very dry and sometimes hard to understand. The main character\u2019s investigation pretty much consists of sitting in the school library and sifting through old yearbooks. Seriously? I had to take points off for that. Where the story really shines is the situations. Many characters will find themselves time and again in very strenuous or perilous circumstances, all of which come out of the blue and give the watcher a very strong sense of suspense. This was what kept me going, and honestly what saves the show in my opinion. I will not spoil anything but I have to say that these parts are extremely well done and had me on the edge of my seat. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (5/10)\\n\r\n\tThe one thing that makes a thriller movie good is the atmosphere and on this section I have mixed feelings. The characters are drawn well enough and the animation quality fits together, but there is one issue. The key to scaring the audience is getting them immersed into the story, making them more susceptible to fear, but there are parts where immersion is broken. For instance near the ending (no spoilers) there is a scene in which a fire breaks out. One huge immersion breaker for me is the animation of the flames. To be blunt it\u2019s extremely bad. Honestly it looks like something out of an old Playstation game. To have something look so poor at the climax of the show is a huge mistake. To be honest I made the effort to try to ignore it so that the experience wouldn\u2019t be ruined. Other than that the animation is fine. The atmosphere is done effectively enough to tell the story with little interruption. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\n\tI\u2019m sure people who watch thrillers know that sound plays a crucial role in completing the atmosphere. In the case of Another they pull it off very well. The music is downright creepy, silence is used correctly, and the OP sets the tone for the show. I found that when the atmosphere was lacking or part of the animation was \u201chiccuping\u201d that the music and sounds would be enough to keep me involved. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\r\n\tThis one is hard for me to admit, but the characters aren\u2019t really well done. They are very average, bland, and plain cookie cutter. That being said, they still fulfill their roles as characters. I never found myself attached to the two main characters, as I should have been. Let\u2019s just leave it as this. There was nothing outstanding about them. There was enough to make me scared and interested but overall they leave something to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\n\tThis show is like junk food. You know it\u2019s bad, the ingredients are not up to par, but there\u2019s just something about it that you like. Apart from all of the faults mentioned above I still really enjoyed this show. There were a few parts that tested my patience and/or bored me, but they were brief enough that I still continued I think it was worth sticking out. Nothing about this show will astound you, make you think, or leave you breathless, but regardless it can still scare you. Everything comes together just enough so that the ride is still a lot of fun, and for me that\u2019s worth something. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.4/10)\\n\r\n\tLike I said before. This show is junk food. Not to say that it\u2019s total garbage. It is not all that well done but proved to be an entertaining and fun ride. Apart from its lackluster appearance and somewhat shaky atmosphere Another still freaked me out and gave me a good time. If you like thrillers that are gruesome and creepy, but you\u2019re not looking for something to overanalyze or study, this is a good two-dimensional product that may be worth your while. Even though it was slightly forgettable I had a good time and, if you pick it up, I hope you do too. \\n",

            "content": "Some horror flicks manage to work because of good pacing, unique presentation, and a genuinely unnerving atmosphere, others are just entertaining gorefests that make up for there weak writing and stupid characters with a healthy dosage camp. I genuinely enjoy both sides of the horror spectrum and came into Another looking for one or the other and instead got what seems to be a horrendously botched attempt at both. As far as being creepy goes, Another employs the most ridiculously derivative approach. A small pale chick and ugly dolls? It\u2019s about as done to death as it sounds . Plainly put, the series puts apitiful amount effort into establishing a legitimately creepy atmosphere using such cliche imagery isn\u2019t gonna put my hairs on end. The ominous music does it\u2019s best to compliment these scenes, but it ends up being overused and doesn\u2019t do much to elevate such weak material.\\n\\n\r\nOK, so Another clearly isn\u2019t very successful when it comes to being unnerving, but there\u2019s still the \u201cother\u201d type of horror I already brought up right? Well the death scenes are ridiculous, but Another otherwise lacks a fun sense of self-awareness. Any fun to be had in this show is reduced to simply laughing at an absurd death scene before the series try to make you take it\u2019s plot and characters seriously once again. I could forgive botched attempts at spookiness and some death scenes too silly and jarring to take seriously, but the underlying writing is so unrelentingly bad it\u2019s unbelievable. The mystery in Another in simple terms makes no sense whatsoever. All the reveals regarding the calamity of Class 3-3 have to do with either how it happens and what the rules are. There\u2019s never any explanation as to why it happens. It\u2019s just a bunch of rules applied to some class with no rhyme or reason. The idea behind the show was bad, but what ruined the show was excruciatingly terrible pacing. For starters, after the 1st couple of episodes, the show pretty much front-loads the viewers with most of the information through forced info-dumps, which is boring as hell to watch and doesn\u2019t really give you much to think about besides the mystery behind who the killer is. You know exactly what\u2019s going on for most of the show (minus who\u2019s causing it all) which guts the tension quickly.\\n\\n\r\n A lot of the problems with the plot could\u2019ve been mitigated if the series wasn\u2019t driven by a cast with perhaps one of the worst case of plot convenience and plot-induced-stupidity I\u2019ve ever seen in quite some time. This is where the characters come in unfortunately, whose actions seem to lack any semblance of logic whenever the script demands so. It\u2019s the type of stupidity that creates plot craters as opposed to holes. Why doesn\u2019t anyone try to do something about a curse for 30 years? Why doesn\u2019t anyone try to transfer out of a cursed class? Surely you\u2019d consider at least that much before trying to murder your fellow classmates right? The writing goes far enough to avoid aspects of the world that ought to get involved in the annual massacre of children (like parents, the police, etc) to the point where the school may as well have been teleported to a remote island. The worst part of it all was the reason they gave for why Mei doesn\u2019t just tell Koichi the identity the real undead person, it\u2019s an insultingly stupid handwave that essentially causes the show to be four times longer than it needed to be while making most of the deaths entirely preventable.\\n\\n\r\nKoichi himself as a character isn\u2019t stupid like the rest of the cast, but that\u2019s really all I have to say about him. He\u2019s essentially a blank slate \u201d hey project yourself on to me\u201d type of character. This sort of lead works OK for video games (though even then I\u2019d prefer not to have to put up with it), this degree of blandness is sleep inducing. They don\u2019t even really give him much to do besides talk, and talk, and talk, and hey that person just died, back to talking. There\u2019s not really much to say about the rest of the cast as individuals, but as a whole, they came off to me as nothing more than l mere death fodder whose names I never bothered learning or forgot after/during my watch-through of this series. Anyone who tries to drop information the writers deem to be to juicy to give up at the moment either do so by dropping very vague hints that you\u2019d have to rewatch the show to catch (fat chance of me doing that), or something ridiculously contrived and inconvenient happens to stop right exact moment where a truth bomb is about to be dropped. There was also a hint of romance between the two leads, but the writers barely gave it any attention, as will this review.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing to recommend about Another. As a serious mystery, it\u2019s far too dumb and not in a way that would make it fun to sit through.\\n",

            "content": "We all have our own expectations for a horror, and whether Another fits this genre is controversial. Its similarities to Final Destination, one of America's horror film series, makes it well-known for the countless freak accidents. It doesn\u2019t go without saying that Another has its shortcomings that declined to make it as serious a horror as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, which it desperately tried to compete with and failed. On the other hand, Another pulls through with a solid mystery, and the top-notch animation by P.A. Works enhances the suspense throughout the series.\r\nAnother revolves around a 26-year-old mystery of one particular high school classthat leads to multiple bloodbaths. The mystery itself is decent and adds onto the horror and suspense for each episode, but it may not please one who searches for complete logic in a mystery. The mystery only has a temporary solution, which makes it appear less serious. Multiple deaths of high school kids normally would cause a reasonable course of action to put an end to it. The fact that it went on for 26 years might turn one off. There was a slow start in introducing the mystery in full, but the characters\u2019 reactions to the situation was understandable. Apart from that, the mystery gradually develops as characters discover more clues for the first time. The ending brings all of the pieces together, including connections between some of the important characters with thorough explanations, and eliminates any potential for plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother\u2019s main problem is that it tries way too hard. Creators mock the viewer with quick cuts of dolls between scenes like \u201cBoo! Are you scared yet?\u201d The gloomy backgrounds and freak accidents were enough by themselves, and the dolls just overdid it. Even the OP places a huge emphasis on dolls. Dolls can be creepy when they want to be, but they have absolutely nothing to do with this show besides their relevance to Misaki\u2019s past. One or two deaths were unnecessarily dramatic as if it's Shakespeare. Dark music plays needlessly during conversations, but other scenes prove that the dialogue is enough for this anime. The gloomy backgrounds and freak accidents were enough alone, so the obsession with dolls and exaggeration in the scenes were avoidable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is literally nothing special about the cast. They only exist to either contribute to solving the mystery, die off, or both. However, they deserve an excessive amount of credit for giving appropriate reactions to calm or terrifying situations. Misaki is probably the only distinct character with her unique background, and her introverted behavior keeps her mysterious. Kouichi is your typical clich\u00e9 male character who feels the need to talk to a girl who is invisible to everyone else or desperately trying to figure out what\u2019s going on around him. Oppositely, Kouichi destroys the concept of a male protagonist in horror who constantly needs saving. He adjust to unfortunate changes very well, but it's annoying how he gulps or gets frightened before anything actually happens. The characters overall is probably Another's weakest point.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works did an extraordinary job with Another\u2019s animation. Finally, there is a show with an active background and not plain stills to just focus on the main characters. The blood splatter and gore are on key. The character design was good. Most of the body figures were distinct, except for two female characters who looked too much alike, and the characters' facial expressions brought terror to the screen. The background design is amazing with the dark, gloomy colors to fit the anime\u2019s theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good, but the problem came with the timing. When eerie music was necessary, it wasn\u2019t there at all and vice versa. There are no complaints about the seiyuu, especially Takamori Natsumi (voice of Misaki) who fit the role for a quiet yet mysterious girl. The sound effects, including the blood gushes and lightning strikes, fit the situations perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you will enjoy Another greatly depends on what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re looking for a logical mystery, you won\u2019t find it. Like other scary movies, you might find the deaths humorous or look past the over-exaggeration with dolls to get a scare. Personally, it was very satisfying for me, but it could be better. The mystery was good, and the high quality animation made the show even more attractive. Even though the majority of them had no unique personalities or anything special about them to make you care, the characters reacted appropriately towards the situations whether it is horrifying or a calm atmosphere. Since Another is a hit-and-miss anime, I suggest reading other (non-spoiler) reviews as well.\\n\\n\r\n*Regardless of whether you liked Another or just dissatisfied with it altogether, watch Higurashi no Naku Koro ni if you haven\u2019t already.",

I thought I need to update it since I got different feeling from the first impression I had, and watching this show till the end just reducing my points.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story is one of the most intriguing idea I ever know, and it fits perfectly as the backbone of a horror. So, at first it's just incredible. However, the routine deaths in the sense of Final Destination bored me. I lost the most of the creepiness feeling on the second halfof the series since the way it presents the horror moments is rather predictable and always repeating. The only surprising moment is just at the end episode when we got to know who the dead is (Thank god it is).\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nI simply love the art of this show (more than the manga). It really fits the atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nStill  AWESOME!, especially when I knew that ALI Project sang the opening. Well, one word of advice, pay attention to the opening scene, there are some 'small' noticeable scene which surprised me, and I love it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nAgain, I really regretted that the secret of Misaki Mei revealed in rather early episodes. This was necessary for the story development though, but I still regretted it. I mean, the only character gives me creepiness is no one but her, and I just feel a big loss when her identity revealed.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is just as predictable as any other horror story : Everyone will go mad. It doesn't matter though, since the way it shows on ep 12 is amazing even some are questionable, like why the hell the inn owner goes mad like the students?.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\r\nWell, In this part I cannot avoid spoiler, since the ones bugged my enjoyment mostly are the last two episodes.\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT\\n\r\nI enjoy watching the show, even with all the predictability, however there are some questionable moments which disturb me. Firstly the death on the elevator. I just simply don't understand it since what I know is the elevator has a kind of automatic lock to prevent it from falling when an accident happen (it was what my science teacher told me).\\n\r\nThe second is the most annoying part. On the last two episodes, there was  fire set in a room inside the inn, and instead of running as quickly as possible, almost all characters (especially the mains) are just walking calmly as if nothing happened !. They even have chit-chat before evacuating ! (What the heck! a fire is under your feet !).\\n\r\nOne more thing, this show ended rather calmly and very complete. It bugged me also, since what I always wish from this kind of show is a cliffhanger ending or an open ended one. This show gave me neither one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nThis show was promising at first, another new breath after the slice-horror/thriller show like Mirai Nikki, but the repeating horror moments just cut off my admiration, and the last two episodes are just nonsense. Thankfully there was tension built up and the one who is dead is out of my prediction.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I can sum up Another in one word it would be, \"fun.\" (Of Course if you're into horror/Suspense/Thrillers) Another is a show that's not the best of it's kind, or not the greatest in it's execution but for what it's worth, nonetheless I had a GREAT time! There's was enough suspense at the end each episode that left me wanting more and even if I fully didn't understand what was going on, the events that were shown on screen were still highly enjoyable to watch!\r\nStory:\r\nThe Story of Another is pretty simple enough; A class has a curse and the characters spend the series tryingto find ways to break it. What I thought the series done really well was to slowly provide small amounts of information on the curse as possible, building tension and leaving the viewers continually invested in the world that these characters were in. The atmosphere of the series was also a high point, showcasing sceneries that were downright creepy (I'm looking at you doll house/museum!) and enough suspense that demands you to marathon the entire series!\\n\\n\r\nWhat lacks in Another however is the pacing and organization this series had. For the first two episodes we see a SLOW development in the plot. It's at the end of episode three where things start to pick up. Even still however, I found the series constantly slowing down for more dialogue heavy moments. I found this rather frustrating especially if it came after a  drastic death scene. The plot can also be convoluted at times. Because of this it can be hard to follow the plot due to all the sudden back stories and similar names (Seriously, how many misakis are there?!?) Another point I have are the deaths themselves! To me personally, I found some of these natural occurring deaths to be too bizarre! None of the deaths had no purpose and they all seemed to be either too scripted, or too random that I actually found it comedic at times! Honestly, who didn't find that death hilarious when that guy was randomly crushed by a pillar in episode 11\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art of Another is a strong point of the series. Even though the animation can be considered standard fair of today's current gen anime, what differs the series is the detail put in each animation. what really stuck out to me was how well the dolls were drawn (Even if I despise them!) as well as how visually detailed and gruesome the death scenes looked. some deaths are certainly cringe worthy, especially to the lighthearted!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Sound of Another is at times eerie, yet only adds to the mystery surrounding this whole entire series. I enjoyed the upbeat opening theme, which suits the tone of the gruesome and fast paced final third of the series. Another piece that stuck out was the piece titled, \"The Mystery Of Yomi Yama\" that played frequently throughout the series in different renditions.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did not fit however, was the ending theme. It was a slow piece that might have fitted a drama better, but after a suspenseful episode, it was especially hard on the ears! I came to watch high school students get massacred, not Les Mis 2.0 Japanese Edition! \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe Characters in Another are sadly the weakest part of this blood fest. Aside from lead female Misaki Mei, I found myself uninterested and not invested with the characters. This is also due to lack of Character development. We don't get to know much of anyone and therefore, it's hard to feel any sympathy when a character would die. Because of this, once I got to the ending, I was shocked, but not as surprised as I could have been, due to lack of interest in the characters. In turn, the characters are simply there to advance the plot or showcase the most intense ways of dying.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nDon't mistake this anime for just \"ANOTHER\" cliched horror title (see what I did there?) xD. What you get is an interesting plot that's enjoyable as well as enough death scenes that can either make you gag, laugh or even make you say, \"whhaaattt!!?!?!\" It's definitely a fun watch and a big recommendation! \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free.\r\nRecently I came to realize how much I like the horror genre, and why did I realize this? Well, a few scares are nice, and a good, gory bloodbath every so often can be enjoyable, yes, I just said that. However, the best about horror is that because it deals with the supernatural and the unreal,  the horror genre encourages the creators to create worlds, that can put us on unease and expecting the unexpected, horror is best when it tries to unnerve us rather than scare us. Unfortunately Another missed the horror class.\r\nThe first sin of Another it\u2019s theunfortunate lack of subtlety. The early episodes feature many, many, many quick cuts to ugly doll faces, as if to say, \u201cAren't these dolls creepy? I bet you\u2019re scared now, huh?!\u201d, the only thing missing would probably be big red flashing signs \u201cyou should be scared now\u201d . There\u2019s nothing wrong with throwing subtlety out the window on occasion, but the world of Another simply isn't strange enough for those types of tricks to work.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the problems don\u2019t stop there, once the mystery develops and students begin dying, Another begins to show how ridiculous it can be. Let me just be totally honest, the first death was putting it simply, ridiculously hilarious. It\u2019s so convoluted and absurd that I dare say it\u2019s impossible to take seriously. Subsequent deaths don\u2019t reach that level of absurdity, but they never feel like they fit the story, I was half expecting Light Yagami to jump out of the bushes and say \"Just as planned!\". Another could easily be the result of merging Final Destination with animation, is just that ridiculous. The show was going for big shocks, but the death scenes call too much attention to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how are the characters? Well, every good horror show needs a great protagonist, Another gives us Kouichi Sakakibara. But don\u2019t worry, Kouichi isn't a stereotype - he doesn't have enough personality to be a stereotype in the first place. If you ordered a \"Kouichi\" from a pizzeria they would send you a pizza base. That all said about him, how about the supporting cast? Well...More than being the equivalent of little pigs going to the slaughterhouse, none of them will matter in the least, you won\u2019t have the time or the reasons to get attached to either of them and they aren't in the least bit empathetic or relatable. Thankfully there\u2019s one character that stands out, not because its good, but because isn\u2019t half bad either, Misaki Mei gets some exposure, even if in small bits, but other than that acting distant and mysterious (Rei Ayanami would be so proud\u2026) she doesn't do much, apart from providing the plot with some unexplained \u201cpower\u201d, going deeper into this subject would involve spoilers so let me stop right here.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning, P.A. Works did a fantastic job with the animation and art, well, most of time, while everything from character art to background was great, the fire animation present on the last episodes of the show, seems taken from a PlayStation 2 game. \\n\\n\r\nSound is very important to the atmosphere of a horror show, so starting from the opening performed by ALI PROJECT, to the ending performed by Annabel, all I can say it\u2019s that it was rather, disappointing, ALI PROJECT performed perhaps their worst song, and the gothic tone didn\u2019t seem to find place in the opening, as for the ending, while not bad, all I can say it\u2019s that is average, sounded nice though. But, how did the soundtrack fare? Well, it\u2019s a bit hard to say, there was a track that matched each situation, but nothing noteworthy, also average to say the least, the anime achieved to provide the unease feel more without the soundtrack than with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo most importantly, how was the mystery? Well is rather decent for the most part. There is some actual interest in finding out why all the\u201d craziness\u201d is happening, and the twist at the end isn\u2019t half bad. The problem is there\u2019s far too much padding. Stupid teenagers are a natural clich\u00e9 of the horror genre, and Another takes that cue and runs along with it. Any useful information is hidden for stupid reasons. Technology fails at convenient times. When information is learned, someone comes and screws things up. This formula repeats until exhaustion. Taken alone these don\u2019t break the entire experience, but when lumped together to prolong the mystery, all these annoying elements end up damaging any tension built.\\n\\n\r\nAnother has the foundation to be interesting, but shaky execution holds it back. It\u2019s not subtle enough to be creepy, nor is it competent enough to be a compelling mystery. It\u2019s too bad that these plot problems waste another strong visual effort from P.A. Works. But there\u2019s still some enjoyment you can manage to extract from this anime, if you like gore, there\u2019s certainly some \u201cfun\u201d to be had, even if there\u2019s nothing to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nI guess in the end Another ends up being just \u201canother\u201d anime, no pun intended.\\n",

            "content": "This is possibly one of the worst excuses for a horror/mystery that I have ever seen.\r\nThe visuals were nice, the music was mediocre, and the voice acting was slightly above average...and that's where the good things end.\r\nLet me start with the plot - it was horrible.\r\nOf course, I should elaborate. \r\nIt was painfully predictable from the outset, and most \"twist\" were obvious several episodes before they happened - and I'm usually not even good at predicting what will happen in gorror/mystery stories. Do to nearly everything being so predictable, the tension needed for a horror story to function was nonexistent.\r\nThere is one \"twist\" I couldnot predict, mainly do to how stupid and nonsensical it was. The ending. I won't give it away, but let me just say that it's a false twist, because all the characters in the story - ALL OF THEM - already know this, but the information was not given to the viewer simply in order to create that false \"twist\" at the end. The piece of info is something that one would think would be rather important to the characters, but they still never mention it while struggling to solve the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the mystery is solved in the end involves this crucial piece of information that everyone knew, but just never bothered to take into consideration, plus some handy Deus Ex Machina. Really, an incredibly intricate \"mystery\" with an even greater resolution.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters themselves...oh boy. The blandest bunch of two-dimensional death-fodder I have seen in a while. Really, most of them exist simply to die in a gory and bizzare way - which might be amusing for some people, but not for me. The Final Destination type deaths just can't make up for lack of character and story - the deaths are not impactful or meaningful if I care for the characters about as much as I would for mannequins.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets any sort of development or personality is Mei, and even she ends up being a stereotypical Rei Ayanami clone, a type of character already seen many times over.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character himself is barely worth mentioning - he is the blandest of the bunch by far, in both personality and looks.\\n\\n\r\nAll things said and done, this is a predictable \"mystery\" with a horrible resolution, an ineffective \"horror\" that relies on gore as its only horror element, akin to Final Destination, and like that film series, is just full of bland characters that are there only to die.\\n\\n\r\nI am unable to fathom how anyone, in their right mind, can give this series any score higher than a 5. \\n\\n\r\nFrom me, this shitstain on the horror/mystery genre gets the lowest score possible. I was curious at the beginning, but by the midpoint that turned into sheer hatred, which was only amplified by the ending.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSince I have been on a horror anime binge lately, I may as well review the ever popular series \"Another\". This is a series that despite its popularity, is quite divisive in terms of critical rating. I will attempt to take a fair and objective look at it and separate the actual flaws from the popularity-backlash.\r\nI'm going to get this out of the way early. The plot of Another isn't very good. Not only is it absurd in its premise and character actions, but it doesn't even feel creative or like it works within its own constructed world. The basic plot and mechanics that drivethe show are VERY clearly borrowed from the shitty Final Destination movies. Another doesn't even try to cover this up. It is amazing to me that the Newline Cinema hasn't tried to sue Another for plagiarism. A curse causes character after character to die from wildly unlikely \"Rube Goldberg\" deaths in which object A bumps into object B, causing object C to fall down and spring object D into the air, ultimately concluding in a piano being dropped on a character's head and crushing them in gory fashion. In defense of Another, many horror classics don't actually have very good plots. Was \"Nightmare on Elmstreet\" a literary masterpiece? Hell No! Another can take refuge in the fact that it is clearly a horror series and horror is about generating scares regardless of logic or realism. A drama play like the works of Tennessee Williams should have a strong level of realism and complex characters, but a horror is unbound by such constraints and Another's shitty plot is therefore excusable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother has been criticized as one of those mystery series that \"cheats\" ,so not enough is revealed to the audience in order to give them a fair chance of solving the mystery in its entirety. I will say that this is a fair criticism, for Another does indeed cheat in that regard. However, that doesn't automatically make it bad. Many of the great mystery novels including the many short stories and novels of Sherlock Holmes refuse to play fair and withhold vital information from the audience. Yet the characters, prose, and enjoyability of the plot made that flaw forgivable. Keep in mind that I'm NOT trying to compare the quality of Another to Sherlock Holmes. I'm just saying that a mystery story refusing to play fair doesn't automatically make it bad and this criticism could be seen as a tad unfair towards Another.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing Another does well is that it actually DOES have a solid soundtrack that helps give it a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, the series often spoils this atmosphere with cheap jump scares, but unlike some other horror anime, Another does at times seem to sort of know what its doing. The art is also excellent! Both the character art, background art, and animation are the highlight of the series. I also love the sharp color contrast between the blood and everything else. Perhaps an homage to the cheesy, Hammer Horror films from the 1950s and 1960s? In summary, Another has a strong soundtrack, excellent animation, and at least SOMETIMES it tries to build appropriate horror atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\\n\r\nAnother is a far cry from being a horror masterpiece that will scare the pants off you, but it isn't actually quite as bad as some critics make it out to be. Another actually DOES do some things right and although it has a weak plot and borrows far too much from Final Destination, it is a competently made series overall.",

            "content": "Intro: Another is one of those truly horrific anime series that you'll regret setting your eyes upon. Not for the fact that it's classed as a \u201chorror\u201d series but for the reason it's truly the one most ridiculously implausible stories ever. If you are anything like me, a person who doesn't scare easily or a person well rooted in all that is sound and reasonable but capable of suspending logic for a moment of fiction. You won't like this series! I found nothing scary about dolls, nothing scary about  bloody deaths and gore or crows, whatever. Is it sick and twisted? A BIG yes!But I fail to see how this series is scary/horror. I think this series will scare only the really really young or people who only can handle happy rainbows and unicorns but a savvy down-to-earth, logic minded person will probably find this funny or annoying.\\n\\n\r\nVISUALS: I really can't complain about the art. I watched it in HD 720 and it looked really great. A lot of detail went into the settings; the dolls in the doll museum looked lovely, their hair very silky and fine, their skin smooth and white. Reds looked velvety and lush. A lot of nice outside scenes as well; crisp colours and believable textures. The animation was smooth and modern techniques were used, the CG wasn't obvious and nicely blended with the rest of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nAUDIO: I love ALI Project and all that they do but using them for the opening song wasn't the right choice for such a supposedly horror series. Some of the notes and tones do sound a bit halloween-ish but it still didn't mesh well for a horror/slasher series. Strangely enough I did think the ED Theme fit the series even though that was more of a melancholy song that scary. I watched the series in Japanese dub....no complaints, and none of the sound effects were scary.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:  The story was deffo a mystery more than anything else but instead of it being a \u201cwho done it?\u201d it's more of a \u201cwho is it?\u201d There is absolutely no credibility to this series at all, and that's because the story was a cliched trainwreck. Sure it starts out nice and slow\u2014new kid in town, goes now new school. It later builds a nice foundation of mystery and suspense\u2014weird behaviour from classmates, intriguing urban legends. Then you GASP: Shocking Death, first student dies in freak accident! Bloody! Horrific! And it's all shit from there! The behaviour and logic is unreasonable, if the urban legend has been going on for as long as they said it was going on...then what sane parent would send their kid to that school? Because not only do you run the risk of that poor  kid in that class  dying in some horrifyingly funny death,  but you as a parent could die or your other children as their siblings could die, etc.  I also found it ridiculous the reach of this  so-called curse and how it attached itself to a specific classroom....yet it spans the whole town? why not demolish the classroom? Or keep assigning students to that classroom? Or better yet why keep that fucking old ass  desk? And why is the faculty participating in this farce? Why is there not a Parent/Teacher conference about this? WTF is a countermeasures task force??? These people all seem to recover way to quickly from all these freaky deaths and that final scene with the hotel? With all that shit going down in that hotel, you have time to leisurely stroll about and politely knock on doors? WHO DA FUCK DOES THAT? And why doesn't such a big ass building have fire alarms or sprinklers? The deaths were hilarious, they were better than the deaths from the Final Destination series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Nicely drawn characters, that's it. They were completely undeveloped, one-dimensional and stereotypical: Big-breasts, brainy chick, bitchy chick [tsundere], robotic monotone girl, air-head guy, meek guy, loud affable jock-type, etc.., then they each die a gruesome death.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: Watch the series, it's great for a laugh, if for nothing else.\\n",

I've never been a fan of most long-running anime series that have 100+ episodes, with exception; because a lot of it tends to be filler and if the writers haven't told the story they set out to, they're rehashing old things or cooking up inferior ones.\r\nI love that Another has only 12 episodes and I love that the beginning of the anime was written in mind with its end. It's not an anime that needs to keep coming up withnew stuff to drag out another season. The writing is strong and the mystery is engaging right up until the end. Historically, I have not been impressed by many endings, but the ultimate climax and payoff in this one is completely worth it.",

Hear me out. I'll tell you my reaction to the first episode was that it was going be a great horror series complete with a mystery that would keep you gripping to your seat every week.\r\nBOY WAS I WRONG!\r\nAnother is about a group of school kids who are the victims in a ancient curse and BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH I STOPPED CARING BY THE FOURTH EPISODE. You see that was one of thefirst things that threw me off. You have this curse that goes around killing all the kids in the High School, but the thing is they never \"Really\" explain it. I mean yes it is explained but in dialogue that's uninteresting and dialogue you will fall asleep during. Then once I stopped caring, I started not liking the show...until I saw the way they handled their death scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie to you, as time went by the show just got more silly with all the people dying and the way they were dying was just absolutely ridiculous. It was then Another turned from being disappointing to hysterically entertaining. I mean it. Another made me laugh so hard that I was in tears from the amount of ridiculous. Instead hoping for all these characters to survive, you instead were awaiting their deaths just wondering how ridiculous could possibly get. I might as well tell you: People just randomly get struck by lightning, people that you think will survive die out of sheer convenience, and...well just click this youtube link replace one of the words with bulldoser: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=616WIdWwuLM\\n\\n\r\nDo you honestly do care about the characters? No, not really. Without spoiling to best of my ability, one of the characters who ends up being the cause, you don't even know that much about other than they were there as a supporting character and somehow is the cause of the what happens. Characters that were meant to be liked, but then suffer a demise ended up a getting a cheer for the fact that no one cared by the end. Not to mention, there's a beach party episode and the show ends a light hearted note as if nothing really happened.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know that there are people out there that actually liked this show and I like it too...but for the wrong reasons. Honestly, I don't how to recommend Another to people. On the one hand, it's a poorly done show where at first glance looks promising, but then spirals into something completely absurd. On the other hand, that absurdity could be looked at from an angle were you just don't care and have fun with it. I say if you choose the latter, then I promise you will have a blast. If anything I recommend watching Another with a group of friends and just riff on it. Tear it to shreds, drink to it, just don't give two shits about what happens. Honestly, if you're going to think hard about the show then you're going to hate it. If you don't, then you're going to love it for bad it is. If you were expecting a horror anime, then let me recommend two for you: Higurashi (which is 10x scarier) and Paranoia Agent which is more of a thriller than horror. Basically, if I were summarize Another in one phrase it would be this: It's Final Destination: The Anime.",

            "content": "[TL;DR: Very well made mystery/horror adaptation, intriguing (and FINISHED) story, interesting characters and pretty art style. Little short, but high on tension and great storytelling/pacing. Some people might be turned off by the nicely detailed gore, but it IS a horror anime, so viewer discretion is advised. Discount a few plot-holes and questionable decisions of some characters, I highly recommend it to all horror/mystery enthusiasts.]\r\nAnother was a genuinely pleasant surprise. I saw very mixed reviews of this series around, but as I later found out, the more negative ones were mostly because of the amount of gore. Yes, disclaimer, there are some pretty graphic scenesin this anime, and I mean \"pretty\" in more ways than one. But first, let's start with the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very hard to review any series in the mystery/horror genre without spoiling anything. Even the short description on the MAL page spoils a fairly important plot point that only gets revealed 2-3 episodes in. But regardless of that, I can only say the Japanese are the masters of the mistery/thriller/horror genre for a good reason, and Another is a nice proof of that. Even modern Japanese culture is still teeming with mysteries of the old, ancient spirits, demons and all sorts of religious, spiritual and superstitious beliefs. The supernatural business is going strong, not to mention a plethora or urban legends and ghost stories. \"Another\" follows Sakakibara Kouichi, a faily generic teenage boy, who transfers to a new middle-school on the countryside, but from the very beginning he starts to suspect there is something weird going on. Students acting strange, whispers behind his back, and fairly normal questions they outright refuse to answer. Soon he'll realize, there is a dark secret behind Class 3-3, stretching back many decades...\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the story is excellent! It's one of those urban legend mysteries most of you might've heard while growing up, about the \"haunted house down the road\" or the \"cursed broom closet\" or something like that. Another's mystery revolves around Class 3-3 and the people connected to it, which is not very grandiose in scope, but the story is VERY intricate, suspenseful and full of twists and turns revealed slowly during the course of the anime. I have to commend the storytelling for the excellent pacing, which is a must for this genre and it's executed perfectly here. Revealing too much would confuse the audience and revealing too little would make it boring to watch, but Another's pacing is right on the dot, and keeps the interest and tension up until the very end. It is a little clich\u00e9-ish, that most of the slow release of story comes from the other characters' fervent reluctance to tell anything to the protagonist, which, in turn, is the cause of many of the bad things that happen later, but at least their reasons for it are explained in context, which is nice. Also, the storytelling is mostly organic and flowing, the creators didn't resort to shortcuts much, like flat out droll exposition or monologues, which is very commendable.\\n\\n\r\nThe other great thing about Another is the art style and direction. For one, everything is VERY dark, ominous and very high-contrast, which was a little off-putting in the beginning, if even for the sole reason of not being able to see much of anything in a few scenes, but it did grow on me as the episodes passed. It looks like the sun never shines in Yomiyama, because the lighting and colors suggest there is eternal overcast above the town, not to mention the rain and stormy weather, but if you discount the weirdness of it, it adds to the dreary atmosphere  The whole art style looks great and has a huge attention to detail,  like showing off the old, run-down school building, down to small details, like  cracked walls, dusty hallways and rust on the railings which is true to all the other locations in the anime. Some shots are incredibly photo-realistic, which makes me wonder if those have been traced from photos or heavily stylized video footage. In any case, the anime looks really good, and makes the experience that much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's tackle the gore. Yes, there are some very horrific and bloody  scenes in the series, and sadly/thankfully (depending on your disposition) the attention to detail and the intensity is very high in this case too. People die in some of the most gruesome/ridiculous ways imaginable, and you get to experience it in sickeningly high detail. I'm a closet horror fan, I grew up on horror/slasher movies (Cannibal Holocaust, Braindead, etc), and I also watched a ton of bloody anime, so I'm pretty much unfazed by gore in most it's forms, but even so, some of the scenes in Another sent a chill up my spine, which is a rare thing and I'm thankful for the experience. There are not too much of it (mostly towards the end of the series), however, I can imagine some people with less hardened stomachs would be pretty shocked/disgusted by the intensity of said scenes. So, if you are squeamish or can't stand blood, steer clear of this anime for your own good. I have to commend the creators, though, since the gore is never self-serving or included only for the shock value, but it always serves to accentuate the story in many ways. It gets a little shaky and show-off-y by the end, but I can forgive a little self-satisfying bloodfest if the rest of the series is this good.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have some complaint about Another, it has to do with the characters. Most of them are well written and fleshed out, but their reactions to certain situations in the anime is downright confusing and weird. When you realize, that most (if not all) of the horrific things in the series could've been avoided if only people would just talk to each other more, then the story loses a bit of credibility. When the mystery involves not one, but an entire group of people, it seems silly and VERY counter productive not to have all the cards on the table, especially when lives hang in the balance. While these sorts of stubborn secret keeping and lies lead to fun hijinks and misunderstandings in rom-com anime, in a mystery/horror series it usually leads to more, otherwise avoidable, death and suffering. Which is kind of the point, I know, but I can't help but feel a little reluctant about his.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, all I can say is, Another was a really pleasant surprise. It has a few shortcomings, small plot-holes and questionable character reactions, but aside from that, it's very suspenseful and thrilling series, with great art direction and well made story. It has a few very jarring (and detailed) gore scenes, but it IS a horror anime, so these kinds of things are to be expected.  If you are a horror/mystery fan, I recommend Another wholeheartedly.",

            "content": "Wow. The ending for Another blew me away simply because it wasn't what I was suspecting? One of the first things I have to say is, if you are tempted to do an internet search to find out who the dead person is before you finish watching the series, seriously don't.  Think knowing before hand could very well take away some of the enjoyment you might have. The ending is actually that good and that unexpected.\r\nThe second thing I want to say is, I had high expectations of the series when it first started and it honestly dropped later on in the series becausesome of the logic just wasn't adding up and the storyline seemed to become rather clich\u00e9. The reason thought the logic wasn't adding up was simply because I wasn't thinking in the right direction in my personal deductions of who the dead person could be. When I found who it was all of it finally added up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work for Another is beautifully done. It is highly detailed, not to mention also colorful. The characters movements is realistic. Then again so are the deaths, so if you are squeamish I highly suggest avoiding this Anime entirely. But if you can stomach a bit of gore and enjoy a good mystery... the kind you find in Higurashi and other such Anime, you will enjoy this. The sound is actually excellent and I enjoyed the overall plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well rounded and well thought out.  The interconnections between the each character is dynamic and as each piece of the puzzle is unraveled you pick up some more things one doesn't expect. I can't go into much detail though, because that would honestly contain major spoilers for this series. \\n\\n\r\nLet's just say my enjoyment for this series was very good. So much so I wish to pick up the Light Novel and Manga if possible and I am also looking forward to the live action movie that is going to be coming out to get subtitled. Not many series make me want to pick up all media for it, particularly the horror genre.",

            "content": "Ah, Another. What a wild ride. This anime has received so much negative feedback that I felt I might as well attempt to bring a little more rationality into this mess of a review section. Firstly, I'm going to address two of the most controversial points: the \"horror\", and the plethora of plotholes presented in this wonderfully appalling show. You see, the anime medium struggles with horror; this is no surprise to anyone, and the reason being is that it's difficult to associate genuine fear with something animated. However, they did a fantastic job with the deaths, and I would be lying if I saidthat it didn't have me cringing in utter disgust from time to time. However, if you go into watching Another expecting to be scared witless, or to have trouble going to sleep that night, you're sorely mistaken. Although the animation and sound design did an excellent job with creating a vividly disturbing atmosphere, it's still not enough to evoke a realistic sense of horror. And then we have the plotholes. Yes, this show is riddled with them. From a ludicrous storyline to a downright absurd bloodbath in the final two episodes and conclusion, Another is not an anime that should be taken so seriously in terms of exposition, but there is in fact one thing that the show did exceedingly well: entertain. I managed to knock out all twelve episodes in a single sitting, and that's a very rare occurrence for me indeed. Each episode left me yearning for more, and even though I knew I wasn't bearing witness to some immaculate story, I was still entertained beyond belief. And isn't that the sole purpose of media such as this? To entertain?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nSo it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who's read their fair share of reviews here, but the story was quite lackluster. I would rate this lower, but I'll be honest: I still found it engaging enough to give it the moderate score of 6. Rating it any higher would go against my beliefs on the layout of the review system, as I feel I should try and convey each category as accurately as possible, foregoing any heavy bias based on my enjoyment, while still retaining some semblance of a personal opinion. Another starts off far better than it ends. The first few episodes present a brilliant air of mystery, leaving us wondering who or what is actually real, and what the hell could possibly be going on in this little town. The narrative continues on at this pace for some time, but ultimately falls flat by the last few episodes, and seeing that we've encountered so many plotholes by this point, it's frankly hard to take the story seriously anymore. While this would be the dealbreaker for many, I really didn't mind it all too much, and I still found my craving for answers to be enough to carry me through the final episodes. In the end, we're not given the all the answers we wanted, but this is partly okay, as the show manages to maintain an ominous aura, even after its completion. The conclusion did however provide a rather interesting twist (albeit still ridiculous), but I have to give the writers credit for at least surprising me in such a way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily the area in which this anime excels the most. The animation is downright beautiful, and as an individual who loves dark and imposing art styles, I cannot express my satisfaction with words. The scenery is gorgeous, and the level of detail put into something as simple as rust on an old refrigerator kept me constantly immersed, even when the story itself was lacking. The characters are visually pleasing in almost every regard  (I know, some will argue in that they seem generic, etc. I think they look good. Sue me), and their facial expressions, especially in their reactions to the horrifying moments, were among some of the best I've seen. The gore was well-executed (no pun intended), but I will say that if you're the squeamish type, there's a few parts that'll probably make you want to turn your head (looking at you, Mr. Teacher). Overall, it's one of the most stunning series I've seen thus far in the animation department, and there are an overwhelming number of frames I felt I could've screencapped and saved into my wallpaper collection.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAnother has a very strong presence in its sound design, and while I didn't necessarily feel terror-stricken in the same way that I would from such implementation in a live-action film, the low, menacing drones and dissonant effects played an integral role in creating a remarkably sinister atmosphere. The music was skillfully orchestrated, and as using atonal and harmonic minor keys is quintessential in creating a good horror soundtrack, the composer did an excellent job with the score. If I'm going to nitpick a little bit, I did feel as though there were a few tracks that were a tad bit over-the-top, especially pertaining to the use of electric guitars, but overall I didn't mind it very much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, Mei Misaki is awesome. Maybe I'm just fanboying a little bit, but if this show were completely devoid of Misaki, or had a less appealing character in her stead, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed Another as much as I did. Well actually, no.. I definitely wouldn't have. I felt entranced by her presence, and as a character portraying the aesthetic of a dark, silent and enigmatic type, Misaki fit this role perfectly. Aside from her, the rest of the cast was pretty damn awful. I mean it. They fucking sucked. But that's kind of a given in these kinds of \"horror\" shows (notice how I keep putting quotes around that word.. you can tell how much I really consider this to be a work of horror, lol), and honestly all I can say is just don't get too attached to anyone, if you catch my drift. The bottom line, though, is that if Misaki weren't in the picture, this section's score would've easily been a 2 or 3 at the max.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow if you've read up until this point, you probably assume I'm the type of guy who likes watching B-list horror movies for the sake of getting a good laugh from the stupid exposition and silly death scenes, but that's not at all the case. Even while watching Another, I didn't really laugh at any of the death scenes (okay, I laughed quite a bit throughout the end, but at least not during the bulk of the show). I still haven't quite been able to put my finger on it, but I think what had me so compelled to keep watching this show was solely an entertainment factor born out of the overall aesthetic. I like horror, psychological and mystery stories, and even though it lacked in the horror department, it did alright from a psychological standpoint, and was a fairly decent mystery. I feel like the real amusement for me came from wondering who would die next, how it would happen, and how it would play into the atmosphere. That's it; I figured it out. The show was highly atmospheric, and that was the primary driving force behind why I viewed it as such a successful piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the easiest shows I've ever binged; it was a pleasure from start to finish. Is it the best work of horror ever? Absolutely, positively not. Is it a good mystery? I guess you could call it somewhat okay. Was it entertaining? Hell yes. As somebody who's into art, I've always taken interest in works with a grim and eerie tone, and if I were to judge Another off of that alone, I'd call it a masterpiece. Sadly, the story itself falls flat and because of that, it's very far from perfection. Another is, in my opinion, an aesthetic. An acquired taste, sure; countless people will despise this show, but you simply have to know what kind of ride you're in for if you wish to enjoy it. Packed to the brim with stunning visuals, gruesome deaths, and a kickass soundtrack, Another was indeed a spectacle. It won't scare you, and it won't leave you gawking over some brilliant narrative or well-written characters, but if you're anything like me, it'll definitely be a fun watch. \\n\\n\r\nI give Another an overall score of 7.4, and a personal grade of B+.",

            "content": "Horror in anime\u2026 how does it stand out? When I see a horror tag in an anime, I know it\u2019s more gore than it is horror. \u201cIt\u2019s gore not horror\u201d. When we say horror, it\u2019s supposed to be scary not icky. It\u2019s rare to see some really good horror in anime. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a really good horror anime. Maybe Corpse Party but it\u2019s more gory than scary too. Let me think quickly here. Nah, I really can\u2019t find anything that scary in my list. But what about Another? It\u2019s a bit eerie will it suffice as ahorror anime? Let\u2019s just see shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the beginning, (there was darkness?) the series tried to make the viewers believe that Mei Misaki is a life-form that only Sakakibastard\u2026 Sorry, I meant Sakakibara can see and interact with. I, for one, was actually fooled by it. I know, I was really stupid for falling for it. Anyway, if you try and get yourself absorbed by what the series is feeding you, it\u2019s a really cool series. A simple comparison: It\u2019s like pro-wrestling, you know it\u2019s fake, but you still watch it and still get absorbed by its various storylines. It\u2019s the same in Another, if you just absorb everything, don\u2019t question every little thing, you will surely enjoy it. But if you\u2019re not that type of person, maybe you\u2019ll hate it because the mystery is really predictable, the characters are really plain, and the re-watch value is almost zero. I want to say I\u2019m currently re-watching the series, but in truth, I\u2019ve only seen episode 1 and a half of episode 2. It\u2019s a bit boring when you sit back and try to watch it a second time. I\u2019m a bit indifferent with the story overall, but once I tried to just accept everything; it was a really fun suspense-horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tI really hate the characters in Another. Not just the main ones, but every single one of them. If you think about it, the main role of a supporting character in this series is to just basically die. Many of them died before even a proper characterization is made. I really can\u2019t remember much about them apart from how they died. Let\u2019s try it shall we? One died from falling down the stairs then an umbrella pierced her in the throat, another (hah!) died when the elevator she was riding took a nosedive from the rooftop to the basement, another one was crushed by a truck, one was crushed by a glass\u2026 you know what, I should probably stop now, trust me I know how all of them died, I just don\u2019t want to waste that much time. Anyway, back to my point. Every supporting character is just a disposable guinea pig that has no role other than dying\u2026 just like well, a guinea pig. Let me just please talk about 3 characters to make this section a bit longer.\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst, Mei Misaki, the Rei Ayanami clone of the series (Rei Ayanami clone, get it? Hahaha. Fuck me, that\u2019s funny). Like Rei Ayanami, she is a useless character. Tell me, what is the most significant thing that Mei Misaki did in 12 episodes? Apart from determining who was the extra person was, she really did nothing. This is probably the reason why I don\u2019t like kuuderes. Almost all kuuderes in anime have no real use than just to exist. Nothing else.\\n\\n\r\n\tKouchi Sakakibastard, the blandest anime protagonist in existence. I remembered during the first episode when his classmates visited him in the hospital. The camera went POV mode (Random fact, POV means point of view. I researched that a long time ago since some porns are labeled POV and I didn\u2019t know what it meant) and it looked like a fucking visual novel. It didn\u2019t happen just then but a couple of more times. He\u2019s like a typical visual novel main protagonist, bland and no motivation whatsoever. He uses other character\u2019s motivation just to keep on moving forward. I really hate this type of character.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd a little honorable mention, Akazawa, the leader of countermeasures. She is the one who should prevent the students of Year 9 Class 3 from dying. Can I just praise her for doing such an amazing job? She saved uhhh\u2026 wait, how many did she prevent from dying again? Oh, she didn\u2019t prevent anyone from dying? Oh, and what\u2019s this? He tried killing another student just to save herself? Haha! What a failure as a character she was! Bitch with an attitude that was all talk. I just can\u2019t deal with this. Let me just facepalm for a second.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tAnimation for Another was done by P.A. Works famous for works such as Angel Beats, Canaan, and my personal favorite, Nagi no Asukara. If you\u2019ve seen at least one of their works, you probably know what to expect. Well, if you don\u2019t, watching Another will surely introduce you to them. Just like in most their shows, the animation was just superb. Some of the backgrounds were just purely amazing too. I remember the hospital where the main characters met for the first time. It is really dark (not because of the lighting, duh) and will tell you, with that scene alone, what to expect in this show. Apart from that, the death scenes are probably the best looking part of the show. Blood has never looked so sexy in a series. In a series, yes, because Kara no Kyoukai is a movie and it has the sexiest blood in all of anime. Anyway, back on topic. The blood in Another is just so realistic that you might cringe while watching. The character designs are a little odd for me, but I\u2019ve dealt with it. Middle school with big boingers? We all know Japanese boobs aren\u2019t that big\u2026 wait\u2026 Hitomi Tanaka?! I forgot about her. lol. Okay, moving on\u2026 hopefully a little less pornographic.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there\u2019s one thing that I can praise this series for, it\u2019s probably the music. I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m really a sucker for suspense/thriller-esque music. When I\u2019m watching a horror show, I want to hear music that is compatible to it. Imagine watching a horror anime then suddenly a rap song was inserted (I\u2019m looking at you Shiki). That will just ruin the experience, wouldn\u2019t it? In a series that is dark it is only natural to hear thrilling music; which Another really did amazingly well. I remember the very beginning of the series, the soundtrack called \u201cThe Story of Yomiyama\u201d played during the introduction.  It really did send a chill down my spine, no joke. Apart from that, the simple background sounds are just so eerie that it\u2019s just perfect. The soundtracks for Another is not the type of music you don\u2019t want to hear when watching this series at night, with the lights out, alone\u2026 It will surely take a toll at your heart.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn regards to the (English) dub, I personally think it\u2019s shit. Monica Rial and Greg Ayres: isn\u2019t it just a recipe for disaster? Though Monica and Greg are good talents in their own right, I really think they miscast the two lead roles respectively. Monica Rial\u2019s voice (which is so upbeat and irritating) in an emotionless doll\u2019s body is probably the worst miscast I have ever seen. And please don\u2019t let me start with Greg Ayres. I\u2019ll be here all day.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, if you\u2019re planning on watching it, I recommend that you watch it subbed. Do yourself a favor. Avoid the abomination that is known as Another\u2019s English dub.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother is a good anime if you don\u2019t listen that much to what it\u2019s trying to tell you. Don\u2019t take it seriously and you will experience one hell of a creep. Though the story and character is somewhat underutilized, the animation and sound are both really good that it might still appeal to your liking. Just don\u2019t set your hopes up that much since you might (and will) be disappointed. A tip from the wise: watch it, don\u2019t take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd with all that said, after some random computations, I\u2019d gladly give an overall score of 7.12 out of 10. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for everyone but it\u2019s still an enjoyable show when you try and absorb everything that the series is feeding you. Though a bit disappointing, it\u2019s still a really interesting series. I\u2019ll just leave it with the same quote that I once said about Elfen Lied: \u201cDon\u2019t watch it for the story. Watch it for the killing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendations:\\n\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation, why don\u2019t you try Corpse Party: Tortured Souls? To this day, I still consider Corpse Party as the \u201cgoriest\u201d anime I have ever seen. Be sure to watch it uncensored so you can enjoy its content in its entirety. Though be warned that like Another, the series is not that good at storytelling and building up the characters. You\u2019ll probably just watch it for the gore anyways so go nuts.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you\u2019re afraid to hurl then why don\u2019t you try Ghost Hunt? Though not as gore as Another or Corpse Party, Ghost Hunt present a much more mystery-based story(ies) that involves the supernatural. Though I haven\u2019t finished it myself, it will surely quench your thirst for horror\u2026 well, maybe. I think some arcs are scary while others are pure shait but that\u2019s just me. You might like it. Who knows? Just give it a few go.\\n\\n\r\n\tWell, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for reading as always. Bye!\\n",

            "content": "What do we have in Another? Leads in their early teens, small remote village, a mysterious curse caused by even more mysterious death; seemingly a perfect combination for a horror anime. Nothing can go wrong, right? Well, unless you overcomplicated stuff for no reason, make ridiculous and predictable deaths and in the end solve and explain nothing, it should work out right. I just wish someone told this to the staff.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nA boy, Sakakibara Kouichi, comes into Hinamizawa\u2026 *cough* no\u2026 wait.. Yomiyama for the first time and right away he is greeted by a very mysterious group of his classmates, acting as if they werehiding a dead body in a closet, with one of them asking if he hadn\u2019t been there before.  Of course he didn\u2019t\u2026 or did he? As if it wasn\u2019t enough, on his first school day he meets a girl that is seemingly ignored by everyone\u2026 or is she unseen? He then learns about a curse that causes a mysterious and improbable (read: ridiculous) death every month and repeats every year. This is because there is one person in the class that shouldn\u2019t be there and is already dead (memories of the said person and everyone around are modified so no one knows anything).  \\n\r\nWhile this show had a LOT of promise and I genuinely loved it first few episodes, the plot slowly succumbed into a blood bath\u2026 by the end quite literally. Everything got messed up, the curse or how it started never got properly explained or, heaven forbid, permanently stopped, a certain character that could have ended it all within an episode pretended they knew nothing and let everyone die simply because. This is a perfect example of how NOT to do a mystery horror. One of the good points was that from the very beginning we were given hints about the dead person over and over.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThere was very little wrong with the art or design. It was interesting, it was fluent, maybe slightly unfitting for this kind of anime but that\u2019s about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nOpening was very good, although some people complain about it. Sound itself in anime managed to bring the atmosphere but it wasn\u2019t anything worth listening to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is the second thing this anime could have done perfectly, yet it showed us how perfectly they could mess it up. Kouichi is a very good character, slightly boring but realistic. Misaki Mei turns from a mysterious plot drive to a moe fanservice into a spineless idiot (that is, of course, never addressed within the series). The rest of the cast is there just for filling empty space, no one really memorable or extremely well done and definitely no one with a character development (turning into an insane murderer doesn\u2019t count). Actually, at the end even Kouichi acts as if nothing happened so I\u2019m not even sure if there is ANY character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nAs much as I loved the plot and characters at the beginning I hated them at the end. Many character made unreasonable decisions that were only explained by \u201cit\u2019s the curse\u201d including the leads. Charm of moe characters escapes me, so the fanservice was a waste of time for me. But it still had a very good start so it wasn\u2019t completely horrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is a perfect example of series that gradually get worse and manage to completely float away from its genre. During the last few episodes, the only mystery there is, is that you didn\u2019t know how people are going to die until about 3 minutes before their death. The curse was turned into a villainous deus ex machina that could control people\u2019s mind. No kidding. Not to mention that the end is as conclusive as would packing stuff and running away be (if the curse doesn\u2019t catch you, of course).",

            "content": "Horror is a genre that tends to be rare in anime. What horror animes exist tend to be of high quality, but generally, pure horror fiction is a woefully unrepresented genre in anime. Thankfully, after finishing Another, I am proud to say that the anime horror genre has found itself another gem.\r\nAnother concerns a young student named Sakakibara Kouichi who moves to a rural town and transfers into the local school's third class. He finds himself drawn in by the mystery of a strange girl named Misaki who wears an eyepatch and acts extremely distant. Kouichi soon finds himself in a whirlwind of supernatural intrigueand terror. Beyond this, I don't believe any more of the plot should be given away. I feel that Another works best as a story that you go into knowing as little as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is, for the most part, a tightly written horror story. Admittedly, the first episode or two is slow and at first glance the story sounds like the same old ghost story that has been beaten to death in countless horror movies. However, the story quickly takes off and becomes extremely unpredictable, creating a wildly unique story that stands out from the often formulaic horror genre. The pacing of the series is simply excellent. The early parts of the series settle for a surreal and unsettling atmosphere, whereas the plot starts to accelerate in the latter part until it reaches a chaotic frenzy in its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnother works extremely well at establishing tension and a growing sense of dread. Bizarre dream sequences, startling imagery, and gory deaths that would make Higurashi proud all work together to create an intense viewing experience. Additionally, Another devotes almost all of its time and energy to developing a rich story and is largely free of filler and pandering, save for a beach episode.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the series is not without a few flaws. Another sports a large cast of characters but only a few of them are gifted with much in the way of character development. This isn't a large issue, but I was left wanting to know more about several of the characters. Additionally, as with many supernatural mysteries, there are gaps in logic present in the story. It doesn't require as much suspension of disbelief as say, Mirai Nikki, but those who are bothered by such things are warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is excellent. Although you wouldn't imagine a show of Another's profile to receive a top quality animation job, P.A. Works has created a surprisingly good looking show. Characters are consistently sharply drawn and the backgrounds are lush with detail. The show's few action sequences are fluidly animated. The dark artistic imagery, such as the show's fixation upon dolls, fits the eerie tone well.\\n\\n\r\nHorror is many times defined by its soundtrack, a test that Another passes with flying colors. Dark moody pieces set the tone for many a scene and frenzied music punctuates the more shocking moments in the story. The opening theme is decent, whereas the ending theme is forgettable. There are few complaints to be found with the voice cast, as all the performers deliver commendable performances.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is a fantastic example of horror done right in an anime. Its not \u201cscary\u201d per say, but the atmosphere will be eaten up by horror and mystery fans alike. Attractive animation, solid pacing, and a compelling mystery all make Another a must-see for long-time horror fans or for those who are looking to get into the genre.",

            "content": "I was amazed at how great Another was. I must say that there were lots of things that had really stood out to me while I was watching. The most noticeable thing for me was the art and sound. In my opinion the art and sound really enhanced the atmosphere of the story and the events that were taking place. The music made things so uncomfortably eerie along with the decaying, drearier backgrounds. The story to me was a little cliche and predictable however that didn't stop it from being any good. There are lots of shows with the similar \"main character moves to newplace\" \"strange things happen\" \"people die\" type plot however out of the many that I have seen Another's unique take on this was very enticing... exciting. \"Another\" thing (get it?) I loved most about Another was that it brought to me the lovable and memorable character Mei Misaki. There are in the anime-verse millions, of mysterious girls characters, Mei Misaki is perhaps my number one favorite for now. She has lots of great qualities to her personality other than being strange (lol )and her hobby of drawing is something I like most. The damn girls a great artist. Lastly, and the thing that really made Another amazing to me was how thrilling it was! Especially towards the end where all chaos breaks lose and people start acting straight up savage. It was one big thrill ride for me, there is however a lot of talking during the show, so if you've ever watched Bakemonogatari or anything similar to that series then you should know what to expect. Overall I would highly recommend Another to anyone who loves Horror Mysteries because it is well worth watching!!! 9/10",

            "content": "I'll say this now... if you have problems of dolls, lots of blood, and unexpected death, I would probably not watch the first episode or any episode. \r\nPlot/Setting:\r\nI'm not going to lie, I was very confused on what the heck was happening at first. It's like a mix of Series of Unfortunate Events, Clue, The Final Destination, and Stephen King's The Shining. For twelve episodes, a lot happens. You cannot miss a second of this or you'll be lost out of your mind. However, this anime, because it is in the horror genre, was able to grab me right way. I was hook like afish out of water! I couldn't stop watching it and watching it! It's a very mysterious, horrific plot line, and for something that is based off a Japanese Book, it's very well done. Yes, it's based off a book not a manga. Now...I would love to pick up the book, and if I could speak Japanese, I would. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting really made me a bit...mad until I understood why there was so much rain. I'll tell you right now, and here's a geography lesson for you all, it does not rain that much in valley areas. There is something called a \"Rain Shadow Effect\" and what this does is if there is a mountain range between the ocean and a interior town, the rain will be stopped by the mountains which will create a dry-ish climate on the other side. It will still rain...but not as much as it did in Another. The climate is the same as an ocean city in Canada. So not much was explained to me before the geographer in me got a bit uneasy. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to say it now, I've never been a fan of the big-eyed anime characters. They really do creep me out. But because this was an horror genre anime, it fit quite nicely. Once again, I am impressed with the animation in this. There were a few \"whoopie\" moments, but they did not hesitate on the gory bits. There was enough blood that literally made me look away. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nVery nice opening. The song set the mood of the story very well. It was an eerie, but exciting and catchy song. The ending...not so much. I would've picked a more darker song than something that made me want to smile. This show is supposed to make you be at the edge of your seat and covering your mouth with your hand, not dance around like a ballerina. The rest of the soundtrack I wasn't paying much attention to since I was so focused on the scene and the dialogue, but at the one part I did listen to it, I felt it fit fine into the scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy...my favourite. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't have a lot of emotion to them. Whenever someone died, their reaction wasn't there. There was no trauma involved. I agree, from someone who has gone through trauma, shock is part of it, and yes the characters went through that, but they moved on the next day like nothing ever happened. There was no fear in their eyes except that one girl who screamed. \\n\\n\r\nMei is a stotic character. No emotions what so ever. Kouichi reminds me of Erwin from Attack on Titan for some strange reason. Izumi is actually a very likable character until the end. And many more characters have very...unexpected twist. You'll be surprised. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt was okay. I'm not a fan of horror and have a strong phobia of horror movies and anything blood. This hasn't given me nightmares yet, so I think I'm good, but I won't be watching it again. However, I found myself at the edge of my seat the entire time (the joys of the horror genre). And at the end...let's just saw I was a bit mind blown. But like I said above, don't watch this if you have a fear of dolls and grossness. This show is rated R for a reason...make sure you know what you're getting into before watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI give Another a B- or a 74% on the blood scale. \\n\\n",

            "content": "[STORY]  - 10/10\r\n-----------\r\nI have watched this anime at least 5 times with my friends, and I never got bored watching it again. I for one never watch horror because I'm very sensitive when it comes to scary things and situations, like jump scares, death, and gory scenes, but this anime really did a nice job of keeping the audience 'preoccupied' and made them curious on how the ending would be.\r\n[ART] - 10/10\r\n-----------\r\nThe art in this anime was very detailed. The blood, the scenery, the school, and the corpses. Not to sound weird of course, but they really were very detailed. The episodes also hadvery high quality as well, and was very clear for me to watch and enjoy, even when like 70% of the anime was taken place in the dark. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe opening of this anime was very interesting. It had nice background sounds as well. I have watched both subbed and dubbed for this anime, and the subbed was kind of 'weak'. Some of the characters didn't really show much emotion as they did in the dubbed, although they still did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were all very well made, especially Mei Misaki. Her appearances really formed a mysterious vibe to the audience, and really made me assume that she would never be the main protagonist accompanying out the students in her class. Some of the other character's appearances were kind of unclear to me, like Akazawa and Sakakibara. I could never read what they were thinking and what they were planning. Very mysterious. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT] - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nAgain, I'm the person who never likes horror, and even though I would be like half way into the movie / series, I would always take the chance to drop it and never watch it again. But in this anime, I wanted to drop it mid way, but it always killed me having to think about what would happen next, so I tried to hold it in and watched until the very end. The first time I watched it, I didn't really remember much because half the time I was turned away trying to not look at the scary scenes, but I watched it couple more times and I started to get over my fear of the horror for this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL] - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, it had very good plot, and really kept up the mysterious vibe and made the audience very curious on what event would occur next. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n9/10 (-1 for scaring me half to death the first time I watched it.)",

            "content": "\"Another\" was the first anime of the horror, mystery genre I've ever watched. \r\nBecause, in fact, I actually dislike watching horror movies due to various reasons. \r\nAnd after watching the first 4 episodes I thought about quiting it, because I thought, it would be kinda like the Final Destination Movies. I disliked those, because (in my opinion) the films and the story are quite focused on the way how those people die. I assumed after the first 4 episodes that would also be the case for Another...\r\nOh how wrong I was.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSo like I said above, I actually assumed that the story would focus onthe death of those people. \\n\r\nAfter watching the first 4 episodes, I (like i mentioned above), was about to quite this anime. The reason, why I kept watching it, was mainly, because I was extremely curious about the secret behind Misaki Mei. \\n\r\nUnlike Final Destination this anime focuses not on the death of the persons, but rather on the, let's call it \"curse\" of the class 9c and how those people struggle to avoid it and finally, how to undo it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very well written. Each episode of the anime feeds us viewers only little information, like puzzle pieces that we have to put together one after another, but keeping us all on the wrong path till the very end ,so, after each episode, we could basically screw the puzzle and start all over again.\\n\r\nThe beginning was a bit slow, but after the first few episodes it quickly shifts into a way faster developing story that keeps you engaged and nail biting.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nAnd the plot twist at the end was beautifully done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only things about the story I disliked are:\\n\\n\r\n1) The beginning of the anime is quite slow. And all this \"don't tell the new guy anything about this\" is a bit annoying, cause they keep doing that for quite some time. \\n\\n\r\n2) The other thing is the ending. The end it self is nicely done, but the final 2-3 episodes are a bit overstretched and are kinda missing the right feeling for me.\\n\\n\r\nI mean... \\n\r\n*SPOILER* \\n\r\n...Misaki could have just telled Sakakibara the name of the dead person, so they could have announced it. But no, let a huge bunch of  people die first, and than tell him afterwards.  I think, it would have been a way better ending, if they actually did, what I just said, and then show, how Sakakibara would react and how the would have proceeded to lift the curse.\\n\r\nThat would have added quite some drama as well, but that's just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end I was just like....woh. Never would have guessed that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful throughout the entire series. The only thing, I didn't like that much, was that I had the feeling that most of the male characters kinda had a female touch of the way, how there faces have bene drawn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was....good. Not outstanding, but not bad either. The music fits the genre and the story of the series well, but that's about it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharcters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have different personalities, but the only character that actually was really interesting, was Misaki Mei. \\n\r\nThere is not much backround story, so we don't really know much about any of them. There is also a lack of character develpoment, I feel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this series. I've actually completed the entire series in one single night. I wasn't able to go to sleep, neither were I able to stop watching it, because I was just biting my nails the whole time and needed to know, what will happen in the following episode. \\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, I actually dislike horror movies and stuff, but this series is in my opinion less horror, but more mystery.\\n\\n\r\nI would basically recommend this anime to anyone (except to little children and people, who have a weak heart), who like the mystery genre and don't have a problem with quite a lot of blood being spilled. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: I will never ever bring an umbrella with me again.",

            "content": "When searching at night for anime I say to myself I'll watch one episode now and the rest tomorrow. This has always been my rule and I've stuck by this. However, When I watched the first episode of Another I couldn't help but to watch the next one and then the next and so on for the entire series. Before I knew it, it was 4 in the morning and I had watched the entire series. \r\nThe story starts when the protagonist starts his new school but is bed ridden due to some illness he procures the day he was meant to join. He meetsa strange girl in the hospital at night (I know...cliched a bit). That's where he meets Misaki. When he finally goes to school, he realizes something very odd is happening in his class and his class mates are dieing accidentally. The story is about his year in class 3 and how he discovers the horrible fate that awaits anyone who has anything to do with class 3.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to crack down now and get straight into this. The story in this anime was amazing. Defiantly worth the 9 I gave it. I have no idea who wrote Another but bravo to you. It had some amazing ability to give me hints and clues to what was going on and eventually I had worked out what was going to happen and I made my predictions. I could not have been any more stupid. The story swiftly and neatly changed and more things came to light. I thought I had it worked out but then more things happened and my prediction was as useful as a bra for a four year old. The constant changing of the story kept me entertained and I could not stop watching it. \\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the art, I thought the drawing of the characters was pretty average for the year the anime was made. Nothing special yet I gave the art a 9. You must be thinking I'm retarded or something but no. The backgrounds were stunning. Truly worthy of a 10 (if not for the mediocre character design). The level of detail and care taken into making these backgrounds had me in awe. The artists also managed to achieve a very good dull, run down, ghost town sort of look by making wood look faded and metal objects rusty. This effect complimented the horror theme.\\n\\n\r\nSorry guys but I really haven't got much to say about the sound except that it's very fitting for the scenes that it's heard in. I usually skip the intros and outros of shows so again, sorry about that one. I will say though that scenes where it's very violent, it has eerie sound sin the background which add very well to the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI do think I've gone over the character's art a bit but the characters themselves are well defined as individual people. That might not make much sense but if you have watched bad anime with a crap ton of cliches then you will know that writers tend to get lazy and characters end up with very similar personalities, eradicating all variety and potential in the anime. Another does not have this problem since the characters have got their own personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime alot and would recommend it to horror lovers with the promise of plenty of blood and suprise. My only criticisms is that this anime, with a few more episodes, could have some romance between the two protagonists. But I guess I'm just saying that as an aid fan of the horror/comedy/romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the story a 9, Art a 9, Sound a 10, Character an 8, Enjoyment a 10 and the overall score a 9. These scores I decided whilst trying to think of the tastes of others in mind but personally I'd award this show a straight out 10. Ignore what everyone else says, this is the anime to be watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're still reading at this point, thanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "Hey guys, my first review here. \r\nFor my reviews, I will not mention the setting or summarize the plot, because people can read that on the page of the anime. \r\nI think that Another, is a very neat piece of work overall. I first started watching this series a few years back, and I actually dropped it after watching the first few episodes of the series. Man, am I glad to pick it back up. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI gave the story of Another an 8 because I thought that it was rather slow-paced at the beginning section of the anime. Many people decide what anime theywant to watch next by looking at the genres of the anime. I personally like horror and mystery series, which is why I decided to give Another a try. There was definitely the mystery attribute during the whole anime, but I being the \"patient\" guy that I am, got somewhat frustrated after watching the first few episodes since nothing was really explained until the end. I am not going to spoil any part of the anime, and I would just like to say that Another has some of the most intense mystery and murder cliffhangers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nBeing from P.A. works, the art was just fantastic. One of the best attributes of this anime was the detailed quality of the characters. One thing that I really liked were the red eyes of Misaki Moe Mei (MMM). Obviously, her eye was not the only reason I gave the art section a 9. The background graphics were terrific as well. The wind blowing on the rooftop of the school and the detail of the leaves flying and blowing made the whole anime experience much more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nYou can tell that the producers behind this anime have definitely put a lot of effort behind choosing, selecting, and/or creating OSTs and songs for the opening, ending, and run-time music. Although I personally did not love the opening, I think that it really suits the vibe of the anime in general. Being a mystery and horror anime, the violin is an instrument that is utilized a lot. From the soundtracks of this song, especially at certain scenes where dread is jump on you from around the corner, the music that is played is very well matched. This factor of this anime further helps create the gloomy atmosphere of the anime with ease, and arouse feelings of dread and suspicion in the audience. The juxtaposition between the constant feelings of dread and the peaceful \"ending\" song provides a period of relaxing for the audience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nHard to explain why I gave this a 9 without spoiling. I'll just say that each of the characters that gets introduced actually play a major role in the story. At the start, you get introduced to a medium cast of characters, and despite mostly being side characters, the plot is constructed in such a way that each of the characters actually matter later on in the story FOR A WHILE. It is very likely for the audience to get confused over the characters at the beginning. Some reactions that I had were: \"Why are they doing that?\" \"Who is she or WHAT is she?\" \"What.\". And guys, get confused, but don't stop watching. It gets explained. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nCouldn't stop watching after episode _. I really enjoyed this series, and it is one of the best tragedy pieces I have watched so far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you like horror and mystery, by all means give this a try. Just hang in there, and do not drop it like I did once after watching a few episodes, and I am sure you will not regret watching this series.\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy oh boy.... I watched this on a whim and was utterly unprepared for what it flung at me. Brilliant anime.\r\nStory - 9 \r\nThe greatest thing about this anime's story was that it surprised me right up until the last second. As soon as I thought I had figured it out, something happened and it blew my ideas out the window. I genuinely couldn't stop watching. If you like easy to follow plots, I'd probably avoid this. I won't deny it's a slog to try to work out what is going on and how it fits together. But that's part of the appeal forpeople like me, who enjoy figuring this stuff out.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 \\n\r\nI thought the art of this was brilliant. The dolls in the shop gave me genuine goosebumps, Mei's eye was just freaky and was quite obviously not real. I hesitate to give this a ten though because I have seen more realistic blood in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe 8 is solely for the opening theme which was just....... creepy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9 \\n\r\nWhilst there isn't much back story to the majority of the characters, the way they are presented in the present is good enough to compensate. Plus, the events of this anime wouldn't suit expansion of characters' stories. You'll understand if you watch or have seen it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed an anime as much as this for a long time. I found myself eagerly trying to solve the mystery as I watched and I definitely 'felt' the emotions of the characters, which isn't something I experience too often so that made it that much more enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\r\nWatch this. This is very similar to the Final Destination film series but it is done so much better and in a way that is a bit more believable, albeit with a bit more of the supernatural edge.\\n\\n\r\nOh and avoid if you have a weak stomach. This anime doesn't hold back in the blood and guts department.\\n",

            "content": "As an avid horror fan, I am a sucker for horror anime when done right.The world of anime has not really seen a good horror one since the Higurashi series.\r\n So, when I first heard of Another getting an anime series, I had really high expectations from it.\r\n    So, quitting all the blahblah's, here goes my review~\r\n  Another starts with the male protagonist, Kouichi Sakahibara, coming to the dreaded class 3, in the summer of 1998. Soon he grows suspicious of the fearful atmosphere and the fact that his classmates are hiding something from him. Meanwhile, hefinds a beautiful and lonely girl named Mei Misaki and learns the fact that she might have something to do with the mysterious deaths occuring to the students of class 3 each year.\\n\r\nPlot- 5/10...The story is somewhat unique, however flawed. A lot is left unexplained, like how does the dead one really come every year? How can Mei see death if her eye is just that of a doll? Also, towards the end, it basically becomes a boring survival bloodfest.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 4/10...arguably the weakest part of the show. Another has a large set of characters, and so no one gets the time to develop much over 12 episodes. A couple more episodes just to flesh out the side characters would have made it more enjoyable.The standout part was the budding relationship between the two main characters, which was nicely done. Misaki's backstory gives the character some depth, but Kouichi was really the weak link. Often stoic and bland, in the final episode he was basically talking in phone calmly being surrounded by fire, which doesn't make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- 8.5/10....the strongest part of the show. Nicely drawn characters makes the gory scenes a tad easier to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack- 5/10....meh, nothing really to talk about this, was average at best.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 5/10....Another fails miserably as a horror series.At certain points, it tries too hard to scare the audience, by showing random images of dolls and using a scary soundtrack. The death scenes, though gory, are really laughable (not to mention most of the deaths are of piercing something through the neck).\\n\r\n  However, it succeeds in the mystery part, and with a decent plot twist, keeps you right on the edge. Also, the side characters were interesting, a fact non existent in most other anime.The ending is decent enough and gives the series a proper closure.\\n\r\nSo, despite its flaws, and the fact that it should have had more episodes, you will enjoy this anime if you like good,old fashioned mystery elements. However, if you go into this anime for the chills, you may feel disappointed to some extent.\\n",

            "content": "I'm extremely skeptical when it comes to any sort of animated entertainment and horror. I went it into this anime having been told this was one of the best horror anime, and I have to say I was slightly disappointed. To be fair, I never asked why it was so good so for all I knew, this anime couldve been praised for things other than its horror setting. And that was exactly how I felt.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story follows the bland and over curious Kouichi, a new transfer student to extremely strange and eerie high school, as he meets the mysterious and beautiful Mei, a girlwho seems to be non existent to everyone else in the class. His curiosity about the school and Mei leads him down some dark paths and he learns about forces which no one can comprehend, all of which he ends up trying to battle with the aid of his classmates. It sounds like a really interesting story but I feel like it wasn't told as well as it could have.\\n\\n\r\nI found the the first episode to be boring. Like really boring. And for me, first impressions have a really large impact on my opinion of an anime, especially if said anime is 12 episodes long. So even though subsequent episodes made the story more interesting, I continued to have a somewhat negative opinion of the anime as I continued to watch it. However, having said that, this anime has some really freaking good cliffhangers, the only thing which really kept me interested in investing my time in this anime. As one episode ended, I wanted desperately to know what going to happen the next episode despite the fact that the episodes themselves were somewhat boring to me. It's only after things are finally explained that I really began to appreciate what the first few episodes were about, and thus my first impressions had been erased quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the things which made me dislike the first few episodes is the fact that I felt like the anime tried way too hard to be a horror. It continually placed you in really clich\u00e9 settings like a dark under-funded hospital or a shop full of creepy looking dolls. To me, it wasn't scary at all and I would've much preferred it just be a regular mystery anime rather than a mysterious horror.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the topic of Another trying too hard to be a horror, I want to talk about the background music, particularly in the first few episodes. The background music itself was actually pretty darn good; it was ominous, mysterious, fear-evoking. However, I felt like it was overused and definitely used in scenes which didn't need such background music. If I recall correctly, there is a scene where a few of Kouichi's new classmates visit him in the hospital to say hi in he first episode. Sure they act a little strangely, but I really did not see the need for the music to be that typical to any sort of horror medium. This only really seems to be a problem for me the first few episodes because as the series went on, I found that the music started to fit the scenes a lot more appropriately and the horror music was used a lot less, making it more scary when it was actually played.\\n\\n\r\nI watch english dubs and I have to say that I probably should have watched the subbed version instead, especially seeing that it was better than the dub in the OVA which I could not find dubbed. It's not to say they were particularly bad. The voice acting was decent. No one felt out of place but at the same time, no one stood out as being good. However, I did like Mei's voice acting. Despite being kind of bland due to her \"I don't really give a shit\" attitude, it really made her all the more mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the more major problems I had when I was watching Another. Aside from Mei and her mysteriousness, all the other characters were bland, uninteresting, and at times just plain annoying. None of the characters are really given much development, if any at all, and even if they were given development, most of it led nowehere. In particular, I want to point out Izumi's development. She's initially shown as cold and heartless but after things are explained you realise that she knows she comes off as cold and heartless but it is for a good cause. Its an interesting development, however it leads nowhere. There is also her connection to Kouichi prior to knowing him at their current highschool which was introduced but had absolutely no connection to the story, well at least one that I couldn't see and which still bugs me quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the things that this anime does extremely well. It's beautiful in just every scene and it's heavenly in the scenes where it wants to be beautiful. While I wasn't scared at all, the art did a really good job of compensating for it by always having me slightly on edge because the art was more realistic and vivid. This also translated to more gruesome moments when people die, especially since deaths are kind of creative in this anime. Seeing how well the art was done when somebody's neck was pierced by a sharp object or stabbed by more than enough knives really made it seem all the more gruesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the first few episodes were boring and this anime tried too much to be scary. However, as events are properly explained and the anime tried less and less to be scary, I satrted to appreciate it a lot more, especially the final two episodes which really explored some pretty dark themes and which were extremely intense.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I helped you in the decision as to whether you want to watch this anime or not. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!",

            "content": "My first review in MAL!!\r\nWhen I first saw the synopsis of Another ,it seemed to have a really interesting plot. Not many animes deal with this sort of school horror involving superstitions of the type found in many old institutions.\r\nThe start though painfully slow ,managed to keep me interested long enough to reach the third episode where things first started to get interesting..\r\nThings start to pick up once Sakakibara learns the truth about Misaki and why nobody else seems to recognise her existence .The suspense and potential horrors in store for me really excited me.\r\n*MINOR SPOILER*\r\nThe ending of the show though turned out to bereally disappointing.Almost all of the deaths occurred due to simple lack of communication between the classmates.When the stakes are so high you would think the class would act together. But what we actually got to see was a mindless and baffling blood bath, all of which could have been prevented..\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show never really manages to fulfil its potential.Most of the deaths are comical rather than scary.The creators seem to be under a delusion that amount of blood=horror.The heavy handed direction of the show irked me a lot.There was no subtlety.At frequent intervals,random shots of creepy dolls were shown almost to artificially crank up the horror levels.\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves,with the exception of Misaki,none of the characters are likable at all.Stupid teenagers are a common sight in such gore fests,but some of the actions of the students were really baffling.As for the main lead ,Koichi was so painfully dense that I shouted at him through the screen many times!!\\n\r\nOverall ,I would give it a 7 rating.The story was awesome and had loads of potential,but lack of proper direction and a weak ending pretty much ruined the show for me.Still,I would recommend watching Another.When it touches its high points,it's worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nP.S:The scene in the last episode where Koichi, standing in the middle of a raging fire, finally finds a network on his mobile and calls Misaki is the most unintentionally funny moment I've ever watched in an anime :P",

One day he realizes there\u2019s a mysterious girl at the school, she wears a patch in her left eye, seems distant from everything, nobody pays attention at her even when she enters the classroom and sits at the empty desk. He decides to talk to her to find out what\u2019s happening but his classmates warn him not get in contact with her, he just has to act like she doesn\u2019texist. Ignoring this warning he contacts her and mysterious accidents begin his classmates. Kouichi finds out that all these strange events started 26 years ago and decides to know the beginning of this mystery.\\n\\n\r\nI must say this anime got my attention until the last episode the problem is they don\u2019t tell us what happened 26 years ago, why these strange accidents happen, who\u2019s the responsible for all this to happen. Not even the way to avoid these accidents is clear. All these points make the story to be a bit complex and make it not a horror story at all, but very scheming. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kouichi Sakakibara y Mei Misaki, have a lot of punch together ad become nice, especially Mei. She\u2019s mysterious, always speaks with calm, seems not scared of anything and wears that eye patchin her left eye hiding something. Tambi\u00e9n es muy simp\u00e1tica. A bit of love between themewould have been good.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of this story are the last two episodes that become in a mess of murders and paranoia, besides taking us to a final you don\u2019t understand very well. Another surprise is that there\u2019s floor 4 at the hospital. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all questions that remain with no answer and to the nonsensical final I recommend this anime to everyone.\\n",

            "content": "What surprises me when I watch horror anime is not just how the plot works, but how interesting the characters turn out to be. I mean, you see them first as their normal, peaceful state, but then, a situation strikes like lightning, taking a big impact. Usually, the reaction of character in horror anime never ceases to amuse me. I just think it's so unique how it not only shows the character's true nature, but also develops them as the show goes on.\r\nWith this anime however, it wasn't as pleasing on the character part. In fact, that was the weakest part.\r\nSo first off, since theplot is the reason for characters, I'll discuss that first. Another starts with a transfer student, a.k.a Kouichi Sakakibara, going to a new school in Class 3-3. First it seems normal and all that, but then he notices how one girl, Mei Misaki, is treated by her classmates as if she doesn't exist. Because of his curiosity as to why, he continues to associate with Mei more, causing dark turns relating to the students of Class 3-3.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty good, but how they portrayed it?  Well, it was okay. I mean, I did like the suspense shown when something happens, but the pacing was really, really slow. If you make a horror anime with suspense, you need to make it good enough for the watcher to stay and continue watching. Putting surprises once in a while is fine, but the rest of the plot itself needs to be interesting too. When I watched this, it felt like all scenes without the suspense element was just filler, until the anime reveals itself. There were times where I did not want to go through the boring dialogue and character. To be fair, I appreciated the dark theme like the show promised, but not the lack of interesting plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be made up for the plot. I'm a fan of P.A. Works because I've always thought that their art was beautiful. They did a really good job of not just making the characters detailed, but the backgrounds and settings detailed and fitting for a dark theme. Definitely one of the strong points in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell, now that we talked about the stronger elements of Another, let's talk about their weakest, character. When making a main character, I expect he or she to NOT be one of those cliche characters that don't make any change in the anime, whatsoever. Sadly, Another is just like that. At least with the main guy character, Kouichi Sakakibara. He's supposed to help out with the plot, to make it better, to develop the story. Instead, all he does is become curious about a situation, but doesn't really find a way to solve the problem. And he lacks personality too. \\n\r\nTalking about Mei Misaki though, she's way different. Honestly, she's the only character that I like in this anime. She has a mysterious personality, and that makes her character way creepier. She was the only one actually trying the support the plot and develop it, while everyone else was too busy being stupid. You can say whatever defense you want for the characters, but really? I don't see anything important in them except Mei Misaki. Don't believe me? Here's some evidence. \\n\r\nOne of the supporting characters, Izumi Akazawa, is an example of a character done wrong. She's supposed to be the in charge of the headcounts of the incidents happening in Class 3-3, but she's doing a horrible job of it. Her \"backstory\" wasn't even one bit sad, and in fact, it was confusing. The supporting characters aren't even helping. It's like all of them are fillers. The rest of the class had zero development and was only there so that they would have people for the deaths.\\n\\n\r\nSound? Same with characters--okay. The opening does have an amazing dark feeling that gets the show started which I did enjoy. The ending was weird. The suspense usually happens at the end, and then it gives us this slow, calm setting. It doesn't fit the ending at all. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I know I might have not written the best review there is on this show, but I think my thoughts are reasonable. Do I want you to watch it? Depends. If you like horror and gore, go ahead, but you might not like the big amount of filler in there. Also, if you can stand the useless characters, then go ahead. I don't regret watching it, not at all. It's just, I expected a lot more to this. Honestly, they were heading into a really good direction, but then they somehow couldn't find their way and became completely lost. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Another' is an anime that looks and feels like a great horror detective story. It puts the viewer in a camera room, displays some fucked up stuff on the screens and then expects you to work out what really happened. And just when you think you have an idea of what might be going on, 'Another' busts through the camera room door and starts violently slapping your face until you have no idea what's happening. It then leaves and shows you more fucked up stuff on the screens. And it does it well. \r\nThe story is simple. It follows the life of 15 yearold Kouichi Sakakibara as he moves to Yomiyama North middle school at the beginning of the series.  He's a smart fellow who asks a lot of questions and quickly adapts to his new surroundings. He's also eager to adapt (iykwim) to Mei Misaki, his mysterious eye-patch wearing female classmate. Apparently though, that eye-patch isn't the only mysterious thing about her and as soon as Kouichi makes contact batshit crazy stuff starts to happen. This is your basic premise and the anime builds on that.\\n\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode horror series there's a lot of gore here. 'Another' has no qualms about precise, high quality bloody mayhem. This is a huge plus for any horror enthusiast. The way the story ties these bloody events together and slaps you with a plot twist after another is sure to keep you frosty. Spare pair of pants strongly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a strong point here. Kouichi is your typical kind of guy caught up in a series of events he does not understand. He tries to keep a straight face when shit gets real but we know that he's quaking underneath. Mei is an emotionless femme fatal who has Kouichi's undivided attention. Watching those two is like watching a National Geographic documentary of a hypnotized Lion following a disinterested Lioness half across the savannah with hyenas tearing animals apart in the background. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a couple of notable supporting characters. The uptight tsundere Izumi Akazawa, the chick in charge of the class, who'd make a good friend to a rock or seaweed. An annoying addition to the cast but she does help make the series complete. The laid back Naoya Teshigawara who is actually a pretty cool character and always tries to help out in his own retarded way. Then there's bookworm Yukari Sakuragi who'd be handy to have around if you ever daydreamt during class (cough Kouichi cough) and forgot to take notes. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a horde of other characters - women who like to get smashed on high quality alcoholic beverages, silent psychopathic types, old melodramatic geezers... you get the idea, it's a fun cast all around.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all that said, 'Another' is not without its flaws. For starters this series is too short. It tries to deliver too much plot material in a very short amount of time (only 12 episodes). There was definitely room for more (think Higurashi) and the plot could have easily been spaced out to make this a 24 episode series. And as strong as the plot is ( a solid 9 imo) there are certain things that make the ending very anticlimactic. That is, the ending is unsatisfying and that is quite enough to knock down a point in the story section.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest - the art is flawless, the gore scenes captivating and the overall tone and art style complements the story well. The sound department however is slightly lacking. The sound effects and voice acting is good but the OST leaves room for improvement. I quite literally failed to notice it and the opening and ending songs don't fit to this particular anime AT ALL, imo. \\n\\n\r\nWith all of the above mentioned, the enjoyment section deserves a solid 8 points. You will be intrigued, you might get scared depending on your disposition and sometimes you might just pause the video and ask yourself if that really just happened (dat daydream). A must see for horror fans. Generally however, I'd recommend this to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 8 points.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!",

I think that most of them were stupid because they didn't make sense to me and that's the only flaw the anime has, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10 \\n\r\nIf I forget about the characters I really enjoyed this anime. It was amazing I was hiding under my covers many times and I really loved it. That's why I think it deserves a 9, so: \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9 \\n\r\nI recommend it to anyone who loves a good horror anime!",

            "content": "Another\uff08\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\uff09is some kind of psychological/supernatural horror anime that has some scares here and there and a really, really, actually really bad OP. No, seriously, what the hell is that opening? It\u2019s scarier than the whole concept of the anime. But anyway, let\u2019s begin with the story concept. By the way, I\u2019ll try my best to hinder spoilers.\r\nStory Concept\r\nSomewhere in Japan, we have a little town in the middle of nowhere called Yomiyama\uff08\u591c\u898b\u5c71\uff09which is your plain, rural town. Then we have the protagonist, Sakakibara Kouichi\uff08\u698a\u539f\u6052\u4e00\uff09, which is a guy with a disease called pneumothorax, which is why he goes to Yomiyama. Or maybe he went becausehis father was working in a research in India\u2026? Well whatever it is, it\u2019s not actually the focus of the series (I think). The thing is, he\u2019s transferred to a Middle School in Yomiyama, and that\u2019s where the story actually begins. The issue with the classroom that he gets transferred to is, it\u2019s a cursed classroom. Meaning, real gruesome deaths of adolescents because of the curse. Anyway, we also have Misaki Mei\uff08\u898b\u5d0e\u9cf4\uff09, a heroine loli that has deep meaning in the story. And she has an eye-patch. There are also a whole cast of classmates, their relatives and the protagonists\u2019 relatives, but of course I won\u2019t name all of them. Specially because they are not that important anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, the concept of a cursed classroom would not be bad, until the moment you notice that it makes no sense to have a dozens of deaths of children (and their relatives) from the same classroom and nobody actually giving a crap. Well that\u2019s what happens on Another. For some reason, every death goes unnoticed by everyone besides the characters of the story, as if it\u2019s a given that, if you are in a cursed classroom and you might die, you have to keep on that classroom. Couldn\u2019t the school just close down and the students go live in Another city? Noticed the lame pun?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, the anime itself states that you the curse only affects those in the perimeter of the town, so yes it would be completely okay to blow up the whole school building. It can\u2019t be that it\u2019s the sole school in the whole town. But then, maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding the concept of the curse, and it would actually pass on to the next classroom/next school building. Whatever is the \u201crules\u201d of that game, it feels stupid anyway when you have a dozens of children and 3, 4 adults in a situation of life and death every god damned year and still no one in the rest of the city ever realizes or helps. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s a secret. Now that\u2019s something I take my hat off for Shiki; even being the slightly rushed adaptation that it was, it had that awesome moment when the villagers finally realized and accepted the truth of what was happening, and reacted to it. In a gruesome manner. Anyway on to the next part.\\n\\n\r\nArt Concept\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s anime, so I believe it goes without saying how the characters\u2019 art concept is. And yes, sometimes the art gets really bad, and you can easily spot deformed characters in the background. Or maybe it was intentional for the freaky effect?\\n\\n\r\nThe scenarios are okay, actually. I\u2019m no art specialist and I actually don\u2019t have much of an opinion, but I don\u2019t remember backgrounds being bad.\\n\\n\r\nOn a fast note (since I\u2019ll be talking about this on a special part), the deaths have no censoring as far as I recall, so yea lots of blood on your screen\u2026 Sometimes a bit too much. Not that this is a bad thing, of course.\\n\\n\r\nAudio Concept\\n\\n\r\nI am, once again, no specialist in this audio thingy, but I can tell you that, being death as the nature of the anime, it has really dull and unimpressive BGMs throughout the whole time, except when someone\u2019s dying. Usually you get a really drastic change of music, which may or may not scare you (mostly for it\u2019s 140% increase in volume), and that music is usually fitting for the death scene. Wait, I like the ring \u201cDeath Scene\u201d has. From now on I\u2019ll be referring to the deaths as Death Scenes.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Scene Concept\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be frank out of the bat. Most of the Death Scenes are ridiculous, not to say obvious. I mean, the protagonist talks to a girl that has no name (or at least is not important at all, because I don\u2019t remember it) beside a truck with a big window glass on it\u2026 Oh, don\u2019t forget the glass was not fastened on anything. Yep, the moment you see it, you\u2019ll immediately notice a Death Scene is coming\u2015 except it had no death! What a combo breaker, for a series that kills a character per episode.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Scenes, besides being quite weird and ridiculous, are also forcibly gruesome. In most Death Scenes, the dying character will agonize and agonize, and you don\u2019t know if you should smirk at the silliness or be horrified at the fact the Death Scenes are actually well-looking (as in, good art) while the plain scenes are not. Well, I just generalized. Like I said in the Art Concept part, it\u2019s not a bad-looking anime. It just suffers the same problem as every other anime: low budget. So they pay more in the Death Scenes, and less in the other scenes. Happens all the time. Anyway off to the next section.\\n\\n\r\nLiving Zombies in the (Burning) Cursed Inn!! (some spoilers here, you\u2019ve been warned)\\n\\n\r\n\u2026Yea I just wanted to go for a weird name. Truth be told, most of Another was the horror of \u201cdying at any time, being hopeless before death\u201d, which might also be the sole redemption of the show itself. But then, because of story details I can\u2019t spoil, you get a whole classroom of students walking like zombies (not in the literal sense) around the inn, trying to kill you with brooms and\u2026 whatever happens to be in their hands. Of course I understand the purpose was to show what a human being can do when facing imminent death but\u2026 please, could you walk like you actually want to kill? Felt really preposterous when dozens of students started to close in around the protagonists like zombies. Or maybe I\u2019m just out of the loop and zombies are really fast? I haven\u2019t really played any new zombie games after Resident Evil 4 (lol quite some time, I know).\\n\r\nAnd then, on the very last episode, we get the epitome of nonsensical happenings and a exploding inn. By the way does that inn have gasoline inside it's walls or something? I can't see Another way (Another pun!) to have it so explosive. Even the lightnings were overboard, and in the very end I expected more of a drama than what we get. To be honest, there's not much to say about the last episode; it's just weird. Well, I've seen worse, and I'm sure everyone did, too, but that doesn't mean I should just say it's fabulous. Because it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn\u2019t deserve more than 6/10. It does have it\u2019s ups and downs, but it quite lost it's way twisting around the mystical and the horror, and in the end I would've been happier if the protagonist went Chris Reddfield mode and shoot everyone in the head while running around the explosive mansion with his girl. Oh yea that would've been one awesome ending. Nothing like sarcasm to finish a review. :P",

The art is good, the sound (not music though) was great and highly engaging, but the story... It starts so good and ends, well you'll have to decide on your own. I thought it was an affront to the story and characters, but your mileage will vary. This show suffers a bit from the Akamega Kill syndrome (or the other way around) and style of Shakespearean story writing I go to Anime to avoid.

            "content": "With its creepy atmosphere and stylistically graphic deaths, Another is a wickedly fun horror ride. It effectively (and gleefully) uses horror tropes to provide plenty of chills, and has enough mystery to keep you guessing from beginning to end. While it is not close to being subtle or refine, its insatiable desire to entertain and its love for bloodletting make it a gory good time. Too bad it doesn't have much staying power.\r\nThe basic set up is something we've seen plenty of times in horror. Our protagonist Kouichi Sakakibara moves from the big city, in this case Tokyo, to a small town to live withrelatives because his father is a way, and his mother is well... diseased. Due to lunge problems, Kouchi enters high school late, an has spent a good amount of time in the hospital. When he finally does begin attending school he finds that a girl he met the day before is release from the hospital, Mei Misaki, is one of his classmate in class 3-3. However, nobody else in class acknowledges her existence... or maybe they are not aware of it (dun dun dun). At the same time Kouichi can't help but think he is being kept in the dark about something by his classmates. Soon, a string of gruesome deaths begin to take place, all of which are somehow connected to class 3-3.\\n\\n\r\nThe story provides plenty of mysteries for viewers to view on. What exactly is going on with class3-3? What are Kouichi's classmates hiding from him and why? Has Kouchi visited the town before? If he had, is it somehow connected to the current situation? Is Mei real, a figment of Kouichi's imagination, or a spirit from beyond? These questions arise and keep you interested in what might happen next. And you know you won't get the answers until late into the story, because the show has a fondness of being cryptic and throwing in red herrings. This is good because it allows the show to maintain the suspense throughout its run; keeping the viewership wondering what exactly is going on. Even with bits and pieces of the truth being revealed, there is a veil of mystery that only gets pulled away in the show's final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show is hardly subtle in its handling of its mysteries. In fact, they are almost always in your face. The plot may as well be yelling \"SOMETHING STRANGE IS HAPPENING!\" sometimes. This is especially true for the early episodes before the plot really kicks in. Most of those episodes consisted of Kouchi's classmates dodging his questions or downright refusing to answer them. While this does keep a good sense of mystery in the early episodes, it can get a bit frustrating when the show seems like it is about to give answers and fakes-out at the last second. Luckily, it does have the sense to actually give answers before your patience runs out, and provides plenty of gruesomely fun deaths along the way. Even when the story gets rolling, however, there is a distinct lack of subtlety.\\n\\n\r\nThe deaths in Another are as entertaining as they are bloody, and boy, are they bloody. Whether they be homicide, suicide, or accident so improbable that they had to be of supernatural decent; the deaths are extremely graphic. However, rather than being gratuitous to the point of off-putting, the deaths are nightmarish spectacles that are equal parts shocking and gleeful. This is largely due to the frenetic energy they are directed with; the deaths are easily the most exciting moments in the show. The fact that majority of the show is talky and cryptic makes the straightforward, matter-of-fact death scenes all the more effective, in all their deranged blood-soaked glory. Admittedly, the energy the deaths are directed with can be a double-edged sword. Sometimes they can end up being more comedic than frightening. Still, the show cannot be accused of being boring or uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is a show that is far more concerned with its plot than it is with its characters. As far as main characters go, Kouichi is actually kinda plain. You get the impression he is generally a good guy, with a rather convenient fascination with the strange and mysterious; especially with Mei and the ominous circumstances surrounding class 3-3. Outside of what the plot requires him to be, he doesn't have much personality, honestly. Mei is the more interesting of our two protagonist, as she is surrounded by mystery a good portion of the show. Her back story also gives a reasonable explanation for her peculiar personality. However, she can be too calm and reserved; her stoic demeanor makes her a bit too distant to completely relate to. The rest of the cast just feel kind of like fodder for the body count. Even more important characters like the head of countermeasures (of what I won't say because of spoilers) Izumi Akazawa, and Kouichi's other school yard friends feel kind of like walking corpses, and you half expect one of them to drop dead at any moment. The problem with the characters is that they are mechanisms of the plot, rather than figures that you can get invested in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Another looks really good. Admittedly, the character designs fall into the same glossy, attractive look that all the shows from studio P.A. Works have. This isn't a bad thing, however, as they are still very polished and never get off model; even when they are going bat-shit crazy. More impressive are the elaborate backgrounds that make up the world of Another. What should be just a mundane school and a mundane town, instead look downright ominous because of the fantastic art direction. The use of lighting and sometimes subdued color pallet (there are plenty of bright moments in the show) does wonders for the show's atmosphere. The music is also well composed and fittingly creepy. The thing is, though, Another wields its soundtrack like a sledgehammer. There is rarely a time when the music is used with subtlety, and often plays very loud at times that you should be scared. That is not to say it isn't effective, it is much of the time; but also overplayed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is nothing short of a bloody good time. The show has no shortage of thrills and chills. The mystery, while being a bit gimmicky, will keep you on your toes. However, the back-hand to all this is that Another doesn't have much in re-watch value. The bland cast provides little in way of characterization, and once the mystery is unraveled there honestly isn't much reason to re-visit the show. Add to that the hammer-fist manner in which the show handles its content. As it stands, Another is a deliciously graphic thrill ride, if only just for one viewing.",

            "content": "Another is one of those animes that you can sit down and watch and then want to rewatch right after you finish.   Now i will talk about many different reasons why to watch this ranging from the story to the osts and i'll give a rating for all of them\r\nFirst off is the story. It is very well done and you can tell the author put ALOT of time into making it. It can get pretty complicated at times which to me was great. This anime will make you believe one thing at one point then another thing at a different point andthen once again make you believe something else. It is very very unpredictable. At episode 3 is when it gets really good and really drew me in. after that episode something happens every single episode after that which is done extremely well. how they ended the story was perfect in my opinion. overall i give the story a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nOk now for the osts. the osts are so good in this anime and really makes the moments in this anime more intense. now they are not as good as shikis osts where but they are great.  now to me good osts are a must have for an anime. and another osts will make it so suspensful. one thing is at the start of each episode after episode 3 a song plays while recaping the big moment tht happened in the last episode and it made those scenes so much more better. i give the osts a 9/10. because while it made it very suspensful and other emotions too it just wasn't as creepy as it could have been\\n\\n\r\ncharacters are very very likable. and prety good character development by alot of the characters. since it would spoil it if i explained why it is good i won't so i'll leave it to you guys to see when you watch it. i'll give the characters a 10/10 because what hapens in the end ws such a great portray of how people might act if this really happens.\\n\\n\r\ndeath scenes. now this i a horror anime so there will be death scenes. and they are very bloody. however most of them are very creative and so well done. there was 2 scenes that i felt where done very very well and thats the 1st two death scenes. the 2nd death scene was my favorite because afterwards i didn't want to go near or in what had killed the person.  overall the death scenes get a 10/10\\n\\n\r\ncreepy factor. now i thought i'd add this since it is a horror anime. now for me i've been watching horror movies since i was 7 and i'm almost 19 now. so blood and gore dosn't scare me. but if blood does scare you then this anime will scare you lol. now i found this anime suspensful more then scary or creepy (except for the scenes with the dolls those where just plain out creepy lol) but to otherpeople i could see it creeping them out or even scaring them so i'll give it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\noverall i give this anime a 10/10 but thats not saying it is perfect because it isn't. but it is pretty close in my opinion. i've yet to find a perfect anime and i've only seen a few close to perfect ones and this makes that list. if yu watch another you won't be able to stop untill it's over.",

            "content": "Sometimes tragedies are unavoidable, sometimes they are necessary to get a point across. Another accomplishes that with as many victims as it needs, though the results can be a bit on the brainless side when the cast is a bunch of school kids.\r\nSTORY: I think it's about time to put something next to the Higurashi series in terms of being a successful horror anime, no Another isn't scary though neither was Higurashi, but Another functions extremely well as a horror story despite some hic ups here and there. Another is 2012's first and maybe only horror anime to come out, but damn, it's a blessingthat it didn't end up like it's blood soaked victims and becomes one of 2012's better series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is about Koichi Sasakibara who goes to live with his aunt and grandparents in the small town of Yomiyama which hosts his new particular school, where his mother grew up while his father goes on a trip to India. Though his arrival to school is delayed by a medical problem and has to go to the hospital. There he meets Misaki Mei and there is where it all begins, from random deaths to getting to know your fellow \"nonexistent\", and a tragedy that occurs yearly that takes the lives of those in classroom 9-3. Sasakibara will be going through a lot with the viewers in tow. \\n\\n\r\nBy the viewer going through some trials I mean the anime takes it time building up to one of the biggest reveals in the show, it's really jarring on one's patience and even frustrating as everything around the oblivious main character that happens just makes you want to slap him silly, and Misaki Mei herself doesn't help other than lead you to believe in the misleading (I wonder who's dead, it may seem obvious but it actually isn't what you'd think, making it into a great twist), making it almost a red herring in a way.\\n\r\nMisaki herself is the biggest source of the anime's vagueness and it's biggest turn of events. But her personally, a very stoic one to the point of being a stiff (But metaphorical and literal if you count the animation) and an emotionless robot, can easily pull you out of tense heavy scenes with her lack of reaction, she only truly emotes well towards the end of the show.\\n\r\nBut by the halfway point, Misaki and Sasakibara become something of an unofficial couple, and their relationship will make you want to root for them, especially for what their future has in store. The anime doesn't put too much focus on their relationship as a couple like how a romance anime would do, but thankfully stays on track with the initial story with this relationship being a very strong character growth for the both of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of some faulty characterizations, the class itself, with the exception of some of the individuals stepping up to bigger role from being background characters, is a big bunch of idiots, or at least where the series first big reveal is concerned as their decision for handling their calamity is borderline retarded.\\n\r\nBut when everything falls apart, their panicked states and desperate actions become fascinating to watch, especially during the series explosive end.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not for the faint of heart, the death scenes are usually very brutal, especially the first surprising one, blood is no stranger in Another.\\n\r\nEven with all of the death and blood coming from everywhere, the anime somehow manages to crowbar in one of anime's biggest and most irritating cliches: the beach episode... Yep, though it end with another death, this is something that obviously had no place to offer other than fan service.\\n\r\nAnd very, very occasionally, the show actually has a brief sense of humor, especially in one very bizarre day dream Sasakibara has (One that could actually happen in context of the show).\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a couple of bad habits like withdrawing important stuff until the end that really needed to have been mentioned sooner otherwise would seem like it was made up right on the spot, even though one moment is actually hinted at throughout the entire anime, making the final twist quite the eye opener.\\n\r\nNot to mention a few cliches, like for example: When a huge reveal is about to be uncovered, right at the very second it gets into it, the show is interrupted and said reveal get postponed, and sometimes postpones into the next episode, and, during the beginning of the series, the anime obnoxiously throws in completely random shots of creepy looking dolls, but it's not totally annoying and when it's gone it's definitely not missed.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, Another is an effective horror story, the set ups, the tone, and especially the audio is all great. It's a series that grows better with each episode, even with it's cringe worthy moments both good ones and bad ones, Another becomes one of anime's few true horror series.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: P.A. Works, the guy responsible for series such as Angel Beats and Clannad have once again prove themselves to be quite the talented group of artists. Everything looks extremely dark and gloomy, making the visual experience one for the horror books. The character designs are diverse and distinctive (The character designs are done by Noizi Ito, the same person who did the designs for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Shakugan no Shana) so overall there's nothing dull or boring to look at that's not unintentional. However, when actual movement is in talks, it is mostly severely lacking as there is little to almost no movement at all, some episodes even start off with a still frame that can last for minutes. But when the gruesome deaths come around, expect no corner cutting, it's done in horrific detail.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: As with the animation, it's sounds as creepy and spooky as any good horror story should, as it ties up the strings called the atmosphere of the anime quite nicely. But my only complaint is the opening theme, an out of place pop song by Annabel, though is still a decent song anyway.\\n\r\nVoice acting is decent too.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Great atmosphere, very creepy and well set up.\\n\r\n+ Initial episodes lead up a very good twist and the series improves from there on.\\n\r\n+ The growing relationship between the main characters is one that makes you want to cheer them on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mixed:\\n\r\n+/- Good character designs and an overall dark and gloomy feel that matches perfectly with the atmosphere / Limited animation all around.\\n\r\n+/- The audio greatly reinforces the overall feel of the anime. / The anime sometimes over uses it to compensate ordinary scenes.\\n\r\n+/- Misaki grows from being a plot device and into major character. / Her personality can take you out of the gruesome scenes when the most she emotes is an annoyed look.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- The beginning can be quite a strain on one's patience.\\n\r\n- The actions of the class of 9-3 are mostly big helpings of stupidity and frustration.\\n\r\n- A beach episode, in a horror anime... Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing I'm seriously hoping that doesn't occur, countless sequels. This is pretty much the Final Destination of anime, though I hope it won't become that literally with mediocre sequel after sequel.",

            "content": "Thunder's review nr.5: Another\r\nDid you heard that sound? No? Are you sure I... wait do you feel it? That chill in the air.. what are you doing!? Wait!! Ahhhh... why.. grrh why? Wait you do not know? What!? Why are asking me?! You are the ghost or something! Can't I get any explanation?! Oh well, at least we had some time together, despite you being such lifeless and cold individual. (Then he died in terrible agony)\r\nLadies and gentlemen, after this terrible intro that could summarize what's this anime is like I gladly welcome you to this review of Another.\r\nThe Story 4/10\r\nThe whole show feel likea good old horror movie. It basically have everything that characterize one as such. Creepy atmosphere: check, pale and strange characters: check, small town: check, beach fanservice episode: che... ah it is an anime after all. Despite the show being very dark and quite violent sometimes it still have some stereotypes that a lot of works in the anime media share, but they are a little bit turned down here. Thanks to that this anime achieved serious and creepy atmosphere, route that very few anime choose which is actually quite refreshing. Feeling of an old horror movie definitely is a great merit to Another. Although sometimes it may try a bit to hard to be as dark as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting itself isn't that original neither for an anime or a horror movie. Your classical small town with secret that everybody want to keep for themselves. Our main protagonist is a transfer student, he doesn't understand what's going on and know just as much as we do. Story is about him discovering this mysterious curse that plague his new class for over a decade and trying to solve it. I think that curse itself is interested enough to keep us engage. There are many rules that apply to it and our poor students, with our MC Kouichi Sakakibara on the head of the group bringing new things to the table every episode. Sadly, this show have a hard time trying to surprise us, actually there are few series I've seen that are so predictable. We can easily guess who die next or what probably will happen at the end of the episode and all that without thinking too much.\\n\\n\r\nSadly I can't say that Another fulfilled its role as a horror. If you are afraid of the people dying randomly out of the blue, you should be fine. Especially if you're afraid of blood, much blood. Otherwise if you're looking for something scarier that just brutal violence you won't find it here. That's saddening me even more because it feels like the great atmosphere that this anime posses is wasted. We're left with mysteriously looking but empty shell.\\n\\n\r\nCurse itself is sadly never explained to us as much as it should. I was thinking that it's fine if they keep all the explanations until the end when they want to end everything with a huge BANG. And when bang is a right word to describe the ending it wasn't the kind of bang I wanted to see. We can say that it was kind of incomplete bang. Ending is very open ended, with a lot things unexplained and what's worse nothing constantly resolved. It wouldn't surprise me if we would get Another II and it would have ended exactly the same way as its predecessor, that's how typical horror movies work and that's how good mystery or horror shows should NOT work.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and the Animation 7/10\\n\r\nAnother have a quite nice dark art style. Everything seems dark and depressing even when the sun is up, which suits this anime perfectly. Backgrounds are well done and everything seems decently detailed. Animation itself is nothing special but it can get very good when some death scene kicks in. It's a very gory anime and if you are not used to see well animated violence it may shock you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters could use a little more details. Everybody look just as your another average person with pale skin (Yes, everyone are pale). Presenting average persons looks may suit some horror movie but animations here don't have amount of facial details that can help us to distinguish different characters from each other. There is always something more needed, that's why anime with unique art styles are made. When overall art style here is quite nice it is generic when it comes to characters and that's sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound 7/10\\n\r\nMusic is creepy and contributes a lot to the atmosphere and enjoyment of the whole show. There aren't any outstanding tracks but there aren't any bad either, I will give soundtrack good score just because it works really well with this show. Opening was ok, a little mysterious and creepy(I really overuse that word in this review)song but it was more of a contrast to the show than intro that suited what's going on. On the other hand I found the ending song unskippable. It have still images in it but I did not mind that and I just sat there relaxed and enjoyed this beautiful and calm song as my soul lifted itself to heaven.\\n\\n\r\nI found voice acting monotone and boring but I think we have to blame dialogues for it, not voice actors.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters 3/10\\n\r\nI can't say that characters presented in this show does not suit its atmosphere because they do. Most of them are depressing and creepy teenagers. It's hard to find someone that isn't seriously sick, doesn't have problem with his family or friends and etc... But a lot of characters didn't have any background story at all. Death scenes may be very well animated and music in them suitable but they have little impact when we know next to nothing about people dying. Also show try to show us reasons for which we supposed to care for characters but they are weak, the strongest of them all is probably this: 10 second long dream or memory(who knows) of one girl that probably fallen in love and worry about her brother (no explanations why).\\n\\n\r\nBoth main and supporting cast are composed mostly, if not only of one and two dimensional characters. Most of them are quite boring and even way that most of them talk is boring and monotone. The only character I kind of liked was girl with the eyepatch (Misaki) she was kind of lifeless but at least she had some decent background story surrounding her.\\n\\n\r\nMy greatest issue with characters is certainly our main character, Kouichi Sakakibara. He's completely average teenager with no useful attitudes whatsoever and some sickness that makes him spend a lot of time in hospital (and give us some reason to care about him). He even looks completely normal (only a little pale of course). Just as the horde of similar anime characters he's that nice guy with brown and slightly spiky hair. Kouichi and all others characters are a little strange bunch of people. If you're a high school student and see someone brutally dying for the first time, how much time does it take for you recover from shock? Weeks, maybe days if you're a tough one? Well, it takes around 10 seconds for our main and supporting cast which is highly unrealistic. Some unnamed characters panic somewhat but our brave heroes act like nothing happened very next hour.\\n\\n\r\nThose characters suit strange atmosphere of Another perfectly and honestly they are so serious I have to give them some credit for that. 3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nDespite lacking in areas of story and characters, every aspect in the show added to the creepy and dark atmosphere of Another, which I enjoyed. If you like dark anime you will probably find it at least decently enjoyable just as me, otherwise there's nothing for you here. If you dislike gore you will have serious problem watching this anime because, violent deaths are high points in it. I probably would have enjoyed this anime more if it weren't as predictable and if mystery element wasn't that random.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nWatching Another wasn't a complete waste. At least it was decently entertaining. Too bad that it weren't something better, it's nice to have mysteriously and interestingly looking shell but what's most important is always hidden insight. Another is a great example of a show that is so bad that it actually becomes enjoyable watch.",

            "content": "Another PA Works anime finished.\r\nI have to say, first and foremost, this was an intense experience especially towards the end.\r\nThe drawings were standard per PA Works and the setting wasn't very remarkable. The overall color scheme, however, matched well with the progression of the story.\r\nThis anime is not for the fainthearted though I daresay, any of the horror genre isn't. It starts off mildly and one starts to question, and in each episode the tension just escalates, as well as the fear and paranoia. As a viewer, you're given front row seats to the twists and turns, the race against time, and the darkness thatultimately swallows the characters (side characters, that is) blood and gore and explosions and madness - which is what I liked about the whole series. The story took me hostage for half  a day from real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters though, I'm not sure where to start. Hmm...well, the Male lead was rather ordinary, without anything special about him, not even a strong personality (and perhaps that's just the way he is supposed to be, though I find that boring). The Female lead was detached to the very end, and even though she had that interesting ability, it wasn't enough to have a sort of \"attachment\" to her character.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the side-characters, though their actions were a little too idiotic sometimes, it's important to note that with the given situation, anyone would leave logic behind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was pleasantly terrified while watching the anime, though not entirely frightened. It's a grand case of paranoia infused with the supernatural.\\n",

            "content": "~WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AWAIT BELOW~\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nHmm... What makes a good, thrilling tale of horror?\r\nYes, that's a pretty blanket question right there--and quite subjective to boot. However, I find myself rarely watching anything horror-related nowadays because it's all too narrow-minded for me. One example is that of the slasher sub-genre, which I find myself always none too fond of since I like to get to know the characters as more than one-dimensional stereotypes, and I only believe character death should either to come with some sort of attribution later on within the grand scheme of the story or serve as a lesson for the audience.\r\nIn other words,I believe that a good horror movie/show should be more about the atmosphere and gravity of a situation, with involving characters that the audience can relate to so that there can be hope that said characters will be okay by the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother, originally written by Yukito Ayatsuji and adapted by P.A. Works, addresses some of my points in a positive manner, but also others in a rather mediocre or even negative manner. Overall, it's a fairly mixed bag, and I will attempt to address as much as I can without stepping too far into spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, there's the plot. In summary, during the year of 1972, there was a popular girl named Misaki in Class 3-3 who suddenly died under unknown circumstances. Her spirit, haunting the class from the year after onward, causes an annual \"calamity\" to occur where everyone who is or once was part of the class--both students and teachers alike--to die horribly in various accidents with each passing month. Jump to 1998 and a new student, Kouichi Sakakibara, soon realizes that there is a girl in his class who the other members claim \"doesn't exist,\" known as Mei Misaki. From there, Kouichi is thrown into the fearful, ominous calamity himself where death happens to be none too kind to strangers...\\n\\n\r\nI will say this: the concept for this plot does look pretty potentially exciting on paper (very Final Destination-meets-The Grudge, if I do say so myself), and, for the most part, Another does, indeed, deliver on this; however, there is definitely some padding here-and-there, as there needs to be room for suspense in just about any horror, right? Although, I will also admit that the suspense can seem a bit ridiculous, with musical cues sometimes coming across as rather overbearing or--at worst--hilarious. Nonetheless, the execution of this story does accomplish its goal to thrill and excite, but its really the cast that becomes the focal point of how things truly turn out.\\n\\n\r\nKouichi and Mei are certainly solid--perhaps even above-average--quality; they are a cool duo and I managed to find myself pretty attached to them along the way. However, it's the ensemble cast that I have plenty of issues with...\\n\\n\r\nI conclude the major problem stems from the fact that this is only a 12-episode anime, and there's a whole classroom full of kids that I'm supposed to know well and feel concern for--but that just didn't happen while I was watching this show. Granted, the deaths could be gruesome, and I didn't want anyone to die, but I didn't feel that I got to notice any of them as bona fide characters--just a collective body count. Heck, even those that were shown more often than others didn't really get enough time devoted to them, either on-screen or in dialogue; it became such a dilemma for me, in fact, that I tended to like certain classmates over others solely based upon their individual hair styles. \"Oh, golly! I hope the girl with the long, brown hair and PJs doesn't die! Hooray, she didn't!\" (Truth be told, she really didn't.)\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the art is nice to look at; it is P.A. Works, after all. Speaking of the art, I think the real reason I didn't want any of the characters to die was because the designs were done by Noizi Ito, who also did the original artwork for such classics as Suzumiya and Shakugan no Shana. It's all just so... moe--though, trust me, it all still works out fashionably well, given the included creepy darkness and pasty color palette.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I was kind of making fun of the music before, I actually really liked it overall. When it worked, it really worked, and the ending song is just so pleasant, yet oh, so eerie, too. I do, however, believe that some scenes may have acted better without any music playing in the background (such as inside the store from the second episode) to keep things from getting too ridiculous, instead utilizing the scene's own strength to capture its audience, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, Another is truly a mixed bag. Those who like a little bit of everything in their horror from creeping to slashing will probably enjoy this ride for all it's worth; I know I most certainly did. Nonetheless, the major faults should not be overlooked, and while there are some nit-picks as seen by others that I could address, I dare not quash anymore of the mystery and--sometimes chuckle-worthy--suspense that this show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nAnother gave me just enough of what I wanted to keep me happy, and as of right now, that's all I could ever ask for~",

            "content": "26 years ago a student from Yomi North's class 3 grade 9 passes away.  The next day however someone in the class says he's still alive. . . as the year goes on others agree that he exist until the time the student graduates.  From this point on class 3 grade 9 has been known as the class closest to death.\r\nThis is the pretext for Another.\r\nI would consider Another to be the first horror anime I've seen (Thinks back to School Days *shudders*) but regardless I would say that it's a very well put together piece of work.\r\nThe first arc so to speakof Another starts off with a scene of one of our main characters Sakakibara Kouichi in a hospital bed surrounded by his classmates.  Seems normal enough. After he's discharged from the hospital he meets a girl, Misaki Mei on the hospital's elevator.  When he goes to school a few weeks later he sees her and goes to talk to her although his classmates strongly object him doing so.  From this event we start getting the meat behind Another's story. \\n\\n\r\nWe start to ask questions to ourselves such as why do they act as if she's nonexistent? Is she a ghost? Whaat's going on? Is how you start to feel basically. You  may also start to wonder why there's a few seconds of zooming on on panels of broken glass windows, and why there's so many dang creepy dolls...  Although these shots may seem random they are fully intentional and provide good foreshadowing for what's to come later in the episode, or series.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of the show is where Another's masterful storytelling really comes together.  Once the background on class 3 grade 9's story comes to light is where the story really picks up with one of the major questions of *Spoiler* (Who is dead?)  This arc is very powerful in the way that it addresses some complex moral issues on the value of life, in a way that's subtle yet powerful.  Although others may disagree and think that people are just killing people there's nothing deep in that is where I think that everyone is entitled to their own thoughts and opinions and this is mine.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Another's storytelling style manages to hit you with plot twists left and right to keep you on  your toes, and just when you start to think you've figured out the story, your hit with a cliffhanger which jumbles up your thinking leaving you feeling pretty mindfucked so to speak. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the characters in Another, just that they played their part I guess, even though some of them weren't around for long. . . The main characters Sakikabara and Mei were good but Mei really caught my attention.  I don't watch horror anime often but her personality really appealed to me.  I like the fact how she's mysterious, reserved, and is able to maintain a rational outlook on things.  Even though there's not much change in the characters they're fine the way they are.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art for Another would be what I would consider to be one of the show's strongest aspects.  The color palette for this anime is strong, dark, and bold which really compliments and meshes with the scene's background settings creating an overall solemn and dramatic feel throughout the show.  The vivid details put into the death of people in this anime also left my jaw agape with horror at times, but also left me feeling appreciative of the beauty of death basically... and how everything lays out (call me sick but some of the scenes in this anime are powerful...)\\n\\n\r\nThe final component of Another is its sound.  The OP for this show is some sort of dark opera song I guess, but it matches the show and does its job.  The ED is a more mellow Jpop tune which gives you relief after an episode filled with tension and horror.  The bgm's do their part of setting the mood for a suspense scene, or horror scene, and it does its job as well and ties in well with the other elements of the show.  In conclusion I had a wonderful time watching this show.  From intricate and detailed story telling, to magnificent gory scenes depicting death and destruction, this show has them all.  The only thing that kept me from rating this a 10 is it's not my usual cup of tea for anime, but nevertheless it's definetly a show worth a watch. :)\\n",

            "content": "Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Another] for your reading pleasure.\r\nStory(8): Another has a very entertaining story, perfect for Humans and Demons alike. I find the story of curses and untimely deaths as a result of activating a curse, to be one grand story indeed. The supernatural has always fascinated me greatly. Of course, it is quite difficult to find an anime such as this, where one can enjoy it alongside a demon....uhhh head butler of the household. The story is compellingly dark enough to be very enjoyable with evening tea, a definite mystery thriller that shall leave anyone with a dark twisted mind wanting towatch more in rapid succession.\\n\\n\r\nArt(6): The animations done for Another is very good indeed. The shade of colors and the vibrant motions delivers the atmosphere of the anime in such a way, that immerses one into the world of Another. I believe the best modern counterpart to the feeling of the art is Halloween night. The sense that all is not normal and something evil lurks in the shadows.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6): The music of Another has the unique property of diving your mind into the netherworld, where you are certain something or someone will attempt to ensure your death. The moments, the fear, the uncertainty, and the desperate attempt to save oneself by hacking apart another; all of it was profoundly more dramatic and more realistic due to the sound of Another.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9): As a fan of the dark side of human psychology, the Characters of Another were portrayed with precision based on true human psychology. When you do not feel safe anywhere at all and you know that death approaches you, mental breakdowns occur. There are a sufficient amount of characters such that they all break down in different manners, which is truly entertaining to observe. The main male character however appears to be the most mentally stable one out of them all by the end, however I and a certain demon believe he is in fact the least normal psychologically, to appear so normal when everyone is dying in gruesome ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9): Another was very enjoyable indeed, however I can not honestly claim that it will be considered enjoyment to everyone. One requires a certain amount of Darkness to enjoy such an anime, watching the suffering and deaths of Grade 9 students will certainly make some loose their lunch in an instant. If death and evil is not your cup of tea, I would advise you to stay away from Another and consider more bright and happy animes instead. However for someone like me and a certain demon, Another was quite enjoyable over evening tea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7): Another was truly a splendid anime and is thus far the only anime that a certain Demon actually enjoyed. I would recommend Another to anyone who possess a dark twisted mind or need something to entertain demonic guests. However for anyone in normal society without any darkness in their minds, stay away from Another if you wish to remain a pure soul for entry to Heaven. This shall conclude my review of Another.\\n\\n\r\n[This review has been brought to you by the Funtom Company!

            "content": "There is a time in every person's life when moving from one place to another is necessary. Packing up and leaving can be very difficult, but often there is some excitement and hope in the prospect of a new place and a fresh start. But, what if that experience was met only with tragedy? What if your arrival has only doomed others? This and many more looming questions lie at the crux of Another, a series that is a definite highlight of this spring season. \r\nAnother is a clever, tight, and atmospheric suspense/mystery series that will leave you anxious for more and unsure if that'sactually a good thing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\\n\r\nAnother is beautiful and greatly benefits from its fairly short run - only 12 episodes. The animations are crisp and the colors are vibrant. The quality of animation is also fairly consistent throughout. One of Another's greatest assets is its art design, especially concerning its set pieces and scenery. Each location is drawn to evoke its own vibe that adds considerably to the mood and tension of a given scene. Corridors are dark and ominous. Abandoned buildings are decrepit and impart a sense of apprehension. Another knows exactly what backdrop will bring out feelings at certain times. These backdrops not only provide some excellent locations and settings, but also take some of the pressure off of the show's characters to build up the tension and emotion. \\n\\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that Another is definitely a series that does not pull any punches. The show is based around a violent phenomenon of death, and as such can involve some pretty grisly scenes. I am not particularly fond of gore, and felt slightly uncomfortable on a few occasions. However, the violence is not gratuitous to the point of being offensive.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9):\\n\\n\r\nAnother's narrative is easily the best part of the show because it does not overextend itself - a feat that many shows miss the mark on. The reasons for this are twofold. The first of these is because Another is only 12 episodes long. A series with a shorter running length must be careful with the construction of its story because there are only so many episodes to deliver it. Another does have its share of plot twist and surprising moments, but it follows a well established and clearly thought out progression that does rely heavily on filling time or stretching out narrative arcs to tell its story in more episodes than it needs. The second reason Another does not overextend itself is because the narrative is kept simple, which is exactly what this type of series calls for. The premise is pretty basic and the progression of the story slowly builds to a crescendo in the final two episodes. Lastly, Another's ending is fantastic - completely unexpected and wraps up everything nicely while still leaving just enough on the table to let your imagination take over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8):\\n\\n\r\nAnother has a fairly limited character roster, which gradually gets smaller leading up to the finale. Given that Another is based around the notions of uncertainty and mystery, the main protagonists, Kouichi Sakakibara and Mei Misaki, are fairly ambiguous for most of the show. We are given bits and pieces of insight into their backgrounds and motivations over time, but never enough to form any cemented impressions of them. Mei is a particularly interesting character that will tug on your inner Sherlock Holmes as you try to put the puzzle pieces together. \\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism of Kouichi and Mei's character development is that they both are largely unaffected by the events that transpire around them, which are seemingly to everyone's detriment except their own. There is definitely a missed opportunity here to explore some unique psychological elements that would surely arise from the circumstances surrounding the main characters. This was the only thing that noticeably interfered with my suspension of disbelief from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (9/8):\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Another is a very solid and well made anime that has the right mixture of coherent storytelling, characterization, and atmosphere. The show does a great job of providing the right setting for the narrative and drops in a tight cast of characters to occupy the world and experience its events. What I appreciate most about Another is that it wants to tell you an engaging story and makes the necessary effort to do so. Its not overly complicated or unrealistic in context, and does not require any real leaps of faith to understand and invest in. Simplicity is the virtue of excellence in this case.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Another and would recommend it to everyone. Even those that are not too keen on suspense and violence should give this a fair shot. The show's violence is really secondary to the situations that precede it. Elements of mystery and suspense and a fantastic conclusion truly put this show at the top of this season's new series.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. Let me know what you think in the comments.",

            "content": "I still don't have an eye-patch fetish yet. What am I doing wrong?\r\nStory:\r\nThe story evolves and reveals more and more elements as the show goes on. The mystery Another has to offer is a pretty entertaining one and it makes a lot of fun to guess what the cause is or who's to blame. If you are not into mystery or whodunnit, then you will not enjoy this Anime. Some people may find it hard to take seriously after certain scenes, but I think they work well into the story. The ending was acceptable and not an ass-pull as other shows might have done. Ican't really say much more without spoilering.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAt first, the art style looked a bit weird to me, even though I can't really say why. Maybe it's because they all look so thin. Nonetheless, the artwork is absolutely good and the animation is well executed. Thankfully the facial expressions rarely are over the top. The body movements are probably the best I've seen yet and the backgrounds look pretty good too.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Another is awesome. The background music creates an eerie and very uneasy atmosphere that will surely captivate you. It may even be too good at times, almost sidetracking from the visuals. I especially liked the chopping off of noises in certain scenes. What was not good though, was the opening. The song itself is pretty bad and it doesn't absorb you into the atmosphere of the show at all, which really hurts in my opinion.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMei is by far the most interesting character of the cast. The mysteriousness that surrounds her plays an important part and drives Another forward, especially in the first half of the series. I didn't get into the other characters very much, since they are all more or less normal people. That's not saying they were bad, they just weren't that special. On occasion, I had a hard time understanding some peoples motives, but it never got so bad that I would say the characters were unbelievable.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt wouldn't have hurt if Another had more than just 12 episodes. It never really feels rushed, but certain things could have gotten more time to sink in or more of their background explained. It also makes it harder to get attached to the characters. On the pro side, Another never starts boring you. I always looked forward to watch another (ha!) episode. If you're in for a horror-mystery, you can hardly do anything wrong giving Another a chance.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.4/10",

            "content": "Here goes my first review, so it might not be one of the best. \r\n*Spoiler free*\r\nSo I have watched Another after alot of people recommended it to me. I have to say I had some great expectations. Sure, the anime was cool, but it was a let down. Let me explain why:\r\nStory: (6/10) \r\nAnother is a anime about a guy who moves to a small village and then weird things start to happen (whats new). In his class he meets a weird girl named Mei that nobody talks to. And then starts the questions: but whyyyyyyyyyy? I wont say much more since I would bespoiling it. To me, the story was nothing really new. I didnt felt any excitement or having the need to watch another episode.  It's a shame when you already know whats going to happen because its cliche or predictable. Also, it wasnt scary at all. At any moment did I think '' wow this is creepy '' . But I have to admit, the last episodes were really nice. It wasnt spectacular, but I enjoyed it. What I liked also was the constant '' Who is dead '' sentence. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (5/10) \\n\r\nThe main character is pretty bland and stupid. Nothing extraordinary. He is just the normal mc that is really curious and tries to understand whats going on. I didnt find any character developpment. As for Mei, she is just a character without emotion that as a mysterious life. All the other characters were all forgettable too. I guess Mei was the most enjoyable one, cause she was calm in any situation and the story for her eyes was good. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\r\nI dont really have nothing bad to say about the art. Sure it was ordinary, but it never felt weird. I liked the expressions and the feel to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nI will give another a 7, because it was an ok anime that I completly watch and enjoyed at time. But, it wasnt as great as others tend to say. Go watch it if you want a mystery anime that wont affect your feelings. \\n",

            "content": "Another: the season's terribleness arrangement. Give me a chance to put a reasonable cautioning out first and foremost, in light of the fact that for as long as months I have seen a couple of individuals unflappably amazed by its actual nature: this show is ruthless. In the event that you would prefer not to watch carnage, then stay as far from this show as could be expected under the circumstances, on the grounds that it contains various extremely realistic passing scenes. This is especially frightful, on the grounds that it takes a while for it to uncover this nature. \r\nA ton of the broadcastappointment in this arrangement is spent on developing. It's no place as great as with Blood-C, yet this show truly puts accentuation on making an air to attract the viewer, just to toy with this in an abhorrent way. This is likewise what makes this show awesome: the difference between shockingly relatable characters, and the truly dim and exceptional scenes. \\n\\n\r\nWith a ton of the terrible thrillers, the makers invest little time on the characters themselves, however this arrangement stays away from this extremely well. This goes specifically through an exceptionally robust lead couple: both of them have innovative foundations, they're decently fleshed out, and this arrangement additionally permits both of them to play off one another truly well at whatever point they are as one. There truly is a considerable measure of point of interest in their acting and dialog. \\n\\n\r\nThe show additionally shakes regarding riddle. The show advances pleasantly as we take in more and all the more about what's going on and the characters. The arrangement loves to drop irregular indications and red herrings all around, which truly zest up its situation. This isn't the arrangement that answers everything, except the conclusion it gives toward the end does wrap things up. \\n\\n\r\nBe that as it may, this arrangement likewise is a long way from great. By a wide margin the greatest defect is that its making a decent attempt on occasion. This arrangement truly needs to be climatic and frequenting, yet the turns it pulls on occasion are just to constrained or evident to take genuine. Consider being in a craftsmanship class, with one of the understudies abruptly painting \"The Scream\" of all things. I like imagery, however there is a line for everything. What additionally appears to torment this arrangement, particularly in its second half, is that it has a tendency to draw extremely advantageous plot turns, only for the sole purpose of wrapping everything up. \\n\\n\r\nIt's justifiable that this arrangement needed to accomplish everything in only 12 scenes, yet that accompanies a reparation. The cast of this arrangement is tremendous, and shockingly it simply doesn't have room schedule-wise to tissue each and every character out, despite the fact that this truly could have enhanced this arrangement considering the way of the story. The same runs with the plot: with more scenes it could have wrapped things up all the more commonly, however that would have been to the detriment of a couple of exhausting scenes. Also truly: the way Another is currently, its a fast nibble estimated loathsomeness demonstrate that notwithstanding its tranquil minute never has a part that drags.\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling:\t7/10 \u2013 Excellent secret, form up and transforms into extremely extraordinary awfulness. Tries excessively hard at different times, however. \\n\\n\r\n Production:\t8/10 \u2013 This isn't tantamount to the standard that we're utilized to from PA lives up to expectations, yet this arrangement still has its snippet of exceptionally life-like activity. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\t7/10 \u2013 great acted fundamental couple, yet a portion of the side-characters could have been exceptional fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nSetting:\t9/10 \u2013 I must say that the story behind everything is extremely innovative.",

Usually, I tend to back out from stories like this, but there was something about the mystery in this story that made me sit down and watch it through. I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen until I had finished all I had.\r\nThe story pulls you in from the very first episode, and it keeps  making you second guess everything, only to find yourself mind-warped once the story starts to finally tell you what's going on. I found myself staring at the screen, my mouth opened wide someepisodes into the anime - and this hardly ever happens with me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, art, music, voice acting - you name it and everything is perfect.  At times, I found myself so into the anime - dark emotions evident in the characters felt so very real, that I could find myself almost as scared as them. The whole idea behind every plot progression in the story is so well thought out and placed, that it becomes difficult to dislike anyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe treatment is what surprised me the most. The basic story behind this is not all that unusual to me. I have seen plenty of animes where a new character comes to live in a new place and strange things happen once they arrive. But this story is different. Everything is brought into question, and anything can happen - and all the while you'll be kept thinking 'So that was what that meant!' The hints are all there, but spotting them can lead a watcher down a path that breaks off into a million different roads. But don't worry, once the story finally tells you what's going on, you'll be saying, 'Oh. Now I get it... Why didn't I see that before?'\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who likes watching unpredictable, gripping and ever so slightly disturbing stories - this is the one for you. Just don't jump to conclusions once you start watching, 'Another' will probably prove you wrong.",

            "content": "The word 'horror' has seemed to lose its former punch in modern media. Movies dubbed 'horror' barely get your heart pumping and video games use the same kind of technique, creating a 'been there, done that' kind of feel. Of course, anime is not free of this curse, as one of the most talked about shows in my anime community, Another, suffers from this ailment as well. This is a review about the horror anime of Another. \r\nThe story of Another is of standard horror quality. There's curse relating to the death of a girl a long time ago. Anyone who talks about will sufferthe consequences and the curse is centered around a certain high-school class. The plot is divided up into what I like to call 'Flow' and 'Burst'. \\n\\n\r\nFlow sequences involve Sakakibara, the protagonist, a girl named Misaki and their pals trying to discover the secret of the curse and how to stop it. These sequences are decent, with some scenes being noteworthy and others feeling like filler. These filler segments, such as the necessary swimsuit/beach scene, do not really add anything to the story in terms of quality and felt like a waste of space. \\n\\n\r\nBurst scenes, on the other hand, occur after these Flow scenes. They use the tension created during the Flow to then shock the viewer with a gruesome event. However, while these scenes can be bloody, they are also quite predictable, taking out substantial shock value. Anyone paying attention can easily pick out who's going to get hit by the curse next and their demises, while creative, don't make my heart stop. Furthermore, as I will address later, the flimsy characters make their demises feel shallow. I must say though that the final episodes were able to successfully capture the chaos of people desperate to survive, much to my surprise, finally delivering on the pulse-pounding suspense the rest of the series promised. The very last scenes though, stop that moment in its tracks. \\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animations and art are quite high quality. The character designs are standard anime fare, with the red-haired girl with a dash of spunk, the black haired, eye-patch silent girl and the hapless new transfer student being the main characters. While the characters looked clean, with the exception of the Old Librarian, Chibiki, none of them had any defining features that make them unique from any other anime. The enviroments of the series were mixed as well. The hospital and doll shop are places horror fans have seen before, but the old mansion in the final episodes was great setting. Furthermore, there is so much action in the final episodes that, for a split second, it seems like a thriller, not just a normal horror anime. It marks a stark contrast in tone from the rest of series, with slow moving dialogue scenes with the occasional twist thrown in being the norm.\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother has a catchy opening, but it doesn't go with the anime. The ending is good and fits the mood. The BGM doesn't do anything special and the voice acting is standard. I only listened to the sub, so I can't judge the dub. \\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are one of the biggest pitfalls. Sakakibara is a very passive protagonist, not really instigating the typical chaos that comes from the new guy asking questions. He does not really develop, instead simply getting blown like a leaf from scene to scene. Misaki is probably the one who gets the most development, but she doesn't do much with it.  At times it can be hard looking past the 'injured Ayanami' look that goes with most eye-patch silent girls. As the viewer learns more about her, they can piece together her past, but due to her cliche, distant personality, she never really makes her self unique for her archetype. Akazawa, the red-haired chief of countermeasures, does a decent job of keeping the class together, being one of the more well rounded of the classmates. However, most of other students are just foils for the other characters, very rarely going past their first impressions. The adults in the series also aren't very memorable, with the exception of Chibiki, the old librarian. He doesn't speak much, but he is a key player in discovering the secret to the curse. Whenever he was on screen, his sense of maturity was a breath of fresh air. As a whole, the characters don't do anything special, but a few decent exceptions bring so life to the cast.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:6/10\\n\\n\r\nDue to the unimaginative characters and the plot that relies on them, episodes proceeded at an uneven pace. Sometimes, an episode would end without going anywhere, while another would drag before ending with a Burst sequence, enticing me to watch more. Another can keep you coming back for more, but it got to the point where I just watched it to say I finished it. The ending was not worth the journey, but the last episodes that I keep mentioning are certainly ones to be remembered. It took a while to pick up steam, but when it delivered, it delivered nicely. \\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was one with a decent plot weighed down by cliche characters, nice albeit somewhat boring art and an average soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nIf this what's on the minds of horror fans nowadays, all I can say is that it'd be better to spend your time on another anime...\\n",

            "content": "Another is tagged as a horror and mystery. The show, however, often feels like a parody of the former and lacks much of what is necessary to be classified as the latter.\r\nAnother's attempts at unnerving the audience are clunky, to say the least. Creepy dolls, dark colors, dreary music (which actually sounds a bit boring and sometimes ridiculous) \u2013 it's too cliche to take seriously. The atmosphere created wasn't outright terrible, but it certainly didn't achieve what it was going for. Next, we have the gore, and this is where the anime borders on (read: damn near spills over into) hilarious, parodic elements. To callthe bloody deaths over-the-top would be an understatement. It seems that P.A.Works exaggerated the brutality of the deaths in order to up the shock factor, but this achieved almost the opposite effect. The deaths are, simply put, funny, in sort of a campy way. Despite how explicit it was, a scene in which the teacher of Class 3-3 spazzes out like crazy while making weird noises before he viciously stabs himself, complemented by a musical piece that almost sounds like it's TRYING to make fun of the creepy feel that Another is going for, is a perfect example of how overdone the gore can be in this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the mystery? Firstly, what's the mystery even about? Well, 26 years ago, a student named Misaki died partway through the school year \u2013 this student attended the same middle school and the same class as the main characters of Another, but the students and faculty refused to believe it, and acted as though Misaki was still alive. Ever since then, every year, a strange phenomenon occurs in which students of Class 3-3 and their relatives die mysteriously every year. So, the class is cursed. Enter the protagonist, Koichi Sakakibara, who is a transfer student and works to solve the mystery behind Class 3-3.\\n\\n\r\n...Except that he doesn't. The rules of the curse are infodumped to the audience early on, erasing any tension for the duration of the show. The audience knows what the curse is as well why it's happening (for the most part...), so any attempts to surprise the audience or put them on edge falls flat. The story plays out predictably and character deaths can be seen coming from a mile away. The character deaths, incidentally, are what the show focuses on the most since the mystery aspect of the show is eviscerated early on.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two things that have any sort of mystery-feel to them. First, there's the identity and purpose of the mysterious eyepatch-chick, Mei Misaki, who sits in the corner of the class, ignored by others, and is oft accompanied by a spooky backdrop of shadows and dolls. A little bit of time is dedicated to figuring out who she is, but the result of this mystery is ultimately underwhelming, and so the time allocated to this portion of the series feels like a waste.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have the identity of the \"Another\" \u2013 an extra person in Class 3-3 who is actually dead, but has kinda come back to life for some reason and is the driving force behind the curse (there's also the question of how to stop this driving force, to which the answer is fairly obvious \u2013 get rid of it, so to speak). \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this part of the mystery is that, aside from being just a small chunk of what could've been something more, it wasn't handled as a mystery at all. There's hardly any semblance of piecing clues together to deduce who the culprit is. In fact, Mei knew who it was all along, and yet Koichi never really tried to pull an answer out of her. After showing us a bunch of gruesome character deaths and dedicating maybe two or three scenes to (barely) advancing the plot, Mei just tells Koichi who the extra is after some shit hits the fan towards the end of the show. One of her explanations was actually that she SAW the extra die before this person actually came to be the extra \u2013 a random, coincidental occurrence thrown in in order to conveniently sway Koichi into believing her, while slapping the so-called \"mystery\" of the show in the face. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with all this is the fact that Mei said nothing for 12 episodes. Now, could she have prevented all the deaths that occurred? Probably not all of them, no. Would the class have believed her? Maybe not immediately, no. But is it accurate to say, as Mei put it, that it \"wouldn't have done any good\"? No. Her reasoning behind not saying anything to Koichi or the class is somewhat understandable, I'll admit, but it's very much a handwave and overly dismissive, and she's let off the hook way too easily. In essence, one of the only mysteries the show had to offer was solved from the start \u2013 the only thing left to figure out was how to stop the curse, and the answer to that was conveniently presented randomly to our protagonists in one episode after several others full of little more than gaudy deaths.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the characters? They're not much to speak of. The vast majority of the animated humanoid beings in this show could not be called characters, as they resemble cardboard more than they do people. I don't expect the supporting cast or all the dead people to be well-developed, but at least some personality (beyond the occasional idiocy) would've done them some justice. Koichi, the protagonist, is as bland as it gets. All the audience ever really learns about him is that he's frail and kind. The show could've had at least one decent moment towards the end when an internal conflict arises in his character, but this was glossed over and there's no real aftermath to speak of. Mei was a bit more interesting, as she came off as a bit mysterious at the start, but she ultimately doesn't do much besides talk cryptically to Koichi early on, infodump to him occasionally, and withhold other information. She has a bit of a backstory, but it doesn't do much for her and it's hard to think of her as anything more than a bland character who falls under the Rei Ayanami Expy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother isn't worth watching. It's not a creepy, scary, or unnerving horror. It fails on every level as a mystery. Even the silliness of the deaths doesn't quite make it worth slogging through this tripe, since it's so out of place and the show tries to take itself seriously anyway. As mentioned a little here and there, the music didn't do much to help, as it either came off as generic or too over-the-top just like the deaths, often sounding like it'd be more fitting in a haunted house attraction for kids than a horror show. I award Another with 2 pie slices out of 10, and I'm afraid that it doesn't deserve much more than that.",

            "content": "Let's be honest for a second. There are a lot of animes and a lot try to appeal to the horror genres. The question is how well each one preforms and which ones we'll remember. So before you think this is just \"another\" run of the mill production, I wouldn't. This show sparked my curiosity almost instantly, which was fantastic.\r\nNo spoilers, but the general idea will be discussed.\r\nBefore I run down the categories, let me just say this show has a superb ending when the episodes are over. Not to be confused with the ending of the series. Its so peaceful and relaxing whereas theshow is rather chaotic. I smiled every time the show ended.\\n\\n\r\nNow then,\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe basic idea here is that curses kill. Not only can you die but others will if nothing is solved. As far as stories go, this is a thrilling chiller. You'll find yourself wondering what on earth is happening before you know it. I even squinted/covered my eyes at times. This class is in fear for their lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI was delighted that the animation was so well done with this show. Everything looked brilliant and clear. The contrast was just right and made the atmosphere even more chilly. I'm pretty sure anyone would appreciate how this show looks.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI loved the effects and the music behind this anime. They went together like salt and pepper. I could pick up on the music quickly and listen. Very atmospheric. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe class involved in this mess was absolutely terrified. They dreaded to think about the curse. Everyone does their best and only you can watch it develop. Personalities and relationships were established, but to what end? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI can say this is something only fans of the genres will enjoy, but don't take that the wrong way. If you like a Stephen king book or just looking for a thrilling animation to watch, this is a solid choice. If your someone that doesn't really like blood or death, this isn't rainbows and sunshine. Needless to say, its a crazy one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nAfter watching this show, drooling for the next episode, I couldn't be more pleased. Not to share any secrets or the ending, it left me on a good note. You'll have to see for yourself to understand. I've seen a few shows that involved \"horror\" but this one really drove it home for me, personally. Between the scared students and the situations they deal with, its nothing short of pandemonium.",

            "content": "What does it mean to die? What feelings come with death and what are the qualities to state that you're dead? The anime follows the concept of something similar to the movie Final Destination, of people dying one by one due to an unknown reason, yet has its own twist to it to make it even better. You're put into a situation where someone is not needed. There's an extra person, yet its completely unknown and everyone's life is in danger.\r\nAnother is an anime that originally aired in 2012, yet still manages to capture fans with its plot and uneasy feeling. The idea of theanime was something unique and attracted a lot of attention and for good reason. The concept of a class being cursed and how to fix it is unknown. Horror and mystery is a famous combination and one that captures a lot of peoples curiosity. I'm not into horror, but I was attracted to its unique plot, and I can say it was one of the best mysteries that i've seen. There's always that eerie feeling that gives you the chills, yet always manages to keep you on the edge of your seat and brings out a new theory every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows a boy named Kouichi and he moves into a new town and plans to go to a new school. The school is rumored to be cursed for year 3, class 3 and he gets put into it. His lung collapses before school starts making him the first month of school and miss out on very important information that is essential to the curse and how they plan to avoid it.\\n\\n\r\nThe moment the anime opens, the first episode is filled with mystery and eerie feeling introducing a girl named Mei. A girl who is as pale as a ghost, and an eye patch covering one of her eyes. Her presence is missing and everyone doesn't notice her, except for him. This brings room for a lot of mystery and the anime does an excellent job making use of this and making every episode suspenseful as possible and making you really try to think of what's going on and connecting every piece like a puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nWith the story being suspenseful as possible, you have top quality sound to back it up. The background music for each scene fits the mood perfectly and gives you that feeling of suspense and making you just wonder what's about to happen next. The anime truly shines with its sound quality and the opening is just perfect to fit the anime. The song gives you the excitement going into the anime and the episode uses that perfectly to make you want more with every passing episode. \\n\\n\r\nFor the anime being made in 2012, the art is truly something that was well ahead of its time. Each character was drawn beautifully and made the anime just much more enjoyable to watch. The background was really well detailed with all the settings that the anime was put in such as, forests, the school, the beach, and even with just the suburban area. \\n\\n\r\nWith the scenes with oddities being placed everywhere, it gives you a sense of uneasiness. You have dolls with creepy limbs and a store filled with these dolls that just give you the creeps. With the detail in every aspect and the color palette complimenting the entire anime it's perfect for the mood the anime is trying to give off. They use mainly dark colors to emphasize the theme and the situation that they're in. The anime having deaths, and lots of it, the anime does an excellent job with the detail in each death as much as possible. I won't go into detail explaining each death, but they show it in a way that makes it realistic and brings out the emotion that the characters feel while witnessing and after the event happened. \\n\\n\r\nWith the anime having a unique story, the characters are all there to back it up to make it even better. You have a wide cast of characters to make every episode as eerie as possible and makes you wonder, who's the extra person? \\n\\n\r\nYou have Kouchi, a boy who just transfers to the school and gets caught up in a big mess by missing school for a few weeks due to his injury. He gets interested in what is happening and tries to figure it out through the entire anime bringing more mystery and letting the fans try to piece all the puzzles together.\\n\\n\r\nSecond you have Mei, a girl who is introduced in the anime in such a way that it makes you wonder who she is, and what's the reason for her doing what shes doing. Later on in the show, you learn the class is completely oblivious to her being there and she has no presence to them and is always wearing an eye patch. \\n\\n\r\nWith the whole class being involved, you get a wide range of characters to develop the story and to make the perfect ending. You have characters who try to take it upon themselves and characters who just try to stay out of it and characters who just want to give up. The emotion in this anime is just spectacular and you can really feel the tension building with every passing death and the feeling of who's next and how is it going to be stopped.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was something well above its time and did an excellent job living up to its hype. With the unique story and characters to back it up, it does an excellent job making each episode as suspenseful as episode. The art is truly top quality and was ahead of it's time of airing and makes the feeling of uneasiness all around better and kept me on the edge of my chair to the very end. The ending for the anime was very unexpected and makes you reflect on all of the events that happened. I recommend anyone who's looking for a good mystery to watch to check this out, it's definitely worth it and will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end!",

            "content": "Ok, another anime that people will hate me for bashing on,  Like my angel beats review, please don't be mad at me, this is just my personal opinion on the anime.  If you need to post a comment, do so, I would be happy to explain further.  \r\nStory (8/10): The story of Another revolves around a boy by the name of Kouichi who gets transferred into a school far away from home.  Upon attending the school, he notices a girl with an eyepatch that sits in the back, that no one seems to notice...  From this, Another seems like oneof those animes that people HAVE to watch.  And, I'll agree.  Another is a very strange mystery anime surrounding the idea that some sort of 'force' is affecting this very class.  However, there are a few key points that make down the story from a 10/10.  For starters, they reveal pretty much the whole mystery in episode 5, shifting the whole idea of the anime in a different direction which is pretty disappointing considering how hooked I was from the beginning.  Because they spoil it so early on, the anime just felt really bland, but there was still a mystery aspect, so I'll give it that.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10): First is Kouichi.  As the main protagonist of the story, he...has nothing going for him.  He's pretty damn bland.  In fact, I could go as far as to say that he has zero actual personality. Coupled with the fact that he doesn't take ANY initiative to solve the mystery, like all the other students, he is probably by far one of the worst characters I have seen in this anime.  Next, is Mei Misaki.  Mei is the complete opposite of Kouichi.  Mei has an actual purpose in this anime and plays a very big part altogether.  Though she basically has the same personality as pretty much every other character in this anime, it's supposed to be in her character.  Which makes her the most fitting in this anime rather then anyone else and makes her the possible favorite of everyone.  The rest of the cast deserves no special mention due to the fact that they're pretty much the same in terms of character and I see no point discussing characters in which they have a very minimal role in.    \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7/10): For the art, the anime is very into the darker color scheme where everything is gloomy, and every ray of light is consumed and destroyed.  Because of the \"gloomy\" atmosphere, it's supposed to make the anime darker then it really should be.  I'm not saying it's bad, but, come on.  At least shed some light on the situation.  Although, not gonna lie, the art is great and very well detailed.  For the sound, the voice acting is so expressionless and monotone for the most part, that it just seems so boring to watch.  The only real emotion they show is when someone is dying, and well, I have to say the blood-curdling screams are pretty damn good.  The OP and ED are good as the OP has a dramatic feel as well as a sort of sadistic one as well.  Although, it did sound a bit strange to me though.  The ED has a very somber and piano background which is actually pretty calming.  As if they were trying to keep the audience sane by what they just watched.  Though the music is good, it felt pretty out of place, seeing as how they don't really fit with the anime's feel in any way.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (6/10): If you've watched South Park, then you'll know who Kenny is.  Everyone in this anime is f***ing Kenny.  The one thing that pissed me off the most in the anime, was the random deaths that were occurring at the end.  Rather then feel sad, I laughed.  They were so ridiculous and out of place, that I couldn't do anything else.  Another thing (see what I did there?) was the fact that the anime felt really boring.  Everyone was talking in a depressing tone, which resulted in a really monotone environment, and I felt really unmotivated to continue.  Granted, I did finish the series and somehow inclined to continue watching to the next episode.   The anime's ending also felt really dumb considering how anticlimactic it was and the fact that it just, ends, without a second word or anything.  In all seriousness, Another was really ok, and not the best thing to watch.  But, this is my personal opinion and, like I said at the beginning of this review, I would be happy to discuss more on my opinion on this anime if you feel as though it should get a higher rating then it does.",

            "content": "As we all know you cannot please everyone, so I'll make sure that my main priority in this review is your precious time and a good scope for you on what the story is all about and my analysis about it.\r\nLet's start.\r\nAnother is a horror, mystery, school, and thriller anime with 12 episodes that has been aired  a couple of years ago.\r\nAnother is one of the best R-rated anime series in it's generation that has a good animation and at the same time a great, intriguing revolving story.\r\nThe story revolves with Kouchi Sakakibara who transferred to Yomiyama North Middle School's 3rd year's third classwho pursued a friendship into a beautiful girl named Misaki Mei, unkowingly, what trouble this can be caused.\\n\\n\r\nAnother has a slow paced story considering that it has only 12 episodes which are meant to be for fast-paced stories out there.\\n\\n\r\nStory : Considering that it only has 12 episodes, the story development of this series is a little bit lazy focused, and probably that is a one thing that really impressed me on how does the creator managed to packed all this laziness into just 12 episodes only.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that one unique characteristic of this series is when you are about to discover something on a particular episode, suddenly, a suprised will come out causing you to analyze the story once again and redo your brainstorming. In fact, while watching this series, you'll imagined yourself that you are also involved with the story and participating to solve the puzzle along with the main cast of the story as well. Also the fact that you'll get dissapointed that you haven't solve some piece of the jigsaw puzzle of the story makes this series fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOfcourse if there is a PROS then probably, there are some CONS as well.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding with the CONS I would much say that the story doesn't deserved a 12 episodes only, because I believe that you can spin the disambiguation of your viewers considering the fact that the story is a revolving creepy story that makes a particular series to be a slow paced, so I'd rather say that you can extend the series up to the maximum of 24-26 episodes since it has a lot of tactical story development which enable the viewers to redo their analysis over and over again until they found out on how to solve the mystery which might be considered as the main selling point of the story as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art is simply amazing considering that this story involves violence and tremendous killing methods since the story depicts deaths, in fact, massive number of deaths involved in the story. Also the cause of deaths in this series is one of the most effective way to express the art of Shinigami on how he takes the life of an individual unexpectedly yet brutal.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that what makes you believe this series is a horror story in terms of art, is the impressive illustration of all of the elements to manufacture an amazing horror-mystery story. Starting from the dark-oranged skies, flying crows that are waiting for your last breath and take out your eyeball in real time, a long path to the hallway with a blinking dim light that can make you think that the next blink in of the light a mysterious shadow appears and that is exciting in fact.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the Dolls, yes the creepy dolls also had a huge impact to make the story art believable. In fact, I am afraid of dolls as well, I always think that they are looking at you whenever you go and probably most of you thinks the same way as well.\\n\\n\r\nBlood, I am afraid of blood as well the more blood spurting the more terror you'll get, and luckily for terror hunters you'll get what you want in this series. Also the use of different crafts and materials to kill are the most exciting part of the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds : Sound elements of a story has a huge impact in every digital arts you see, including animation because it will serve as the voice of the story, and unfortunately, I am not satisfied with the sound elements that has been used for the whole series. Organ/Piano sounds are a good investment for this series unfortunately, I heared them very rarely or maybe I am not just carried away with those instruments. Violins you can make a strange sound with violins as well but I haven't heard them on this series as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound FX, yes the sound FX are really impressive, stabbing a knife through your throat? Yes it sounds real.\\n\\n\r\nBGM's This one has some issues as well. Especially on the beach scene, I am not sure what to think about after I heared that sound.\\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes to sound elements I'll score this as an average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : This is my favorite part for this series, we all know now that Another is a horror-mystery series and what we expect for the characters are a little details only out there. Just come to think of it transfering into a school where those people around you are strangers and some of them are acting strange. So what would you think? Exciting! And you want to know more about them!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development for the story is a slow paced as well in terms of the GTKEO (Getting To Know Each Other) aspect, in my own interpretation for this is because this one is a horror-mystery story and giving excessive details to your viewer can messed up the whole story and turns your ending into an expected crap. This one is a main aspect of the series as well because you are involved with the story at the same time and you are trying to know each character's personality since their personalities, are the key to your analysis to solve the mystery puzzle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : This is a must watch series for this specific genre and you'll not get dissapointed in terms of the positive things I've said above. Also note that this story is not for all audience, since it is a rated R series, and sometimes some of us are really sensitive when it comes to violence and profanity.",

The story focuses itself on the mysterious events happening in particular highschool in small city hidden in the forests. After the first episode, the story got me immediately hooked. I must say though that there are elements that I noticed before in other anime of similar genre (Shiki, Shinsekai yori etc.). I wouldn\u00b4t even say that it\u00b4s that much gore as it is mysterious. \r\nThe pacing and storytelling is accurate, not too fast and not too slow, the finale is unexpected and wraps the story pretty surprisingly. The art wasvery nice, combined with just a little haunting, but not unpleasant music. \\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this story way more than I expected. You should definitely give it a try. For me solid 9/10.",

But i would like the main 2 characters ya no the guy and eyepatch girl to go on a very romantic date butthen at night things would start to get very Intense. They would gaze into eachothers eyes and the guy would say \"eyepatch girl would you like to do the intercourse in my bed room\" and she would respond with \"yes iv'e been dead and i haven't had the chance in soooo long\" and so soon later there was lots of noise ya no like screams and stuff anyways the next day she would cum back to life and they would get married and every day since then they would do the intercourse. That sounds like the perfect story not the current one this one sux",

            "content": "Another is a mystery horror anime based on a novel by Ayatsuji Yukito. The anime actually started in January and finished a few short month ago and a live action movie is set for release in August. So it's done pretty well so far. Let's take a look at the anime adaptation to find out why.\r\nI can't give away too much of the story without going into spoilers. The basic gist of it is that a student named Sakakibara transfers to a new school after a short stay in hospital. There's a strange girl with an eye-patch who no one will talk about or evenacknowledge the existence of and a rumour about the class of twenty six years ago having the ghost of a student who died appear in their picture. No one will explain what's going on, leaving Sakaki to try to unravel the truth for himself. Which is why I can't go into too many details. You get information as he gets it. That really strengthens the mystery element, it does an excellent job of building suspense by slowly revealing more and more information. It also does an excellent job of leaving clues that are subtle and difficult to put together properly, but that all make perfect sense when you know the entire truth. As a horror story, it doesn't do so well. It's simply not scary. The main issue is the premise which, though very creative and interesting, is too outlandish to be frightening. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done. They have enough complexity to seem like real people, making the tragedies that start to happen even more poignant. Most of the characters, certainly all the major ones, are sympathetic. Which helps create a genuine atmosphere of concern for them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is spectacular. The details, atmosphere and characters are all terrific. The use of colour and shading in every scene helps set the situation up perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent. The entire cast does really well, particularly Sakakibara Naoko, Yonezawa Madoka, Abe Atsushi and Takamori Natsumi. They convey emotions really well and realistically. The music is perfect for the atmosphere in any given scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There isn't any yuri here. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Another is a 9/10. The mystery and suspense elements are superb. The characters and voice acting are top notch. Really, the only aspect that doesn't work is the horror aspect, which doesn't bother me that much when you look at everything that it does right.",

No I don't average out the scores, its how I do things. :P\r\nAnother tried its hardest to be good, but it wasn't.  \r\nThe Story.\r\nI give it a 6. 5 for how well the plot was and 1 for effort. The story is about some curse that happens in class 3 and it starts up again with Sakakibara arrives in May. Now, this anime tries to be so suspensful, mysterious and horror-ish. This plot would of been a lot better if there was a deeper meaning to the curse, which there wasn't. They dragged the ploton for so long. No, 12 episodes isn't that long, but with the ending, it really is just a dragged on plointless story. I love Horror and Mystery as well, but this just did not seem to live up to the standards. The twists the anime tried to do, didn't really twist anything. I just think the story was poorly crafted and not well layed out.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nI think the art was just amazing. 9. Probably the only good thing about the anime, besides sound.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n7. I liked the sounds and music of the anime, but I generally don't pay attention to  the sound a lot, so I could be off. :P\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n3.\\n\r\nThis. Had to be the worst. Sure. Its supposed to be mysterious not knowing about the characters, but the characters seemed bland, there was NO character development and you didn't learn anything about anyone except two characters, one not being relevant to the story at all, except them trying to confuse you, if that was the point. I could be sounding like a complete dumbass right now, but I just think its dumb that the characters were so poorly crafted and not fun. By not fun I mean not interactive, by that I mean not used in the story at all. All the other characters but 3 or 4 were just there to be there for Class 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n6.\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime enough to finish it, which the fact that its overall is really low, is odd since I don't like to watch anime this bad. :/ I'm not going to go into full details why i enjoyed it this little or to much since its pointless since everyone enjoys different things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n5.\\n\r\nNuff' said.",

            "content": "Horror, like any other genre, is rather subjective. While some are thrilled and excited by fear, others become truly frightened and even repulsed. Unfortunately, I was among those who were actually quite scared after watching Another, thus lowering my enjoyment considerably.\r\nTherefore, it will be rather difficult for me to review this series fairly. I'd like to point out that, for me personally, the quality of the plot and story have little to do with the overall emotional impact. \r\nSo, with that in mind, let's get started.\r\nA regular kid moves from the city to a small town to live with his aunt and grandparents. He meetsa mysterious girl with an eye patch at the hospital, where he was recovering from a lung condition. The girl ends up at his new school, where a lot of strange things happen due to an accident involving a popular student's death many years ago. And from there, the story progresses through numerous horrific, gory twists and turns, finally arriving at a (rather anticlimactic) conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Another starts out as very interesting mystery coupled with horror elements. The first few episodes, while slow, were actually very good. But I distinctly remember the exact point at which I became sorely disappointed with the direction of the plot. What could have been a thrilling supernatural mystery/horror simply became Final Destination with some loose semblance of a plot. And that plot became so riddled with holes by the end that I really thought the creators were trolling us in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I know that Another is a light novel, and I'm sure the light novel was well written enough to even get an anime adaptation in the first place. However, I did not enjoy the way the anime version was directed. Another had a solid premise to build upon, but the creators simply did not deliver. Most of the deaths were extremely contrived and sometimes downright silly. If Another did not take itself as seriously as it did, then much of it would have been a whole lot less ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will give to Another's storytelling is it's ability to freak people out. If you're used to gory horror elements, then this will be pretty tame to you. But for someone like me, who usually dislikes horror and is scared easily, the creepy and often horrifically shocking atmosphere of Another will surely keep you up at night.\\n\\n\r\nI won't reveal too much about the plot, because in all honesty most people high enjoyed it. If you are intrigued by cheap mysteries and overly creative deaths, then you will have no problem enjoying Another's story. However, if you are looking for something more solid and meaningful, then you will dislike Another's story as I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a big part of the problem as well. Most of them lacked common sense, and although this is normal in the horror genre, I expected anime of all mediums to be more creative and get it right every once in a while. Unfortunately, this did not happen, and many of the characters ended up being shallow, creepy, and generally unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music were all of top-notch quality, so there's not much to say there. The only problem I had was that all the characters looked bland and emotionless, but I suppose that was part of the creepy atmosphere Another was trying to create. I also thought the music sometimes gave away the scene before the scene could unfold, so it tended to lessen the mystery a little. But overall, Another's aesthetic qualities were all very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't say I enjoyed Another very much. I'll give it props for good music, great art, and the ability to give me nightmares, but there were simply too many plotholes and unsatisfying characters for me to fully enjoy this. If the plot had been more solid, and certain story elements changed, then Another would have gotten a much higher rating.\\n\\n\r\nBut as it is...6/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, let me start this review off by saying, I love horror. I live off of it. I really wanted to like Another. It just seemed like something that I would like, and I liked the doll aspect of it and the female main character\u2019s design. I tried really hard to like this anime, but it just couldn\u2019t happen. No can do, was not possible.\r\nThe story is very all over the place, and it never really is fully explained. The male main character\u2019s father is off in a different place, and you hear about it several times, but he\u2019s not visibly emotionally affected by it.His classmates are very mysterious, but not to the point where you\u2019re curious as to what is going on. But rather to the point where it\u2019s just straight up annoying. Why couldn\u2019t they have just told him everything before this disaster happens? Obviously a new student is going to be very curious, so why would you keep this foundational secret from him? (Especially if things knowingly go wrong if it isn\u2019t executed well, the main conflict of the series could have been very easily avoided, if everyone wasn\u2019t a fuckwit and was educated about what was going on.) The pacing is slow, and suddenly you learn a lot of new information at once that\u2019s never repeated again. The dolls that you see so much of in the transitions are practically useless except for the development of one character. They\u2019re not important to the plot and they\u2019re used as a weird scare tactic.\\n\r\nThen suddenly, characters start dying all at once. But for what? Why? Was there a pattern to these deaths? Even so, would I really care? The characters weren\u2019t developed enough for me to care about their deaths. The pacing of these deaths/plots are very oddly placed. First people \u201cslowly\u201d start dying, then the setting changes and everyone is murdering each other? I don\u2019t understand. Then, in the midst of everyone dying, everyone willingly changes the setting? Does no one know how to properly grieve for the death of someone? These characters show emotion in very odd, unrealistic ways. They\u2019re either emotionless or a plethora of emotion, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. The character development is just sloppy.\\n\r\nPersonally, I like the art very much, but the \u201ccreepiness\u201d is very forced to the point where it looks very obviously overdramatic. To some it might add to the \u201cunsettling\u201d events, but personally it\u2019s just silly on a whole new level. This dramatic aspect becomes very prevalent when you watch it with someone else. As a horror lover, this was a try-hard.\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime results in the murder of a character, which was supposed to be \u201csurprising\u201d. And it left the audience not so much in a disturbed or surprised state, but more like, \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d It was a cheap death of a character. We knew very little about the person and the main characters had a very awkward, almost nonexistent relationship with them. (Then again, the main character doesn\u2019t build up a relationship with really anyone, and if he does, it\u2019s very.. awkward with little communication.)",

            "content": "Another is a horror mystery that depicts the curse going on in class 3-3. Aside from the occasional disfigured humans that have been murdered, or the hatred between one another, this is one horrifying anime. This anime is one of few that invokes \u201cfear\u201d within us, as time goes on more horrific events occur which leave the viewer startled. \r\nThis story takes place in classroom 3-3, where it has been a cursed classroom for 26 years. Each year there is that extra (another) student, whom is exiled from the class in order to try and prevent the calamity that is occurring. The issue is, thiscalamity does not have a \u201csolution\u201d to solving it, and therefore they try to piece together information in order to try and come up with a solution. In this anime there are many mysteries, and unanswered questions that will keep you thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime is absolutely fascinating. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, the darkness in the colors really brings out the true nature of this show. This show is a mystery horror, and lighting and colors is something that helps invoke fear to the viewers. This anime \u2018s use of the dark colors, creepy buildings, and eerie setting, help this anime really come to life.  In almost all horror, mystery, any type of dark anime, something that is important is the blood.  How do they portray the blood? In this anime it is almost like black blood. In some of the scenes, the blood is a very dark dark red, but it is also sometimes portrayed as black, which really invokes the horror that you are seeing within this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is truly fascinating. The opening song is very energetic and contradicting to what to expect. I personally think this brings a nice touch, because instead of using a slow paced song, which could add to the atmosphere of what to expect in this anime, it uses a very upbeat song. Aside from being such an upbeat song, the meaning is what counts. This song talks about being alone and the darkness within our hearts. This songs words express destruction and really what this anime wants to show. The ending theme song is also beautiful. This is the more classical type of ending for this type of show, slow and a very touching song. This is the type of song that depresses the viewer, but it is also very fitting for this anime, because it is depressing, all the tragic deaths, alongside with the curse that is haunting this school.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many characters in this anime, but only a few ones that actually have a significant role in this anime. Koichi Sakakibara is the transfer student who is going to be attending Yomiyama North Middle School class 3-3. Koichi is 15 years old, and has been hospitalized before coming here because he was sick. His goal after joining this school is to figure out the secret behind the mysterious deaths that are occurring. He is accompanied by a girl called Mei Misaki, whom was the girl exiled in response to trying to stop the calamity from occurring. Koichi befriends Mei unknowingly, that she is the student whom does not exist. Throughout this anime both Koichi and Mei become closer friends with each other, both with a common goal\u2014to stop the calamity in class 3-3. A less important character, but one that deserves mentioning is Izumi Akazawa. She is in charge of the \u201ccountermeasures\u201d, due to the curse within class 3-3. Her job is to try and prevent people from dying due to being part of the class of 3-3.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I would highly recommend to watch, if you are interested in a mystery horror, alongside gruesome deaths. I personally really enjoyed this anime because of the suspense. This was an anime that not only kept me thinking in order to try and figure out the mystery of class 3-3, but in order to see the answer that they come forth with. Not only is the story unique, but it also keeps the viewer wanting to know more and more. Something that also made this anime very good, alongside the themes of horror and suspense, was the art. The use of the dark colors always helps make a point when watching a horror show. The lack of light and being able to see what is happening is something this anime prevents. Truly, both of these factors are what make this such a good anime. If one of these aspects was missing, this anime would not have been as nerve racking and scary.\\n\\n\r\nJust as a quick side note or whatever you want to call it, take notice of the titles of each episode, they have a significant meaning most of them. I wont expand on this due to the fact that it could spoil some of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed reading this review, if you have any suggestions of what i should add please feel free to message me. If you want to talk about any other animes or want me to do more review please feel free to message me or friend request me.\\n",

            "content": "Lots of times, there were pauses between conversations, I'm guessing it adds a sense of reality, since it sometimes happens, but if we were to choose between this and words to continue the story, I'd choose the latter. The musics are already doing its job and the art so no need for dramatic pauses when like introducing your name in a class. \r\na serious horror. No comical scenes exist, no reforming of faces, eyes, mouth to exaggerate emotions like cartoons. Since they did this, the anime risked being boring unless it could compensate the horror quality of this anime. The boring side tipped the scale,for me due to that it just didn't scare me, except ... I was thinking for instances but non come to mind. One emotions did came up, and that is feeling sorry for the characters that died, and that's not the emotion the series really wanted. The story could have been interesting if they would have just compacted it.the music, though helped lift the dullest scenes of pauses, head turning, and people walking. And maybe it helped me go on to continue until the 4th episode, where boredom completely conquered its way to me.\\n\\n\r\n== Story ==\\n\\n\r\nA transfer student comes to the province of his mother, to heal. He is sick, but not sick enough to go to school. I tried to read the manga, just so I could finish the story/ending, but I guess I didn't like the manga since I couldn't finish it as well. I haven't seen the ending but I'm guessing them to be the most awaited of them all after the many pauses, delaying of the story, or maybe, perhaps more likely, I am not attracted to serious horror in anime or manga. By the way, in manga, the characters where light, I mean joking around where faces would exaggerate its form. \\n\\n\r\n== Art ==\\n\\n\r\nIn art, no one could argue its quality. The background was detailed enough, scratches from tables, chairs, buildings, and houses, wares. All were complete to add that realistic scene that the anime wanted.\\n\\n\r\n== Sound ==\\n\\n\r\nVarious solo instruments was heard in its background. The piano usually dominates them. It was played creepily like we usually hear in movies. Like the Art, the sound was of similar level. But one fault did come to mind when I thought about and that is the frequency. I think they shouldn't play horror music when a normal student is walking towards you, when she's watching you normally, it may be weird but not frightening. Of note, the student is just an ordinary one, not the creepy girl with the eye-patch, which would be appropriate, adding the horror soundtrack, if it were her. That said, the choices of effects were great.\\n\\n\r\n== Character ==\\n\\n\r\nThe girl with the eye-patch (TGWTE) has the personality same of that as a zombie, with a recorder to audio player to replay recorded responses to people. You will understand TGWTE later on, and its background but I never got to that part.\\n\\n\r\nThe hero, though I doubt that's what he is, is a transfer from Tokyo due to his health. He is ordinary as far as I can observe, but there really wasn't much event to test his character. Though I'd say his quite curious for his age. A trait, I think, necessary in horror videos. Curiosity hopefully not kills the cat in this story. He is respectful, friendly, it seems.\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment ==\\n\\n\r\nBored. The only emotion that got raised from me is pity to those that died. Nothing more. No matter the music, scenes, gore, I was not moved from my sit. If asked what were lacking in it, I'd say was the surprise factor. there were attempts in it but never quite got a jump. So I guess its the quality of that factor.\\n\\n\r\nburp!",

(or lets say it ends with the mystery not properly solved), but that doesn't mean you're going to hate the ending\u2026 however you may deduce everything on your own so we can't call it for sure a \"mysterious ending\", anyways; the plot is really interesting\u2026 following the story of Sakakibara Kouichi\u2026 a high school student who transfer to live with hisgrandparents in a small and strange town\u2026he started to attend school there and (unfortunately) finds himself stuck in a class with a mysterious curse or calamity\u2026everything was going well at first until he met an odd-looking  classmate\u2026 Misaki Mei\u2026 and there everything will start.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about this show are the sounds, the soundtracks can stimulate your nerves easily so you could be more thrilled and scared\u2026 the sound effects were pretty good and the voice actors/actress performance was very well, the art (animation) was pretty good especially the settings\u2026 everything was delicate enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really loved this anime, I believe by just watching one episode you'll simply want to complete it to the end\u2026 maybe it is a good thing that Another is a short anime with only 12 episode so the show will be as flawless as possible, in case you love horror shows (anime, movies, books\u2026etc.) then this anime is good choice.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading :)\\n\r\nSorry for any linguistic mistakes.\\n",

            "content": "*This is my first review and is my own personal opinion, the opinion may differ from yours though all respects are due*\r\nAnother is a mystery/horror series that consists of 12 episodes and a OVA, this series is deserving of more praise than it get's already. It's worth you're time if you're into a good mystery or gory anime.\r\nStory - 9/10 Kouichi Sakakibara is a new transfer student of a third year middle school, the class has a mysterious past, this classroom also contains a mysterious student who also contains a girl called Mei Misak who wears an eyepatchi. -This storyline always keeps me on edgeand you never know what's going to happen next which I really enjoyed! as the episodes go on there are many characters that are introduced and it's safe to say with the horror genre that most of them do not have a happy fate. The only gripe I had with the story is that was a certain twist that happened too late in the story to really make too much of a impact.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 10/10 I thought the art and animation was great for this serious I was really impressed with P.A. works and their capability to make the series look greater as it went on!, The character models looked perfect as they were proportioned amazingly without looking odd at all. The many different environments looked as best as they could with loads of colour and subtle details.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 The sound was pretty much perfect as it set the tone for the series with dreary backing tracks and sharp and fit for what is happening within the episodes. The opening by ALI PROJECT and Ending by Annabel certainly grew on me as the series went on, while they are nowhere near my favourites they certainly set the tone for the opening and with the ending it was soft to relieve the tension from each episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10 While the only characters that stand out as much throughout the series are the two main characters, the rest seem to be cannon fodder, Mei is the typical monotone character throughout the series though a different side can be seen to her in the OVA. Koucihi is the typical male lead that knows nothing about what is going on and tries to find out the secrets which makes him a character that people would connect to. The supporting characters did little to progress the story and I found their names really difficult to remember...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 I can definitely say that I enjoyed this show so much that I was constantly waiting for the next episode to be released!, this was one of the few shows that made left a massive impact after watching a certain episode, safe to say it left me breathless. For anyone unsure about this series watch the first 3 episodes and if you're not hooked by then it's probably not the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10 After enjoying the series so much I feel like I should give it 10 what can I say, I've always been a sucker for a horror series that keeps you guessing.\\n\\n\r\n- Thanks for you're time reading this review and hopefully you'll enjoy the show as much as I did. - Rikku101.\\n",

It\u2019s very difficult to write that. It\u2019s like writing humor. Things get lost in translation. What\u2019s scary in one place is piss-funny elsewhere.\r\nThis show has great atmosphere. In all 12 episodes there\u2019s this lingering feeling of isolation. Everything has a grim, cold tone to it. I kept wondering what was going on with the outside world. They have cellphones, but that shit never works in a horrorstory.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best part of the show was Mei Misaki. I fucking love her. The story is intriguing enough, but what kept me going was to learning the truth about her. I won\u2019t spoil anything (because I\u2019m a good person), but there are some nice twists. I went into this show knowing nothing and was pleasantly surprised. Did I mention the deaths and gore are fantastic?\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue is the rest of the cast. The main character is too simple, little boring, but he\u2019s nice enough to care about. The classmates are okay. They\u2019re serviceable.",

I came across Another. \r\nAt first, I was not really convinced on watching the series, but when I saw there were only 12 episodes, I thought 'eh, why not?', but at the same time 'it's only 12 episodes? How can an anime so short hold a really interesting story?', hell I was wrong. Even though the serie was really short, it is one of the most interesting stories I've ever encounter. \r\nAt first, theseries starts pretty slow, I have to admit I didn't like it much, but then you start to get attached to the caracters and you get caught into the story little by little, until you cannot stop thinking about it. There is si much mistery, so much creepiness that, in my case, You start watching episode by episode and you don't leave the computer until you've finished the complete anime. I have to say that Another has one of the best build ups I have ever seen. This is what makes this anime so great. Little by little it goes revealing the meaning of the series, everything (music, enviroment, characters, etc) helps the build up and makes you attached to the story line. Thus, it is also amazing how they create the plot and the results of it, especially the results, at the end of the series they give you an answer you'd never expect. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve me, take my word, if you're fanatic of horror, drama, supernatural, etc, this is an anime you must put on your 'Plan to Watch' list.",

I think in the first 3 episodes, they made us belive that a great story with a great end was coming .. after this episode it just gets worst until the final episode wich for me doesn\u00b4t make any sense. In the first 6 episodes, we had a creepy and spooky show with a lot of interesting stuff to explain (Like Misaki's Mei green eye) or all the dolls of that store .. they fogot all of that and focused on a crappy gore style and action story .. so i don\u00b4t recomend whatch this anime .. i got really disapointed with this show.",

            "content": "Another is a uniquely made anime leaving you to question it's every aspect, and every character, making you unsure of what was going to happen next, and who was at stake of a mysterious curse happening within a newly transferred student's classroom. It's a fresh, new drama with plenty of horror thrown in. \r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nThe story of Another takes it's time to unravel. It took it's time to build up to where it would finally tumble over and release the inner demons of the characters. The score was cut short, as with a story like this it was hard to understand clearly what theoriginal direction storyline was heading in, as different characters were telling different parts to the 'curse'. There were a few parts here and there with cohesion issues, it sometimes felt like there was something missing the whole time.  This is a good and a bad thing sorely because it left the watcher unsure of what was going to happen next, and who was really at fault. The story took it self seriously from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nI don't feel as if the art and animation had much of a power within this show, but any of the scenes where much animation was necessary, it served well and none of the scenes or episodes left you cringing with it's bad animation or art style. This anime was more focused on the story rather than focusing on the art, which is understandable. The art wasn't overly complicated and the colors weren't overpowering, which is necessary for a horror-genre anime. It was calming to the eye considering the tone the anime was in, and any visuals that were present still looked well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending credits of this show is considered to be two of my favorite songs. The sound track throughout the show hands over even more of the story's eerie feeling, especially the seemingly 'theme song' that character, Mei has. It can be a bit overplayed once in a while, but I can see that the point was that if you heard the song, that's what you would think of. Well played. It gives a feeling that everyone involved is just another victim within this game-like curse. They're waiting to see who is next. The music gives a feeling of uncertainty and it serves well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 \\n\r\nI think the characters were well developed enough to where we could see what type of person they were, for their flaws and their advantages over others. It made you unsure of what type of person they were at the same time, and that everyone had some sort of fault or flaw that would've made them questionable, but equal. It wasn't so great at some points, we weren't able to feel much sympathy for some of the characters because of their underdeveloped stories, but I do understand they can only fit in so much into 12 episodes. You wanted to feel some type of emotion, but it was like you were sitting back and watching it all happen, which is actually clever at the same time. It was sort of an advantage, so that when anything interesting happened, we weren't able to think highly of other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because it forced you to think a certain way, and realize that everyone was at stake because of the class curse. You were uncertain of every single character that was presented to the audience. It has a slightly slow build up, but then it quickly picks up and the ending serves well and is very bittersweet once the ending credits roll. It forces you to think deeply and put yourself in the position of the students. It doesn't necessarily focus on the physical aspect and the horror aspect, even though that is a huge portion of it. It focuses on the psychological aspect and what happens to people when they're desperately searching for a solution to something seemingly unsolvable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it does have it's paranormal-ish aspects to it, but it serves as a pretty realistic anime that is also very enjoyable if you're into the drama/horror genre. I would also like to add that there is an OVA that exists called, Another: The Other. I felt like this should've been added into the show as it would clear up some confusion that watchers may have. It was important to the storyline, and it would've made the anime a little bit more cohesive. It was very enjoyable and recommended to anyone who is interested in paranormal/horror/drama/thriller genres.",

            "content": "*Review contains minor spoiler*\r\nStory - 9 The plot is so intriguing that I sometime even wish that my new class would have a curse like it, no, not because I want everyone to go batshit crazy but because it'd be so cool to get to the bottom of a mystery like this. The pacing of this series is perfect, which may not applies to generic-shounen-boys because it takes a few episode until the curse is revealed to the male lead, even so they managed to remove any possible cliffhangers and ended with a happy-ish ending (yea right, watch it and see) in 12 episodes +OVA. As much as I love the plot twists, I must rate this a 9, why? Because Final Destination deaths, I'm sorry to say this but I laughed as that umbrella pierce -insert-character-name-here-'s paper face, plus that last episode's events felt like it contain some minor plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 I love the art in this series, the background effects and creepy lightning just make the show more dreadful (in a positive way, of course), like most horror/mystery series, the contrast is always darker, giving it a more intimidating view, hell, even the school's design was scary itself, it looks like something where \"Corpse Party\" can take place.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 Decent enough soundtrack for a horror anime, quite fitting, especially the OP, well, except for the animation, but that's on a different matter. Ending song also tell the mood of the series well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9 - At one point (mostly the first half) I find myself watching this mostly because of Misaki, I love the backstory that she have as part of the package that coem with the plot. As for our male lead, he was more of a meh, but atleast he proved that he was able to understand most of the confusing events that's suddenly taking places around him. This is getting a little long, might as well do my third character: Izumi Akazawa, 11/10 would bang, on a more serious note, I have no idea why I like Izumi that much, maybe it was because of the possible ship? Yea, that's most likely it... I do wish the MC had more development though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 - The reviews above explains this part... But I have something to add too, never watch this while lying down, because you'll keep sitting up and saying \"naruhodo\" at every god damn important plot points/twist, atleast that's what I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.5 - Am I overrating this? No, of course I'm not. Am I a die-hard Another fanboy? Yes, of course I am. In my opinion the series certainly lived up to my score, I enjoyed every bit of it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a breath of fresh air to the horror genre, which has been relying on common tropes for far too long.\r\nI read the Another manga before I watched the anime, and I can say confidently that the manga is 10s across the board for story, art, character development, and enjoyment. A few things are changed in the anime (I can't say what they are, because of spoilers), but not enough to make me enjoy it any less. The anime explains things just as well as the manga does, and the art is at the same level. \r\nOne of my favorite things about thisanime is the character design. All of them are visually appealing, and even the minor characters are unique enough to be easily differentiated. Personality-wise, they are interesting and most of them have a well-developed background/character arc. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it is extremely confusing for the first few episodes, but everything begins to fall into place later on. This is certainly an anime that requires brain power, so if you're looking for a fluffy time-waster, go somewhere else (there's a whole genre for that type of thing).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP leaves a bit to be desired in subtlety, but that isn't this anime's strong point. The ED song is hauntingly gorgeous and worth a listen, even if you don't end up watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is my favorite horror anime, and one of my favorites of any genre. Overall, it's about a 9.7 - 9.8. Definitely watch it if you're a horror fan. Even if you aren't, this one may change your mind.",

            "content": "Another is one of those animes that will surprise you. Its like a different version of Higurashi, but it gives out more excitement. It is one of those animes that you cannot stop watching until it ends.\r\nPlot:\r\nThe plot so far is being slowly explained while it still have time as a 12 episode anime, but I already the plot outstanding when I draw out my conclusion after seeing the third episode. Of course we have a transfer student who will not know everything about his town or school. Next, everyone will try to avoid telling him about a certain student who died 26 years ago.After seeing a girl who seems to appear somewhere, the classmates would try to get him away from the girl, but too late and everything goes bloodly. I expect the plot to even go deeper than I think I should expect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI think the characters are just great because what makes this anime a bit more exciting is how one of the main charcters, Kouichi Sakaibara, intends to find out what happened in his class 26 years ago. Its like a mystery to him and he has to find out somehow by asking the girl he kept seeing, Mei Misaki.\\n\r\nMei Misaki is a character that interests me. I seriously love mystery and horror animes with these kind of characters. Mei is that character who will interest you because you think she might be the girl who died 26 years ago. She is also that character you want to know about because we hardly know Mei until the third episode. Who knows, but I won't spoil the third episode for people are just started watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAnother is a horrific anime that people should watch. The mystery, the characters, and the blood is what makes this anime go on my top 50 animes of this year. I could hardly wait for more episodes because my blood is already pumped for more. So I highly recommend people to watch it if you really love mysteries and blood.",

Well, First of all, I would like to say that this is gonna be my first time making a rewiew and this is solely about on my own opinion and personal experience in the serie itself. Second is that I would like you to know that English isn't my native language so please bear with me if there's any grammatical errors. \r\nThis Review is only about the Anime not the Manga/Novel. Ratings are subject to change. I have no experience yet in making a review so definitely errors and inaccuracies will be expected.\r\nLet's kick off the review by rating the STORY: 9/10\r\nThe Reasonwhy I gave the story a 9.6 is because of it's versatility and being open ended for each of the episode. The Story will try to keep the viewer in tact with the happenings inside the world of this serie making the people like being the one playing the role of those characters. It makes the viewer/s wonder on what's next. The suspense, the mysteries and the thrills are there to bind the viewer's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThe character designs were well delivered and well drawn. It makes me and the people viewing appreciate the beauty of the serie. The combination of all the stuffs being rendered makes the serie \"a must watch\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound effects were greatly done and its flawless tbh making the serie more real and more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were appealing to the viewers but still something's lacking with in each of the people around the serie. Let's just see since it's still halfway.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime so far. It feels like watching a real life horror story or movie. This anime really keeps me on appreciating the beauty of horror. I have no regrets taking this anime in the first quarter of 2012. Perhaps, making it one of the best series of 2012, huh?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nUnpredictable/Great story line; Well drawn char design; Flawless sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nSo... if you're currently making a research about a good horror mystery anime to watch, I bet you'll really love this. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT 2/17/12",

            "content": "\u201eAnother\u201c  is just another thriller/horror story in just 12 episodes. With 23min per each episode you can finish this anime in less than 5h (4h and 36min to be exact) and it's definitely worth the time. \r\nAnother is actually a Japanese novel written by Yukito Ayatsuji. After the manga adaptation an anime series, directed by Tsutomu Mizushima, was launched in 2012. \r\nStoryline & Plot\r\nThe story line is very smooth with not a single plot hole. I think that it kind of merges from horror ghost story to a killer thriller, and that\u2019s what really gives the show the special taste. \r\nSo, the story beginswhen Shakakibara Kouchi (what a name) moves from Tokyo to a small town called Yomiyama and enrolls The Yomiyama Middle School. Right in the beginning he feels that something is rather odd about his new class. Ninth graders class 3. All the talks about \u201cNot breaking the rules\u201d and \u201cNot letting him know\u201d makes Kouchi and the audience just more curious. He gets closer to solving the mystery after meeting the little girl with the eye-patch, Misaki Mei. But wait\u2026 Misaki who? No one except Kouchi sees or knows anything about her. Is he crazy? Is she a ghost? Is that the mystery of class 3? Well, find it out on your own. \\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters I\u2019ll just talk about the main three:\\n\r\nKouchi: An ordinary boy that becomes part of an unusual story. I was surprised that despite all the happenings he keeps calm and puts on a brave face. To be honest, I would completely lose my mind.\\n\r\nMisaka: That girls looks just resemble her personality. Dark and emotionless, but strong. She really the creeps, not to mention the eye-patch.\\n\r\nAkazawa: You probably have an Akazawa in your own class too (American High School excluded). The oh so smart, pretty and popular girl that sits always in the first row. A very strong character and a leader. As the head of countermeasures and later on the Class Officer she does her job very well. I personally think that she is, let\u2019s say, the best developed character and my favorite. \\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThis is just how a horror anime should look like. Dark, with a lot of ravens and a creepy music in the background. I hope you notice the doll-pictures that keep flashing in every episode. Unique characters, awesome graphics\u2026what to say, hats off. \\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know what to do the whole afternoon go to Hulu, Crunchyroll or I recommend Gogoanime, dive into the story of Shakakibara Kouchi and enjoy. And don\u2019t worry, you can put away your pillow after a few episodes but don\u2019t you dare to stop watching until the very end.\\n",

            "content": "Hello :3\r\nSo, for you who don't have a clue of what this anime is about, I'll give you a hint. Another is soooooo similar to Final Destination.\r\nAnother tells us about some kind of deadly curse(they called it a natural phenomena) that kills students(actually not just students) in Yomiyama North Middle School's third year's third class with some kind of pattern. That's all I can say. I really don't want to tell more of synopsis because all of it would be spoilers.\r\nThis anime follows two main characters, a boy who just transferred, and an isolated girl who is ignored by the whole class and considered tobe a nonexistent. And again that's all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are displayed perfectly. The two MCs are great, but the supporting characters are really good. Unlike those animes which has all similar supporting characters, Another's characters are all unique, and the background of these characters will get you mindfucked!\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Another packs a lot fun. There's a whole lot of surprises and also MAJOR PLOT TWIST. Seriously. Watching this made me say \"WTF just happened\" countless of times.\\n\\n\r\nI don't watch thriller animes so often, but I must say that Another really got me impressed. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend anime for those who likes plot twist and can handle some bloody death scenes.\\n\\n\r\n:3 thanks\\n",

In the past there was a student who was very popular. In the middle of the school year a tragic accident happens, thus that student passing away. When everything started going back to normal, a student sees the deceased. If the students ignore the \"ghost\" then everything will be fine. But if one of the students acknowledges the ghost then the students will start dying in bizarre accidents one by one. It's up to Kouichi to put an end to the curse.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe animationwas good. I enjoyed the way the characters and background were drawn. It tied the anime together really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe sound effects and ending/opening songs went along with the anime quite nicely. \"Anamnesis\" by Annabel is one of my favorite anime endings and it was a good song chosen to end the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI loved all the characters, though there wasn't much character development except for in the character of \"Mei Misaki\" In the beginning she was shy and didn't talk to anyone except for Kouichi.

            "content": "Curiously, I cannot figure out whether I enjoyed \"Another\" or not.\r\nStory - 7. I think what I question most would be the story. Let's think about what a horror genre is. This could be quite different with each viewer, but I believe an anime of the horror genre is intended to scare the viewer. This leads me to think of jump scares, anxiety attacks, etc. etc. While \"Another\" did have the child genres mystery and thriller, I did not find it to be frightening. The ending became more scaring, as everything was in chaos and disarray, while they maintained the mystery and thriller even then,that I enjoyed very much, but during the plot build and development, there was nothing keeping me to the edge of my seat, making me flip to the next episode, instead, a lot of things only left me asking \"why\" rather than \"Oh god, who?\" or something similar to a frightened perspective. Overall, I enjoyed the plot, and the mystery and thriller aspects were pulled off quite chiefly, however, in looking for a horror anime, I feel dissatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10. I am finding that I am not picky with the art. The animation was fluent, the details of reactions and movements were realistic, and overall, I enjoyed the art style as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8. I am also finding that I am not the person to look for when it comes to music opinion. I enjoyed the music when it was present, because I apparently like all anime music. I gave this rating short of a 10 however because during build up, or critical moments, music was not at all playing, which is crucial to a horror film.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10. Everyone was outstanding. Every character had a \"life,\" so to say. Nobody was just a side character which we don't care about, everyone has friends, family, history, possessions, which they all hold dearly, and will serve to push them off the edge.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6. Even at the end of writing this review, I'm not sure whether I enjoyed or disliked this anime. Again I say that the plot concept and the sister elements such as mystery and thriller were pulled off quite nicely, but since I was looking into this for the horror I did not find, I have mixed feelings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8. The entire series of course averages out to a 10. Confusing as I may be, I do suggest this anime, if not for the horror, than to enjoy the mystery and suspense, which this anime is rich with. Also if only to experience what it's like to have extensive background knowledge on every character, regardless of whether or not they are side or main characters.",

            "content": "If you are reading this because you have not yet seen this anime and want to know if it is the right anime for you, then please keep in mind that this is my opinion and may be contrary to your own so take what I say here with a grain of salt and consider your own tastes when reading this. If you have already seen this anime then you're kind of just along for the ride but I will talk about re-watching in this review.\r\nStory/Characters:\r\nTo start off, this anime has a bit of a slow start, I mean the first two episodes can bemind bogglingly boring and when I first watched this I almost quit. However after that the story begins to pick up pace as you learn more and more about the mysterious Class 3 that our main male protagonist \"Kouichi Sakakibara\" has just transferred into and of course \"Mei Misaki\".\\n\r\nThis anime handles the plot really well as it reveals that not all is what it seems and the show takes a few twists and turns until it finally climaxes and everything comes full circle and then even has some closure at the end. To me this anime was just satisfying and gave me what I wanted with out it being too predictable and I definitely think this is an anime that you should see twice just so you can connect all the dots. To sum it all up the story definitely does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, there is a wide variety of characters in the show but they're all kind of cannon fodder and start dying left and right which doesn't leave a lot of time to develop them and there are other characters like Akazawa who I felt like should have been a little more fleshed but wasn't, I mean Akazawa is normally made out to be a tragic character but I just didn't feel it.\\n\r\nNow as for the main characters, Kouichi is sort of like your average male protagonist that is kind of plot device more than anything else but not really, there is some actual depth to him and to me he did feel more like a character than a plot device. As for Mei Misaki, she starts out as you average silent, mysterious (Rei Ayanami clone) type character but as the show progresses she kind of stops being that and steps outside that archetype and is likely the most developed character in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation are really good and I loved the character designs and I don't really have anything bad to say about it.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack definitely works for this anime and keeps pace with the erie atmosphere of the show and even the use of sound is really erie and I feel like it's really polished and perfected in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nYes, there is in fact an english dub for this anime and from what I've seen, this is probably one of Sentai Filmwork's best works, though there were some characters it think sounded a little better in Japanese but most of the cast did a really good job (though I wish they could loosen up a bit) but one thing I definitely have to note is that Greg Ayres and Monica Rial are not annoying, usually they're the most annoying english VAs but in this they're not and they do an excellent job in portraying Kouichi an Mei Misaki and I honestly can't imagine Mei Misaki without Monica Rial's voice and this is my favorite anime to hear these two VAs in.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI'm giving this anime a 9/10 which is a rare score for me but I find this anime pretty re-watchable to me and I can't really think of a whole lot of bad things for this anime.",

            "content": "Very rarely do I watch horror/mystery anime shows. However, after longing for one that is of similar caliber to Higurashi, I managed to stumble upon a new series called 'Another'. Short story short, the story felt enticing enough for me to give the anime worth a try. \r\nStory - The story is nothing really special as it's the typical boy leaves big city and goes to a creepy, small town area where people are hiding secrets from him and he wants to unravel the mystery only to find out there's a curse or 'calamity' going on in the particular class he's in. However, once theviewer learns that there is 'another' or 'extra' to be found and the rules of how the calamity works, the story plot unravels into something a little more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - The art and animation in this show is definitely one of its strongest points. There color palette and scenery really add to the whole mystery/horror atmosphere. The only annoying and cheap scares they made were the dolls, which is an old horror scare trick. Other than that the characters move fluidly and the use of black crows was a nice extra touch to add to the whole horror/mystery feel of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound - I would have to say that sound is the strongest point of the anime. The music really brings forth tension when things are getting hectic or something bad or eerie is about to happen. There were times where I bit my lip in anticipation on what would happen to certain characters as the dreary music started rolling. The only complaint I have sound wise is that halfway through the anime, it becomes rather obvious when something bad is going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - This is where the anime starts to crumble apart. At the start of the series, the characters all have a mysterious side to them. All of them seem to be hiding something while some specific characters seem to have ulterior motives. After the first few episodes, the mysterious tension and alluring atmosphere between Kouichi and Misaki is lost and PA Works focuses a bit too much on accelerating the story plot instead of the characters. After watching through the whole series, I couldn't help but wanting more interaction between the characters and their relationships with one another. This way, when one of the characters died, one would really feel for the characters as 'human'. Higurashi and Steins;gate are good examples of really doing a great job of character interaction and development. 'Another' unfortunately falls flat in this. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't help but laughing at the stupidity of Kouichi several times in the anime. Yes, I understand that Kouichi along with class 3-3 have experienced great trauma via the calamity, but a lot of their actions later on in the anime, particulary the last arc, were just plain stupid. At one point, Kouichi, our main protagonist, is literally talking ON HIS CELL with Misaki....when there's a FIRE GOING ON!!!! The only two characters that were compelling were Misaki because of her mysterious and alluring looks in general and the counter-measures girl, Izumi (red-haired). \\n\\n\r\nOne last complaint I have is that they could have developed more interaction between Kouichi and his aunt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I have to admit for whatever reason, I always sat in anticipation for the next episode. The anime isn't particularly original in any aspect, but the sound and mysterious atmosphere of the anime was what made it so compelling I guess to me. The use of cliffhangers does get admittedly pretty old as it is a rather cheap trick to get viewers to want to watch the next episode in anticipation. The anime does so well at the start for the first 4 to 5 episodes, but afterwards starts to go on a slippery slope of identity crisis. As many have noted in forums, it is often compared to Final Destination because of the ridiculous death scenes that occur. After a while, I feel that PA Works started to focus a little too much on these deaths making them ridiculous as possible, and less emphasis was put forth on the great mysterious atmosphere that was put forth at the start of the series. Pretty soon, we see in the last arc, PA Works must have been inspired by 'Battle Royale'. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc (Battle Royale shall I say) really put the series down for me. There was little to no mystery left and it was only a matter of time that they would finally reveal who the 'another' is, which was obvious to me by episode 8 or so. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - What started out to be a fantastic horror/mystery anime came down to a rather disappointment due to what the anime could have been. The last arc brought down the series greatly that I started to not care anymore about the characters besides Misaki and perhaps Kouichi. PA Works no doubt excels in their execution art and sound department wise, but have continued their tradition of poor execution of the last arc or in other words, wrapping up an anime series. Again, the story plot became too much of the focus while the character development and interaction took a big backseat. If it were not for the terribly executed last arc, this anime would be upped to around a score of 8. As it stands, this anime receives a 'fair' rating. I would definitely give this anime series a go, but expect yourself to be severely disappointed by the ridiculous last arc of the anime.",

            "content": "A horror mystery Anime, that goes by the name of \"Another\", definitely was done well. It does start off slow, but it's to throw the viewer off, when the suspense kicks in! The story has a way of making you want to know more, as well as keeping you guessing and on the edge of your seat. One of the great things I found about this Anime. is that it stuck to what it knew it could do best, it didn't try to venture out of it's comfort zone like other shows happen to do. \r\nNow although it had a compelling interesting story, it doeshave it's flaws character wise, with no growth or development for most of the cast. The most development you'll get, is for the main two leading the show. The animation happens to be great, with the horror scenes! Making the characters look crazy or insane, showcasing the grief and scare some of them have. The animation is also very dark and suits the Anime well. Nothing special, but gets the job done. Same for the sound effects and voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I really found this to be an enjoying horror Anime that gave me something to look forward to in each episode, past episode 3. It could have gone longer to develop some things, but that's not what the show is really for. It told the story, and got it over with. Which leaves me rewarding \"Another\" with a solid 7.7/10, and a recommendation to watch! If you enjoy mystery, with a bit of gore and violence, look no further.",

            "content": "When I found out that Another was a mystery horror show, I was pretty excited since there are not a lot of animes that really try to do this. After watching it entirely, all I can say it's that it was kind of a disappointment. \r\nSTORY (5/10): There are some cool elements here and there. The first episodes are good, full of mystery and really interesting (THEY ARE VERY SLOW THOUGH (Which are not a problem per se but end up being one (I will explain later)), however, it ends up becoming worse and worse from the middle to the end. First off, the curseor whatever you want to call it doesn't make much sense at all. Second, the pacing; because of how slow the first part is, it seems that the show ends abruptly in order to have only 12 episodes. In addition to that, the deaths are so ridiculous that they make you laugh instead of feel intrigued about what's happening. Also, a good mystery really needs to have clues throughout the whole series so you could find out who really is the culprit (in this case, the extra person). However, THERE IS ALMOST TO NOTHING, and what is worse is that THE MYSTERY COULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED WAY BEFORE IF MISAKI DID SOMETHING. Oh, and by the way, what was the purpose of that weird dance moment? \\n\\n\r\nART (7/10): There's nothing extremely negative I could say about the art. The characters seem generic but they are well designed. And the background looks appropiate.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10): The opening was not that good when I first heard it, but after listening it a few more times, I ended up liking it a little. The ending was very calm, and a decent song. The background sounds are really good and fitting, making you feel in suspense. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (2/10): The characters are really bland and most of them do not develop at all. In fact, a lot of them followed archetypes we've seen done better before, like Mei, who clearly was a Rei Ayanami clone.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (5/10): I wouldn't say I enjoyed a lot, but I really spend a nice time while watching it. I couldn't stop cringing at some parts, but still, that doesn't change that I was a little entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (5/10): I am not going to lie. While being a very flawed show, there are some cool things, but still, they could have been a lot better if done properly. I wouldn't say it's bad. Decent at best.",

I think out of all the animes labeled as HORROR genre, this one actually is the real deal.\r\nStory: 9.5/10\r\nThe most fascinating part is the PLOT. While watching the anime, I was intrigued by its complexity and and it was truly interesting. A transfer student from Tokyo comes to Yomiyama North Middle School, located near the Mt. Yomiyama and joins the Class 3 of the 9th grade. This class has a very creepy history. I don't want to spoil it. I thinktelling the history, the Synopsis somewhat spoils the story.\\n\\n\r\nI understand Japanese to some extent. So, when I was watching the Subs I found some wrong translations. Actually what the wrong subtitle suggested was more intriguing than the original story. I mean, at some some point, they translated \"aitsu\" as \"She\" and \"ko\" as \"girl\", when actually these 2 pronouns are neutral. Although I realized this 5 episodes later, I don't regret the original story either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was perfect for creating the perfect dark, creepy, strange environment that suits the anime perfectly and makes it way too enjoyable. It truly creates an unworldly damp atmosphere. I suggest the viewers to watch this anime alone after 12 at night, with all the lights turned off. Then, you'll see what I am talking out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh... the sound. It will make your heart stop at some points. You will feel those shivering cold feelings that I can' even express. Some sounds will come out all on a sudden and your heart may even lose a beat or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. But at some points in the anime, they were badly animated. I mean, one day after your friend dies before your eyes, you can't sit on a restaurant table and laugh and joke. This made me sad because the anime was perfect at every aspect except for these bad animations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHell YES! I look forward to seeing more anime like this one. It gave me a different kind of fun. This is the best part of a great horror story, you are scared but you enjoy yourself being scared.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to give a 10. But this anime could have been better at some places. So, I will have to settle with 9.",

            "content": "*This review doesn\u2019t take the prequel OVA into account\r\nAnother was a series that I never thought I would actually watch. That is mostly because it\u2019s a classified as horror anime, and I\u2019m not really in to the horror genre. While I\u2019d heard some negative things about the series, most of the reviews I saw were extremely positive, so I decided to sit down and watch it. And I have to say, Another was very underwhelming.\r\nStory:\r\nAnother takes place in a stereotypical backwater horror town, where our main character has just moved. Shortly after his arrival, starts to attended a new school and starts to get thefeeling that something isn\u2019t quite right. This feeling is confirmed when he realize that he is the only person in his class that seems to notice this strange girl sitting in the back of the class room. I have four major issues with the story. Firstly, it\u2019s a horror story that isn\u2019t the least bit scary. I\u2019m a person who hardly ever watches any sort of horror series, and this show didn\u2019t frighten me. It does a decent job of setting up a creepy and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, but that\u2019s it. Another\u2019s way of scaring you reminds me a lot of commercials I saw for Final Destination. Instead of making the story thrilling by being mysterious, or making the audience feel anxious, it just throws us a bunch of gruesome death scenes. The second reason is the way the story\u2019s mystery is told. It starts off my implying one thing, and then totally switches to something else. Some people might see that as the show keeping you on your toes, but it isn\u2019t like that at all. The first few episodes are spent dealing with something that was never an issue to begin with. You are tricked into thinking is, not because the story was written really well, but because it was intentionally vague. Granted they did have a reason for why it was vague, but that is an issue I have with the characters (they\u2019re all stupid), and I\u2019ll get into that later on. Not only that, but the solution to the problems they are having in the story was literally the first thing I thought of when the entire situation was explained to me (I\u2019m pretty sure it was somewhere between episodes 4 and 5). That leads me into my last two reasons that go hand in hand. Thirdly, you don\u2019t care about the characters in this series, and, lastly, they all act like idiots. As stated earlier, I have issues with the characters in this series, and those issues affect my view of the story, but I\u2019ll explain all of them in the Character section of this review. The series does come to a conclusion during it\u2019s last episode, but it leaves you with another, no pun intended, horror clich\u00e9\u2019 by teasing that the story isn\u2019t really over. I don\u2019t have a an big issue with the ending, other than the issues I have with the actions the characters took in it, but it wasn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nAnother does have solid animation throughout the series. There is some nice background scenery, as well as decently defined characters. The death scenes are well animated, and provide several cringe worthy moments. There isn\u2019t anything noteworthy here, but it does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is easily my favorite part of this series. All of the tracks have a dark and eerie sound that really helps to establish the shows creepy atmosphere. They definitely fit the tone of the series, and are really well done. There are definitely some songs that I could listen to all by themselves. The series\u2019 opening and endings are also both really well done and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are even more disappointing than the story. The story stars two main characters, Mei Misaki, and Kouichi Sakakibara. There are also several supporting characters in this series. My first issue with the characters is that were are given little to no backstory or development on any of the characters, including the protagonists. My second and main issue with the all of the characters in this series, is that they all incredibly stupid. They are worse than stereotypical horror movie stupid. At least in horror movies people can say they made stupid decisions out of ignorance, but in Another everybody knows what is happening. Everyone, from the students in the classroom down the hall to the school principle, and they make no logical attempts to end this problem. They do, unofficially, form a department for counter measures, but, the adult\u2019s infinite wisdom, they decide that it would be best to allow a middle school student to be in charge of it. It\u2019s things like that that really irritated me while I was watching the series. No one had any common sense. They would just act like their only option was to go to school and hope that they didn\u2019t die. Needless to say, that didn\u2019t work, because a lot of people die in this series. No need to worry though, because you won\u2019t find yourself growing attached to any of the characters. So when they meet their brutal ends, you won\u2019t even miss them the next episode. The reason for this is, like stated earlier, because they lack background information, development, and make choices so stupid that your not even surprised that any of them end up dead. The weak characters drastically affect the story of the series. Since the main tool Another uses to scare you are the death scenes, you\u2019d think that they\u2019d want you to actually care about the characters that they are slaying in front of you. You\u2019d also think that they would have come up with characters that would be able to think rationally enough to come up with the most obvious solution to the problem they are facing. The characters aren\u2019t totally unlikeable; they\u2019re just not very fun or interesting to watch either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t have a great time watching this series. I\u2019ll admit that I was decently entertained, and I was interested in exactly what the real issue is the story was. But, this isn\u2019t anything I\u2019d really think about watching again.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2.7/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.1/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2.4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/5\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3.1/5\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Another isn\u2019t a bad series, but I can\u2019t recommend that you watch his series unless you are just really into horror and or gore.",

            "content": "[*NO SPOILERS*]\r\nHi everybody. This is NickSharpx and this is my second ever anime review, so, hmm.. Where could I start from? I have a lot to say about to this masterpiece, so keep reading if you're interested into watching this!\r\nI'll begin with a little disclaimer that could save a lot of people: If you're one of those people who like to watch OVAs before the series, then don't you dare doing it this time. In this case, Another's OVA is a prequel, meaning that the action takes place before the whole story, although you're meant to watch it at the end, like a sequel.\r\nOk, withthat being said, man. This anime, is just, one of the best I've seen so far. Honestly, when I was recommended this anime the first thing that got me fascinated was the horror/thriller genre its story fits in. I was in shock when, at the end of the anime, I actually was to become aware of how many different feelings this anime gave me. There were many, but the one that was prevalent was the continuous thirstiness in knowledge of what would've happened next. You know, that helpless being on the edge of your seat watching and waiting for everything to happen.\\n\r\nI felt like the characters were well developed (although some weren't as much as I feel they should've) and the story was truly amazing, I really enjoyed how the action was distributed throughout the entire series, the soundtracks were always perfectly fitting and the anime overall really wanted me to watch more and more of it as it had a lot to offer, and it's proven itself to be a fantastic one.\\n\r\nThe only reason why I gave it a 9/10, which I would consider more like a 9.5/10 is because I felt like there was something missing. After watching the whole anime I thought that it needed one more, single episode. I swear, if they developed little they left about a few of the main characters, it would've defenetely been an 11/10, not even a 10/10. Most of the few points that I think could've been developed a little more were found within the episodes 9-12, and they were about 3 in the whole series (obviously including the specific character I think should've developed more).\\n\r\nSo, lastly.. Is this an anime I could recommend to people? DEFENETELY. It's an anime that is fantastic, everything about it is just almost flawless, its story is perfect for the genre. Everytime I'd try guessing what would've happened next (even thinking outside the box) I would find myself disproven, and I think that even people who don't like horror/thriller series will enjoy this one for sure! If you're kinda like me, or, a guy who laughs at horror movies then try this, and I'll give a penny to everybody who'll say they haven't enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nHope you guys found this review helpful, if so, show it clicking on \"I found this helpful\" so that more people can read it! \\n\\n\r\nPeace, and have a good time watching this series!\\n\r\nNickSharpx",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nFor some people, myself included, death is a scary thing. It is both mysterious and closer to us than we may usually think. Some aspects in our life deal with death as well, such as superstitions and more commonly funerals. It is with death in-mind that Another takes to heart, and after watching the show, I walked away having enjoyed a pleasant experience.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe basic premise for Another is that our new transfer student Kouichi has transferred into a new middle school. However, when he enters, he slowly learns that there is something quite mysterious going on within theclassroom.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, this show is not horror. It never goes out of its way to scare you or make you jump. What it does, however, is provide a very good creepy atmosphere that adds to the mysteriousness of the situation. Many questions early on are left unanswered, and there is always this lingering feeling that something out of Kouichi's control is guiding him and the class along. And this is what the show does well, especially with the other main character Mei Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is split mainly into two arcs, who is Mei Misaki and what can we do to solve the mystery. I greatly enjoyed the first half of the show simply because it provided the most mystery with Mei. Who is this girl? Why does she act this way? Where does she come from? I think it is generally regarded in the anime world that good mystery/horror is hard to come by, so I was surprised how nicely done the first half was executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half was not as enjoyable since the majority of the mystery gave way to \"shock\" value. Now, this show is gory; it is not afraid to kill off people and it happens early (and often). But I felt like the show started to prioritize the gore over the mystery as it went on, which was a huge letdown.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there were way too many something-is-about-to-happen-but-is-interrupted moments for my liking. I don't really mind when it occurs every once in a while. But it felt as if the show was using that technique to drive the plot along and it was getting quite annoying when it happened at regular intervals. At the very least, I shouldn't be able to guess when they are going to cut away from some big reveal.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThis show was created by P.A. Works. As such, it may come as no surprise that the scenery and overall art for the show is beautiful. When it comes to thrillers and horror-esque shows, it is paramount that the general atmosphere be filled with unease and intrigue. And the show does this well. It uses a lot of reds, browns, grays, and blacks to give us a town filled with despair, dread, and death.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show is quite similar to Glasslip in terms of actual animation, in that there really isn't any (credit to /u/tundranocaps, a reddit user, for pointing this out). Yes, the show is definitely pretty and perfectly gloomy. But there is actually very little character movement or anything in particular happening on-screen at any one time. This may be because they focus a lot of money/time/resources on the backgrounds and environments, but they really don't do anything spectacular with regard to actual movement.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the gorgeous backdrops, I enjoyed the character designs as well. I am a fan of these types of characters (my favorite being what KyoAni draws), so I had no real complaints with the way they were designed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor certain shows, certain aspects are more important than others. For example, a slice-of-life doesn't really rely on a strong story but requires its cast to be incredibly strong in order to have an enjoyable show. For Another, it is not about the characters but about the mystery and the story behind it. So I give them some slight bias in their favor when I say that their characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nNo one in particular was engaging to me, except Mei (and again, only in the first half). Besides Mei, the rest of the cast were rather boring and plain. We never learn much about any of them, even Kouichi, and when we do, it is usually irrelevant information that doesn't add anything to situation. Again, I would fault the show more for this, but I understand that they are not the focus of the show, but when I don't care about 9/10 of the people I am watching in the show, then there is something wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the most important parts of horror/creepy shows or movies is definitely its sound, for sound adds to the atmosphere (which is arguably the most important part for these types of shows). The OP can be listened to here. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, especially the visuals (the reds and dark colors give off a nice vibe that was perfect for the show). The ED was generic, but gave a sharp contrast to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, I found the rest of the soundtrack to be nicely composed. There were sharp tones and creepy repetitions. Most of the music is not something you would listen to on its own, which is good, because it was definitely designed to fit the aura that the show was giving off.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime or any other medium, I tend to rate shows more highly if they have the \"balls\" to kill off very important characters to a story. However, I wouldn't put Another under this same category mainly because the characters themselves were not important enough (to me) to warrant any sort of emotional feedback. But that isn't to say I didn't enjoy the show. Frankly, I liked it a lot simply because it was different from most of the other cutesy/ecchi/dramatic/comedic shows that I had been watching recently. It wasn't perfect, but for at least the first half, the show did a nice job in the genre it was looking to represent.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, good first-half but bad second-half\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, beautiful art but actual animation is lacking\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Mei Misaki is the only notable character, sadly\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, sound and general ambiance add nicely to the atmosphere\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, not the typical genre for anime so in this case different was nice\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 6/10",

They all matched the characters which all had nice stories and personalities  that matched their looks and way of talking.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said on the start of the review, I really enjoyed this and I think that this is one of those animes that you can really enjoy if you stay with the story and think of it. Horror with a slight \"comedy\" in it and also a nice touch of psychological questions for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the greatest animes that I've seen and will be!\\n\\n\r\nIf you have not seen this yet and like a bit of horror and crazy things, you should try this!\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to everyone who likes to watch horror things.",

Gripping suspense from the first episode \u2014 transfer student, a mysterious young girl, strange new school in rural Japan, and a \"killer\" myth \u2014 the anime had me on the edge of my seat to the very bitter end. It was a flabbergasting, gory, enthralling mystery. The artwork was decently executed; what I liked the most was that extra characters had individuality; however it was slow paced at times, with a generic male lead that did practically nothing (Mei, the female lead, was probably the most intriguing characterthe entire show). Overall, I enjoyed it immensely in every sense of the word: if you are looking for some horror where you can just sit back and enjoy the gore without having to think much, this is for you.",

            "content": "I have to say, Another is one of my favorite animes. I started this with my friend last summer, and couldn't stop watching it, and I mean that almost literally. \r\nI myself am a fan of blood and gore, which this show doesn't hesitate to provide you with. If you don't like that kind of show, then I HIGHLY suggest you stay away. \r\nStory: The story was great and kept throwing curve balls throughout the majority of the show. Some parts were a bit predictable and even clich\u00e9, but others were completely unexpected, like the spontaneous dance scene (which I found to be hilarious). Theended was one no one was expecting, or at least that's the impression I got. I can't say much without ruining the entire show, but you will be surprised to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nI'd also say that the plot was unique. I haven't actually scene or heard of any other shows with a similar story line, and that's impressive. They managed to fit a complex story into 12 episodes, which can either make or break a show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It was simplistic, yet detailed at the same time (contradictory much?). I've seen similar art styles for the characters before, so I wasn't blown away by the shading or movement. The backgrounds were well made, and quite detailed in some scenes. A personal favorite example of the graphics is the opening; it represents the show well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the soundtrack for Another, so much that I've deemed it to be one of my most favorite soundtracks. I went back and searched again for many tracks from the show, downloaded them, and thoroughly enjoyed them from then on. The main theme, while it didn't fit perfectly with the show itself, was well done and enjoyable, though the backtracks were by far the most memorable. Be warned, they can be creepy (so don't make the mistake I did and listen to them in the middle of the night with all the lights off). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I loved the characters, simply put. They were likable (except for Izumi, I was never really fond of her), and  believable, given the circumstances that they were in. I thought each had a unique personality, and though the traits have been seen in other characters before, they had enough originality to make them, well, original, new, and a bit refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I really did enjoy every minute of this show. It was unique, captivating, and moved at a great pace, for me, at least. There was nothing I had any complaints about, really; the art was good, music wasn't repetitive or obnoxious, and none of the characters were stereotypical. I do feel like they could have gone into more detail with the 'calamity', but they got all the important facts down. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I would most definitely watch another season, or more, if they decide to continue this series.",

            "content": "It's widely known that anime as a medium usually doesn't work out with the horror genre. \"Another\" challenges this notion and presents a story of accidents seemingly coincidental in nature, that lead to the demise of students and the family of these students. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAt first glance, the story itself is adequate. Basically, in class 3 of the 9th grade in Yomiyama North middle school, death will befall the students, teachers and families of these students in seemingly unprecedented ways. Our protagonist transfers into Yomiyama North middle school, due to familial circumstances, completely unaware of this rumour, and the tragedies begin. As you progress throughthe show, the students grow more desperate trying to escape the hands of death, \"climaxing\" at the end of the series with a plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like the pacing of this show was far too slow to be considered a thriller. Each episode blended into the next, and there was never a real sense of urgency. It felt like watching a train-wreck in slow motion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\n\"Another\" has a large cast of characters, with a focus on Sakakibara Kouichi and Misaki Mei. Initially I was intrigued by the potential of these characters. Sakakibara, the protagonist, is curious with the way the class operates, seemingly good natured and interested by another student Misaki. Misaki, on the other hand, can be seen as the doll archetype because she doesn't outwardly express emotions or reactions to tragic events. The story begins by leading you on, creating expectations for the characters, believing the show could deliver. It didn't. What we do get is a bunch of generic stereotypes and an overwhelming sense of incompetence by majority of the cast. Many of the characters actions don't match their intentions and most of the time these actions didn't make sense. I was dumbfounded by the sheer incompetence of some characters it was ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to comment on the soundtrack of the show. It worked well with the themes and tones of the show and didn't try to overwhelm to audience. It wasn't very memorable and the opening was no \"must watch\" either. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art for \"another\" is definitely one of it's strong points. Initially i was a bit put off by the characters design because they didn't quite match the theme the show was going for. However you quickly get used to it and even begin to enjoy it. Every scene is drawn to precision and there wasn't a single moment where i felt that animation was off or lacking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nHonestly i was really invested with the plot at the start of the show, but gradually it became duller and duller to the point of \"whatever\". It's starts off true to it's mysterious nature, and you're itching to deduce these mysteries yourself. However once you get the answers to these mysteries, you immediately see the blatant flaws behind the logic of certain actions that make no sense and were really stupid. The ending was anticlimactic and i was left with no sense of closure because they hint at a possible, vital, element of the show that they completely ignore. The show never truly felt like it the \"climaxes\" or sense of anticipation it needed to be a thriller. Everything was slow paced, and they drag things out as long as possible before finally revealing the mystery behind it.\\n\r\nI also found it extremely frustrating when characters withheld vital information simply for the show to progress. If the creators had established the setting quicker, the story would have reached new levels of potential, but instead we're left with a lack-lustre, generic plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI'll say it again to re-iterate but there is never a real sense of urgency thus the \"thrill\" of the story is non-existent. As much as i've been badmouthing \"Another\" it's definitely not the worst i've ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone interested with the premises of the show but other than that anyone looking for a thought-provoking, thrilling horror series is going to have to keep looking because this show just didn't do that for me.\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a middle schooler named Misaki.  He was a beloved student, as smart as he was easy to get along with, and he had the unanimous favor of both his student body and the teaching staff.  He died tragically in a house fire that took not only his life, but that of his parents and siblings, too.  Distraught by this loss, his entire class adopted a ritual of pretending that he was still in the room with them.  They left his desk empty, gave him handouts, and even arranged for his posthumous graduation.  But littledid they know that by refusing to acknowledge their classmate\u2019s untimely demise, they were creating an opportunity for HIM to ignore his fate as well.\\n\\n\r\nEvery year following this event, Misaki\u2019s ghost stayed in that classroom as a student...  But his lingering spirit brought a tragic curse upon the residents of class 3.  If the number of seats in the classroom matched the number of students, then Misaki would have nowhere to sit, and thus, a string of tragic deaths would occur among the people who were connected to that class...  Both students, teachers and their relatives alike.  The only way to stop this curse was to alienate one student, pretending they didn\u2019t exist so that Misaki wouldn\u2019t feel left out...  And if they could hold this ritual down for one month, the deaths would not occur for the rest of the year.  Everything was going fine until one year, one transfer student was absent from the first day of school, and wasn\u2019t able to hear about these rules, and unfortunately for him, the first and second rule of Death Class is \"Do not talk about Death Class.\"  Will his curious questions draw the class closer and closer to their assured doom, or can they find some way to stop it in time to survive the school year and put it all behind them?\\n\\n\r\nWith Another, we\u2019re once again returning to the realm of PA Works, a company that\u2019s produced many impressive looking, high budget shows over the years.  Another doesn\u2019t seem to have that budget advantage, however, as it\u2019s a very staticky, text-heavy show all around.  About seventy five percent of the time, movement on screen is minimal, using fixed camera angles and talking heads for what should have been embarrassing lengths of time.  The other twenty five percent of the time, the animation will show off a dramatic increase of it\u2019s frame rate in order to carry the more action heavy moments, especially with it\u2019s bevy of gruesome death scenes.  For such a wide clash in animation style, the difference is surprisingly hard to notice, as the aesthetic of the series remains consistent throughout.  Chances are, you\u2019ll be too distracted by the show\u2019s gorgeous visual direction to notice just how inexpensive the animation really is, which is what ultimately saves it from looking like a cheap show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother adopts a dark, gothic aesthetic, and it\u2019s pulled off very well.  It\u2019s the most evident in one character\u2019s house, which is dimly lit and full of creepy looking ball joint dolls, but that one setting is small potatoes compared to the over-all atmosphere of the series which is gloomy, foreboding and full of realistic gritty details.  The character designs as well are grounded and simple, covering all the essential tropes while still never being over-the-top enough to distract from the heavy, somber mood.  Even the beach episode, while full of contextual fan service, never manages to betray the feeling of imminent danger surrounding the characters at all times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also very true to this mood.  Kow Otani is a legend, famous for his work on the Godzilla films and, more relevant to Another\u2019s tone, he\u2019s also highly celebrated for creating the soundtrack to the video game Shadow of the Colossus.  The music matches perfectly with every beat of the story, showing off it\u2019s blend of cute high school melodrama and harsh, heart-pounding horror to a frightening degree.  The perfect example of this is the track \u201cThe Story of Yomiyama,\u201d which inserts intense dramatic stings into a soothing yet still really creepy piano tune, and the two intermingle more and more throughout the track, sounding downright sinister by the one minute mark, and it creates the image of people running for their lives away from a terrifying monster who wants them for dinner and won\u2019t take no for an answer.  You won\u2019t find this kind of feeling from all of the music tracks heard throughout the series, but the feelings they do express are flawless across the board.  There are few things lonelier than Mei Misaki\u2019s character theme, and the opening theme, Kyoumu Densen by Ali Project, is a nigh-unskippable fast-paced goth rock piece, with vocals that match hauntingly well with the orchestration.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I heard that the dub for this show was being both written and directed by the same person, I was initially worried that it might have gone to Steven Foster, the notorious ruiner of material, butcher of teen dialogue, and possible space alien learning human speech patterns piece by piece to further his conquest of the planet.  Thankfully, the dub went instead to Chris Ayres.  I\u2019m not familiar with his behind-camera work, but if Another is any indication of his abilities, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more from him.  Overall, the performances in this dub are very grounded and naturalistic, with no real standouts to speak of...  Although in a dub like this one, uniformity is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few performances of note, though.  Monica Rial, who plays the character Mei Misaki, the student who\u2019s been chosen to be ignored by the class, brings a sense of bitterness to the character that was sorely lacking in the Japanese, as well as a condescending air when talking to odd man out Koichi.  Jessica Boone plays a pig-tailed tsundere girl named Izumi, who\u2019s been tasked with the title of Head of Countermeasures, which is a creative spin on the class rep title that a character like her would typically get.  She gives the character strength, as well as a patience that has very clear limits.  Blake Shepherd, who I\u2019ve bashed in the past, is used surprisingly well as the soft voiced Yuya.\\n\\n\r\nThe actors are directed extremely well by Ayres, who knows exactly when to get subtlety from them, and when to unleash the reigns and let them scream in blood curdling terror.  Every single voice crack is on point, every scream is terrifying, and the noises the unlucky students make as they\u2019re dying are skin-crawlingly realistic.  His interpretation of the script is faithful to the original, while still altering the wordings and turn of phrase just enough to be accessible to an English speaking audience without even once betraying the intention of any of it.\\n\\n\r\nI first watched Another way back in the fall of 2013, after being intrigued to pick it up by the smattering of clips that it inspired in both versions of AMV Hell 6.  The basic plot and several death scenes were already spoiled for me beforehand through word-of-mouth and the aforementioned AMV Hell clips, but I was still finding myself mildly entertained by the material.  It wasn\u2019t great, it wasn\u2019t giving me feels, but I was enjoying the dark tone and trying to figure out the mystery.  But then the ending happened...  The ending that people like to laud as being one of the greatest they\u2019ve ever seen.  Even people who didn\u2019t like the show still claim the final two episodes made the entire experience worth it for them.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s some pretty heavy praise, which is why I was all the more disappointed by my own reaction to it.  If nothing else, I can safely admit that the ending of Another affected me in a way that I don\u2019t think any other Anime\u2019s ending has affected me before...  It actually made me feel uncomfortable.  Honestly, throughout those two episodes, there were times where I felt sick to my stomach, and I wasn\u2019t sure why.  It couldn\u2019t be the violence...  Oh no, I\u2019ve seen and loved shows far more bloody than this, so what was it?  In the two years that have followed since then, and especially after watching it a second time for the sake of this review, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve finally pinned down what it was that kept me from enjoying this bloody, bloody spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into that, let\u2019s talk about the characters.  The two leads are Koichi, the boy who missed the rules, and Misaki, the excluded girl.  I hated them both, and they were the only two characters in the show that I actively wanted to see get killed.  Koichi, the boy we spend the majority of the series with, is one of those boring and bland main characters who exists as a blank slate for the viewer to project themselves onto, so that you can explore the story right alongside with them.  Honestly, the only thing I can remember about him is that his father lives in India.  His role in the story is to ask a lot of questions and make situations worse, so he\u2019s basically Mindy from Animaniacs.  \u201cIgnore that girl, she doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d  \u201cWhy?  Why?  Why?  Why?\u201d  And I get that, because nobody\u2019s allowed to tell him, and being left out of something sucks, but for God\u2019s sake, have an arc!  Get a hobby!\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is where the series gets it\u2019s iconic look, contrived though it may be.  She\u2019s the eyepatch girl, which is a tried and true trope, and she is owned entirely  by her darker color palette.  She speaks in stilted, overly formal slow speech and seems to have a serious phobia of contractions.  As far as her speech goes, she\u2019s basically a poor man\u2019s Rei Ayanami, right down to the fact that she literally lives in a house full of dolls that she probably adopted her personality from.  She even has a doll\u2019s eye in place of her missing eye.  I kind of like characters like that, so I really wouldn\u2019t mind her so much if the series wasn\u2019t such a troll about how they used her.  Her darker edges, while somewhat iconic, have absolutely nothing to do with the plot or story of the series, so she\u2019s seriously like that just for flavor, and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the ghost...  Yes, I\u2019m considering him a character, deal with it...  Who\u2019s level of power and influence is just plain laughable.  He\u2019s omnipotent, can monitor and kill you at any time, in any way, and for any reason as long as you\u2019re within the city limits, and I\u2019m still not sure what his motives are.  I just started picturing him as some stereotypical Looney Toons style mob boss, flipping a quarter while chewing a toothpick and daring anybody who he can control to oppose him or his best friend Murphy.  He has the Yuki Nagato-level ability to alter not only peoples\u2019 memories, but public records as well, which begs the question of why he doesn\u2019t just force people to think he exists, which he totally could.  But then again, for someone with so much power, he\u2019s somehow unable to notice a student leaving a tape full of clues behind in the classroom for years.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s only one character I did like, who I actually wanted to see survive...  A strong, selfless character with convictions that I really admired, and whom I wanted to learn more about...  I\u2019ll let you find out for yourselves whether or not they lived, but aside from those four, there isn\u2019t much of a cast to speak of.  The class is made up of walking character designs, some more likeable than others, and they\u2019re all more or less dispensable, so let\u2019s talk about what kind of story Another is.\\n\\n\r\nIn the strictest literary terms, Another is a tragedy.  You might not think that at first, since it shares the same basic idea as the Final Destination films, which were definitely horror comedies, but it is.  Another wants you to take it super-seriously, despite how ridiculous and goofy it\u2019s many death scenes are.  To it's credit, Another is a master of tone, and it places it\u2019s horror exactly where it belongs; on the faces of its surviving characters.  Their sense of edginess and unease are only ever interrupted by their terrified reactions to the gruesome demises around them, which goes a long way in making up for the lunacy of watching a girl fall down the stairs and land throat-first onto the pointy end of her umbrella.  Yes, Another is very firmly a tragedy, and that\u2019s kind of the problem.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t make this observation myself...  I learned it from the work of another reviewer, who also learned it from someone else...  But in order for a tragedy to truly work, it has to be earned.  A tragic ending can only be earned when it feels inevitable, as if the characters it\u2019s happening to have done everything in their power to prevent it, but were unable to because of one damning flaw in either themselves or their world that made their efforts futile.  It\u2019s basically like going to a casino, making millions of dollars at Black Jack, and then losing it all because you just couldn\u2019t handle not doing one more hand.  In Another, I just don\u2019t feel that at all.  \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, in order to take this story seriously, you would first have to believe that a school with a yearly student body count wouldn\u2019t be closed down and subsequently demolished to make way for a new building.  Would this work?  Maybe, maybe not, but the idea of people still sending their kids to a school like that and them willingly going there just infuriates me.  But what makes me even more angry is the supernatural power that Mei Misaki possesses, and how easily it could have ended the calamity on multiple occasions...  But she refuses to use it in the early episodes because she didn\u2019t want to get made fun of, and she doesn\u2019t put it to good use until the last ten minutes of the final episode for spoiler reasons that are complete BS.  She could have saved eight peoples\u2019 lives just by speaking up at the right time.  She killed them by not speaking up, and the narrative makes no attempt to even acknowledge it.  The only thing that was inevitable about this show\u2019s tragic ending is...  And I\u2019m going to try and be vague about this...  That the ghost trolled everybody by breaking it\u2019s own rules.\\n\\n\r\nI know I\u2019ve been talking a lot about the ending, but that\u2019s where the majority of my serious problems with this series lie, and it\u2019s difficult to talk about why it made me feel so turned off without giving away some spoilers.  Instead of saying more about what it did wrong, I\u2019m going to tell you the two things I wish it had done right, both of which could have secured a much higher rating from me.  \\n\\n\r\nThe perfect ending to this series, for me at least, would have seen the entire class...  Plus their vulnerable family members...  Forming a united front and charging the school at night with intent to burn it down.  The school would have defended itself through it\u2019s Murphy\u2019s Law magic, and a lot of them would have died, but the ones who survived would have succeeded in their task, rendering the school unusable and ending the curse forever.  The somewhat less perfect ending would have seen a handful of characters confronting the extra classmate, getting them to remember that they\u2019re dead, and speaking to the class\u2019s ghost through them, reasoning with him, learning about him, and ultimately convincing him to move on to the spirit world, ending the curse forever ala Paranorman.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, what with me being so subtle about it, the one thing those two ideas have in common is that, in both cases, the curse is ended permanently.  This is important for three reasons;  First of all, it gives all the meaningless deaths in the series purpose, as at least it would mean they accomplished in exchange for their sacrifice.  Secondly, ending the curse during this particular year would have made said year special compared to every other of the 26 years that the curse had been active, thus justifying that year being the focal point of the series in the first place.  And finally, for the simple reason that it would have given the series a much needed sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t like the series, but why did it make me feel so sick and uncomfortable?  Well, there\u2019s a very specific reason for that, and it has to do with what I believe to be the intention of the series.  Another feels, to me, like somebody with pent up rage issues putting a lot of people into one house in The Sims, putting the carpets too close to the fireplace and removing all the doors.  It feels like the writer is a lonely person...  Probably in middle school...  Who decided to write a story where he could insert himself as a powerful supernatural being who can strike fear and obedience into the hearts of all his fellow students who make fun of him, ignore him and have social lives that don\u2019t involve him.  That\u2019s my biggest problem with Another: Not that it fails in a literary sense, which it does, but because it feels like someones sick revenge fantasy that they published and printed for the world to see.  I don\u2019t want to see that, and I don\u2019t know why anybody else would.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is available from Sentai Filmworks in both DVD and Blu-Ray formats, both of which can currently be found on Amazon for around thirty dollars apiece.  You can also find it on Crunchyroll, but they don\u2019t currently offer the English Dub.  There are two light novels and a manga that are both available stateside from Yen Press, and a live action film that is still unfortunately not.  There\u2019s an OVA episode called Another: The Other, Inga that acts as a prequel to the series. Weird title aside, this is probably the best episode of the entire show, and while it\u2019s intended to be watched after the series, I strongly recommend watching it beforehand, as it\u2019s a much better introduction to the power, circumstances, and personal tragedy behind Mei, the posterchild for the series, which helps to clear up any confusion caused by its insistence on using her as a red herring.  It can be found on pretty much any release of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is currently considered the greatest horror anime of all time by numerous sources, such as Rightstuf magazine and Watchmojo, but to say that I disagree is a huge understatement.  Rather than a dark horror story or a cheesy slasher film, it feels more like watching a PETA documentary on slaughterhouses.  Yes, seeing horses on a conveyer belt getting stabbed in the head upsets me, but not because I care about any of them individually...  It\u2019s because I\u2019m pissed off at the people behind it for butchering them so heartlessly and mechanically for the sake of human consumption.  I\u2019ll give the series high marks for it\u2019s beautiful presentation and for holding my interest as long as it did, but what started out as a mildly entertaining ride ended just on a giant trollface that taunted me for daring to take the mystery and the fates of it\u2019s character designs seriously.  I give apathetic abomination of assassination a 4/10.",

            "content": "Ugh, Another... One of the biggest disappointments of my anime watching life... Another does almost everything right- it's visually beautiful, has very good music, has solid voice acting, is genuinely creepy and unsettling in a few spots and has a truly original premise you've never seen before in any other anime. So, with all that said, why a 4? Because the plot, not in its premise but in the way it was executed, is an absolutely inexcusable, non-believable dumpster fire that makes absolutely zero sense and is often offensive to my sensibilities.\r\nI'm not some tight-wad who believes anime should be super realistic and have flawless,hole-free plots. I love fantasy! And likewise, I watched (and really enjoyed) anime like Shiki and The Future Diary- the former sporting some of the dumbest and most oblivious characters in history and the latter having more holes than Swiss cheese and having ridiculous elements such as a hyper-genius, murderous 5 year old who has access to chemical weapons and characters who can survive full on explosions without a mark to show for it. Another is far worse than that.\\n\\n\r\n*****SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT*****\\n\\n\r\nIn Another there is a recurring yearly calamity that results in the deaths of students that are members of a specific class in a specific school. Every year, three, four, five or sometimes even more kids are killed by this curse. This has been going on for a quarter of a century. But don't worry, it's hush hush. Law enforcement has zero knowledge of any of this. Many children have died in the same exact classroom year after year for 25 years straight but there is no suspicion or investigation whatsoever. Likewise, knowledge of these occurrences has not spread to anyone in town, any parents, any media... It's a closely guarded secret that only people in the school know about!\\n\\n\r\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg... In this anime, when a large building is ablaze the fire contains itself to one room and one room only for a significant period of time. It does not spread to other rooms and the characters are all completely calm. They walk slowly and with zero urgency, knowing full well that two floors below them the building is on fire, and they stop to have very calm conversations and then continue casually walking along. Now granted, when the plot calls for it the fire near instantly consumes the entire building, but it doesn't leave the single room it was in for an hour leading up to that point.\\n\\n\r\nWant more? When hanging out on the beach on a clear day with no visibility issues whatsoever and absolutely no boats or other people anywhere in sight, a boat suddenly turns the corner at absolutely blazing speed, comes within mere feet of the shore at said blazing speeds and happens to take the exact path at the exact and only moment one of the children took when they go deeper into the water to get their beach ball. The boat basically comes out of thin air and takes the EXACT route and the EXACT time that it needs to take to result in a ridiculously cheap death- one of many.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst part of all, and this is the straw that broke the camel's back for me, is this- It is established early on in the anime that the cause of the calamity is a deceased person \"coming back\" and joining as a member of the class and they're not supposed to be there and as long as they're there the misfortunes will continue. The anime establishes very early on that the entire point of the anime- the mystery they're building toward from start to finish- is to figure out who among the class is the \"dead one\" and then figure out how to stop them. Fine. Kind of cool, actually. The problem? In THE most stomach turning, made me want to scream, absolute slap in the face \"plot twist\" I've ever seen in any anime, it is revealed near the very end that ONE OF THE LEADS KNEW THE ENTIRE TIME WHO THE DEAD PERSON WAS, both from a special paranormal ability they have AND FROM (extremely conveniently and implausibly) WITNESSING THE PERSON'S MURDER!!!!!! Are you serious??? This particular character knows the answer to the puzzle THE. WHOLE. TIME. and instead of speaking up to a classmate, a teacher, police, ANYONE she sits there and says nothing and lets classmates die over and over and over again. And still after the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and every other death that happens over the course of weeks and weeks this character STILL says absolutely nothing and simply lets it all continue. I wanted to puke...\\n\\n\r\nThere are anime that ask you to suspend your disbelief and that's fine and well, but Another is on ANOTHER level, pun intended. Its plot is outright stupid and simply not believable even with the utmost stretching of plausibility. I really, really wanted to like this show, and initially I did, but every other episode from the midpoint on had me screaming \"OF COURSE that happened exactly that way at exactly that time\" about five times per episode and the reveal at the end made me want to throw the DVD off my balcony.\\n\\n\r\n*****END SPOILERS*****\\n\\n\r\nIf not for the absolute dumpster fire that is this anime's plot you'd be looking at an easy 7 or 8 here, possibly even higher. Oh what could have been...\\n\\n\r\n+Visually nice\\n\r\n+Original premise\\n\r\n+Solid voice acting\\n\r\n+Great music\\n\r\n+Some genuinely scary/creepy moments, specifically the main character's nightmares scenes\\n\r\n+Well paced, never boring\\n\\n\r\n-WORST. STUPIDEST. MOST NON BELIEVABLE plot EVERRRRRRRR\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 5\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4",

            "content": "Another is a masterpiece. Of course, not many people would agree with me, but the people who hated this show or didn\u2019t think it was amazing, misunderstand the message that Another is trying to tell the viewers. No, even some people who loved this show don\u2019t actually know the deepness and how genius of an anime Another is.\r\n          I will now proceed and explain what many people overlooked in this series and prove that this series is a masterpiece. Let\u2019s start.At the beginning of this anime two people were talking about Misaki, from the 9th grade-class 3.\\n\r\nthey talk about the incident that happened 26 years ago.\\n\r\n        Misaki yomiyama. he has been popular ever since the 7th grade. He was smart, handsome and had a great personality. So, he was liked by students and teachers alike.\\n\r\n         But, shortly after starting the ninth grade, he died from an accident. Everyone was was shocked, until, suddenly, someone pointed at Misaki\u2019s desk and said \u201cMisaki is right there. He\u2019s not dead\u201d.\\n\r\n          Class 3 continued to behave as though Misaki was still alive.They kept up the act right up until graduation.The principal even arranged to have Misaki\u2019s seat included at their graduation ceremony.\\n\r\n         When they took the class photo, they could actually see Misaki in the photo.He was deathly pale, but he also smiled like the other students.\\n\r\nThis is what triggered the curse.Since they acted like some dead person is still alive, the class invited the dead in.Which in turn, drew class 3-3 closer and closer to death.It basically became a place for the dead to live.\\n\r\nThis is really sad. What this anime shows by this is that Humans can not accept death. They would do anything to bring the dead back to life. And since even the dead couldn\u2019t accept their own death, they would do absolutely anything to live again \u2014 even killing other people. I don\u2019t know if you believe in ghosts or spirits, but in the universe of Another, they exist.\\n\r\n            This anime geniusly showed how humans can\u2019t accept the truth and how they live their lives delusionally, in this case, they acted like death doesn\u2019t even exist. This anime showed that acting like some dead person is still alive, is going to keep inviting the dead in, and this would cause a bad curse.(meaning if you don\u2019t accept the truth, you\u2019ll regret it)\\n\r\n             The message behind this, is that humans build illusions in their lives, just to try to live happy life and run away from the cruel reality.\\n\r\n          Let\u2019s say If you face a really terrible trauma in your life; like losing someone close. Your subconscious mind tries to save your mental health by making illusions in your life. Let me give you an example.\\n\r\n           You are a really quiet person, that doesn\u2019t socialize often and doesn\u2019t make any jokes or have any sense of humor, you are basically a shut in who gets emotional really fast. You\u2019ve lost the only person that ever cared about you, Your family always gets in fights, you always have misfortune, you\u2019re always bored and you have nothing to do.you have no purpose in life.\\n\r\n          If you continue like this, it might cause depression. You will be very mentally ill. So the job of your subconscious is to save you from getting ill and tries to make you forget about traumatic events that has happened in your life.By building illusions. This is sort of like a Defense mechanism.\\n\r\n        In this case, your subconscious will change your whole personality in a way that you could survive from your cruel reality.\\n\r\nYou would first change from being solitary and unsocial, to being a really sociable and approachable person.\\n\r\n        You\u2019re changed from hating jokes and being serious all the time to being really sarcastic and having a really good sense of humor. You will try to act happy, even though your heart is in complete pain. Because you have lost the most precious person to you.......the only one that cared about you and made you happy. After that person dies, how could you be happy? Exactly. To bare with this sadness, you will make the most necessary personality and environmental changes in order for you to be as much happy as you was when that person that you\u2019ve lost was alive. So you act like that person never even died. It\u2019s all an illusion.\\n\\n\r\n           \u201cIt\u2019s sad when people die\u201d-Misaki Mei.\\n\\n\r\n           The lives of us humans are full of illusions.\\n\r\nFriendships, love, kindness...........\\n\r\nthat\u2019s what the curse is about.\\n\\n\r\n          Also, many people say that the characters were just killed off for no reason whatsoever.\\n\r\nBut the matter of the fact is, there is a good reason.\\n\r\n         \u201cDead people would do anything to come back to life even if it meant to kill a human being\u201d Does anything come to mind?\\n\r\nThese dead people, or these \u201cghosts\u201d or \u201cdead spirits\u201d or whatever you want to call them. Also wanted to be back alive.They didn\u2019t want to accept their deaths. Thus, every month, one student would die due to class 3 inviting the dead in.\\n\r\n         To organize all of this mess, they treated one student non-existent. If they treat one student non-existent, it would make up for that dead person, thus the \u201cghosts\u201d wouldn\u2019t kill other students to  replace them. So the reason people kept dying, is because the charm didn\u2019t work, not because Sakakibara treated Misaki like she exists. But because the curse now happens automatically even without the students treating as though the dead are alive. This happens because they kept acting this way for many years. So, you people who say all of this is Misaki\u2019s fault because she kept speaking with Sakakibara, you\u2019re wrong. Because the curse started way before Sakakibara came to school. The curse started in April even though Sakakibara wasn\u2019t there. So you have to use your brain first before blaming Misaki for this disaster.\\n\\n\r\n         Also, haven\u2019t you ever wondered why Kouichi was so drawn to being near Misaki? Why did he keep approaching her? This is a theory, but i think that these \u201cghosts\u201d kept drawing Sakakibara near Misaki. Either that, or Sakakibara really is one hell of a protagonist That\u2019s basically the message behind the curse in Another. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s now go more in depth about the other deep subjects that were shown in another\\n\\n\r\n         Let\u2019s first talk about Misaki Mei. Misaki is a very withdrawn, solitary and anti-social girl that sees no value in having a bond with someone.She is fascinated by a pair of conjoined dolls in her grandmother's shop, wondering how they can be so calm even though they are attached. When Kouichi suggests that is the reason, Mei claims that that's impossible. She also claims that, in the end, everyone is alone, no matter how many bonds they may have.\\n\r\n           However, Misaki was much more cheerful and happier and much more sociable and wore bright clothes. She even had a childish side. But after the death of her sister Misaki Fujioka, due to the curse, Misaki changed completely. She avoided socializing and having bonds, she even became null to any other trauma, as she didn\u2019t even flinch when their teacher commit suicide right in front of the entire class. Misaki was alone, she had no one that truly cared about her, not even her parents. Her mother only thinks of her as a doll. \\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the reason I love Misaki. Because I can relate to her so much. \\n\r\n           Fortunately, I\u2019ve never experienced the death of someone close to me. But I\u2019m also really lonely. No one cares about me. All of my friends became my friends for the sole purpose of using me for their own benefits and then backstab me when I\u2019m no more in need. I have experienced this more than 30 times. It\u2019s easy to move on from your old fake friends, but my best friends have also abandon me many times, they left me all alone. I thought they were the kindest human beings before, but they showed their dark sides, and left me all alone. Friends weren\u2019t the only issue I had, I also experienced getting bullied by many peopls, that I became this person who shows no emotion, and doesn\u2019t believe that there is any value in having bonds with someone.\\n\\n\r\n          On Episode 6 Misaki says, \u201cDeath is not Kind. It\u2019s dark and black as far as you....as far as you can see, you are all alone. There\u2019s no one else. But it\u2019s no different when you are alive. No matter how many relationships we seem to have, we are all alone.\u201d\\n\r\n          This quote is actually really deep. It\u2019s in fact the deepest quote that I\u2019ve heard of. But it\u2019s the truth. What Misaki means is that there may be many people around us whom we have strong bonds with but still at the end of the day all we have is ourselves trying to figure out our problems, finding solutions, solving those unending puzzles of our brain and crying silently with that heart wrenching pain. People may support us, motivate us, stand by our side but ultimately no one can or will experience the exact feelings or exact struggles we have been through. There is no need to be connected to people, after all, love is just an illusion.\\n\r\n              Love as we understand it doesn\u2019t exist. People treat others well or become attached to people only when they are able to provide something for them, whether this is material benefits or emotional support. Those who argue against this are simply not self conscious enough to deeply evaluate what they truly feel.\\n\r\n             Your friends love you because you give them time, you entertain them by having fun with them and you listen when they need to rant or cry. You make them feel good. They love you, but only because they are able to use you to maximize their own emotional satisfaction.\\n\r\n             Your parents love you in a deeper way, but this is probably more out of habit than anything. They don\u2019t truly love YOU. They could have given birth to any other baby and loved them just as much. Even if they love you, they are loving the idea of you, The idea of a child who loves them and will treat them well. I guarantee you, if you went full psychopath mode and told them you wanted to kill them, even your parents will stop loving you.\\n\r\n             Therefore, true love does not exist and everything we do is a barter. Even something seemingly altruistic is done in order to make a person \u201cfeel good\u201d. So in this case, we engage in altruism in exchange for a pleasant personal sensation. So it\u2019s still selfish in the end.\\n\r\n\u201cLove\u201d is a manufactured concept that was generated to tie communities together in order to further survival.\\n\r\n             And you might be saying. What has this got to do with Another? Isn\u2019t this just a quote by Misaki, and how she thinks? Well, don\u2019t you remember what happened at the last two episodes of another?\\n\r\n            Everyone went insane when they figured out how to stop the calamity; killing the extra student for survival. They thought that the extra student this year was Misaki Mei, they tried to kill her in order to stop the calamity. Nobody could think critically and lost their sanity just to kill Misaki. To save their selfish lives, they tried to murder a fellow classmate who\u2019s completely innocent. So the last episode showed the true feeling, and the true side to humans. Humans always hide behind a mask; trying to hide their true feelings. But when faced with true terror, their real feelings are released. \\n\r\n             Of course, Misaki wasn\u2019t the only one targeted. The students killed other students; but also tried to kill their teacher. But, they even tried to kill their best friend to survive and live on with their selfish lives.\\n\\n\r\n           What does this imply? Exactly what Misaki said \u2014 No matter how many relationships we seem to have, we\u2019re all alone. This is exactly what this anime is about, Loneliness. But as we said, this doesn\u2019t only happen in the Another, this is also true for real life.\\n\r\n           No matter how many friends you have. There will come one day when they show you their dark side and betray you for their own selfish desires. No matter how kind someone is, they also have a dark side, this is the sad truth about life.\\n\r\nWe only make friends not actually for the sake of helping your friends or making them happy or being with THEM specifically. But it\u2019s just a method used to cope with loneliness.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re born alone, we live alone, we die alone.\\n\r\nOnly through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we\u2019re not alone.\u201d\\n\r\n             Humans are terrified of being alone. Let\u2019s say you wake up one day and every human on earth, has disappeared. You would go absolutely crazy, right? Indeed, There are some people in this world that enjoy being alone. Like introverts.\\n\r\nBut time to time, they like to socialize and have fun with some friends for a change.\\n\r\n           Did you know that people can actually go insane, from isolation? It\u2019s actually true, there are many experiments and articles on the internet talking about the effects of loneliness and isolation to your brain. So we being connected to other people is nothing but a selfish way of living.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway. Enough of this part.\\n\\n\r\nNext, let\u2019s go over Another one of Mei\u2019s quotes.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki says \u201cIf you\u2019re here, can you prove you\u2019re really here?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nYet, another deep quote by Misaki.\\n\\n\r\n           First of all, what if you are actually the only one that exists in this world? What if all the other humans are not real, but only you are real? What if you\u2019re the protagonist of this world? What if the humans you are talking to aren\u2019t actual humans? What if they are ghosts or demons?\\n\r\n           Second, is this world actually real? Do we really exist? Is this whole thing just a dream?\\n\r\nWhat happens after you \u201cdie\u201d? It\u2019s turning really philosophical here.\\n\\n\r\n         But one other thing this quote could mean, is that, there are some people who do not exist. Everything they say, every joke they try to tell, every opinion they share, they all get ignored by other people. It\u2019s just like they don\u2019t even exist. They\u2019re not there. \\n\r\n         This happens to me a lot. We\u2019re just having a casual conversation in the group, everyone says what they say. But when I try to say something, it gets ignored, or when someone tells a really bad and unfunny joke, everyone laughs at it. But when I tell a funny joke to them, they don\u2019t even giggle. It\u2019s just like I\u2019m not even there. They even asked for everyone\u2019s opinions but mine. This is from my experience. Why do we even waste time working hard in this world? Everything you say, every opinion you give, every action you make, every talent you have, every good things you do.........will all be forgotten, someday.\\n\\n\r\n         If you die, will the world be in a crisis? Absolutely not. Sure. It might cause a shock, or sadness. Your parents and family may cry and can\u2019t accept your death. But after a while, you are forgotten. They have all already moved on with their lives, they accepted your death and they can already smile normally again after they\u2019ve accepted what happened to you.\\n\r\n           Another, showed being non-existent really well. No, really AMAZING that it\u2019s really relatable.I am sure there are plenty of people that can relate to this.\\n\r\n           Misaki, who had no one that cared for her, it\u2019s just like she doesn\u2019t exist from the start. So, when she was picked to be the non-existent student, it was a really easy task for her. After all, all she had to do was live her life like she has always lived. After the charm failed to stop the calamity, Teshigawara said \u201cWhat does it feel like to finally have the weights lifted?\u201d(Meaning, how does it feel being existent again?) But Misaki replies \u201cHard to say. I didn\u2019t really feel any weight to begin with.\u201d \\n\r\n...............How sad. It actually made me cry while writing this. It just shows how much Misaki means to me as a character. It also just shows how messed up this world can be. Poor Misaki.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHow does it feel not to exist?\u201d-Misaki Mei.....\\n\\n\r\n           Now, let\u2019s go over the people that hated Misaki and thought she was very selfish.\\n\r\nLoneliness, pain, sadness, being hated, losing the closest person to her.......\\n\r\n          Even after having Misaki go through all of that, she still isn\u2019t completely cold. She actually has a really soft side. As shown when Misaki says\u201dI\u2019m the most suited to be the extra student .Because if another student was to be picked. I would\u2019ve acted like all the other students, and acted like someone doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d But we also see the really soft side of Misaki at the last episode of Another. When Misaki knew that Reiko/Mikami sensei was the dead one, since she could see the color of death with her left eye. But, She couldn\u2019t get herself to tell Sakakibara, because she didn\u2019t want Kouichi to be sad. Sakakibara was the only one that cared about her, and was with her all the time.\\n\r\n              At first Misaki told Sakakibara that he should stay away from her.But after a while, she actually gets used to the presence of Sakakibara, and they become really close friends...\\n\r\n             Even though she went through hell in her life. She still is sane, and she didn\u2019t even lose her kindness.She could still give a really bright smile.........\\n\r\nIf we experience pain, we get stronger.\\n\r\nThe more trauma you experience, the stronger you get and the more null you get to trauma.\\n\r\nBut to call Misaki selfish for \u201ccaring only about her self and not caring about other people\u201d is just absurd.\\n\r\n             When did \u201cPeople\u201d ever care about her so that she would care about them? Everyone just thought that Misaki is weird and would even kill her if it means the calamity would stop.\\n\r\n             Now, can\u2019t we call everyone \u201cselfish\u201d?\\n\r\nAt the last episode everyone cared about them selves only and they literally MURDERED every other student and yet Misaki who has killed NO ONE and hasn\u2019t lost her sanity gets called \u201cselfish\u201d? What the fuck? \\n\r\n             It\u2019s really sad that people call Misaki selfish and that she cares about no one but herself. Yes. She could\u2019ve just used her left eye from the start to know who the extra student is.\\n\r\nBut you should also know the feelings of Misaki.\\n\r\nShe is very scared of seeing the color of death. She doesn\u2019t want to see it anymore because of the incident with her sister Misaki fujioka. Also, even if she said who the extra student is, nobody would believe her.And it might even cause problems.\\n\r\nSince, if she said (insert name here) is the extra student, that extra student\u2019s best friend would never ever accept it and would never believe Misaki. So, There would be no point for her to do that at all.....\\n\r\n             Many people also call her selfish for not seeming to care about other people\u2019s deaths, or not caring about what\u2019s happening at all.\\n\r\nIf you actually think about it for a second, Misaki has every right to be like that. When has the world ever cared about so she would care about the world? Nobody would care if she dies and yet she HAS to care if others die? That\u2019s like finding a very rare diamond after searching for years and just giving it to a random stranger without having anything in return.\\n\r\n              She has every right to not give a fuck about this messed up world or it\u2019s messed up people. Misaki had such a tragic life and when she finally found out about her sister and starts to hang out with her, she started to get really happy and finally experience having a connection with someone. \\n\r\n               But then, what happened? You guessed it. The world stole that happiness away from her.\\n\r\nAfter she knew that this world won\u2019t provide her happiness. She didn\u2019t give a damn anymore.\\n\r\nThis is exactly what every one should do. You shouldn\u2019t care about this world, it\u2019s people and it\u2019s events.\\n\r\n               No matter what happens, it\u2019s never permanent. Yes, if you have a serious injury, it will cause so much pain. But after a while, you will get used to that pain and live with it. If you experience the death of a close one, you will get used to living without them. If you have an embarrassing moment. It doesn\u2019t matter. It will be forgotten anyway.\\n\r\n              So many people have also called me \u201cemotionless\u201d or someone who doesn\u2019t care about anything. Well then, let me ask this.........Is that a bad thing? Not caring about anything is much better than caring about everything.\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t care about anything, then pain and loneliness won\u2019t affect you as much.\\n\r\nBut if you care about everything, then pain and loneliness would drive you crazy.\\n\r\n              Plus, being emotionless is impossible.\\n\r\nUnless you have brain problems.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a normal human, then you have emotions.\\n\r\nEven if some people don\u2019t display their emotions, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have them.\\n\r\nThey are just reserved and like to keep everything to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is best girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\n               Also, Many people said that Misaki\u2019s left eye is a plot hole and wasn\u2019t explained why she could see the color of death.....I\u2019m going to ask this just in case but ummm............did you pay attention while watching the show? If you don\u2019t know why Misaki can see the color of death, then you are either stupid, or have a really short attention span.\\n\r\n             Misaki clearly said this in the anime \u201cDolls are hollow, you see? Completely hollow in body and soul. The void connects them with death. But hollow things seek to fill their emptiness.\u201d\\n\r\nShe also said \u201cDon\u2019t you feel like this dolls are sucking or draining something out of you?\u201d\\n\r\n(She clearly means your soul.)\\n\r\n           Mei can see the color of death because the void connects the dolls with death. That\u2019s why her eye is called \u201cThe Voids Eye\u201d Even if you don\u2019t believe this in the real world. It\u2019s true in the universe of Another. Do you get it now? It\u2019s not a plot hole. It\u2019s just a big hole in your brain that made you unable to calculate what\u2019s happening.\\n\r\n           Also, Misaki Mei is best girl and I\u2019ll fight anyone who disagrees with me.\\n\r\n          The darkness and deepness of Another isn\u2019t the only amazing thing about this anime.\\n\r\n          The story of Another is really good and actually very unique. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before.\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nUniqueness 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely fantastic. I mean, P.A works has some amazing anime out there.\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style is also very good. Again. P.A works\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt style: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is just top notch! The osts in this anime are just fantastic. Also, many people hated the opening to Another. But I absolutely loved it. It suits this series really really well.\\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t believe me.Then go and listen to the english cover of the Another\u2019s opening.\\n\r\nLike, just Right after you finished reading this, just go and listen to the whole english cover of the Opening, while thinking that Misaki is the one singing the lyrics. After you\u2019ve listened to it, you\u2019ll know how much it makes sense.\\n\r\nThe opening is really catchy and has absolute meaning in every single word.\\n\\n\r\nSo I give the Music: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also absolutely nailed it.\\n\r\nMisaki\u2019s voice is basically eargasm to me.\\n\r\nVoice acting:10/10\\n\\n\r\n        But the only problem this anime had was the characters.  they weren\u2019t explored that much. We didn\u2019t know anything about some of them, they were just there.Many people have big problems over the characters. But I actually don\u2019t mind this problem with Another. Since, even if the other characters weren\u2019t covered that much, they actually have really important roles in the anime.\\n\r\nSo I rate the characters a:9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Something that can\u2019t be meaured by numbers/10. Best. Overall rating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n         I could\u2019ve went more in depth of the review of Another. But I think I\u2019ve said enough about how amazing and how much of a genius Another is,  but since I\u2019ve never reviewed anime, I can\u2019t make good reviews. But I\u2019m sure there are plenty of reviews you can read of this anime. But don\u2019t read them on myanimelist, because they are bad. Another is the best horror anime ever made and I would fight anyone who disagrees with me.\\n\r\n(Not really. I wouldn\u2019t fight for such thing, but you know. I say this for exclamation) \\n\r\n           The tension and the creepiness that you feel watching Another is just really incredible.\\n\r\nevery episode left me on the edge of my seat.\\n\r\nEvery episode, I wanted to know more and more about, what\u2019s behind the mystery of this cursed class? Who\u2019s Misaki Mei? Why can no one see her?\\n\r\n           When watching Another, you\u2019re just like \u201cjust one more episode, then I\u2019ll sleep\u201d After watching that episode, you say \u201cjust one more, I swear\u201d But then before you realize it, it\u2019s already 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, and you watched every episode of Another. Magic? No. It\u2019s just the genius work of Another.\\n\r\n           At the end of each episode, something really intriguing happens, that you just can\u2019t help but watch the next episode to know more about what happened.\\n\r\n          So the episode starts off with explaining what happened at the end of the last episode, and then at the end of this last episode, there is yet another mystery(pun unintended) that needs to be explained in the next episode. This anime is basically something you can only watch in one sitting.\\n\r\n         Also, this anime ended really geniusly.\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\r\nBecause at the end, it ends somewhere where you definitely didn\u2019t want it to end. So you are like \u201cYou can\u2019t just end it there. I need more! \u201d If there is any anime like this. Then it\u2019s just a sign of how amazing it was.\\n\\n\r\n          This anime knows exactly when to add gore. Also, the death of the characters in this anime has really good reasons, unlike corpse party. That was just an anime that had no good story whatsoever and just added gore everywhere to make people think that it\u2019s a good horror anime.well, let me tell you. It\u2019s not. Unlike corpse party, Another has a pretty excellent story. Also, have i mentioned the dialogue in this anime?\\n\r\n             Kouichi and Misaki are just talking when suddenly, everything goes silent.......What will happen?! Where there be a death?\\n\r\n*BREATHING REALLY INTENSELY**........\\n\r\n...........\\n\r\n.......\\n\r\n.......\\n\r\n.....\\n\r\n....\\n\r\nOw.\\n\r\nShe just continues talking.....\\n\r\nThank god nothing happened.\\n\r\nI thought one of them would\u2019ve died for sure.\\n\r\nAn example of the dialogue would be something like this:\\n\\n\r\nMisaki: Sakakibara-kun.....\\n\r\nSakakibara:Looks at her................\\n\r\n*eerie music starts to kick in*\\n\r\n*the atmosphere is really silent*....\\n\r\n....\\n\r\n....\\n\r\n.......\\n\r\n...........\\n\r\n..............\\n\r\n....................\\n\r\n........................\\n\r\n.............................\\n\r\nMisaki: You should be going home now.\\n\\n\r\n         This just shows the amazing atmosphere that Another has. This is how horror anime should be.\\n\r\nThis anime relies on it\u2019s story and atmosphere to scare people, and not jumpscares or unnessecary gore.\\n\r\n        People said that the ending was very bad and \u201ccomedic\u201d.\\n\r\nAnd that they killed off every character for no reason. And they also ask why did everyone go crazy.\\n\r\n        Let me start by saying. The ending of this anime makes so much sense. The students were basically in a class, where the eead were having fun in.\\n\r\n        They were in a cursed class....... A place where the students die each month.\\n\r\nYou are basically coming to a place where you have a 98% chance of dying. Now tell me, if these emotionally unstable students found out how to stop the curse, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for them to go absolutely insane? To stop the curse, they HAD to KILL another student. These students want to escape from this curse by any means necessary.\\n\r\nHow the hell are you expecting them to be sane after trying to kill other human beings??\\n\r\n             These insane students would also kill their best friends to escape from the curse.Even if those students weren\u2019t actually the extra ones. So it all makes god damn sense. \\n\r\n             The psychological aspects of this anime is very genius. It shows exactly what would happen to your brain, when you face trauma.\\n\\n\\n\r\n          As regards to those who are wondering why I rated Another\u2019s OVA as a masterpiece. Let me explain. You might say I love it because of the shower scene. Well. You aren\u2019t entirely wrong.\\n\r\nBut the main reason I love it is because This OVA is really important. Not only does it show Misaki\u2019s backstory but, It also shows the transformation and the drastic change of Misaki\u2019s personality \u2014 From someone who was very cheerful and laughed after finishing every sentence, to someone who displays no emotion or interest at all. Also, I get to finally see my waifu laugh....\\n\\n\\n\r\n          As for Another\u2019s music track \u201cShizukani-Misaki Mei\u201d Just go and listen to it with english subtitles. It makes SO much sense.\\n\r\nSo after you read this, go and listen to Another\u2019s opening(english version)\\n\r\nBut also listen to shizuka ni- Misaki Mei\\n\r\nwith english subtitles and i dare you to say it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\\n\r\nSpecially shizuka ni. Misaki basically puts her suffering into words.It\u2019s an absolute masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n            This anime is a masterpiece in my opinion.\\n\r\nBut of course, this anime isn\u2019t for everyone.\\n\r\nif you are a big action fan that can\u2019t stand watching a whole anime about amazing indirect character development and slow world building. And you just want fight scenes everywhere.\\n\r\nThen  Another is not the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\n      Of course, every anime has its flaws, and Another definitely did have a lot of flaws everywhere. But I personally didn\u2019t mind or care about those problems in Another at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\n       Because I absolutely loved every single second of this show. It\u2019s simply a masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"What makes Another so special?\"\r\nThat's the question I'm aiming to answer in this review. I don't mean \"special\", as in, close to my heart, nor poignant, nor anything that suggests that Another has any real artistic merit whatsoever as a show. I mean, what makes Another so special that it's one of the most popular anime on MAL, and almost 1 million people have seen it? I'm not saying that Another is a complete waste of your time - but yes, if you don't care that much about blood and gore, this will be a complete waste of your time - but I just can'tfathom how this anime became so popular. Why this show and not another? It's certainly not its flat characters or its clumsily-told narrative, but I think a good argument can be made for aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nAnother is beautiful, eerie, and distinctive. The poster on MAL is actually a very good representation of what the show looks like. It's incredibly well-done, with animation that is very lively and realistic. Particularly in the death scenes (which there are a lot of), the animation is stunningly gruesome, and you can really feel the impact of a sharp object through a human body. This, combined with the dark aesthetic of the show will make your jaw drop with how much care was put into it. I'm not used to PA Works being this good at animation. I recommend, that if you really want to check out what Another is all about, you just search up \"All Another Death Scenes [Uncensored]\". That's what this show is about. Beautifully animated and colour-graded death scenes. One after the other. Hilariously more ridiculous and over-the-top as it goes on, each one trying to beat the last.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there's one other aspect that Another does really well: the sound design. Right before a sharp object impales somebody, there'll be this dramatic sound cue that will make your stomach drop. There are also a lot of things falling down and crushing people, spooky lightning, and other ambient sounds that really set the atmosphere. It's admirably done. And Ali Project did the OP, and it sounds as delightfully eerie as always. The voice acting is also - well, it's definitely serviceable. Considering what the VAs had to work with, it's also done pretty well. So, the sound design and OST is pretty good, too.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why I think it's completely wasted on this messy and confused narrative that has one of the most unsatisfying endings and worst solutions to a mystery I've ever seen. Part of the fun of a good mystery is that the clues are strewn about the show, and that there are so many small ones that you almost feel stupid for not connecting the dots. Another gives you two or three clues, and one of them is an off-hand mention right in the beginning. The twist is a sucker punch to the jaw. You thought you were going to end up feeling stupid not being able to figure it out, but you end up feeling that the story is stupid for hiding the solution ten miles underground, without even giving you the tools to dig it out. It's almost completely impossible to figure out - not because of how outside of the box it is, but because of how little information and attention is given to the mystery. This show spends most of its time on the psychological aspect of it - which is markedly different from the horror aspect.\\n\\n\r\nAnother tries - I think - to be a horror show, but it's just not scary at all. It's just gruesome. There aren't even any cheap jump scares that I can think of, except maybe one or two in the last few episodes. I mean, the plot doesn't actually sound that bad to begin with: In a class of x students, there's somehow x+1 students. One of them is already dead. And unless everyone ignores the person they think is the +1 all term (like they're dead), everyone in the class will keep dying of unfortunate coincidences. But our protagonist, who's a transfer student and knows nothing about this weird, ridiculous urban myth, ends up associating with Mei unknowingly, who is thought to be the +1, sending the class in a downward spiral of death and destruction that seemingly can't be stopped.\\n\\n\r\nThat lays the foundation for a scary horror story and a deep psychological exploration of the human mind - what it takes for a person to kill another. But, as I mentioned, Another is not scary. I think it tries to be, for what it's worth. When it starts to telegraph that it's going to kill another character who we've barely had 3 minutes to get to know, it drags it out, as if trying to goad the audience into believing he might survive, but eventually, he dies in an incredibly horrible and gruesome way. But I don't care. At all. Who is this person? Why is he important? He's not. And the show doesn't think he is either; he's just there to die and scare the main characters psychologically. Which brings me to how Another handles the psychological aspect.\\n\\n\r\nIt...doesn't, really. In the last few episodes, lots of people go crazy because they're scared shitless that they're going to be next, and there's a lot of murdering. There's this one scene where this one character dies in a super-dramatic way, and it's supposed to be really sad. But all I could think the entire time was, \"Do I know you? Were you in this show the entire time?\" Because this show basically ignores the psychological aspect in favour of chasing the mystery. Which, as I mentioned, the show does poorly, too. There are a few scenes that reference how stressful and traumatic the situation that the class is going through is, and we see some stressed and traumatised students with blood literally dripping all over them, but it ultimately doesn't really have any impact on anything. Aside from the awful, but equally over-the-top and hilarious \"final battle\" is. The \"Final Battle\" is awful because of how awful the show was up until that point. I should be shocked and tearful that characters I like and have grown attached to are pulling out big, rusty knives and slaughtering each other like pigs, but because Another gives zero fucks about its characters, it's just long and drawn-out, and even I'm starting to get sick of all the ridiculous death scenes by the end of it. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose now is the time to mention how badly this show addresses the need for likable and human protagonists in a heavy psychological story. Mei is mysterious at the start of the show, and she's mysterious by the end of it. She's hinted as having this dark past, and the eye patch is a constant source of mystery, but these things are never addressed. Mei is flat and boring, but she has a good character design. So there's that. Our protagonist, whose name I don't even remember, is the only character we really get to know well. And you can kinda feel for him because of the ridiculous and traumatic scenario he's been thrust into. He's just doing the best he can with his tiny adolescent brain. He only gets a sudden burst of insight in the very last moment, incredibly uncharacteristic of our previously obtuse protagonist. And, let's give it to the guy, despite being a bog standard protagonist, he does have some moments of sparkling individuality. Like that infamously weird dance scene. But otherwise, the show completely skimps on his backstory, home life, and any other possible traits they could give this guy other than \"nice\", \"wants to help\", and \"doesn't like getting murdered\".\\n\\n\r\nIf the animation and sound design wasn't as good as it was, this show would have nothing of value, even in its death scenes. But because it is utterly fantastic, even the simplest deaths are felt intensely. I cannot emphasise enough how much love has gone into the animation behind this monstrosity. It's just a bunch of worn-out garbage crammed into a thinly-veiled excuse for blood and guts with a mystery we never get any real information about until it's already solved, and some melodramatic reactions and loud screams that constitute as \"character development\" and \"psychological horror\".\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the final nail in the coffin; the last fuck you cherry on top: Another is really, boring when people aren't being killed. When you have characters you don't care about, a mystery you aren't being told anything useful about, and the characters you don't care about going through trauma you don't know the specific details of, what reason do you have to keep watching? \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe it'll get more interesting when more details of the mystery get revealed.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe it'll get more interesting when a character breaks down in a sorry heap, directly addressing how screwed up everything is.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe Mei's backstory will be revealed, proving interesting and intrinsic to the mystery.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe it'll all come together in the end and be worth the sluggish pace.\"\\n\\n\r\nThese were all things I told myself when I was watching, because I wanted so badly to like Another. To see what everyone was loving so much about it. And to do justice to the crisp and creatively-directed animation that someone clearly put a lot of effort into. But none of my desperate pleas for help were heard. Another is on a collision course that can't be altered. If you stand in it's way, you'll only get caught up in its confused and pointlessly twisty narrative. You'll end up either bored to tears or personally insulted for being told that Another was \"cool\", \"dark\", or even \"good\". Another is not \"dark\". It's not even \"edgy\". It's just gory and high-pitched.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what makes Another special? For one, it's pretty. For two, it sounds good. For three, it's one of the few mainstream horror offerings in anime that aired in this century. For four, it was dark in a time where that was only just then becoming the thing to do if you want to be seen as deep. And for five, it does get the intriguing atmosphere right, almost purely because of the art and sound direction. If you watched Another without subtitles, you might be fooled into thinking that this show might actually be worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not.",

            "content": "My review for Another without spoilers.\r\nBefore i start i want to let everyone know that i'll write this review with honesty.\r\n\u2022 Story/Plot rate (8): \r\nThe story in general is unique and interesting therefore the episodes weren't connected good enough. The story was interesting and also hard to follow by the way the director linked the episodes. Surely he could've done better job. What i really enjoyed it was that the story was hardly predictable. I wouldn't say that the ending or the plot of the anime was too rushy since it was 12 episodes, it was good enough!\r\n\u2022 Art (7):\r\nFirst of all the characters wereperfect for the anime, their voices, their behaviors and also the art of the anime in general. Their voice actors for me weren't realistic enough to convince me that it was a horror/thriller anime, they could've done better job. The backgrounds though were pretty simple. As about the design of the characters were decently fine for their roles but you can hardly say they had different personalities, they were similarly the same.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound(5):\\n\r\nLike i said on the Art part the voice actors could've done better job, to be more passionate with their roles. The background sound were fitting nicely with the anime but it wasn't creating any atmosphere in contrast with other anime i watched. As about the OST was great and probably i'll listen to it again at the future.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character rate (6): \\n\r\nThe characters weren't super smart or they had any superpowers but for me they were stupid. Why i do believe that? Watch the anime and you will see. The characters weren't realistic enough except in some \"action\" moments. Also, you couldn't recognize who was the main character judging only their actions, main characters were those who appeared the most in the anime. I might remember 1 of the main characters in the future but there were any characters that i disliked. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment rate (7):\\n\r\nThe anime had suspense and lot of mystery that's why i liked it even though it was confusing at some parts like i said before. Someone who is not an anime fan i think will not even bother to watch the anime and personally i wouldn't recommend it to any friend of mine. Probably i had a lot of expectation from this anime and i got disappointed with what i saw. I guess in the future i might forget the plot of the anime to be honest..   \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall (7)\\n\r\nIn general i'll rate this anime with a fairly 7 mark. If someone wants to discuss the anime feel free to visit my profile and leave a comment!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! \\n",

            "content": "*note: this is an incomplete review\r\nLooking for horror, thrill, blood, high school, massacre, horror? wait did i say horror twice? This is the show you might want to see.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nStarting off at a hospital with the main character being suspiciously questioned by the newly met class counter measures committee  brings ample mystery for anyone to keep watching the show. He meets a girl, Misaki Mei at the hospital late night taking an elevator  to the basement where the morgue is located. Things gets serious from there, mystery upon mystery, revealing little by little facts about his class and Misaki. The story is athrilling watch, giving you icy fingers often and the confusion to stop, scared for the worst. The successful implementation of plot to suit the horror genre is commendable. But it lacks common sense and logic which i strongly prefer. All that being said, the ending was not my cup of tea. I felt it ruined the hype the show had build up till the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely spectacular. The dark overlay, dilapidated buildings, reddish rust stains, periodic puppet doll shots, sets the horrific mood imparting coldness and lifelessness to the plot. Art is one of the things that makes Another enjoyable as it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nSound effects are mandatory for all horror shows and Another nails it perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nMuch like the story, the characters were pretty lame in my opinion. Taking the fastest route to home leaving the school, especially Misaki and talking about the occurrence to an adult should be the logical course of action for the main character. Instead, his actions are mainly in favor of the plot. It's more like the character is controlled by the plot. This applies to all characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 \\n\r\nThe horror elements were the limelight of this show. I had to pause the video playback several times out of fear. So very enjoyable in this regard. But, the ending made me reconsider. It was no longer a show i would consider 'best'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\\n",

It felt like a gory eroge complete with stock moe characters (eyepatch emotionless girl, twin-tailed tsundere, loudmouth best friend, hot big-sister nurse, etc...).  I kept expecting to see talk-sprites and text boxes at the bottom of the screen.  Nothing really stood out and made me go \"Wow, that was really spectacular\" or \"I wasn't expecting that!\".  Nothing really got resolved in the end, nor was the curse sufficiently explained.  For all the hype and enthusiasm surrounding this show, I really had expected better.  \r\nMaybe if this anime had taken the time toproperly set the mood, develop characters beyond two-dimensional stock characters, and explore the curse a little more thoroughly, it would have been better. As it is, though, it has a slow build up and a rushed, poorly-executed climax that killed off characters I didn't really care that much about, and there's a lot of blood thrown in just for the shock value. I don't mind blood in my anime, but there are more artful ways to employ shocking death scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're a fan of Elfin Lied or When They Cry, you'll probably like this series.  If you didn't like either of those, skip this one.  \\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe story in this show is the main reason to watch it, in my opinion. It's very well written and thought out, and the mystery is slowly revealed at the perfect pace. The end of every episode always makes you want to come back for the next episodes and the resolution is especially satisfying. The only real problem with the story is that it doesn't really grab you from the first episode, it took me a few before I was infested, but once you are, you're hooked. There is also a beach episode in the latter half of the show that feels completely unnecessary anddoesn't really advance the plot at all, which ruins the pace a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nThis show is a really good looking show for the most part. It is animated very nicely, and the action sequences look especially good. The only thing I didn't like was the occasional use of CGI really stood out in a bad way and I felt it clashed with the 2D art of the show, and doesn't work very well. However, it is used pretty sparingly throughout, so it isn't a huge complaint.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good and does it's job. I didn't think any of it was really memorable outside of the Opening but the music always fits the scenes well and gives the show a good atmosphere. The voice acting (dub) feels a little bit shaky outside of the Mains, but nothing too distracting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nPersonally speaking, the characters are the weakest point of the show, and what prevents it from being great. Outside of Mei, the other characters are extremely underwhelming. Mei is the only one who gets any real development and backstory, with the rest getting pretty much nothing. They aren't annoying and they do their jobs, but they are incredibly forgettable for the most part, with the only other mildly interesting characters being Koichi and Izumi, but that's about it. With there being a good 10+ characters, only a few of them being interesting is a problem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe show is very enjoyable on the whole and I'd very much recommended just for the story, however the forgettable cast is really holding the show back from being something really great. \\n\\n\r\nI found this show to be incredibly hard to rate, with the story being great but the characters being pretty forgettable so I decided to give the show I very good 8/10.",

            "content": "Another, isn't just another cut-em-up show. It may be reputable for its violence, but having just completed it, I've come to appreciate it so much more than i could imagine!\r\nI found this show to be spectacularly composed, Another really is an anime that keeps you on edge. NEVER is there a dull moment!\r\nAnother is primarily based off a single, incredibly unique, vivid back story, that you'll come to understand more so as you go. The story behind these episodes is weighty, deeply, DEEPLY immersive. To the extent that results in its signature uneasy atmosphere. Despite being the viewer, i found the show to be powerfulin that it reinforces a constant sense of peril, it's very rare that you'll get to process how everything has congealed so far - until something else has already you by surprise. \\n\\n\r\nAs an extremely violent anime, there's bound do be death. The show always reminds me of final destination, and in both productions, what further heightens the suspense (of this very suspenseful show!) is its unpredictability. Who knows who will die? You don't. So you're essentially dropped into the show yourself when you start watching it. Personally, i found this really made me want to watch more.\\n\r\nOn the topic of watching more, do be prepared for a rollocoaster ride - as there are a lot of cliffhangers too!\\n\\n\r\nI really thoroughly enjoyed watching Another, and looking back i'm still amazed by its story-telling ability despite its length. There's NO POINTLESS FILLER, NO NONSENSE - it's a straight-up (violent) horror -mystery/supernatural type show. One of great substance and depth to say the least!\\n\\n\r\nI seem to have only mentioned the plot so far, and so i will move swiftly onto summering its other qualities...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art: the vivid colours, mixed with a moody, dark/pastel palette - combined with the detailed sets make it look Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound? I personally adore the soundtrack, on top of this - the use of suspenseful horror themes worked really well in completing the show's wonderfully grim atmosphere. Try watching it without once getting the shivers! ;)\\n\\n\r\nI believe I've already conveyed how i enjoyed watching - and i can't stress enough: how BRILLIANTLY ENGAGING everything seems from start to finish. As long as you're ok with graphic violence, you'd be a fool not to give it a go!\\n\r\nI know you want to ;)\\n\\n\r\nI left it to the end to bring up my only criticism, as a reviewer I've got to fulfill my self-proclaimed role of giving everything a fair trial. So, due to the show's length, and that fact that it's already very weighty coming across, it's unavoidable, but with the exception of the main characters to an extent: character development is significantly lacking. Obviously i would be all in for a 50 or so episode series, but Another DEFIES CONVENTION in that it really doesn't need to do anything different. As something to watch, it really is just a masterpiece.",

I was so wrong, and the anime got me hooked right from the first episode. If I were to summarise this anime, I would say it's kinda like final destination + a thriller where you need to find out who is (the one). The ending was just mindblown-ing because you thought you've predicted it but yet the ending just throws you offcompletely. Not a lot of jumpscares though, but otherwise there's a creepy vibe thats enough to make your hair stand.",

It's a simple and very generic (a little boring, even) anime for a large portion of it's episodes. Despite this, it comes around pretty hard in the last two episodes with a very chaotic ending thats makes you pity even those \"npc\" characters.\r\nStory-The story is...well a story, i guess. Generic mystery curse puzzle detective horror story. It is entertaining atleast and you can atleast through most of the anime accept it. The\r\nending gets a time to shine with, as said earlier, a chance at murderous chaos. Isthere even really a story? well...no, but the small story does entertain. Dont really know why, but it does. 6 out of 1O\\n\\n\r\nart-It's there. Ya know, like all animes. I will mention there are some very brutal gore scenes that act as a source of major shock, and they are definetly gruesome. As an avid fan of gore\\n\r\nmyself, the man definetly knew a brutal death when he sees one. Not much leading up to the gore, but still pretty cool. 6 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nsound-kind of good theme song. literally nothing else to be said. This animes is pretty much the most semi-good anime you'll find. 6 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-The characters here were sometimes mildly enjoyable, mostly just either kind of depressing, kind of happy and exciting, or literally not important at all. alot of the characters really had no point in being there and didn't actually contribute to the story, however the two main leads-mei and kouichi (and i suppose izumi can be thrown in their too) and the teacher are actually of heartwarming and mei can get absurdly kawaii (the scene with her trying to catch fish makes me cry from cuteness.). So, despite alot of lackluster unimportant characters, Their were a few that were kind of cool and heartwarming and i did love mei a lot actually. 7 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-I still suppose this was still a strong 8 just because i had fun watching, an occasional kawaii moment, an awesome action packed ending, and one or two teary eyed moments. Therefore, i give an 8 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-overall is a 7 just because it was enjoyable, fun, and had just a slight more good qualities than it did bad. If anything, it's mostly kind of endearing, even if its pretty generic.\\n\\n\\n",

There should be more anime with that kind of art.\r\nSecond: The story is amazing, I was at the edge of my seat while watching it. And the end was... Well let's say awesome.\r\nI would suggest to watch it, if you haven't yet. It's really a great anime and I think there should be more horror anime like this one.\r\n-NOTE-\r\nthere are some part where I wouldn't suggest watching to people who has week stomach etc.",

            "content": "Another is essentially a horror/mystery anime. The story revolves around a high school class that is under a curse where students in the class (and their relatives) have a very high chance of dying that year. Each year they take countermeasures to avoid the curse, some years with better results than others. \r\nThere are two main characters, Misaki Mei and Sakakibara. They are the ONLY two characters that get any development in the series and the development they get is just about fully reliant on each other. Misaki does seem to open up a little as the show goes on, but also kind of revertsnear the end. Sakaibara does tend to get a little braver, but that's really it.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are not really worth mentioning. Only a couple of them have any real important input to the story, in fact, you can probably just think of them as potential victims of the curse. \\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere at first is great. It is really haunting and eerie feeling. Gets you into the mood for a horror anime. However, this does not erase the crawl like pacing of the show. It is part mystery, but the show takes a long time revealing any information. \\n\\n\r\nThe reaction (or lack of reaction) of people outside the class is also odd. If there was a school with random kids dying all the time I'd think it would get some sort of attention. There are also other loop holes, especially one revealed near the end of the series. If you caught the major loophole in Madoka Magica and breathed a sigh of discontent over it, you'll rage over the loophole(s) in Another.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a pretty neat resolution at the end, but it is semi-ruined by the fact (due to a loophole) none of it actually had to really happen. Also, while the last episode was by far the most entertaining, it was also by far the most ridiculous. Another really takes things a little too over the top at times to the point where it turns into a comedy. If you like movies like Final Destination, Another might be your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't often talk about the art quality in reviews. I do have to comment that Another looks great. The OP/ED are bad, there is no way around this. But if you're like me you listen do them once and that's it. The sound and music within the show are placed very well and add to the general haunting nature of the series (well until it wares off). \\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up Another is a series full of plotholes, bland characters, and moments that will make you upset for the wrong reasons. It is kind of entertaining, but often not for the reasons that the creators intended. It is slightly saved by a neat ending, but as an overall package your probably better watching another show. \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n",

Whilst it is okay for the premise behind something to be inconceivable, peoples reactions to things should be realistic. The Characters react in the stupidest ways to things. The MC is absolutely retarted and does not grasp the idea that he is killing people by continuing his questions, and also the fact that when people die and he tries to talk to people the next day, he does not understand why they are ignoring him. Also, why wouldn't they literally just not have a class 3 anymore? Orleave the class midway through the year WHEN PEOPLE ARE DYING. Or they could cut down the class size by 10 but keep the 10 desks? Makes no sense in many ways. Other than that, solid anime.",

At first, the first few episodes ran a little slower filling me with more and more questions about this and that, and if this is connected to that. It was a little annoying before, but they created questions that had me really curious, drawing me to the next episode hoping to find the answer to something.\r\nThe story starts off with you finding out that something serious happened in the past (about 26 years ago), and the main character asks around but before he gets an answer something happens or the subject changes, and we're leftwith vague and incomplete answers, almost nothing. Eventually things start progressing when events start happening in the present which is when the story gets real interesting, having me asking more questions while getting answers to others, but nothing was ever what I expected. No matter how many times I guessed and change my guess, I was always wrong, leading to a plot twist at the end that I would've never guessed.\\n\r\nThough by the time the anime ended there were a few questions still left unanswered, like how or why all of this started, when the climax hit, I wasn't concerned about that, I was more worried about how they were going to end it.\\n\r\nI recommend this to those who likes gore, suspense, and surprises.",

The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because of how it started. At the start, for some reason, Kouichi (the main character) kept on following Mei (a girl people pretended didn't exist) and kept on finding her in a creepy-looking place with creepy-looking dolls. I think they wanted to make it look as a horror anime, but this part was unnecessary. (The deathswould be able to classify the anime as horror, it could do without the dolls).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is really well done. The colours give the anime an aura of mistery and suspense which worked really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the sound was excellent. The opening is beautiful, the ending as well and whenever we had a funny moment, happy songs played and whenever there was a \"heavier\" moment, dark music played.\\n\r\n I think it really was well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are good, but they didn't get much development. You find Mei in the end the same you found her on the beggining and this applies to every character with the exception of Izumi and a friend of hers who I won't talk about in order not to spoil.\\n\r\nIzumi, in the start, was just that strong-headed typical girl but as the story progressed, she became more and more happy and developed a sense of humor, so she DID get development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10) \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot, it would be cool if they made a second season with other class 3-3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nLike I said above, this anime is very well done and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys mistery, horror and if you quish it a lot, a bit of romance.",

My only gripe is that oh, it should have been longer! \r\nThe story really impressed me for the genre. It was clever, fresh and the telling of it was done really well. Very unpredictable too, which I lift my hat for since people tend to lean towards predictable scary stories. The atmospheres changed fluidly from ( slightly tense ) ease to thrillingand unnerving. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was beautiful and as an owner of ball-jointed dolls I really loved the detail of them as they appeared through out the series. I also loved the subtle creepiness of them, even considering their eventual role. Usually dolls are a pretty cheap gimmick to make a creepy atmosphere but they balanced their beauty very well. If one were so inclined you could speculate on their symbolism in the anime. \\n\r\nAlso, the gore. There isn't a lot of it, but the gore there is is rather impressive. I like. Very nice attention to detail considering that it is a (non-movie) anime. Hooray for blood that doesn't look like ketchup ( Elfen Lied... ).  This sort of thing rarely makes me go 'eugh' audibly but the first gore scene most definitely did. \\n\\n\r\nSounds... weren't particularly memorable. The OP was kind of interesting but not really something I cared to listen to. Not bad, but not incredibly good either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were alright, if a bit unbelievable at times ( honestly, they were quite relaxed most of the time considering their situation ). \\n\r\nAt first I really didn't like the cover girl Mizaki Mei but once SPOILERS, I had to admit she suit her role and felt sympathetic for her. \\n\r\nThe male protagonist Kouichi was somewhat uninspired, minus SPOILERS towards the end which left some questions in the air ( more in manga? ). However it didn't really take away from the series.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this show and I HOPE dearly that it gains enough popularity to inspire more proper horror anime.",

            "content": "I know I'm kinda late for the party but Another is just one of the first horror anime series I'd watched. And of course... I LIKED IT. Read the following reasons below.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nI know a lot of people have known about the Final Destination series; you know those movies were people get killed in the most brutal way possible during the most coincidental moments at the most irrational places. Another sends me back to those scenes. But unlike the latter, Another takes a slightly different route thus have a more profound and complex story. Honestly at first I was confused by the entire story, soI always end up wrong in my hypotheses on the ending results. But I did encounter other shows who has the similar plot outlines as this one, where one factor in the upcoming ending climax of the story is always found on the beginning of the story where we tend to miss it - ironic. Still the story was very rational and well-explained from start to finish. And those scenes of bloodshed and the manner on how they were depicted was great as well. The cliff-hanger endings in each episodes really get the watches riled up, deducing  on what'll happen next or who the next victim would be. From one storyline to another, Another brings the full package when it reached its ending - which really shocked me. Still, I wouldn't mind for a second season as I feel the story could use for another one, if not the same cast as before but the next batch who will face the similar fate. But the reason I didn't gave this a perfect score is that there are areas that could have been better or that the story was lacking something extra.\\n\\n\r\nART:10/10\\n\r\nThere's nothing to say much about the visual quality of this show as it is, to me, just beautiful. I didn't see the quality of the art degrading as the episodes go on yet improves or still retaining its quality from the first episode if otherwise. The background art also fit the atmosphere of the scene adding the beauty and dread for the upcoming predicament. The animation was close to real-life as it gets even if I sometimes find it quite choppy but that doesn't spoil my viewing pleasure. Good job people from P.A. Works!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nNothing can be called horror without any music and voice acting to fit the dark and dreadful atmosphere, and Another just scored a hole in one! Each voice actor was perfect for their roles along with the sound that fits the mood of every situation. From the sound of bones snapping, blood dripping, organs crushing, just hearing it sends a shiver to my entire body. The soundtrack was pleasant as well as it also somewhat reflects to the story of the anime. Just brilliant the audio this show has...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nThe full set of characters here contain many colorful personalities that separate one from the other, making them unique in their own way. Weird, plain, popular, it doesn't matter as long as they can stand out from the rest. Unfortunately though, some characters are underdeveloped throughout the story and still retain the traits they have by the time they were introduced. Mei Misaki, for example, who at first was an \"unusual loner\" barely evolved to anything as the story progress - continuing her \"cold shoulder\" treatment to other characters besides the protagonist. Also, some characters weren't greatly emphasized in the story so I didn't even feel a bit of remorse when they died. However, character backgrounds and relationships are nicely depicted so you don't have to worry that the characters here are lacking any identity. It's actually the opposite as a matter a fact, all main characters also contain at least one hidden surprising quality or identity shocking the watchers as they discover these. So looks can be deceiving at times so you better watch out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nAnother is a mystery/horror/thriller anime worth watching even if yourself isn't familiar with the said genre. I had fun watching it so why can't you? Knock yourself out and get horrified, in an entertaining way that is. If another season comes out, I doubt it'll be any better than this one but let's just keep out fingers crossed. However, if you have a weak heart, then I advice you to stay away from this one or else you will end up dying the same way one of the characters did in this show - hopefully not.",

            "content": "Introduction - \u201dAnother?\u201d yeah try telling that to a fellow otaku,at first the name seems very odd but it all makes sense as you watch the anime.I\u2019m somewhat squeamish when it comes to this type of genre,but hey this anime is pretty good. to be honest there isn\u2019t much to talk about here,however this anime proves that it doesn\u2019t matter what genre you are into,as long as the story and characters can bring a good anime then it shouldn\u2019t matter.That being said this anime does fall a little short in some area that keeps it from being a prefect anime.\r\nContent- The anime is called \u201cAnother\u201dit contains 12 original episodes with an OVA known as episode 0,which is basically a prequel to the series. the main series was released early in 2012 with the OVA shortly after,i suggest watching the OVA afterwards,but chronologically the OVA is first.This anime is a horror/mystery anime and despite not being into either one of the genre,this anime proved to me that it doesn\u2019t matter what genre it is,an anime can be good no matter what the story or setting can be. still a fair warning to everyone who isn\u2019t into horror/mystery,you still may not like it. The anime also contains some romance in it as well,and some light hearten moments to break up the pacing of the gloomy world \u201cAnother\u201d presents the viewer.The series also shows it\u2019s dark theme that center around it,such as death,ignorance, the feeling of lost and, mob mentality.Rather than explaining the themes,the anime is more about demonstrating them and showing examples of what happens when people start to believe in ideas and turn against other peoples for it. this whole concept is similar to the witch trials in Salem,where the town\u2019s people had to get rid of witches but end up killing innocent people just becuase of false accusation and the mob mentality of believing in those ideas. However even as the anime did a great job showing this,it still feel short on telling an excellent story that can bring them together and make a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nPlot- (spoilers)The anime takes place somewhere in the 1990s as a new student by the name Koichi,sakakibara transfers to yomiyama. however he did not join the class right away as he was stuck in the hospital for a while due an illness,before leaving the hospital he was stopped by izumi, a school girl that is in charge of the countermeasure. at first it is not revealed what the countermeasure is suppose to do,but it shows that they are suppose to protect the students from the curse that plagues the class later on.Speaking of curse the main plot of the anime revolves around a curse of class-3 that kills students and people involved in the classroom,students believe the curse starts when a new transfer student enters the class,in order to replace a dead one.the students believe it was a student name mei,misaki who is supposedly dead already,which leads every student to ignore her and to treat her as she outdoes exist in order for the curse to stay dormant,however koichi begins to befriends mei,even after being warned not to even talk to her,which makes the student believe the curse is awaken when of the students died in an accident,thus opens up the plot for the rest of the episodes as the students try to find out what is behind the curse and how to stop it,which leads to ignorance and violence.The plot can keep you into the anime as well,as they uncover another clue the anime becomes part mystery,which can be fun to watch and creates a lot of drama for the anime.Most of the plot is purely supernatural and you will see how some parts of the plot is not even relateable to real life,then again its common in anime if this genre.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art-The animation is done by P.A works,an animation company fairy popular,and known for animes such as angel beats,and hanasaku iroha.This anime truly does have amazing animation and incredible uses of lighting that can create the dark gloomy world,along with excellent color which is expected for an anime of 2012.Art for the anime resembles much like older animes during the early to mid 2000s but still keeps itself pretty original and recognizable.One thing to note is the camera angles the anime uses,such as first person views,and even some CGI for certain scenes,which is pretty new to me and its a cool thing to see an anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/voice-One word,Perfect the anime gets a lot of points on music,now the music doesn\u2019t have to be melody based,or have a certain beat to it,this is a horror anime and the music does its job perfectly to change your mood and become somewhat nervous,along with the sound effects and you got a great atmosphere that makes you feel like if you were there too.As for the voice actors/actresses they do an excellent job and can keep you on the edge of your seat,and becomes very believable in what they do,when they scream,when they shout and when they cry,its all done perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nAppeal- A major appeal to this anime is the characters,they are well though out have decent back story to them. Mei is the character who is the memorable,due to her appearance with her eyepatch and her personalty that can give off that mysterious but curious feel to the character,it can also be a good assumption that her character design may have influenced rikka\u2019s design in chunnibyou due to very similar appearances.\\n\\n\r\nfinal opinion - i believe the anime doesn\u2019t rely on overused jump-scares or gory imagery as much,instead it builds up the fear and suspension by carefully working the sound and music to create that gloomy and frightening atmosphere,as soon as you hear a conversation,the music slowly build up making anyone nervous since its something that affects naturally. the people behind the anime probably knew how to get the most out of the viewers when it came to this,and did an excellent job pulling our fears and feeling of anxiety,of course this shows that we even care for the characters,and tells us that the anime did a great job fleshing out the characters,but also leaving us with little information to keep it mysterious. sadly this also backfires a little bit as i felt they used it to create plot twist that can come out of nowhere,but can be justifiable because we were not told in previous episodes,its like an a popular anime where a plot twist can happen and the viewer is confused,but then a flash back shows a character doing something that was never known to the viewer until it was revealed by the flashback.even with that flaw,it is only an assumption of mine can i felt could have been different to get a better ending.The anime is a good one, especially in its own genre,it can teach us a few things but can still lack real meaning behind it and leaves us with mixed feelings,so do i recommend this anime?\u2026.in short yes,but not to everyone obviously, i think its still worth watching,and the ones who enjoy horror will get more out of it than i did,and for the ones who aren\u2019t into horror anime,i say its a good start,if you seriously want to watch one,but please follow the age ratings it was put there for a reason. with that i leave the review,i hope you guys enjoyed reading the review,peace.

            "content": "2012 Series directed by Tsutomu Mizushima\r\nProduced by P.A. Works\r\nReview from my POV (w/personal biases)\r\nMild (Sp)oilers\r\nPRO/What I Liked:\r\n+ The overall atmosphere of this show is setup right from the get go. From the eerie speech in the beginning of the first episode (and every other episode for that matter) to the built tension leading to a climactic-heavy ending for almost every episode, it does a good job of being legitimately \"horrifying\"\r\n+ In typical P.A. Works fashion, they know how to make a show look pretty.\r\n+ (personal) The pacing of the plot might seem a bit sluggish at first I'll admit. For me though, I thought itwas a good way to build tension. \\n\r\n+ Some of the more light-hearted characters (Teshigawara, Mochizuki, etc.) gave you room to breathe, giving you moments of light humor and diversity.\\n\r\n+THE BLOOD. OH JESUS!!!! :P\\n\\n\r\nCONS/What I didnt like so much:\\n\r\n- Mei Misaki pushes the doll-like personality too hard at crucial times especially when she is faced with intense danger.\\n\r\n- The ending theme is very misleading \\n\r\n- There were some scenes that featured a grim occurrence, yet was followed by a scene where I felt the characters seemed too laid back for my taste.\\n\r\n- (Sp) I felt a certain plot device involving an eye could've been handled better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: I've never have been a huge fan of horror. I consider myself quite the opposite, yet i decided to give this one a chance. I ended having alot of fun with this show. It's plot might not be the best i've seen nor is it the tightest, but the tense pacing and the blood curdling animations help this show move foward in the right direction, even if it does stray a bit from its projected goal.",

            "content": "Please excuse my lack of experience in writing a review*\r\nFirst of all I want to point out the obvious: this is a horror anime. Now, as I'm sure you know, many directors and companies attempt to make an interesting, original story that has its own never-seen-before plot, however unfortunately miserably fail. I can tell you that right off the bat- Another has everything that other horror animes lack. \r\nThe story itself is an eye-catcher. A young girl dies 27 years ago, but is still seen by her class. Is she really dead, or is she a ghost? Are they crazy, or is there something thatreally makes it able for her to be seen? Right off the bat you're given a mystery that you're aching the find the answer to. As you continue on through the first episode you're given an obvious atmosphere of secrecy. There is something that the people of the village are very afraid of. Something they do not want Kouichi, the leading male roll, to yet find out.\\n\\n\r\nIn just the first 3 episodes, more questions have been brought up, and the mystery around Misaki Mei tightens. It's very clear that there is something not right with the girl, and that there is something not right with class 3-3. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I give the story a 9/10 for the time being. I understand that's likely a high praise for an anime with only 3 episodes out, but I strongly believe that within those 3 episodes a great plot line has been presented. I feel that with time it can only grow into a more interesting and an even more attention grabbing story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I give the art an 8/10. The overall design isn't anything out of the ordinary, there is no out-there characters (Aside from Misaki with her eye patch), however the art and animation is smooth and well detailed. Character deisgn was something I was very impressed with, especially certain characters such as Misaki Mei, and my personal favourite looking character, Mochizuki Yuuya. I would also like to point out the usage of an almost cutscene animation of dolls to show the atmosphere of the setting. I think that was a very smart idea. This, along with the design of each doll, truly adds to the idea that this is a creepy anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I give this an 8/10. I'm going to include the opening and end theme songs within this section, and if it had not been for the voice actors, I would have given the sound a 7/10. I believe the opening and end themes could have been done better, I don't see either fitting for a horror story for Another's type. Personally, I believe something slower and creepier would be more fitting for the opening. I did, however, give it an 8/10. This is because of the voice-actor choices. I was very pleased to hear clear, fitting voices for each character. Especially, once again, Misaki Mei. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I give this a 9/10.  Each character has room for development, which is something I like. You know things already about each character that draws you into them. There are questions around each that make you want to know more, that make you want to continue on in hopes of learning about their story. Each character is connected to class 3-3 in some way, and each character has either shown a reaction to Misaki Mei's name, or has mentioned their stance on the matter. It adds to the suspense of how their character will react in certain situations, and also brings questions of what's in store for each. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, I'm giving this a 10/10. I know there will be people who agree, but there will also be people who think I'm being a little bit too generous here. However I can fully say that there has never been an anime that has made me ache for the next episode as much as Another has. While watching each episode, I'm instantly drawn in, clinging onto every word, gathering as much information as I can. I've grown to most every character already. I've feared for them, I've pitied them, I've related to them. It's a thing I don't get with many animes out there. Especially not horror animes. Another keeps me glued to the screen, it keeps me interested and it makes me think. Things that I look for in an anime, are things that Another seems to have all wrapped up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give Another a 9/10. The story has opened up in a way that right off the bat catches ones attention. That alone is uncommon, in my eyes. It didn't take long for me to become interested. However as you go on, with each element; Originality, Mystery, and Excitement, you're drawn more and more into the story. It's a great anime if you're looking for those three things. \\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this anime to any viewer interested in character development, mysteries and questions, originality, and enjoyable characters. Another gives you just that and much, much more.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nAnother is a disappointment, it really makes me sad, i LOVED the theme they created and color choices the first couple of episodes were excellent BUT of course they fucked it up\r\nThe main character is awfully unrealistic, first off he has lung disease (for no reason!) and there is a scene which he is caught in fire, you might ask: Does he run? WELL NO he takes his phone out and tries to get a signal! what the fuck? that bitch Mei is no better, when people attack her to fucking kill her, she sometimes tries to dodge and sometimes she just doesn\u2019t givea shit, she is so inconsistent and annoying, there is no depth for this character.\\n\\n\r\nyou know mystery is fun but if it\u2019s creative, they showed mysterious things in the most clich\u00e9 and lamest way possible, every sec someone wants to explain what the fuck is going on to the main character (and us!) but then they say shits like \u201cehh\u2026ehhh\u2026nothing!\u201d it\u2019s so bad, in one point in front of our stupid hero they literally say: \u201cwe have to do something about this curse\u201d and he says what the fuck are you talking about nigga? and they get all nervous and act stupid and finally tell him in a really lame way that everything is OK and you don\u2019t need to worry even though everyone in school are dying!!!! \\n\\n\r\nfights are an insult to the audience, you know the typical villain doesn\u2019t kill the hero when they have 100% chance to do so! and suddenly out of no-fucking-where dues ex machina, YEAH except to see those in this anime\u2026A LOT.\\n\\n\r\nthis anime is basically Final Destination but much worse, in the FD series at least characters were smart enough to realize something is up and they should avoid dangerous things But in this fucking anime after their classmates get brutally killed they go to picnic!! i\u2019m serious that\u2019s how dumb it is.\\n\\n\r\nother characters are no better than main ones (Obviously) at one point they just go berserk and try to kill each other for no real reason\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is everyone is stupid if they fucking shared their information with each other they could solve this so called mystery!\\n\r\nat the very least they could explain why he should stay away from that girl but that stupid red bitch should have implemented her \u201ccountermeasures\u201d!\\n\\n\r\nbtw What the fuck was that ending?!!!! did he really murder her dead aunt just like that?! (i know it sounds ridiculous but..WAIT there is no but! it IS fucking ridiculous) he is a fucking psychopath!\\n\\n\r\nOH i almost forgot about that idiot Mei, she said she could see the dead! but does she opens her fucking mouth to tell others? NO,she remains silent for two fucking Episode (and as always FOR NO FREAKING REASON), she is also a liar in one episode she literally said to main character \u201cshe doesn\u2019t exist\u201d and since we saw her suddenly disappearing when she was being chased by hero, it was reasonable to assume she is indeed some sort of a ghost but it turns out she is just a human who sees dead people (unexplained why!) , i mean that\u2019s cheating MAYBE she meant metaphorically that she doesn\u2019t exist but still, why being so vague? just say it like a fucking human, but Maybe she just lied, to throw off the hero so the countermeasures keep on working but it still doesn\u2019t make any sense, she could have ignored him or tell him to fuck off, that would work!!\\n\\n\r\nif i keep pointing to the plot holes and inconsistencies and stupid decisions i would have to write a book for that so i\u2019m going to end this here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nbut in the end this anime is not unwatchable, it does have good things to offer (rarely), so if you really need something to watch then go right ahead, as you might read in the comments this anime is unintentionally a comedy and it is a successful comedy!!! you will have good time laughing at the ways people die and how stupid, other characters reaction is.",

When I think \"horror\" I think of obsessive gore, and mediocre suspense, and fear. Mostly with the anime scene, but also in mainstream movies, and shows. But, I can safely say, this anime is entirely different. You shouldn't expect to go into this, hiding under you covers from fear. No anime is going to achieve this level of horror. But in terms of suspense, and mystery. This is the best I've ever seen. Sure, it's scary. But that is secondary to the main plot.At it's core, this show is a thrilling, mysterious, joy of a show.

            "content": "Ever wonder why Horror in general is the least appreciated and the fussiest of all the genres out there? Be it a movie, a TV Series or even a book, Horror has always been an experiment. And not the successful kind of one. You see, horror writers tend to focus on typical \"scary\" or disturbing elements, use absurd situations as scare tactics, and even rely on previously-used clich\u00e9s just to be on the safe side. And the worst part is, they try to please every horror fan by mixing everything up together and shattering the story and its characters as a result. Sure, Gore isgreat, even \"enjoyable\" at some point, but not when it's irrelevant to the plot and used just to induce horror. Because it gets lame really fast. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnother\u201d is not one of those exhausting experiments. It's a diversion. It plays the audience as much as the audience \"plays\" each episode. The first five episodes are creepy to say the least, but not enough to encourage someone to keep watching because story-wise, nothing is actually developed in those episodes. The atmosphere surrounding the characters, their interactions and relationships with one another is just too unsettling and dark. And the viewers have to be patient; it's a price to pay. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnother\u201d is an unorthodox show that focuses more on the atmosphere while trying to fool the audience, rather than attempting to scare us using cheap mind tricks. \\n\\n\r\nThis review will consist of two parts: one about the many positives of the show, and the one thing that was in my opinion poorly handled.\\n\\n\r\n(+) POSITIVES\\n\\n\r\n\u25cfSTORYTELLING: \\n\r\nMYSTERY: \"A cursed and unfortunate class close to Death\" is all you can get from 5 episodes. And while this simple phrase seems blurry and lacks any form of context, it makes it easier to tell more than just one story. It\u2019s confusing, but at the same time intriguing, because it creates diversion. Here's the best way that I can describe it: the story is like a chameleon that continuously changes its color skin. In short, the writer meticulously creates a situation with multiple scenarios but showing only one at a time such as convincing the audience that one of the characters is a ghost or a potentially resurrected classmate nicknamed \u201cextra student\". The writer chooses to name the female lead character \"Misaki\" on purpose, which is conveniently the same name as a mysterious person who died 26 years ago and pretty much started all this misfortune. This first part of show succeeds in piquing our curiosity by simply teasing us with mysterious elements before explaining them afterwards. And this is important: it DOES answer the questions it raised contrary to most Mystery animes where they tend to keep you on the edge of your seat but at the end decide to keep all the details for themselves. Of course, raising one or two questions at the end may come in handy in some cases, but not when they only serve as an extra pile of unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nSUPERNATURAL: As expected from a supernatural view, most of the deaths in the show are absurd, especially the first one. But is this excusable? Is it actually linked to the story (or just used for experimentation purposes like excessive gore and violence) ? Since the calamity causes someone related to the cursed classroom to die unexpectedly and sometimes inexplicably, yes. What's the chance of getting killed by an umbrella while walking down the staircase? Close to 0%. But I accept improbable deaths as long as they matter, as long as they are relevant to the core story (In this case, the curse). \\n\\n\r\nHORROR: Sometimes, the small details matter because they help settle the mood and create something unique. One of the most interesting elements of \u201cAnother\u201d is the use of representations to express feelings of loneliess, alienation and emptiness such as the focus on dolls which cleary depict lifelessness and isolation, the interpretations of different paintings (\u201cThe Scream\u201d, random sketches of a wingless angel\u2026), the ravens (Death), the rain (indicates misfortune to come and hints at traumas and tears) and the list goes on. The writer even associates the female lead character with complete emptiness by fusing her right eye with one of a doll, as if this wasn\u2019t enough already. Mix those small elements up with a plain and simple horror setting such as \u201ca curse in a school\u201d and you\u2019ll get an interesting result. Because it\u2019s not an ordinary curse anymore, like striking a nail into a straw doll or anything like that. It\u2019s a curse that involves ignorance and disregard (I\u2019m not going to say more than that for fear of spoiling it) which happens to be of the many themes of \u201cAnother\u201d. In fact, it shows us the horror by carefully exploring its hidden themes instead of resorting to meaningless violence like most horror shows do.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cfART & ANIMATION: \\n\r\nI don\u2019t usually take much time in this section, but this time it\u2019s an exception. The art is almost flawless: it\u2019s overly detailed and carefully crafted and drawn to point that you can read the title and cover of the book that one of the background characters is reading, more or less. Speaking of which, every background scene has details and colors instead of the usual \u201cblurry\u201d cartoonish shapes or even worse, the famous \u201cfaceless\u201d students in the back. The production team also took their precious time adjusting colors so they can perfectly fit into the scene and setting. They played a bit with wind effects at the beginning, helping us predict that misfortune is about to come, but they got tired of it later on. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the character designs are unique in their own way, making it much easier to distinguish them by their looks instead of their forgettable names. There are no characters that present remotely the same shape, outline and features: they have been drawn with a unique \u201cskeleton\u201d unlike what most animes are doing nowadays, where they focus on one particular design and then keep adding or removing facial features accordingly to match a different character. Apparently, they focused more on Mei Misaki \u2018s character design, most likely to further isolate her from the others by adding more dark features than her Manga counterpart (which is cuter and less gloomy).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it\u2019s fluid, concise and delicate. There\u2019s almost no stuttering between frames, or overused jump frames that make question what just happened in the last few seconds. In short, you won\u2019t have to rewind the episode to re-watch a scene, unless you\u2019ve missed the subtitles.   \\n\\n\r\n\u25cfCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nAround 20 characters are present, including 5-6 main characters. This makes it impossible to develop all of them in a 12 episode-deadline. Instead, only the main characters are developed, especially Kouichi Sakakibara (Male Lead) and Mei Misaki (Female Lead). The others are only described with a single trait, such as a certain hereditary illness, nothing more. This leads to a certain dilemma: we can have some under-developed characters only if we will kill them later on for the sake of the story. People will complain that those deaths are meaningless as they weren\u2019t invested in those characters and as a result, don\u2019t really care what happens to them. OR: we can try to fully develop most of the characters including their background stories but we will still kill them (the story will remain unchanged). People will be outraged that the writers killed their \u201cfavorite\u201d character(s) and wasted their precious time. So what\u2019s the solution here? Well, we can\u2019t have one without the other. And since some characters are cleary more important than others, the stage should be given to them instead. Discard the rest. And this is exactly what \u201cAnother\u201d does. It presents its secondary characters by summarizing their traits, nothing more than that, and later on kills them in favor of future events to come. It\u2019s a necessary sacrifice to be made, especially in the horror genre. People die, a lot. And it shouldn\u2019t shock us. It\u2019s a tragedy, and it made it clear from the start. Everyone is on the writer\u2019s Death List, even if you don\u2019t believe it yourself. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters\u2019 psychological state, it\u2019s messy, crumbled and distorted. They are scared, selfish, even psychotic and violent (last episode) and will do anything to stay alive, even if it meant killing their own classmates. Ironically, the character with the most distinctive traits is the silent one: Mei Misaki. \u201cAnother\u201d shows us that there\u2019s another way to express a person\u2019s feelings and state of mind. Words lie (and Mei doesn\u2019t talk much), but representations don\u2019t (the scenes are mostly emphasized on her). The same goes for the main character.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cfSOUND:\\n\r\nMost voice actors did a perfect job in conveying the characters\u2019 emotions and feelings, so you won\u2019t find one of those annoying high-pitched voices that makes you wish you were watching a Dubbed version (God Forbids). \\n\\n\r\nOP made by ALI Project titled \u201cNightmare Contagion\u201d was awesome and fit the horror-thriller genre perfectly. I recommend you give it a try if you enjoy eerie violin melodies and a good vocalist.\\n\\n\r\nED was an alright one. \\n\\n\r\n( - ) NEGATIVES\\n\r\nBesides the slow-paced and dark beginning (first 5 episodes) which will discourage a lot of people to continue, \u201cAnother\u201d had one problem. The execution of its last episode. It felt rushed and chaotic, and I believe it was on purpose. The writer wanted to confuse the audience by combining multiple events that happened, or were supposed to happen (some of the events couldn\u2019t be shown on-screen due to time restrictions) while also making many character decisions for no other reason than hype us for the final revelation. Just like us, the characters were confused and lost, but out of their fear of dying miserably by \u201cunfortunate events\u201d, and this backfired a bit. Nonetheless, the ending was on-point and the closure perfectly wrapped up the whole story and may serve as a prologue to a next story with a good ending.\\n\\n\r\n\u25cfENJOYEMENT: I watched \u201cAnother\u201d twice as of now. The first time was when it aired and I didn\u2019t quite enjoy it because I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the story and its metaphors. After a second examination, I loved it, maybe because I got tired of the repetitive horror shows out there and wanted something unique in its own way. Not the kind that makes you question your sanity or the writer\u2019s sanity. But the kind that makes you curious, excited, frustrated and even sad at the same time. So to wrap this up:\\n\\n\r\nGive this a try if you:\\n\r\n- Prefer atmosphere and setting over plain and simple horror story \\n\r\n- Look for acceptable main characters\\n\r\n- Enjoy exploration of dark themes\\n\\n\r\nAvoid this if you are impatient. Otherwise you\u2019ll be disappointed.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I need to name one caveat I have about this anime, it's this: you can't judge it by its first few episodes. In fact, after watching only the first four episodes, I would have named this one of my least favorite anime of all time without hesitation.\r\nAs such, I feel like I  have to divide the show into two parts for the purpose of this review: the \"boring-as-watching-paint-dry\" part (episodes 1 though 4), and the \"interesting\" part (episodes 5 through 12). My issue with the first part is simple: almost nothing happens. I know that a slow pace is encouraged and preferable insuspense-driven horror, but there is such a thing as doing too little. Here's some advice to anyone who wants to write, draw, or film anything in the horror or mystery genres: suspense isn't as simple as waiting a long time before doing something scary. You need to keep the audience invested in the meantime. How do you do this? Establish the setting, make the audience invested in the characters by subtly introducing backstory, and (most importantly) give the audience information about the mystery at a moderate pace. Most, if not every, scene should serve a purpose to the plot or the setting. \\n\\n\r\nI will give this anime credit and say that it does establish the setting very well. By the end of the first episode, I knew who the characters were and what the basic gist of class 3's history was, and I was sufficiently intrigued by the mysterious behavior of all of the characters. The problem is that the next three episodes (and a decent chunk of the first episode, for that matter) do nothing to advance the story beyond that point. Most scenes simply rehash what the audience already knows or consist of nothing more than students giving creepy stares or saying cryptic nonsense to the main character. There are some exceptions, of course, but they are few and far between.  Not only would it be incredibly easy to cut those four episodes down to two episodes without removing any important information, character moments, or suspenseful scenes, but the repetitive nature of these episodes ends up ruining the impressive setting and interesting characters already established. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the fourth episode, I thought that every character (excluding the main character's nurse friend) was stupid, annoying or pretentious. This was due in large part to the fact that most of them seemed to be acting creepy or mysterious for no reason other than to act creepy and mysterious, even when outright explaining the situation would serve their own goals far better. The main character, Kouichi Sakakibara, does nothing to alleviate this situation, since he does nothing but stare blankly at the events going on around him. He seems almost unwilling to uncover the mystery behind class 3, frequently letting characters dodge his questions or walk away from him without so much as a word of protest, no matter how blatant it was that they knew more than they were telling. I cannot express how pissed off I was by this sorry excuse for a protagonist. The episodes also try to establish a relationship between him and Mei Misaki, but this attempt is utterly foiled by Misaki's tendency to do nothing other than, you guessed it, give creepy stares and cryptic nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, everything changes after episode 4. Without giving too much away, I will say that many of the plot points that the characters have been needlessly holding off on are revealed by the end of episodes 5 and 6, and virtually all the problems that I had with the previous episodes are no longer present. Suddenly the characters begin acting like normal humans; they're friendly with one another, they legitimately try to uncover the mystery, and they develop their own unique, likeable characteristics. Misaki and Sakakibara talk with each other in a believable way. Almost every scene in these later episodes is relevant, even though the pace is still very slow, making the episodes both suspenseful and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nTake for example episode 8, which is my favorite episode. While I won't give away too many specifics about the plot, I will say that the episode begins with several characters going to a hotel to meet someone who may have a hint regarding the central mystery of the series. During this sequence, they decide to spend the day at the beach while waiting for said person to show up. For most of the episode, there are no new elements of the mystery introduced, nothing bad happens to anyone, and the dark, overcast skies of the rest of the series are abandoned in favor of a sunny beach setting. The characters just spend a day at the beach. Why do I like this episode? Because it has the characters acting like friends. They make jokes, they feud with each other, they have fun. Suddenly the people who I took for one-note, cryptic morons felt like multifaceted, interesting and (most importantly) realistic people. After this episode, I cared about these characters and didn't want anything bad to happen to them. Who cares if the mystery narrative is ground to a halt when the scenes here still serve some purpose to the series? They make the audience develop an emotional connection with the characters that makes the eventual climax of the series far more impactful.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace does eventually increase as the series begins to reach its climax, making the last couple episodes feel a bit too fast-paced. However, I do appreciate that the show does still manage to tie up most of its loose ends by the conclusion, and that none of the series' events or twists were predictable or cheap. I do have a few complaints regarding the plot and the overall mystery, but mentioning those would get into spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this series to anyone who wants a decent horror mystery, although there are definitely far better ones out there. I honestly feel like I would have enjoyed it much more if it were shorter or if there was more variety in the first few episodes, but as it stands I give this show a fairly good 6 creepy stares.....out of 10.",

I liked the pacing during the first half of the series and I enjoyed the contrast between the slow pacing and the quick surprise deaths. But the ending was obviously too rushed, as if it was unplanned. Many half-baked secondary characters were slaughtered. Each death was all pleasantly gruesome and entertaining but the overall result was a bit messy. Other elements of \u2018Another\u2019 were satisfactory. I generally liked the editing of this series. There were several quiet foreboding sequences which I thought was interesting.The music did not stand out as much as I expected but it was okay.",

Are you willing to sacrifice your friends? or maybe someone's existence?\r\nTo my surprise i found this specific anime quite amazing not only because of its plot twists, but also because of its original concept that most horror and mystery genre anime are missing. Honestly I am not a fan of this genre but after watching this anime my perspective of horror and mystery genres changed. I am proud to say that I gave this anime a score of 10/10 which is solely based on my enjoyment, most of the time my enjoyment does not necessarilyshow on how good an anime is, but this one did, surprisingly. Now lets get started.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier just before watching \"Another\" I was not a fan of horror and mystery genres ( especially if it involves bloody scenes of people dying). The story was done in a slow pace but this slow pace gave the story its maximum suspense towards its build up to the end of the series it also gave the audience the opportunity to learn every important detail. The most amazing thing about the story is its unpredictability, believe me most of my assumptions were wrong, and this is rare because most anime are very easy to predict in its outcome,so far the only thing that throws off this anime is that it tries to be \"more\" complex and \"mindfuck\" even though it already is in the first place. Despite its flaws Another is worth a watch, I strongly recommend it if you are a fan of horror and mystery genres and if you are not a fan I assure you after you watch this you will be searching for more mystery filled anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n Sounds that perfectly fit a horror anime are hard to come by but yet again the soundtracks for \"Another\" is perfect.The sound was able to set the proper mood in every scene. In my honest opinion the opening for \"Another\" was incredible as it was able to show a quick \"preview\" of the anime and at the same time did not give out any spoilers. The art was no doubt, incredible, every single detail was made perfectly from something major like the design of the characters , the surroundings and etc, to the minor stuff like the background, vivid details of every setting they were in and even rust in metals and  dust in old lockers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\\n\r\n A characters are actually quite impressive; they were able to remain mysterious and rather clueless(specifically the main character) up to the very end; at the same time they were still able to give off certain hints which makes the audience watch each episode, it will leave you wondering what was really happening. Piece of advice: Don't judge them, if you do you will most probably end up like me, shocked, because my assumptions were around 90% wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:10/10 :)\\n\\n\r\n I really enjoyed this anime, and I am proud to say that I did not regret trying a new genre. To be quite honest this anime is perfect in terms of mystery, and horror, what more is that they were able to fit all the right concepts of a perfect anime in only 12 episodes.That concludes my review for this anime if you have any criticism to make feel free to pm or just comment with that have a good day and enjoy !!",

            "content": "I have rarely seen Anime series that have truly satisfied me with the gore genre. They usually just overdo it, and not let the audience appreciate the blood-covered action and the bloody scenes. But not with Another (Anime). This has been the first anime that has satisfied me with the action scenes, the gore and the horror side of the story and plot. Though at first the plot formulation was a bit hazy, it got more clearer around the middle and into the ending.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI rated the story a \"Very Good\" only because I was left a bit unsatisfied me with the story itself. Atfirst I had thought that the plot was to end the calamity itself, to finally free the curse of the school. But it somehow got twisted and ended ending the calamity only for that year. It was good, how they made the story so fascinating, unique and so different from the other anime that I have ever encountered. It was certainly made appealing and enticing, that you couldn't just escape it, but watch it until the end. The gore and bloody scenes made you sit at the end of your seats and chew on your nails, while the action scenes made your heart jump at least once or twice while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the formulation towards the plot was made well. There were a bit bumps, yes. But I couldn't have done any better, since it fit so perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOkay, I rated Art a good 10 because the art was just sublime. They detailed everything so well, so perfectly. Everything was made so beautifully. I don't think I've seen any other anime with Art as amazing as Another. It was, as to say, Outstanding. The simple flicker of the lights, the blow of the wind, the waving of the trees to the wind, the character detail, the tiny blotches on the different places. It was all simply outstanding. Everything was drawn and animated so perfectly, I could cry. (No, I'm joking. That was just exaggeration)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nLet's move on to sound. Alright, I am very touchy when it comes to sound, I admit. And I have been looking for the Anime that perfects my score in the \"Sound\" area since I had been watching anime. And lucky me, I have found it. A round of applause to Another yet again. The Opening had been a bit weird when I first started watching Another, but it absolutely fit the anime, making it irresistible to the ears. It was absolutely bone-chilling and made you so-called prepared for the thriller the anime had to give. The sound actually contributed to the cold atmosphere that was probably meant by the animators and producers. From the loud bangs to the drop of a pin, (I'm not saying there are pin-drops in the anime, but it's just a thought I can give you) Another just nailed it to the core. The music never really left sometimes, but it totally added to the hazy and damp atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters weren't really described well and we didn't really figure out what had happened to them, other than their deaths. And other than Misaki Mei and Sakakibara Kouichi, the other characters in the story remained unknown and untouched. But that's what a mystery's all about right? But even though a little was discovered about them, it actually made the anime more appealing and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\r\nIf you want a test of strength, go watch Another now. It won't take anything out except your time and some of your strength. I recommend it to you to watch it during evening, at around midnight. Who knows? It might even turn out fun for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story hasn't totally satisfied me, but I can't say that I didn't enjoy watching it. I wish to tell you all to prepare, for one of the most horrifying, blood-twisting and mind-dulling anime that have yet to blow your minds.\\n\\n\r\nIt was and will always be, a certainly bone-wrenching experience.\\n\\n\r\n\"Feel the Thrill\"\\n\r\n-AnimeRokka18",

            "content": "***This is a Spoiler-Free Review***\r\nBefore reading this review you may wonder, is Another just [Another] horror anime?  Do I have room for [Another] show to marathon?  Can this reviewer get away with [Another] pun before I slap him? And OH MY is that Chihiro Shindou? (major props for anyone who gets that).  Well worry not my friends this review will answer those questions and more.\r\nBefore I proceed any further I must say that after Madoka, I now refer to my former 3-episode rule as \"the Madoka rule\" in that in order to avoid basic *premise* plot spoilers even if you are thesafest online surfer, one should generally adhere to the watching up to the third episode before reading online commentary, or in some cases, before dropping a show.\\n\\n\r\nStory  [7 / 10] - The roller coaster analogy works well to describe the plot of Another.  The beginning (first two episodes) works very well in setting up the premise just like the initial climb of a roller coaster.  After that, we are left with the aftermath of that first initial *drop*  Erm.  Anyway, the momentum built up to that point seems to be able to carry the show pretty well for the most part.  The viewer is left with a pattern each episode, with something that adds to the mystery and solving it, some character development, and what you might be able to call \"fan service\"... the \"punch\" that the viewer is expecting each episode.  Just as one might expect, there are some very creative \"train wrecks\", like Rube Goldberg machines from hell.  The more chaos that is unleashed, the more our heroes try to find the source of the chaos and stop it.  Wait, wasn't there [Another] anime like this involving cicadas?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you read some of the better written, thoughtful reviews of this show, either on this website or on blogs, you'll find that the only real point of contention is with the ending.  You will either love it or hate it.  If you don't marathon it, and are a weekly watcher like myself, you might share my opinion which was \"come on.  Really?  Is that the best you can come up with?\"  The roller coaster runs out of steam, and then to make up for it, seems to just hit the accelerator without stopping, or without adherence to the former speed or pacing.  Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that while something akin to the ending was expected, the ending replaced creepy and mood-based mystery/horror with something of a different genre altogether.\\n\\n\r\n[Another] way to describe the ending would be that you could replace the BGM with the Overture from Carmen (youtube it if you don't know what I'm talking about) and it would transform the show from a horror into a pretty effective dark comedy.  It certainly wasn't meant to be funny, but there were parts during the ending where I actually did laugh (one scene in particular involving a light fixture of sorts...)  Once the chaos ends, you're unfortunately left with a fair amount of questions [such as Why Can't My Little Sister Be This Cute? (as Mei)]  Ahem.  Some really don't have answers, or the answer leaves you stuck in a recursive loop.  Maybe the OVA will explain some things, maybe it won't.  It was likely that it was intentional to leave some things untouched.  However, it might have been as simple as the \"Elfen Lied flashback\"-style fix of adding [another] episode to really make the ending come together.  It's not the unanswered questions that detract from the score, but the way the resolution was handled without really piecing everything together until the last minute.  We're given a few explanations and expected to accept them without question thanks to some hints given both in and out of the show, but parts of the \"mystery solving\" and flashbacks could have likely taken a full episode than 1/3 of one.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation [9/10] - [Another] excellent job by P.A. Works but the credit doesn't just go to them, as there were tons of big name contributors to the Key and In-Between Animation.  Character design and animation are P.A.'s forte of course, but the animation especially in the peak of action is fluid and gorgeous (well as gorgeous as you can find some things to be) and the team is very effectively able to pull off the \"creepy\" factor as well with not only its characters, but its settings, OP/ED animation, dream sequences... Nothing to complain about here.  And we can be sure that the BD version will remove any doubts that they \"held back\".\\n\\n\r\nSound (OST, OP/ED, Voice Acting) [9 / 10] - Would you believe it, [Another] soundtrack composed by the very talented, very multi-faceted Kou Otani.  He is a master of mood tracks, as well as complementing action sequences, and the OST does its job well.  It doesn't have too much replayability outside of watching the anime, but there are some tracks that will clearly remind you of certain scenes when you hear them.\\n\\n\r\nI would just like to say, Animation Studios, I would like to never hear an ALI PROJECT OP/ED ever again.  Please.  Stop it.  A friend seriously commented when he walked into the room and just briefly heard ALI and saw a doll on the TV, \"Is that Rozen Maiden\"?  There is nothing special about the OP song at al, which is a real shame because the OP animation is wonderful.  The ED on the other hand is a great song, but thanks to the pacing of the show, you might throw something at your screen when the ending pops up.  It's interesting to look at how your perspective on the simple ending animation may change as you watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the voice acting.  Well, Abe-san is great of course.  He just fits right into the protagonist role.  Many of the other seiyuu are actually not at all big-name, but Mei's voice actress does a superb job as well, perfectly maintaining her image of mysterious, approachable, and yet socially awkward with a mild dark side.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6 / 10] - [Another] difficult category to rate.  On one hand, the protagonists themselves get a lot of character development.  While there are still aspects of them shrouded in mytery, you get to see the mounting tensions between some of the feature characters, as well as some of the budding relationships between other pairs of characters.  Definitely the main character's relationship with Mei is something to pay close attention to.  Other characters however (including in a couple particular instances, the main characters) function merely as plot devices.  They become disposable and merely a sort of circus act.  That act advances the plot and gives us our daily punchline for sure, but contrasting with a show like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni where stuff actually happens to characters we grow attached to, in Another we don't care as much when something happens to a character we just met that episode, and it becomes more for entertainment purposes than character attachment.  Lastly, especially at the end, some characters remain in character (especially when you imagine their feelings when faced by certain situations) but other characters turn into sort of robots whose programming has gone haywire, and even others are just sort of there for dramatic impact.  Unfortunately that impact isn't as dramatic thanks once again, to the lack of connection we have to those \"NPC\" type characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8 / 10] - Simply put, it's definitely not [Another] horror anime.  Every episode delivers a satisfying dose of mystery, horror, and train wrecks that one can't help but keep watching.  Even more painful when you have to wait a week for [Another] episode, as this does end up being one of those shows that you have  watch more to see what happens next.  In the realm of entertainment, Another definitely performs, even up to the final episodes which depite being questionable from a plot standpoint, are definitely entertaining in one way or [Another].  \\n\\n\r\nOverall (not an average) [7 / 10]: Another is definitely a ride worth taking.  With its outstanding animation, moody OST, great acting, and interesting premise it is definitely different than some of the other horror anime offerings out there.  However it is not without its flaws, but those are only in certain areas, and are still an area of contention among different viewers.  Definitely watch it as it was one of the better offerings in the Winter season despite everything, but it really doesn't hit the ball out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nI even ended the review without making [Another] joke.  Oh wait.",

            "content": "Typically, I write off most horror genre animes as lame attempts at an animated ghost story, however the depth of this one has far exceeded my expectations so far.  Not only has the plot felt thick and sticky with depth as each episode seems to painfully pull away to one layer at a time, but the characters with their own fears play right into the mystery spreading vastly throughout as Kouichi searches for the truths which no one will tell him.  Furthermore, this is not a horror anime without guts, by the 3rd episode it becomes apparent that as the truths become revealedbloodshed will occur (let me tell you its a good final destination one too :D).\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyone that can stomach some blood, and is into mystery / horror genre.  You will be PLEASANTLY suprised and, like me, look forward to every minute of every episode, and wait impatiently for the next release.\\n\\n\r\n@Gamejok3r",

            "content": "This anime is the literally the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life? \r\nThe way they parody the horror genre to such a hilarious level amuses me everytime.\r\nIs Gintama or Carnival Phantasm your favorite anime because they make fun of a serious franchise/genre? Well, then forget those two and watch this!\r\nJust like in everything horror, teenagers die left and right because either logic happens or they're stupid. I think the only time they sort of had some sort of sense was when this one guy had a heart condition and eventually had a sudden heart attack and died but was just \"Get-the-bitch-out-of-the-show-syndrome\" whichis a very common symptom in anime.\\n\r\nBesides, it's not like we could take one of the only deaths that could make sense seriously because they portray that scene perfectly too. \\n\r\nThis show is a comedy that relies on incredibly dark humour so you do need to have a strong stomach to be able to take all the suicide jokes and stupid logic.\\n\r\nMy favorite scene is when a girl slips on the stairs, falls backwards dropping her umbrella and somehow ends up falling forwards and her neck gets impaled with the umbrella because, hey, maybe it's a special umbrella.\\n\r\nThere is one character who is an obvious parody of Sadako Yamamura and is supposed to be the scary female character with dark hair trope.\\n\r\nExcept this time, Sadako is a teenage girl with a fetish for dolls and is portrayed as the creepiest version of Rei from Evangelion whenever she is on screen. Despite how creepy this girl is being portrayed, she is actually the person who saves our male damsel in distress who is clearly supposed to be a gender-bent Bella Swan with a different name.\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, watch this anime if you're into dark and gory humour. Every character is an amazing parody of the teenage archetypes that appear in anything horror and then they also parody the horror genre by making it as anime as possible such as it taking place in a school and contains sociopath females and a Morishige parody.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, how could anyone take this terrible attempt at horror seriously?",

            "content": "It's not easy to write a good horror story. Everything in the genre is done to death, and writing up plot elements that haven't been used before can backfire way more times than they can succeed. This is due to the fact that horror is not a genre that can stand very well on its own, and often needs to lean on other genres to be intriguing. Even horror masterpieces like the Shining movie/novel or the Silent Hill 2 video game are reliant on a thorough understanding of psychology and human behavior, as well as being as mysterious as they are horrifying, if not evenmore so.\\n\\n\r\nHuman behavior is the key to a successful horror story. A lot of horror stories are heavily reliant on simply giving the characters a back story and being done with it, not hesitating on killing them off afterwards, rather than use the fear as an intsrument to develop the characters are make them, well, more human.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Another comes in. Another is heavily reliant on atmosphere to set up its mystery, and this is where the show shines best. It does a marvelous job at sucking viewers in, making them curious about what happens next and adding more and more plot points and subplots to keep things interesting, especially early on in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis slowly but surely backfires as the show progresses, as it becomes very clear that the writers were simply being atmospheric for the sake of being atmospheric and nothing else. The plot contradicts itself on countless occassions, simply to allow itself to advance and this ruins viewer immersion really quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe deaths that happen over the course of the show are probably the most interesting(read:laughable) aspect of it. The deaths happen in the most random fashion, making us treat the character deaths as nothing more than a joke and forget that they are characters. This makes them nothing more than worthless, since we remember how they died better than how they supposedly lived, meaning that they are flat and one note for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe story literally feels in retrospect like it could have been solved in the first episode if everyone was simply talking to one another, and this means that the character interactions are easily the most terrible aspect of the show. The characters do not speak to one another like actual human beings, they speak to one another like monotone robots. Actually, scrap that, that's an insult to robots. Robots at least have a reason to be this monotone, unlike the characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation quality are this show's saving grace, being extremely fluid and beautiful to look at if not outright gorgeous. The backgrounds look fantastic and the colors fit the mood of the show extremely well, meaning that there is a ridiculous number of great shots and eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is something that I can say, it's that this show entertained me, even if for all the wrong reasons. The story kept me mildly interested until the end and the character deaths were hilarious to watch and had me laughing on the floor at one of them.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I advise anyone who has experience with other works in the genre to stay away. The mystery is a mess, the characters are bland and there are as many loopholes as a piece of Swiss cheese the size of the pyramids. \\n\\n\r\nUnless you like stuff like Final Destination or Wrong Turn (ironically or unironically), this show isn't for you.",

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a girl who could not watch horror movies to save her life. Even as her friends invited her along to watch the Mama movie, which was only rated PG 13, she refused to go because even the trailer scared her. Yes, I'm talking about myself. And trust me, I almost left this anime because I thought it was another one of those horror anime with a lot of blood and killing to satisfy the gory desires of people I did not understand.\r\nIf you are like me, a person who does not want to get involved with movies like ParanormalActivity or watch ghosts suddenly appear behind you in a mirror after your shower, STAY! I admit, I almost stopped myself from watching this simply because I was scared that...it might be scary. However, this anime ended up being my favorite (and only) suspense anime so far! Anyway, to the reviews:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. \\n\r\nThe plot is...intriguing. I promise you that you will simply love every moment, every episode of this scene. There are no unnecessary fillers, no unnecessary moments--every scene is filled with clues and mysteries, keeping you on the edge. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story is about a boy named Sakakibara and a girl named Misaki. To not give any spoilers, Sakakibara is a new boy at a cursed classroom. If the curse starts, students and their associated families will die every month--and there is no apparent way to stop the curse. Most of the story, you'll feel like Sakakibara, since you know nothing about the mystery. As Sakakibara learns more, you learn more as well, and the mystery unfolds--why only he can see Misaki, for example. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, have you ever seen an awards show that always did something like, \"The first place winner is...(everyone holds their breath)...will be announced after the commercials!\" This anime is FILLED with those. They are annoying at times, but these moments truly make the story good. You are forced to wait, even though a crucial clue is just at your fingertips. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the answer to this anime is most unexpected. I dare you to try to guess who it is. And you'll see what I'm referring to when you watch the anime, what the protagonists are trying to find.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the anime, even though the beginning was a bit confusing as you soak in the information and environment. There's also a tidbit of romance as well, which is highly implicit. I ship Misaki and Sakakibara so hard, I was a little disappointed when their relationship didn't develop further. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nPretty good. There are so gory, bloody scenes in this, but it's mostly not that bad. There are, however, some scenes of random dolls here and there which have little impact on the story...it's kinda annoying. It's as if the anime makers want you to feel scared, but you don't. Because the dolls are kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nYou will NOT see much character development. Why? Because you don't even know the characters well enough to begin with. The entire 12 episodes is designed to help you understand the characters--therefore, there's no room for development. However, the characters' relations develop quite significantly, and this makes up the story. When people are dying, what's important is how the relationships between friends change. This is accentuated in the last episode where...well, I'll let you find out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nAs I stated before, I loved this anime. It's filled with A LOT of plot twists and turns, and subtle clues to keep you guessing till the very end. There's plenty of action, and plenty of bittersweet moments as well. Furthermore, if you're like me, you will fall in love with Misaki! She is such an interesting character, who can lead the story by herself (she is also the cutest anime girl I've ever seen, even with her eyepatch).\\n\\n\r\nI hope you try this out! This is not a horror anime, mind you, but a mystery one. If you want to be caught by surprise, or if you are looking for an anime that will keep you on the edge, take this anime up and try it.",

            "content": "Humans are despicable creatures. When all is fine and well, they wear smiles on their faces, going around promoting peace and unity. But when a crisis that threatens them arises, don't expect things to remain the same. Friends suddenly become traitors, acquaintances become enemies, and chaos ensues. The human instinct of \"survival of the fittest\" kicks in, eliminating the once supported notion of unity. Blood and tears are shed, with no one to clean up the mess. The once peaceful community will become infested with selfish, cruel animals. The difference is like day and night, black and white. This is what Another tries to depict- the horrible, but true, nature of human beings.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nWhile the artwork itself is not particularly outstanding or excellent, the way some of the scenes transition from one another makes up for it. Camera angles were used skillfully throughout the series - a close-up shot when wanting to draw attention to something and a wide show when wanting to establish a scene. The sheer amount of symbolism used really required the art to be detailed and captivating, and I felt the animation in Another had no problem with that. Character designs and background elements had a good amount of detail in them; barely anything to complain about. Very solid animation, overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, there really isn't much known about the characters. From start to finish, they are more or less kept a mystery from the audience. Their background, hobbies, family, and any other pieces of personal information are not revealed, with the exception of the two protagonists. While this effectively accentuates the \"mystery\" aspect of the show, and prevents viewers from analyzing the characters in order to easily solve the mystery themselves, the consequence is the lack of character development for the side characters. This leads to a lower shock value when these characters end up being part of a significant plot event. But in the case of the main characters, Sakakibara K\u014dichi and Misaki Mei, their characters are developed fairly well throughout the 12 episodes. As the series went on, it was nice to see the two of them slowly open their hearts and grow closer towards each other, and at the same time supporting the other in times of need.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nWhen it comes to horror series, BGM plays a bigger role than usual. If it is unable to set the mood for the scene, the viewer's enjoyment value plummets. Luckily, Another does well in this aspect. The BGM is very noticeable during the suspenseful scenes of the series, enhancing the overall sense of tension in the air. Although there weren't any big name seiy\u016bs involved in this project, I was surprised at how the emotions of the characters were brought out fairly well through their voices. The only setback in this category had to do with the OP. I felt that it wasn't dark enough; it didn't fit the theme of \"horror\" too well. The slow and soft ED, on the other hand, wrapped up each and every episode magnificently. It's soothing melody is perfect for allowing the viewer to slowly absorb everything that has just been thrown at them.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nHaving often been compared to horror masterpieces like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Shiki, it's not like Another has a unique story. But while this may be true, the approach it takes using the plot of \"a strange boy in a strange town\" is what separates it from the other two. While I do admit to having lost faith in this series during the first half due to the seemingly predictable pattern the story was progressing in, I'm glad I stuck with it to the end. In a way, the slightly disappointing first half helped to lower my expectations for the second half, which ended up being both captivating and shocking. The story as a whole had a good sense of realism to it, making it all the more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAnother is undoubtedly more psychological than bloody. Each flashback, event or action almost always has a hidden meaning that is crucial to the series as a whole. Because of this, it's re-watch value is very high. I found Another to be one of the best shows of the season; the right elements came together to create a captivating story, full of twists and turns. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short and interesting psychological thriller.",

            "content": "Another is a 12-episodes-long horror/gore/mystery anime from the Winter season of 2012. It was directed by Tsutomu Mizushima and the two main characters are voiced by Atsushi Abe and Natsumi Takamori.\r\nIn the start, a very intense horror atmosphere is created and it hints that this show would be quite scary, but that is destroyed in the third episode when it becomes a full-blown gore. Also, the mystery feels incomplete by the end, the reason for everything that is happening is never fully explained and some aspects are ridiculously convenient, for example: if Mei, one of the protagonists, didn\u2019t have her power, it would be neighimpossible for the class 3-3 to end their situation \\n\\n\r\nThere are some decent stuff. As any mystery, Another has red herrings, quite a lot of them, and they are mostly decently presented. It manages to keep the viewer interested and entertained, despite its problems. The story had a lot of potential, the premise was great, but it all falls flat in the middle and goes downhill because of bad pacing, the lack of discoveries about the reason that all of supernatural stuff happens and the general stupidity of most of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the worst part of the anime. The only character to receive a bit of development was Mei and most of the other characters are completely bland and forgettable, I can\u2019t remember the name of anyone apart the two protagonists. Also, they are really stupid, in a lot of moments everything would have worked out if they talked to each other and tried to understand what was happening as a group, this is particularly evident in the last two episodes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are two things that were really good: the visuals and, strangely, the gore. Another is incredibly pretty, very detailed, the animation is very fluid and the style not only suits the setting, but also goes a great way to create the atmosphere. The gore, in a very twisted way, is enjoyable (I feel really bad and strange about writing this), some morbid part of you actually likes it, as it is nicely presented and has real punch. Sometimes it is ridiculous, but it always is very imaginative and twisted.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the times the soundtrack is brilliantly used to set the atmosphere, but sometimes it is terrible. At one point, I laughed during what should have been a very tense scene because it had a very badly time track that just broke the tension.\\n\\n\r\nAnother begins creating an incredible horror and mystery atmosphere, but does nothing with incredible potential and ends up disappointing. But even with all that was bad, I greatly enjoyed watching it and felt intrigued by its premise (this is what made me continue watching it).\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a series with very good gore or just eye-candy, watch it. Don\u2019t watch it expecting great characters, a masterfully executed story, good supernatural elements or a satisfying mystery.",

            "content": "Another!\r\nIt's Another horror anime! \r\nThose who watch this show will usually be split into three camps! The first camp claims that this show is great since it has an amazing atmosphere. The art, the soundtrack, and the animation, all of it just screams SPOOKYYYY!!! \r\nThe second camp shakes its head, calls the first camp a filthy casual, and claims that this show is a shitty horror story! They claim that there is no logic whatsoever in the mystery, and that the characters act incredibly stupidly, as if they are simply letting themselves be killed without making any progress in solving the mystery. \r\nThe third campsimply bitch slaps both of them and claims that Another is quite possibly the most hilarious show ever to grace the medium. After all, some of these death scenes are just completely outrageous. Sometimes I don't know if these scenes are supposed to be taken seriously or as a joke, and the third camp takes it as the latter. \\n\\n\r\nSo which camp is correct? Well, I'll be that guy and say that they are all correct! Another is a highly atmospheric well executed illogical piece of comedy. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched this show for the first time, I was scared shitless! I've always been scared of horror movies, and even though horror anime aren't really scary, I was still unable to sleep. Upon finishing it, I was soooo proud of myself! I thought I had just gone through the best horror anime ever created!\\n\\n\r\nBut now, since the Another death scenes are in almost every Anime vines or Anime crack video, I don't even know if Another should be considered a horror anymore. Yes, the scenes are really brutal, but when you take it into context... it's outrageous. Why did this character die like that? What the hell?\\n\\n\r\nAnother is simply a show to watch for the brutality. The mystery may be interesting, but the way it tries to solve the mystery leaves much to be desired. The story may be thrilling, but when you think about it, it's also pretty stupid. The characters are... ok? Mei gives off a very mysterious vibe, but over time, she just becomes a Kuudere version of Rikka. The MC is pretty unique in the sole fact that he actually wants to solve the mystery, but really, he just wants to. He doesn't really even try.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a thriller mystery with actual substance, Higurashi is still your best bet! The deaths actually have meaning and contribute to the story, and it's even got more comedy than Another. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Final Destination is my favorite Smash bros stage.\\n",

Basically it doesn't leave a gripping memory you would expect \r\nStory 4/10 Decent but Meh\r\nThe plot isn't that fancy or its not something that quickly hooks you on. Its okay to begin with the story does turn around and twist allot however its still very meh i cant rate this plotanything more than a 4 it feels so recycled the whole school class horror genre is to be fair getting over used\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that another tends to cover for its lacklustre plot is its art. Being only 12 episodes short another does actually have well drawn out well illustrated artworks. The characters appear clear and non fuzzy the background including trees and cars ,houses etc does look quite good. If your a fan of death note type art work then another is in that sort of level \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is okay nothing new goes well with the scenery  i usually don't pay attention to the sound but it was okay \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nVery forgettable characters none that quite grab your attention most seem boring and rather bland the main character K\u014dichi Sakakibara is rather naive and quite timid. To be honest you don't remember any characters who connected with you as a viewer \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nLike i stated before this anime isn't horror you would barley noticed you watched this series after you watch many other anime's \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for something to kill time or simply bored i guess another is an anime that would do the trick bland,timid,unoriginal , and nothing fancy\\n\r\ni found this series rather poor but that's just me\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, this one was gory.\r\nAt first I was pretty sceptical of the horror part of the story. I only watch anime from time to time, and as an outsider, even though this one has a really dark and kind of creepy atmosphere, that's as far as it goes. The horror element in this series is mostly blood and brutal violence, and while that can make some people flinch, it didn't work for me, (I was kind of forced to let all that go because of my best friend, the scary movie maniac.)\r\nAnyway, this story is about a boy, who moves to a new town, andeverything is of course not fine and dandy. He meets a girl with an odd appearance, and begin in a new school. There is just a slight problem, the class seem to be cursed.\\n\r\n(Insert spooky noise here)\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this anime isn't the artwork, which is really good along with the music, but the characters and the pacing of the story. After a while, you get used to whats happening, and it's really hard to care when not only the side characters, but also the main characters, are very hard to understand. They all seem pretty dull at times, and we don't get much explored about their personalities. I also wish the story would move on in a different tempo, it's WAY too slow, except for a few actionfilled moments. The ending (No spoilers! :D) are actually pretty awesome though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend to give it a watch, there is nothing particulary bad about it even though it's not that amazing either. And even if some things don't work, it definatly have a very creepy tension, that I found quite enjoyeble. \\n\\n\r\n(And apologies for any spelling mistakes in advanced.)",

The main character is the cliche orphan transfer student who moves to the mysterious small town and gets caught up in the middle of the trouble. He attends school in a classroom with a paranormal mystery to it, where you must follow certain rules or mysterious deaths will occur, as they do every year since a strange incident many years ago. He meets a quiet, sad girl from his class andtogether they slowly see the mystery unfold. \\n\\n\r\nViolence and blood come at unexpected times and the strangest of accidental deaths occur. It has a Sixth Sense feel to it in terms of \"what is happening?\" and \"what is real and what isn't\" and definitely in regards to a surprise ending. A delightfully dark story that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. The beginning song is interestingly eerie and matches the creepiness and darkness fairly well but is confusingly psychotic and upbeat. The ending song is very pleasant and nice to listen to with a brilliant vocalist and soft piano. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like dark murder mysteries with tragedy and a twist ending then this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nPlease take a look at my favorite characters and watched animes and send me any recommendations please. I'm always looking for my next fix.",

            "content": "Another is a satisfyingly bloody little cup of anime. There is a haunting atmosphere, a refreshing plot resolution and kids dying gruesome, gory deaths. What more do you want?\r\nStory: Clueless transfer student lands smack in the middle of a cursed classroom where the unlucky students and their family are dying in horrifically inventive ways. And you thought your failing math test scores were the worst thing that could happen\u2026 \r\nNow, the story has some very good points and some not so good points. It gets cookies made of sparkly awesomeness for producing twists that keep up the interest, letting the characters do stuff that isunexpected, pulling the rug from beneath the viewer\u2019s feet in sudden delight and generally keeping up a creepilicious atmosphere throughout the whole.  It never reaches top score due to the fact that in order to have these plot twists make sense it sometimes needs to give real flimsy excuses, aka pulling shit out if its ass. Not that it detracts much, in a show like this, it\u2019s the body count that matters and this anime delivers gore in bucketfuls. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nSakakibara the transfer student is the main character we follow for the majority of screentime but it is essentially the whole cursed class interacting together that makes the show shine. Alone, Sakakibara is just your everyday joe but since every other character adds a little something to every action and conversation they have together it snowballs into giving everybody depth. Now, since this is a \u201cwhodunit\u201d show I won\u2019t analyse the characters because much of their evolution hinges on spoilers. Wait for it, they are very fun to be around. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis show is straight up scenery porn, the backgrounds are simply jaw-dropping. Everything looks sleek and clean and motions are fluid. There are a couple of weird frames here and there but keep those eyes on the porn\u2014the scenery porn that is, don\u2019t go thinking dirty thoughts now. \\n\r\nAbout the only nitpicky complaint I have is the character design. Why the frak do they all look 5 years old, even 30 year old adults included? A more realistic design would have lifted this up to a perfect score. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe music really sets the tone here. It is creepy and spooky and perfectly keyed to crucial moments. It knows when to play and when to stop. Me gusta. \\n\r\nOP: A lot of dismembered dolls and deliciously creepy scenes set to a gothicky jpop tune.\\n\r\nED: boring ballad and a still picture that just screams red\u2014pun intended\u2014herring. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nThis was immensely enjoyable and quite gory. Starts slow, builds up carefully and just explodes in the end. Recommended for all who liked the Ring. \\n",

Add in a little mystery, a creepy curse, ghostly dolls, and a very weird bird, and you will haveAnother.

Can't always have it both ways, you know? \\n\\n\r\nIf you've got the itch for ghosty-school-curses, eye patch wearing girls with a pretty eerie collection of dolls, and the chance to see character after character get killed off in a bloody fashion, then you can't do wrong by giving Another a chance.",

            "content": "\"Another\" is a modern classic of Japanese horror, although not everyone liked it because of the many controversial points. I will not dwell on the plot, since it has already been described with an abundance of details. Undoubtedly the story starts as a horror, a horror intent on the atmosphere of mystery, from the return that instead of solar to return to the country where your mother was born turns out to be full of doubts, of fog because nobody wants to explain what is there that does not go and why. We then move on to the mystery linked to the strange girl who,undeniably, turns out to be an interesting and attractive character. But then the mists thin out, a solution seems to have been found and zac, it turns into the purest splatter and seems to be in an American horror movie, with the class of high schoolers cruelly to exterminate! Not to mention the ending, with the absurd fire, made even more absurd by the behavior of the characters who, for eleven episodes have endured adversity with a stoicism worthy of a Greek philosopher and then now become hysterical murderers ready to slaughter anyone even though was he innocent to reduce the list of suspects? And then the question that I can't help but ask myself: \"But wouldn't it have been better to put ours in another section and finish it there, if you weren't willing to tell him the truth right away?\" This is just a brief examination of the reasons why these souls may not have met many, since they start well but then lose themselves at least a little on the street. The satisfaction is therefore very subjective and, personally, I find that the work is valid and certainly not overrated. Even the final fire, which many disliked to me, seemed interesting in its own way, were it not for the adrenaline it transmits. The characterization of the characters is really good, touching and causing sorrow to those who will disappear. Although the best character will undoubtedly be given by the mysterious co-star. The graphics are good and the direction taken care of. The good opening, somewhat reminiscent of \"Rozen Maiden\". The sweet and wonderful ending is truly unforgettable, it seems a hymn to adolescence and to the desire that the friendship born on the school desk can last forever, even if the cruel fate, in fact, will make it impossible.\\n\r\nAn intriguing and interesting anime, the ending disappoints a little, but it remains an excellent anime. It is not a deep soul with a moral, so if you are looking for such an anime passed on, if instead you like thrillers this anime is perfect.\\n\r\n\u00a0If at first the deaths could be justified by the curse, they are absolutely ridiculous, and they deviate from the plot, in the final, which in fact is inconclusive and leaves with more doubt than anything else; in fact I had to go and look elsewhere for an explanation of the ending, which otherwise is very incomplete and not at all understandable.",

After yhegruesome death of one of his friend and a nurse of the hospital kouichi suddenly felt that his classmates ates are now ignoring him.Even the teachers.\\n\r\nKouichi meets with mei and comes to know about a incident that took place 26 years ago in the class 3-3.A Student misaki yomiyama died due to some reason.Overyone being too much attached to the student could not accept the loss of the student.Suddenly a student remarked that he could see misaki sitting on a bench.It was obviously an attempt to makeup for the loss of their friend.In the graduation day the principal himself arranged for a chair for misaki.But in the Graduation photo a pale picture of misaki appeared and it was the instigator for the calamity.\\n\r\nFrom every year there was a series of death due to this  phenomenon.No one could stop it.Every year there was an extra .The extra was non living and of the same class.The records were altered so the minds of the people making it impossible to determine the extra.\\n\r\nTelling the rest of the story would cater your interest to watch it.So find the rest out of your own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was good and excellently executed.However the character of the story were not vey prominent to me.Specially the character of Kouichi.Inspite of the male centre character I feel there was nothing heroistic in his activities.He was not taken the role of the prime central character.To me he was the mere onlooker of the events going on and taking steps on others footsteps lacking the minimum sense to do something of his own.To me Mastunaga was  the most important person the anime but his role was not that pronounced. Izumi Akazawa was a good character but was a prey to the calamity.\\n\r\nNo permanant solution could be availed at the last which was the prime flaw.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall it is really a good watch.If you are comfortable for blood and ferocious death scenes you can give it a watch.",

            "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS\r\nAnother is the first anime I've watched that's straight up focused around horror, not built up for like fight scenes or anything, so I don't think that I'm the best judge for this genre as it's not usually something I watch but again this is just my opinion. Another began in a very eerie setting, a small town that apparently had something up that nobody would discuss in the open. This is good for the genre and gives a good sense of immersion. The sense of dread that unfolds due to the curse placed on the class is done well, it creates panic betweenthe character. The characters, however, have very little background given to most of them. Sure, we know a little about what some of them like to do, but that's about it. I have no idea if this was intentional, but I think that the back story of more of the main characters should've been given some light just to give more attachment to them. I think that the random flashes of dolls at the first few episodes were pretty unnecessary, since they don't play part into anything of extreme importance. I also think that the past interaction between Sakakibara and Akazawa with the can was completely unnecessary. Finally, the last episode seemed very scattered. Again, this is another good anime that I think would be better with 24 episodes and left at that rather than 12. I also know some of the characters were introduced only in the anime and not in the novel, such as Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Mei Misaki\\n\r\nThough I'm not really given many options, Mei stood out to me because of her horror story personality. I like how she doesn't care about the rain, doesn't like cell phones, and generally doesn't mind people ignoring her for the \"greater good\". Maybe I just like her because she's like one of the two characters given actual character though.",

It feels like watching a high  quality horror film with enough run time to make you feel nothing was rushed. \r\nStory is quite good and the mystery remains through-out the show. Even in retrospect there were very few hints that foreshadowed the events. No matter what you're likely to be surprised multiple times as you watch it.\r\nArt and Sound are high quality, no complaints there. I felt like the scenery was especially well done. Really detailed. \r\nCharacters were good, though with the cast being as large as it is, most remain underdeveloped. Which is fine however, asfurther development would be unnecessary for the show. We get to know people just enough to care about their fate, but not enough to get overly attached and throw the balance of the cast out the window.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was good and there was something of note in each episode.

            "content": "First of all, I only considered watching this cause I want to see something Horror in anime. This as the cause gave me low expectations about the Anime. Although I don't think I am wrong I still think it doesn't give the Horror vibe I've been searching for. But please don't misunderstand, I am not saying it is bad at all it's just that I think it goes over into the Suspense or Mystery more. In my opinion, it resembles the Final Destination movies a whole lot. Like the sudden but slow deaths in it. I mean it's like telling me, \"This Character will diein less than 1 minute.\" or something and then I'd say, \"Oh, ok... so that character will die... but how, in what way will that Character Die?\" That question does incite some intrigue just enough to put me on the edge of my seat. LoL.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---STORY: 8\\n\r\nAs I said before it's like a Final Destination movie cut into episodes so there shouldn't have been much to the story. Well... It actually is more than that although still kinda basic. The story is set upon mostly how will Sakakibara, Kouichi & *company* solve a certain kind of mystery. Simply speaking, that certain How was what made me curious of watching the next upon next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOpinion: Good.\\n\\n\r\n---ART: 9\\n\r\nThis kind of Animation (For Me) is definitely one of the greatest! Specifically the one P.A. Animation does. If I would rate them animation studios #1 would've definitely been P.A. and with like and in 2nd Kyoto Animation. Ok so back to the Anime review. The Art is portrayed very well in a way that it should have scared me IF* I watched it by myself at night. It gave a realistic feel whilst staying true to Anime. The Death scenes though were quite unreal like, \"How did the blood spray reach that far!?\" and the characters look like... say, characters in a make your own anime avatar but you can only change the hair/accessories but I guess you could say that to most anime.\\n\\n\r\nOpinion: Great!\\n\\n\r\n---Sound: 6\\n\r\nThe BGM or Sound Effects were so-so. They were put at the almost perfect time to match the mood. Why a 6? That's because even though the songs did match the mood, they didn't give out the feels as opposed to some popular ones from Movies like Jaws or Scream etc. The sound effects also seem recycled, like hearing the same stabbing sound in every murder anime you would have watched. As for the OP & ED, I think the OP is good and fits the anime quite well. And as for the ED, I don't know if they tried to make something emotional like Angel Beats' ED but no, it just doesn't work out like that. All in all sound/music is good but definitely not one to remember.\\n\\n\r\nOpinion: Fair.\\n\\n\r\n---Character: 8 (Roundabout Spoilers)\\n\r\nI think the character development was pretty well done. Only part of what that could do was make you say \"WTF!?\" when someone dies. That feeling of getting close to someone for the first time then after some seconds he/she dies. Yes, that's how I felt but also got sad at the last episode about Akazawa Izumi. The Characters themselves aren't just like Student Council President with a crush on MC or something like that, it's something Deeper.\\n\\n\r\nOpinion: Very Good.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\nKyaaa~! Ahhh~! Nooo~! Hiyaaa~!\\n\r\nOk, well that 9 came from watching the series a 2nd time. The 1st time I watched it was at broad daylight on my SGSIII at public places. (No, it wasn't because I was scared. Really) The 2nd time was with my friends using our Projector at night. You might have guessed that they were easily scared. Well all I could say was it was a fun night, can't beat those Expressions!\\n\\n\r\nOpinion: Great!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.00000008\\n\r\nIt is, without a doubt, a Great Anime overall. What I found instead of the Horror was the joy of watching this anime. Something I'd definitely recommend to people who like Suspense/Mystery/Horror or Random, Unexplainably-Explainable Deaths.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and another great \"Thank You!\" to a certain someone who got me motivated! Please say any problems you have with the Review as a comment in my profile or as a PM. Again, thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nCause it seemed like a certain character was cutting the review, I have rewritten the review and triple checked the contents. I don't think there is any spelling/grammar errors left and it is now officialy complete.",

            "content": "*Everybody who reads this: PLEASE understand that this is my opinion, and even though you might not agree, I have an opinion too, and I would like it to be respected, just how you expect to have your opinion respected. Just because I thought that something was better than you thought or worse than you thought, doesn't mean that I did a \"Bad review\". If I did a \"Bad Review\" than I wouldn't have cared to make a review in the firstplace. Also, I can understand if I might have said something that offended you, upset you, or whatever, but I literally can't quite helpthat. I certainly can make a review that deserves \"Constructive Criticism\", but I certainly don't intend on EVER making a \"Bad Review\" of anything. Anyway, rant over. Onto another review.\\n\\n\r\nAnother, hmm, well this anime is not really that great. I am not even joking. It literally made me want to punch the creators for basically doing what they did, but also have to restrain myself, because some parts of this anime were actually decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a kid who came back to the town he grew up in, after medical problems cause him to need a better environment. Anyway, its all fine and dandy until the second episode or third episode, I don't remember which, because it didn't leave that much of an impression. That was when the first person was systematically murdered for some reason, and then I find out there is some kind of \"Force\" behind the fact that there are a certain number of people in the class, as opposed to another.... What? that is just confusing as hell, and whats worse, the girl with the eye patch apparently is that \"extra student\", for some reason, and the main character talks to her, and then he gets ostracized by the rest of the class.... I don't know. I wasn't able to follow the story. The real \"extra\" person you find out is actually a bit of a surprise, but also isn't, if you really think about it. (Yes, I will tell that much: The real \"extra\" person is technically not her)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was probably the best aspect of this, and even that isn't that great. For a more modern anime, it certainly isn't the best, but some of the explosions and other things like that did look more realistic at times. The blood and gore were okay looking, but they didn't leave an impression. Basically, when someone died, I am not surprised at how much blood and gore are there, but with actually how they died being. There was only one death that actually looked pretty cool, while also being disturbing, and it actually isn't one of the students. (Not much of a spoiler, but still one I guess.) \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't really much of a spectacle. I wasn't impressed by it. The opening song, closing song, etc. It just didn't give that much of an impression, nor was it horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, by far, the worst aspect to it. You mostly get the different tropes that are within a typical school setting, for the most part, and there is not much more exploration into the anime about it, but it did have a couple characters that stood out. The class representative (Red-haired chick. Dont remember her name) and the main character, but even then, they were just not that interesting. Until the first death, there really wasn't much bad with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I kinda enjoyed this anime, but at the same time, I had to realize that it really wasn't good and decent is the best I can really give it.

The story led me in but the sub-events captivated me more.\r\nMei Misaki, is she dead? Is she a ghost? Is she an illusion? The answer to these questions was something I never would have thought of and it honestly made me laugh when we find answers. Laugh because it was just funny, not laugh because it was just plain stupid. Once I found the answer to that question, the rest of the anime seemed dull, but not dull enough to stop me watching.\r\nDid I enjoy the wildride? Yeah. For sure. Do I enjoy dolls? No. Not at all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like death and dolls.....\\n\\n\r\nThis review is simple - To me personally, the thriller comes into play but I know for most it is just childs play and superstition which doesn't necessarily mean it isn't enjoyable. I recommend watching it if you are up for a lot of death and simplistic, but not boring, story lines.",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers\r\nThis is as subjective as your opinion is,also there's a lot of unfunny things that may disappoint you,I'm not funny,ok?\r\nWell,let's go to the point.\r\nStory-6\r\nAnother's a horror story which tells you about a curse on a highschool,this kind of stories really appeal me,even though,they can be stupid or complete shit but they're still enjoyable,that'd be the case of Another.\r\nThe premise's settled on a japanese highschool (oh,what a twist...) there was a student called Misaki on the 9-3 classroom that was intelligent,kind,athletic,he was like jesuscrist came back,but we all know that he wasn't the luckiest guy ever and Misaki isn't not the expection,hedies on a fire shocking all his classroom in such a way that they act like he didn't die,this doesn't work as well as they could think,because when they take the classroom photo,they can see the ghost of his partner.\\n\r\nThe story starts 26 years later of this incident,our main character,Kouichi Sakakibara,transfer to this school,he fells that atmosphere on his class it's creepy,and there's a secret that his mates haven't tell him about,he finds a mysterious girl on the hospital,Misaki Mei,that anyone seems to see.\\n\r\nThe story's well developed,the pacing is appropiate because it continous in such a way that it's not predictable and that's a reallt good point of the show,making the story having a bit of complexity,but the main problem with another it's the time and distribution of the plot.\\n\r\nThe anime has only 12 episodes and it's very slow on develops its plot and even there're some filler episodes and scenes (the beach one,for example).This is a problem if the amount of time that you have it's little,and that issue it's very clear at the end,which is very rushed.\\n\r\nA very important part of this show is the shock factor,shown on the deaths of the students and their relative ones (beacuse of the curse).The deahts are kind of predictable and with gore,handeled on the same way like the ones of \"Final Destination\",stupid and with gore.\\n\r\nThe problem that I told before,about the time,affect the conclusion,it's anti-climatic and rushed and without the visual it will be very bad.The deaths were funny and on this time of series ypu can't afford this to happen,I have to cry no to laugh when someone dies,even tohugh,it manages to end piecing most of the things together.\\n\r\nIn conclusion,I like the premise and how the story develops at first but the narrative became really slow and the end was anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation-10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was made by P.A Worka,known by other works like Angel Beats,Shirobako or Charlotte.\\n\r\nAnother looks gorgeous,the character designs are flawless and well detail,with Misaki Mei ones standing out,even though,some extra mates can be rather generic.\\n\r\nBackgrounds are beautiful,they 're very well detail making everything feel more real,the colours are very well chose and helps you to be inmersed on the story.\\n\r\nThe animation it's fluid,the camera angles,rotation and planes are great,giving the story a feel of realism,making you think that you're actually there.\\n\r\nAlso,the animation it's good on the killing scens for gore fans out there.\\n\r\nSo,on this part there's nothing to complain.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\\n\r\nIn this kind of story,the ost doesn't take an outstanding role,it's there to exalt the scenes and it kind of gets it,the sound aspect it's smotheing very subjective so,if you want,listen to acouple of themes,anyway,I think it's accomplish it job but I don't tink it's amazing,it's not bad or anything it's only above average and it's nice.\\n\r\nThe opening is atrocious,the visuals are good but I really hate the song.\\n\r\nThe ending is forgettable.\\n\r\nThe voice acting it's ok,nothing to stand out,it's done correctely and that's all.\\n\r\nThe sound of little things or details it's where the sound shines giving you a sense of tension and danger like the noise of the steps of the wood,so it's great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the weakest point of the show,being a cast of generic characters.\\n\r\nThe anime failed on making the most od the credible,making have any kind of feeling to them,where its obvious at the end where most of them die and you don't even know who are they or care about them because you see them 1 minute on the screen.\\n\r\nAnyway,the let's talk about some of them (the most important)\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Mei: She's the co-protagonist and only character that actually develop on the serie,she corresponds to the Rei Ayanami type,\"the doll girl\",however,she's the most interesting character of the serie,she got develop in such a way that they show her past and the mystery arround her,so she's without a doubt the most interesting character on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSakakibara Kouichi:He's the protagonist,he's your typical bland character,he's not completly awful in way that you want to kill him (I'm looking at you,Yukki) but he's boring.You get his backdrop shown but he hasn't any development through the series,which it's a big mistake with him,because this is not a comedy,it's a tragic story where people die and is they die,it shoul affect you in anyway but at the end of the serie it seem that's like it hasn't passed such a story.\\n\\n\r\nAkazawa Izumi: she's kaichou-chan,one of the most important supporting character,because her job is to handel the curse of her class,so seeing what happened,she didn't do a greay job...She's a tsundere,she likes the main character because some events on the past,there's no development on her and you won't see her backdrop.\\n\\n\r\nTeshigawara Naoya: He's the main character friend and follows every clich\u00e9 and stereotype that you can see anywhere,there's not development of him,things happens to him because he's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing you should know it's that the main character's aunt it's interesting and you should keep an eye on her.\\n\r\nWhat I feel with the cast it's there and because it's there things happens to them,it's not horrible but it's sterotypical and forgettable,at the end of the day,you won't care of them.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end,another it's an enjoyable show,it's not horror but it didn't pretendent to,even though,it's labeled as horror,ir's not scarry,there're not sick chasing or jumpscares.It's more focused on tell you story.It's intelligent and engaging,at times,with great technical aspects,but the pacing,narrative and character are the most important issues.\\n\\n\r\nPS:I enjoy the show,I don't think I can rank enjoy beacuse it doesn't afect the show and unless I fucking hate it and feeling insulted,It wouldn't count to rank to me,so that's all I have to say about to say.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like mystery stories,you should give it a shot,if you're specting to be scared this's not a show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6",

            "content": "Another is an anime with a LOT going for it. We open the show through a young man named Sakakibara, who has moved in with his grandparents/aunt now that his father (an archeologist) is out of Japan. This means that Sakakibara has to transfer to Yomi Yama North, the local high school, and while there he meets a mysterious young woman with an eye patch. One that the rest of the class doesn't seem to know exists.\r\nIt's hard to go into the plot without fear of spoilers, so I'm going to have to be as vague as the show was - and that KILLED me.The show is a mystery-one, where as the viewer (and the characters) solve one problem, there's another, greater problem lying just beneath it. The problem with this is that it takes FOREVER for them to start. Approximately four episodes are spent solving the mystery of eye patch girl (Misaki Mei) and having the extended cast dodge the question. Whenever Sakakibara asks a question, the other students just look around nervously and give some vague reason as to why they can't answer. AND HE LETS IT GO. Where's the drive? Where's the need to solve this mystery? Why is Sakakibara so passive about this? You might be seeing a ghost or something and you're just gonna let it pass by? What the hell is that?\\n\\n\r\nOther than the shows \"taking forever to get to the point\"edness, Another is an intriguing, entertaining anime. The main thing pushing the show is the mystery and the atmosphere - and boy, Another has some GREAT atmosphere. The surrounding environments are realistic, yet bleak - even a stereotypical beach episode isn't light and bright and airy. The sky is grey, there are no bird calls, and the beach is abandoned, save for our cast. It really hits home the feeling of dread that fills the students, as well as the tension.\\n\\n\r\nMy only other gripe is some of the detailing in the final episode, but that's not enough to deter from this show. If you're looking for a good mystery and don't mind some blood (i.e. tons of blood), then Another is a solid show. Nothing that special, but solid.",

The first few episodes did an amazing job of introducing the cast and presenting several bizarre and unsettling elements in a way that reminded me of Twin Peaks.\r\nI had really high expectations after experiencing such an interesting first part, but then Another did something I feel supernatural mystery/horror series should never do, and chose to answer most of the bizarre mysteries that got me hooked on the show in the first place,failing to present any new ones after that. Then it paved the way to becoming something akin to Final Destination, where all that was left was watching lots of bizarre deaths with little to no real mysteries or uncertainties involved. That seriously hampered my enjoyment of the series, as I felt like they had really nailed the ominous and paranoid atmosphere at first.\\n\\n\r\nJudging the series as a whole, I'd say it's good if you want to watch some horror, but not so much if you want to be scared by supernatural or unknown things rather than grisly death scenes and nothing else.",

            "content": "Back in 2011, I was looking to the upcoming 2012 anime seasons...and to be honest, it looked bleak...but there was one gem that caught my attention and that was Another. There's a pretty good reason though, Mystery Anime + Horror/Slasher + P.A. Works (Producer of Angel Beats, my personal favorite anime) = MUST WATCH!\r\nSo, I did, and I must say, it lived up to the expectations. \r\nPositives\r\nThere are a lot of positive things I can say about this anime. What I loved most about it was the dramatic suspense the writers created with the situations and scenarios they placed the characters into. I felt genuinelyafraid for each character because it felt like any one of them could die at any moment. The character building between the two leads (Sakakibara and Misaki) was really well done. While I'm sure some would call Sakakibara a fairly dull character, he felt extremely relateable to me. He was a character that for the most part, was able to keep his calm under pressure...and I think his prior situations revolving around death had a lot to do with his personality. I also have to say the twists that this anime created were absolutely fantastic. I really could not see many of them coming even though I did semi-predict early on in the series what needs to happen to end the curse. Even the situations early on in the anime had me guessing and for the most part, guessing wrong. Even the final twist in this anime I never saw coming and I loved how this anime explained the subtle hints that were there all along but brushed them off because they didn't feel important. The music in this anime was absolutely fantastic and matched the tone of the anime perfectly. In fact, I thought the WORST song of this anime was actually the opening. The ending credits in my opinion, was one of the best I've ever seen. The imagery, the music, everything about the ending was just gorgeous. Perhaps the best dynamic of this anime was how it portrayed death. Trust me, this wasn't an anime where character falls over and slowly slumbers into death. This anime is gory, its graphic, and there is nothing beautiful or heartwarming about how the characters die. Blood curdling gasps of final breaths, muscle spasms of those passing into death, it all felt extremely realistic. The producers of this anime had a strong grasp of what happens when someone goes through a violent, painful death. To top it all off, I believe this anime had a very satisfying ending as well. It wasn't too happy, it wasn't too sad, they did enough to conclude this anime completely and left enough open where they could expand upon the story. Although, that does lead me to my negatives...\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\nWhile I did believe the story for Another was really good, they left a few things untouched. For example, why this \"curse\" even exists in this town. Now, approximately halfway through this anime, a character (I can't remember who) did explain that this curse \"was natural in Yomiyama. It's much like how typhoons and earthquakes are natural anywhere else.\" I didn't really buy that. As the viewer, we know sort of how this curse came along with the student 24 years prior dying suddenly and the class pretending that that student was still alive. However, it didn't really explain as to why that class is cursed, why this event takes place, how it even came to be. Or what causes the dead to come back to life and manipulate the memories of those around them. If there was some backstory about how someone cursed the town, the school, the class, whatever, I might buy it. However, we had nothing. Just the \"natural\" causes. I really don't care who you are, that's not natural, I'm sorry, its not. Another negative about this anime in my opinion was the character building between Sakakibara and his classmates. It was difficult to get emotionally invested in a lot of the classmates. One classmate does die early on and I think the creators were supposed to make us feel like we should be invested in that character, I had a hard time doing it. I had a hard time getting invested in Akazawa and she's probably the 3rd most important character in this whole anime. Toward the end of the series, I started to understand it a bit and feel for her character, but for the most part, she just felt like another pawn in this series. I do believe the short length of this anime had something to do with that...but hey, Angel Beats was short and I was still able to get invested in the characters of that anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWhile I did elaborate a bit more on the negatives, don't take them too seriously. This series is great in every aspect. I'm not a big horror/slasher fan but I do enjoy a good, paranormal mystery by one of my favorite anime studios out there. I guarantee you that this anime will have you making wrong guess after wrong guess as to what is going to happen next. I had a very hard time seeing what was going to happen or who was going to die next. Nevertheless, I've never enjoyed being wrong so many times moreso than I did watching this anime. Even if you are not a fan of this genre, it still might be worth the watch.",

Watch it and you'll see.\r\nI first discovered the anime when I was in an overnight gaming session in one of my city's internet cafe. I just didn't have anything to do so I went and looked for an anime - found this one - and decided to watch it due to the great comments. And I was hooked. You know the feeling of being totally surprised, mystefied, scared and creeped out? That's how it felt watching the anime.A couple of episodes was already released back then so when I finished watching those, I immediately had my clock scheduled to what day the episodes was going to be released. The mystery and the lack of it (because I was just wanting to see the episodes until the end) was killing me.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only a few good horror animes out there; Shiki, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and finally, Another.",

I want to rip out my audio source every time I hear the squeaky female vocalist \"sing\" over the most weeaboo of all sounds ever. Christ, why is it over two minutes long??? Moving on.\r\n     The first shot is actually a gorgeous depiction of a serene lake. Pretty rad to be honest. And the characters were detailed enough, so whateva. The plot took a long ass time to develop, and the anime as a whole was slower than I would have liked. The first death camein episode three, and that shit made me laugh. These crazy Japanese! ^_^ #KAWAI Deaths were in about every episode after that, and I found my self impatiently waiting for another character to die off, because the stuff in between was not sufficient in quenching my thirst for entertainment. I almost stopped on episode 8, but it was reccomended to me that I continue. Holy McPiss nuggets I am glad I powered through. It went from a Prius to a Miata in terms of enjoyment! These niggas are crazy, but it made for one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\r\n     All in all, the story was intricate, and although while watching I didn't appreciate fully, I now respect hardcore. The art had some beautiful moments, but most of the time it was average, and the movements of the characters ranged from alright, to laughable. Every surface someone touched made a different sound, and when in the mansion thingy at the end, had a nice resonating touch to it. The main characters were likable and deep enough for meh! At the same time though, they dud have some mystery to them, so honestly I could not have guessed the \"extra student\" until the very end when it was explicitly announced! Even then I didn't fully believe it at first. I enjoyed the anime from episodes 1-4 and 8-12 the middle was just kinda dull :/ I would not re-watch, because the fun is in the constant suspicion of who the \"extra student\" is! Am I glad I watched this anime? Hell yes. Am I likely to recommend it? Probably.",

            "content": "Normally I'm a stranger to the horror genre in anime, with the only other titles I've seen being Elfen Lied and some of Higurashi. Therefore, I came into Another with only a faint idea of what the series was about and what to expect. What I got was a pleasant surprise that rekindled my interest in the genre and provided me with one of the most suspenseful shows I've seen to date.\r\nStory - 8.5\r\nIf nothing else, Another is an example of suspense done right. Despite being classified as a horror anime, Another is more along the lines of a suspense/thriller with strong horror overtones. Theseries does a good job of keeping a lingering sense of unease most of the time, and I guarantee there will be a few shivers that creep down your spine before it ends. But the suspense is not the only thing Another has to offer; its story is engaging, mysterious and kept me interested from episode one all the way to twelve, so much so that I found myself constantly wanting to push the 'next episode' button in order to decipher the mystery behind Class 3.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning does a good job of setting the mood and establishing exposition by feeding you information in little pieces, as well as making known the fear felt by everyone over the horrific happenings in the school. One particular thing I liked was how the character deaths were done; the series has no problem killing off anyone it so chooses, and I loved the nail-biting feeling that nobody is safe from the nightmare. The story does slow down a bit towards the middle, almost feeling like a dark slice of life show in some sequences, but what the middle lacks in pace, the end more than makes up for. The final few episodes do not disappoint, and the climax and conclusion were dramatic and exciting to watch. To put it simply, you'll definitely walk away from Another with a satisfied smile.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4.5\\n\\n\r\nDespite the very well-done story, the characters of Another are weak to say the least. Most remain static throughout the series and have no real development or purpose to speak of, other than to be killed off as fodder. Moreover, the characters' emotions (mostly) did not seem fitting of a horror show, as people rarely panic despite the gruesome scenes that unfold. Nowhere is this more evident than in our two main characters. Sakakibara seems more like a plotline device than a horror protagonist, as most of the time his only role is for the audience to simply witness events through his eyes. Misaki fares no better in her evaluation, showing even less emotion than Rei from Evangelion, though her character does develop a bit towards the end of the series. Save for a couple of stand-outs from the supporting cast, the rest of the characters are forgettable and don't do much for the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art - 9.0\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of Another are undoubtedly the high point of the show. Despite the gruesome content, there are plenty of beautiful backdrops and settings present in this anime, and I was awestruck with some of the detail that P.A. Works put into the art. The animation is fluid and doesn't feel choppy at any point, and it particularly shines through in the gory death scenes. The lighting is done brilliantly, adding even more to the suspense and creepiness felt in the darker parts of the show. There's scarcely something not pleasing to the eyes in Another, making it a real treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.0\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, the opening for Another is terrible, feeling more like a demented Adams Family tune than the intro for a horror anime. The ending follows suit, being completely forgettable and not fitting the series well at all.\\n\r\nBut despite these hiccups, the rest of Another's score is well-done. Though no pieces stand out as defining works, the music does a good job of setting the tone for each scene. One thing I also appreciated was that the series was not afraid to use silence in order to make the viewer shift in their seat, adding to the already-tense atmosphere created by the story. The dub was solid, enough to leave me satisfied and not feel obligated to watch the entire sub, but there were no stand-out performances other than Jessica Boone, who did an excellent job voicing Akazawa.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 9.0\\n\\n\r\nAnother kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through until the end. Though the characters hold the show back from being truly amazing, it is still an enjoyable anime that I recommend to anyone who enjoys suspense and a good story.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score - 7.6\\n",

            "content": "Mild spoilers ensue:\r\nWell, it wasn't bad...a lot of the time, I actually found it to be quite interesting. I think the plot just tried to overdo itself. Personally, I would have loved for it to have had more to do with the dolls...they were a creepy, albeit, pointless add on. For a horror show, it wasn't scary, though it did have a few cool death scenes and some gore which was helpful. The ending when chaos started to ensue was also pretty cool. I just didn't like the fact that Mikami Mei knew the whole time and just decided not to tell anyone. It's like...why?Was it just to drag the story out? Its an ignorant \"horror movie\" tactic and it hardly ever works. This show seemed to borrow a whole bunch of other movie plots (i.e. The Sixth Sense, Final Destination, Every cursed high school movie etc) and try to evolve them into something more...it felt like too many ideas rolled into one. The overall reveal was kinda cool and unexpected, but the fumbling way we got there was the problem.\\n\\n\r\nI know most of my review has been focused on what I didn't like, but what I did like were some of the earlier episodes. Though this show started slow, the atmosphere was creepy and the whodunit plot line had me hooked early on, so it wasn't all bad. I loved Akizawa she was badass, but most of the other characters including the protagonist were stock...also they never explained all these heart problems and lung problems the characters had...was it just to move the plot along? \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was cool. The \"Final Destination\" style deaths were interesting and some of the reveals (Including the big reveal) were pretty awesome...but the story got muddled along the way so when these reveals did come, they didn't have the shock value OMG I wanted, and they felt contrived a bit. Also useless sub plots (I.e. the dolls and Sakikabara's dad, the mom's death etc) were useless and unexplained. The deaths from 26 years prior to now that were ONLY explained and not shown were confusing most of the time since they tended to be car accidents or falling. The music was good, but some of the voice acting was sub par. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - Above average, but barely. 5.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nWatched - subbed",

Unfortunately its complexity is let down by simplicity. I'll try not to leave any spoilers, so you will find out when you watch it. The plot is consistent and each episode makes some reference back to the main story line. Episode 00 gives some back story so its recommended to watch before starting Another. But episode 00 is a but of a spoiler.\r\nArt and Sound:\r\nNot alot to say about the art and sound except that the character design is reallynice and so is the played music. The op really wasn't my thing though. Too dark, though it is a horror\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nGot a 7 only because nearer to the end you find that the emotions portrayed in each character aren't 'real'. Usually if your classmate is murdered at the age of 16ish you would mourn their death not go a rampage and kill everyone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIf your like me and likes to see a death where you would laugh at the person for being 'not so smart' than this is the anime for you. Four story drops in elevators, electrocution and justa whole lotta blood that makes you want more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAn 8. It's major let down was its ending (which was Ok but not the greatest) and character development. Apart from that it was an amazing anime which just missed out of my top 10.",

I would have to say that this anime really caught my attention even thought there can be many parts it could have been improved. What had mainly attracted me n maybe the other viewers might actually be the storyline and how the plot twisted and how the anime was concluded. I feel that the art was quite good but if it has landed in the hands of j.c staff or maybe Gohands it might hv beenbetter? Bt who am I to judge! The sound quality was good bt nt really the best you would expect out an anime of such caliber.Compared to the recent animus like Sao or maybe chunnibyou the quality might hv been a little bit weaker. Bt the development of the characters  definitely made up for what the anime lacks as I felt that the main characters were awesome and have great depth. It might be similar to the movie final destination but what this anime have in offer for u viewers out there is definitely better than final destination. Watching this anime every wk in the past has brought me chills and excitement. So overall I would say the story's storyline was so savory to me that it made me gave it 10 even though it had lacked in certain areas. If you guys like anime with amazing storyline like Mirrai Nikki and Hyouka , then I would definitely recommend this anime for you guys so why nt give it a shot? There isn't much horror to me so it would definitely be nice to enjoy it at night ! Try to watch it without any expectations and it might just dawn to you how great it actually is.",
