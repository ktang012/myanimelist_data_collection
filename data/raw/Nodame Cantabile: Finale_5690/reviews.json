            "content": "We've often heard the adage that the book is always better than the film/TV series, but how true is that statement? There are many cases where the written work is superior to the adaptation, and the reasons for the sometimes massive differences range from the limits of one's imagination and ability to visualise, to important chunks of plot being left on the cutting room floor.\r\nSometimes though, the difference between the two is very small....\r\nSo, Nodame Cantabile is finally over, and with it we say our collective goodbyes, gyabos and mukyas to the odd couple of the classical world. The aptly named \"Finale\" follows directly onfrom Paris Chapter, and not much has changed since the end of the second series. Chiaki is still conducting the Marlet orchestra, and they are progressively getting better thanks to him and the concert master. Nodame is also improving thanks to her lessons with Professor Auclair, however she feels that Chiaki is drifting further away from her. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that has always surprised me about the entirety of Nodame Cantabile is how closely the anime tries to follow the manga, however while the majority of the tale is transposed extremely well, there are occasions where the adaptation only touches on the manga storyline. For the most part the plot in Finale flows rather well and, as with the rest of the series, the music allows one to appreciate the story in a manner that simply isn't possible in the manga. However, if one has read the manga then there may be some confusing occurences in the story, one example of this being the absence/alteration of a huge chunk of storyline from the final two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor many people the changes in the anime won't be an issue, regardless of whether they've read the manga or not. The story in either form is enjoyable, and while the manga may contain more plot,there are elements of the anime adaptation that more than maks up for the changes. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of design and animation, Finale is very much in the mould of the first two series, something which should come as no surprise since J.C. Staff are responsible for the trilogy (and OVAs of course). Character designs are just as eclectic as they were before, and the European settings are just as good as they were in Paris Chapter. Animation is pretty much on par with the previous series as well, including the dreaded 3D fingers playing the instruments (something which has long divided opinion since it's not the best CG in anime, but is reasonably accurate in its usage). I didn't mind them personally, however they do interrupt the flow of the story a little (while you pause to chuckle at how robotic they are that is).\\n\\n\r\nThe star of the show though, as any fan of the series will know, is the music. While Finale may not be as heavy with the classical pieces on display as previous outings, there is enough here to enhance the story and add vibrancy to the series. One thing that I was pleased to hear was the more subtle thematic music used in the series, and many scenes were made without any accompaniment, something which is laudable given the series is top-filled already.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the quality of music, the acting is also very good throughout the show, but given that the cast is pretty much that of Paris Chapter, this should be no surprise. Seki Tomokazu is in fine form as Chiaki, while Kawasumi Ayako continues to bring out Nodame's oddness and eccentricity. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, this is probably the weakest of the three series  for Nodame and Chiaki. While the cast generally receive a decent amount of development, the overall quality seems a little rushed, especially in the last two episodes. It would have been better if Finale was a 12 or 13 episode series as the bits that have been left out of the manga shed a new light on Chiaki's feelings for Nodame, something that has been hurried in the anime version.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, those who have only watched the anime will probably find the characters to be pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nFinale is a nice way to end the series as it continues to use the tried and tested formula of the first two seasons - mixing slapstick comedy with classical music. While the show does have some niggling issues that could have been resolved, these shouldn't really cause any major problems with one's enjoyment of the series, even if one has read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole Nodame Cantabile: Finale is a good addition to the franchise, but not a great one. The somewhat rushed development of the characters during the latter half of the series may annoy some people (those who've read the manga for example), however those who love the show in its entirety will probably be happy enough with the results. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is, this is an enjoyable show that rounds off the franchise in a fairly pleasing manner, and if anyone is sad about the series ending, well, the encore has already started.\\n\\n",

Ah. Nodame Cantabile is one of my favourite romance series and that being said, I do watch a lot of romance anime and although I do love the typical 'love at first sight' sort of thing - let's face it. It doesn't always happen in real life and Nodame Cantabile shows love in a realistic setting.\r\nI personally love the \"find someone who makesyou a better you\" type of romance because a good partner will always make you a better type of you and in Chiaki x Nodame - it was beautiful. We see the two of them mature as they move along from one stage to another, facing difficulties and learning to accept one another's flaws. It takes a lot of work and that's reality. And I love romance animes when it's real.\\n\\n\r\nLove is a really funny thing. It's really difficult to interpret but I always find that small things really do matter. It's not about the big things that couples have to do - it's the small things that people normally don't really care about. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Chiaki constantly taking care of Nodame - cooking for her, cleaning her room and laundry, etc \\n\\n\r\nThat to me, is love at its simplest form. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a series filled with funny characters, amazing classical music and slowly developed romance - then this is definitely the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really a hidden gem.",

See I have 0 experience with musical studies, so I can't relate with the situation of the characters, but still after watching Nodame Cantabile I felt like I was experiencing the struggle ofbeing an musical student, not just a musical student but also an average student. The show gets very well the feel of the academical experience, this meaning things like the time that you have to manage so you can focus on studies and the sacrifices that you have to make, or other things like love/romance which is another aspect that the show gets really freakin' well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is really calm and kinda episodic in a way, although the story progress every episode, which brings the slice of life feel that suits very well the nature of an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is probably one of the many things that makes this show so enjoyable, Noda Megumi is probably one of my favorite characters ever, and in a nut shell all characters are highly likable and really relatable being in their interactions with each others or the choices that they make in life as the story keeps progressing, which helps the show have a realistic feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is really amazing as you might aspect from an anime like this. Being when characters are performing on stage with an orchestra or solo, or just having a normal conversation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend Nodame Cantabile (All the three seasons) if you want to watch a really good slice of life show with awesome character development and romance.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile Finale is the third and final season of the series. This review assumes everyone reading has watched or is at least aware of seasons 1 and 2.\r\nFinale picks up right after season 2, and carries on the plot in same fast-paced style. The atmosphere changes dramatically, as the series shifts drastically from  a music anime with career-focused protagonists to basically a drama anime with  occasional short bursts of music.\r\nHonestly, Finale was a massive disappointment for me. The major reason for that was thrust of Nodame into the sole leading role, to the point of pushing Chiaki to secondary status. That meansthat Nodame gets a lot more screentime, and a lot more time to shine; or not. All seeing even more of Nodame does is accentuate her flaws, which never get resolved throughout the series, and bug the hell out of us with a 'gyabon' or a 'mukya' on every third goddamn word of speech. That was cute character trait when used sparingly, but now that is spammed so much it is just nerve-wracking.\\n\\n\r\nNodame makes for a terrible protagonist. Her issues with music are not resolved throughout most of the series. Even now, almost 40 episodes later, she still faces the same issue with her playstyle. Mainly, that she is not respecting the score or the people she's playing with, and instead goes off and does her own thing. It's an issue she's known and had highlighted for her since early season 1, but it's still there.\\n\\n\r\nEven her massively successful debut was, in reality, a failure of Nodame's, since she disregarded every rehearsal she'd done with the orchestra so far (in which she kept asking for everyone to move at her own pace) and went off to do her own thing. It was only Stresemann's superb conducting skills that saved the concerto from total disaster, which by rights it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, Nodame in season 3 (and 2, to a lesser extent) is a selfish, irresponsible person who's being a dick to everyone around her for no good reason and then cries about her lot in life. Vanishes without a trace for days and weeks, communicates with absolutely no one, making everyone worried sick, gets the best result she could have possibly hoped for, and then is still not satisfied and acts like a dick to Chiaki and even Stresemann.\\n\\n\r\nNo, her behavior towards Chiaki in particular has been irritating me during this and even the previous season. In an ironic turn from season 1, it is Nodame that is being thoughtless and ungrateful rather than the other way around. Never answering phones, showing up only when she likes and making it impossible for him to reach her even when he's worried. Hell, making him worried on many occasions when she could have avoided that with a simple message.\\n\r\nThat's not the sort of behavior you have towards the man you've been claiming to love for years. That behavior is reserved for people for whose feelings you don't care.\\n\r\nHell, her friends are asking her direct questions about the same concerns I expressed, and she outright ignores them. Nodame has her so far down in the sand that only her toes stick out. It's pretty heartbreaking to see this deconstruction of Nodame, especially since season 3 Chiaki is so hopelessly in love with her. Of course, there are no repercussions or even a mention for this, because Nodame is anime protagonist and no one holds their dicking behavior against them. This kind of behavior is not okay in real life, especially among significant others.\\n\\n\r\n\"I've changed since then,\" Nodame says. And the hard, painful truth is that no, she hasn't. Never, at any point in either season of the series, has she had a shred of change or character development. Every time she makes progress in any direction, she consciously destroys it not long after. Doubly the shame and the frustration, because Chiaki has come so goddamn far as a character that the comparison is just sad to make.\\n\\n\r\nI liked season 1 Nodame. I tolerated season 2 Nodame because at least half the time we followed Chiaki and he was enjoyable to watch, but season 3 was just terrible in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nWith the shift in focus away from music, the sound score itself has gone down, lacking the variety and sheer number of musical pieces from earlier seasons.\\n\\n\r\nConversely the animation quality keeps getting better, and is certainly a far cry from season 1 when wed only get frames during concerts.\\n\\n\r\nThe third season did this weird thing with the secondary cast, where they were prominently featuring in several episodes, but outright absent from the rest of them. It was a bit jarring, and a shame because I liked most of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending resolved nothing, showed nothing, just a curtain call with typical philosophical poetic with little actual significance.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say that I enjoyed season 3 of Nodame Cantabile, which a big shame. It was well-made on most of its aspects, but it made me so mad that giving it such a high score annoys me.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\r\nIf there's one thing I've learned throughout the viewing of Nodame, it's that everyone would hate me within the orchestra. But then again, most people hate me as I am, so it isn't really a surprise. \r\nContrary to my score, I loved the series. I binge watched it within 2 days, and didn't regret it one bit. Yet, unfortunately, I felt a massive drop in quality during the 3rd season that relates to three major problems: story, character(s) and ending. I gave first season 9 without flinching, and will probably re-watch it again soon, but when I compare the finale to the 1st season,it all kind of falls apart. Why? Let's dive in. \\n\\n\r\nStory continues right where Paris Hen ended and we're, once again, thrown into the ensemble of beautiful music and diverging paths our characters take. What drew me into this anime, personally, were the orchestral pieces, and occasional solo pieces by Nodame. Third season, however, shifts this about and focuses almost exclusively on personal competitions of side characters and the progress of Nodame, both as person and as a musician. I would be fine with that, but it was poorly executed. Unlike previous two seasons, pacing is all over the place; first 2-3 episodes seem to setting up the whole thing nicely, then suddenly it slows down and picks up in last two episodes where it ends abruptly, without major cause. It kind of felt spread thin and a lot of time was spent covering same subjects multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nCantabile's story was never its strong suite - far from it. It didn't really have that much depth or complexity, but that's where its charm lay. Due to its simplicity and ease of following, it allowed its other aspects to shine brightly. It was used as somewhat of a background supporting character, and it fit perfectly into the whole thing. The entire structure of the first season, and majority of second, felt natural and it had its flow. Yet, Finale brings forth a set of unnecessary plot pieces and overused tropes, and it soon turns into somewhat of a convoluted mess, and even ends in such. Several characters are used as plot devices, some are given way too much screen time, some way too little. As an example, we have Shinichi's original sensei, who was introduced to us as pivotal point in Shinichi's life, because he's the reason Shinichi wanted to conduct. Yet, he has about 2 minutes of screen time throughout the entire thing, and for the most part is in the background/used as a cheap plot device. That's just an example of bad storytelling at its finest. I have absolutely no idea who this guy is or his importance within the world of classical music or how he helps Shinichi once they reunite. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, there are still some parts of the story that worked well. and as a finale it did its job ... kind of. Before the end, there were some parts that really did bring out emotion, and did show the progress of story and I liked that. However, I absolutely need to rant about the ending for a moment: it's bad. It's really, really, bad. What's worse is that the events leading up to it are also bad. All in all, ending leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and it really forces you to look back at the series and think 'Wait, wait. That's ... it?' - ending is not only abrupt but it makes no sense. A lot of things are left hanging in the air, bunch of questions still unanswered, and it seemingly ends in the middle of telling the actual ending. Unfortunately, it's definitely the low-point of the entire series, and that's not the way you wish to end your series. Not in a long shot. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, story is definitely above average, but you wouldn't go wrong in rating it anywhere from 4-6, depending on your personal taste. It fits into each part for a number of reasons, and that's quite unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nNext up with have production: animation is definitely the best its ever been, and there are far less stiff shots accompanied by awesome music from first season. It's still not that great though, and the \"age\" kind of shows, but it does what it's set out to do well enough. Art is still crisp and colorful, comedic expressions are done well, and there are some vibrant scenes (mostly involving reflections on water) here and there that I still remember. Easy on the eyes, but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I really have no need to touch on this: music is still here, in all its glory. Absolute 10 without a doubt. Could give even more if I could - definitely the high point of the entire show, the way it was meant to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to skip through production is because it's the thing that works in this anime - and I want to discuss things that don't, because I'm anal like that. Characters. Ugh. Looking back at season 1, I really should have expected this, but it still hurts.\\n\\n\r\nI have this love-hate relationship with airheads if I'm being honest - I always end up being their fan at the beginning, but end up hating them by the end. Why? Because, most of the time, that's who they stay as. At first it's cute and funny, but if you drag it over 40 episodes, than it's annoying and distracting and, honestly, plain insulting. Nodame starts out as a great character - your typical, talented, overly-cheerful airhead. And through the first season she mostly remains the same, with a few changes here and there, but that was fine because the focus wasn't really on her. However, they drag out her natural klutz personality to hell and back, and drive it through and through for forever. Another trait of hers was a lack of motivation and indecisiveness - which comes into play this season, and holy hell does it overstay its welcome. It's used as nothing but a plot device, and it's as obvious as well. It's used to create drama. At one point, here actions just stop making sense, and, just the same, you stop caring. She becomes a walking bore and annoyance, and I really didn't want it to end up this way - but I should have figured out it would. You can make your audience laugh because your character is an unaware airhead only so many times, after all ...\\n\\n\r\nThe set of supporting characters from Paris Hen returns this time around as well, and are given ... way too much space, if you ask me. I understand the need to flesh out your side-characters, but we already knew that they were never supposed to be the focus because writer literally abandoned everyone from season 1 aside from Oldy-Pervy. Yet, their problems and struggles come into focus here and take way too much time to resolve, sidelining main story and the progress of main characters. Yes, there are some nice moments here and there, it felt nice knowing more about who these people are, but ultimately they're still just a fodder. They barely interact with the main story - I'd go so far as to say that they have no actual impact on it. And this was supposed to be a finale - thing that wraps up the entire series - not a season that sets up your side-characters. This also ties in to the pacing problems I talked about before, and overall leaves a bitter taste. A few more pairings bear fruition, and there's an introduction of a random Japanese girl midway through that had even less point that the original sensei. I have absolutely no idea what was that girl doing there, and I'm happy she stayed only for about 10 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shinichi is still the best character in my opinion. Unfortunately, he's given less and less focus as the series progresses. He's often thrown into random journeys across Europe just to get him out of the picture for a while, so that we can focus on Nodame. For me, it backfired, as he was always the one leading the show, and Nodame was the one following. They reversed the roles and it didn't work. Too bad. \\n\\n\r\nIt'd be a lie if I said I didn't enjoy Nodame Cantabile as whole, because I did. I love this series, and will probably re-watch it more than once. However, if I compare my enjoyment from 1st season to Finale, they're worlds apart. Here, instead of enjoying things, I spent far more time questioning motives, actions, characters and story, and trying to understand what the hell was with that ending. \\n\\n\r\nI still wholeheartedly recommend Nodame Cantabile - it's definitely the best anime about music that I've seen to date, and whether you're a fan of classical music or not, it has some outstanding pieces. From the familiar Bach and Mozart tunes, to some that your average Joe would have never heard of. First season was definitely its high point, but the entire 3 are worth watching without a doubt. \\n\\n\r\n*If you wish to discuss the review, feel free to leave me a comment. Thanks for reading.",

Though, the story is like the piece of what Chiaki said it keeps on playing, but you will not know how will it end. Both of the characters have developed in terms of music and romance even the extras. The finale vibe is there since most of the characters are finally graduating from the school. As for Chiaki, the dream of meeting his teacher come true that the scene is a tear-jerking. I thought that Franz von Stresemann will not appear, but it tends that he have the highest rolein this series. The art and the sound are maintained. The thing is I'm kind of frustrated in this prequel. Although, the author did not give a full resolution to the agonizing feeling of Nodame. Again, the anime did not put labels in the relationship of two, the proposal is kind of hurry. It is filled with flashbacks. The finale was shorter into episode 10 and 11. For me, I think the way the first season ended should also be given in this prequel. In the end, I still enjoyed this, although with a long sigh...",

            "content": "Anime and Quality Films?\r\nJust to let clear my situation as a reviewer, I followed the series timeline until the very end. After having watched the first season, I gave myself the chance to review it. One that I, personally, recognize more as a non-spoiling guide or introduction. Wait. What about season 2? Well, it failed to achieve my expectations, so I'm not giving a chance. It was only useful such as a bridge for third season.\r\nThe third season somehow manages to conquer another failure that was pretty clear in the Paris presentation one: the bad calibration between its exposure from show to viewer and thecharacters alongside the story timeline. Going easy on you, this season, as its ancestor, has around 11 episodes, which wasn't the case for the first, which had twice of each. Somewhere during this, it will be mentioned how long it took from the beginning of the main characters' lives in France until the very point they are then. That will be the strangest moment in this streaming experience.\\n\r\nNow, about the title, it is not the perfect studying relationship, such would be books, especially classics, but given it is a totally different art, I decided to express the idea using a closer term which can be still given good use. When I think about Quality Films I don't think about a Martin Scorsese's, a Christopher Nolan's, a Tarantino's. No. I think about a Steve McQueen's or a Lars Von Trier's. Why? Because it is not about building an interesting story, it is building an interesting way to develop a concept, a reflection, your personal opinion using Humanity, people, as tools, to comprehend themselves. Cult Films isn't their main reference, yet, is understandable. You have found the big step into understanding how the story will grow. This is the huge picture this season extends for the whole series. Whatsoever, in anime style, using characteristic clich\u00e9s of this industry.\\n\r\nAnd, still, I gave it a 7/10... Yes, it took my time, trust me, but that first argument, although it may not seem much, affects completely the viewing experience. And the whole season falls due to such. The characters are hardly developed and, other thing to mention, the concept studied lays too restricted/ limited in its undergoing. The story keeps changing directions, which is something that can be amazing when fulfilled nicely, and it also could have been in this show, even if 11-episodes short. Here, you don't feel the attention is worth it. Also, it can go indifferent according to the viewer, but the collision between languages, better, the way it is avoid, can be a itch on your back.\\n\r\nOne thing is certain, the idea thought regarding season one will change after you see the full series. You will understand things differently (although my initial review keeps solid), possibly giving a re-watch.\\n\r\nThe whole \"Nodame Cantabile\" is about life, desires and concerns. Again, it is not what you achieve, is the walk you walk.",

While Chiaki is a genius who learns and does music splendidly, Nodame on the other hand relays more in her instincts when it comes to music. Even though both are talented, Nodame is in a really different caliber. Chiaki keeps on moving forward and making so much success in the music world leaving behind Nodame. At this point, Nodame struggles so much and keeps on envying Chiaki so much to the point oflosing her motivation. She wanted to rush things and ended up feeling more inferior from Chiaki. Again! I really don\u2019t understand why she has to be jealous of Chiaki when she is so much more talented than him. The problem with Chiaki he forces Nodame to be greater and to dream even more considering she is so talented. It becomes a problem because Nodame is the type of a musician who\u2019s really hard to comprehend. She is like those famous artists who have a very complicated set of mind and forcing them can really break them. With her character, it should be done one step at a time. It\u2019s like he\u2019s holding Nodame so tight that he ended up losing her. Now, the problem with Nodame she keeps on trying to follow Chiaki when his already leaving her behind. This is the problem when a couple pursues their dreams in the same industry. They wanted to be together but ended up getting more far away from each other with their differences. And just when he thought she will be alright with the success of her first debut, she decided to stop playing the piano anymore. Anyways, it still ended well when both realized their differences and what they have done wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI was hoping more from it considering it was the finale after all. Though I am expecting too much because this series is one of my favorites it is still satisfying enough. I am going to miss it so much especially Nodame with her unique antics of her Mukya and Gyabo!\\n",

            "content": "We've often heard the adage that the book is always better than the film/TV series, but how true is that statement? There are many cases where the written work is superior to the adaptation, and the reasons for the sometimes massive differences range from the limits of one's imagination and ability to visualise, to important chunks of plot being left on the cutting room floor.\r\nSometimes though, the difference between the two is very small....\r\nSo, Nodame Cantabile is finally over, and with it we say our collective goodbyes, gyabos and mukyas to the odd couple of the classical world. The aptly named \"Finale\" follows directly onfrom Paris Chapter, and not much has changed since the end of the second series. Chiaki is still conducting the Marlet orchestra, and they are progressively getting better thanks to him and the concert master. Nodame is also improving thanks to her lessons with Professor Auclair, however she feels that Chiaki is drifting further away from her. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that has always surprised me about the entirety of Nodame Cantabile is how closely the anime tries to follow the manga, however while the majority of the tale is transposed extremely well, there are occasions where the adaptation only touches on the manga storyline. For the most part the plot in Finale flows rather well and, as with the rest of the series, the music allows one to appreciate the story in a manner that simply isn't possible in the manga. However, if one has read the manga then there may be some confusing occurences in the story, one example of this being the absence/alteration of a huge chunk of storyline from the final two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor many people the changes in the anime won't be an issue, regardless of whether they've read the manga or not. The story in either form is enjoyable, and while the manga may contain more plot,there are elements of the anime adaptation that more than maks up for the changes. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of design and animation, Finale is very much in the mould of the first two series, something which should come as no surprise since J.C. Staff are responsible for the trilogy (and OVAs of course). Character designs are just as eclectic as they were before, and the European settings are just as good as they were in Paris Chapter. Animation is pretty much on par with the previous series as well, including the dreaded 3D fingers playing the instruments (something which has long divided opinion since it's not the best CG in anime, but is reasonably accurate in its usage). I didn't mind them personally, however they do interrupt the flow of the story a little (while you pause to chuckle at how robotic they are that is).\\n\\n\r\nThe star of the show though, as any fan of the series will know, is the music. While Finale may not be as heavy with the classical pieces on display as previous outings, there is enough here to enhance the story and add vibrancy to the series. One thing that I was pleased to hear was the more subtle thematic music used in the series, and many scenes were made without any accompaniment, something which is laudable given the series is top-filled already.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the quality of music, the acting is also very good throughout the show, but given that the cast is pretty much that of Paris Chapter, this should be no surprise. Seki Tomokazu is in fine form as Chiaki, while Kawasumi Ayako continues to bring out Nodame's oddness and eccentricity. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, this is probably the weakest of the three series  for Nodame and Chiaki. While the cast generally receive a decent amount of development, the overall quality seems a little rushed, especially in the last two episodes. It would have been better if Finale was a 12 or 13 episode series as the bits that have been left out of the manga shed a new light on Chiaki's feelings for Nodame, something that has been hurried in the anime version.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, those who have only watched the anime will probably find the characters to be pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nFinale is a nice way to end the series as it continues to use the tried and tested formula of the first two seasons - mixing slapstick comedy with classical music. While the show does have some niggling issues that could have been resolved, these shouldn't really cause any major problems with one's enjoyment of the series, even if one has read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole Nodame Cantabile: Finale is a good addition to the franchise, but not a great one. The somewhat rushed development of the characters during the latter half of the series may annoy some people (those who've read the manga for example), however those who love the show in its entirety will probably be happy enough with the results. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is, this is an enjoyable show that rounds off the franchise in a fairly pleasing manner, and if anyone is sad about the series ending, well, the encore has already started.\\n\\n",

Ah. Nodame Cantabile is one of my favourite romance series and that being said, I do watch a lot of romance anime and although I do love the typical 'love at first sight' sort of thing - let's face it. It doesn't always happen in real life and Nodame Cantabile shows love in a realistic setting.\r\nI personally love the \"find someone who makesyou a better you\" type of romance because a good partner will always make you a better type of you and in Chiaki x Nodame - it was beautiful. We see the two of them mature as they move along from one stage to another, facing difficulties and learning to accept one another's flaws. It takes a lot of work and that's reality. And I love romance animes when it's real.\\n\\n\r\nLove is a really funny thing. It's really difficult to interpret but I always find that small things really do matter. It's not about the big things that couples have to do - it's the small things that people normally don't really care about. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Chiaki constantly taking care of Nodame - cooking for her, cleaning her room and laundry, etc \\n\\n\r\nThat to me, is love at its simplest form. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a series filled with funny characters, amazing classical music and slowly developed romance - then this is definitely the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really a hidden gem.",

            "content": "So, I just finished watching Nodame Cantabile Finale, the last season of Nodame Cantabile, and so my memory is still fresh about it, not that the anime is short forgotten, not by any given means, because this may well be one of the most memorable anime that I will ever be given the chance to watch.\r\nWatching Nodame Cantabile was just not simply watching but it was about having an experience as well. See I have 0 experience with musical studies, so I can't relate with the situation of the characters, but still after watching Nodame Cantabile I felt like I was experiencing the struggle ofbeing an musical student, not just a musical student but also an average student. The show gets very well the feel of the academical experience, this meaning things like the time that you have to manage so you can focus on studies and the sacrifices that you have to make, or other things like love/romance which is another aspect that the show gets really freakin' well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is really calm and kinda episodic in a way, although the story progress every episode, which brings the slice of life feel that suits very well the nature of an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is probably one of the many things that makes this show so enjoyable, Noda Megumi is probably one of my favorite characters ever, and in a nut shell all characters are highly likable and really relatable being in their interactions with each others or the choices that they make in life as the story keeps progressing, which helps the show have a realistic feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is really amazing as you might aspect from an anime like this. Being when characters are performing on stage with an orchestra or solo, or just having a normal conversation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend Nodame Cantabile (All the three seasons) if you want to watch a really good slice of life show with awesome character development and romance.",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile Finale is the third and final season of the series. This review assumes everyone reading has watched or is at least aware of seasons 1 and 2.\r\nFinale picks up right after season 2, and carries on the plot in same fast-paced style. The atmosphere changes dramatically, as the series shifts drastically from  a music anime with career-focused protagonists to basically a drama anime with  occasional short bursts of music.\r\nHonestly, Finale was a massive disappointment for me. The major reason for that was thrust of Nodame into the sole leading role, to the point of pushing Chiaki to secondary status. That meansthat Nodame gets a lot more screentime, and a lot more time to shine; or not. All seeing even more of Nodame does is accentuate her flaws, which never get resolved throughout the series, and bug the hell out of us with a 'gyabon' or a 'mukya' on every third goddamn word of speech. That was cute character trait when used sparingly, but now that is spammed so much it is just nerve-wracking.\\n\\n\r\nNodame makes for a terrible protagonist. Her issues with music are not resolved throughout most of the series. Even now, almost 40 episodes later, she still faces the same issue with her playstyle. Mainly, that she is not respecting the score or the people she's playing with, and instead goes off and does her own thing. It's an issue she's known and had highlighted for her since early season 1, but it's still there.\\n\\n\r\nEven her massively successful debut was, in reality, a failure of Nodame's, since she disregarded every rehearsal she'd done with the orchestra so far (in which she kept asking for everyone to move at her own pace) and went off to do her own thing. It was only Stresemann's superb conducting skills that saved the concerto from total disaster, which by rights it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, Nodame in season 3 (and 2, to a lesser extent) is a selfish, irresponsible person who's being a dick to everyone around her for no good reason and then cries about her lot in life. Vanishes without a trace for days and weeks, communicates with absolutely no one, making everyone worried sick, gets the best result she could have possibly hoped for, and then is still not satisfied and acts like a dick to Chiaki and even Stresemann.\\n\\n\r\nNo, her behavior towards Chiaki in particular has been irritating me during this and even the previous season. In an ironic turn from season 1, it is Nodame that is being thoughtless and ungrateful rather than the other way around. Never answering phones, showing up only when she likes and making it impossible for him to reach her even when he's worried. Hell, making him worried on many occasions when she could have avoided that with a simple message.\\n\r\nThat's not the sort of behavior you have towards the man you've been claiming to love for years. That behavior is reserved for people for whose feelings you don't care.\\n\r\nHell, her friends are asking her direct questions about the same concerns I expressed, and she outright ignores them. Nodame has her so far down in the sand that only her toes stick out. It's pretty heartbreaking to see this deconstruction of Nodame, especially since season 3 Chiaki is so hopelessly in love with her. Of course, there are no repercussions or even a mention for this, because Nodame is anime protagonist and no one holds their dicking behavior against them. This kind of behavior is not okay in real life, especially among significant others.\\n\\n\r\n\"I've changed since then,\" Nodame says. And the hard, painful truth is that no, she hasn't. Never, at any point in either season of the series, has she had a shred of change or character development. Every time she makes progress in any direction, she consciously destroys it not long after. Doubly the shame and the frustration, because Chiaki has come so goddamn far as a character that the comparison is just sad to make.\\n\\n\r\nI liked season 1 Nodame. I tolerated season 2 Nodame because at least half the time we followed Chiaki and he was enjoyable to watch, but season 3 was just terrible in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nWith the shift in focus away from music, the sound score itself has gone down, lacking the variety and sheer number of musical pieces from earlier seasons.\\n\\n\r\nConversely the animation quality keeps getting better, and is certainly a far cry from season 1 when wed only get frames during concerts.\\n\\n\r\nThe third season did this weird thing with the secondary cast, where they were prominently featuring in several episodes, but outright absent from the rest of them. It was a bit jarring, and a shame because I liked most of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending resolved nothing, showed nothing, just a curtain call with typical philosophical poetic with little actual significance.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say that I enjoyed season 3 of Nodame Cantabile, which a big shame. It was well-made on most of its aspects, but it made me so mad that giving it such a high score annoys me.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\r\nIf there's one thing I've learned throughout the viewing of Nodame, it's that everyone would hate me within the orchestra. But then again, most people hate me as I am, so it isn't really a surprise. \r\nContrary to my score, I loved the series. I binge watched it within 2 days, and didn't regret it one bit. Yet, unfortunately, I felt a massive drop in quality during the 3rd season that relates to three major problems: story, character(s) and ending. I gave first season 9 without flinching, and will probably re-watch it again soon, but when I compare the finale to the 1st season,it all kind of falls apart. Why? Let's dive in. \\n\\n\r\nStory continues right where Paris Hen ended and we're, once again, thrown into the ensemble of beautiful music and diverging paths our characters take. What drew me into this anime, personally, were the orchestral pieces, and occasional solo pieces by Nodame. Third season, however, shifts this about and focuses almost exclusively on personal competitions of side characters and the progress of Nodame, both as person and as a musician. I would be fine with that, but it was poorly executed. Unlike previous two seasons, pacing is all over the place; first 2-3 episodes seem to setting up the whole thing nicely, then suddenly it slows down and picks up in last two episodes where it ends abruptly, without major cause. It kind of felt spread thin and a lot of time was spent covering same subjects multiple times. \\n\\n\r\nCantabile's story was never its strong suite - far from it. It didn't really have that much depth or complexity, but that's where its charm lay. Due to its simplicity and ease of following, it allowed its other aspects to shine brightly. It was used as somewhat of a background supporting character, and it fit perfectly into the whole thing. The entire structure of the first season, and majority of second, felt natural and it had its flow. Yet, Finale brings forth a set of unnecessary plot pieces and overused tropes, and it soon turns into somewhat of a convoluted mess, and even ends in such. Several characters are used as plot devices, some are given way too much screen time, some way too little. As an example, we have Shinichi's original sensei, who was introduced to us as pivotal point in Shinichi's life, because he's the reason Shinichi wanted to conduct. Yet, he has about 2 minutes of screen time throughout the entire thing, and for the most part is in the background/used as a cheap plot device. That's just an example of bad storytelling at its finest. I have absolutely no idea who this guy is or his importance within the world of classical music or how he helps Shinichi once they reunite. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, there are still some parts of the story that worked well. and as a finale it did its job ... kind of. Before the end, there were some parts that really did bring out emotion, and did show the progress of story and I liked that. However, I absolutely need to rant about the ending for a moment: it's bad. It's really, really, bad. What's worse is that the events leading up to it are also bad. All in all, ending leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and it really forces you to look back at the series and think 'Wait, wait. That's ... it?' - ending is not only abrupt but it makes no sense. A lot of things are left hanging in the air, bunch of questions still unanswered, and it seemingly ends in the middle of telling the actual ending. Unfortunately, it's definitely the low-point of the entire series, and that's not the way you wish to end your series. Not in a long shot. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, story is definitely above average, but you wouldn't go wrong in rating it anywhere from 4-6, depending on your personal taste. It fits into each part for a number of reasons, and that's quite unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nNext up with have production: animation is definitely the best its ever been, and there are far less stiff shots accompanied by awesome music from first season. It's still not that great though, and the \"age\" kind of shows, but it does what it's set out to do well enough. Art is still crisp and colorful, comedic expressions are done well, and there are some vibrant scenes (mostly involving reflections on water) here and there that I still remember. Easy on the eyes, but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I really have no need to touch on this: music is still here, in all its glory. Absolute 10 without a doubt. Could give even more if I could - definitely the high point of the entire show, the way it was meant to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to skip through production is because it's the thing that works in this anime - and I want to discuss things that don't, because I'm anal like that. Characters. Ugh. Looking back at season 1, I really should have expected this, but it still hurts.\\n\\n\r\nI have this love-hate relationship with airheads if I'm being honest - I always end up being their fan at the beginning, but end up hating them by the end. Why? Because, most of the time, that's who they stay as. At first it's cute and funny, but if you drag it over 40 episodes, than it's annoying and distracting and, honestly, plain insulting. Nodame starts out as a great character - your typical, talented, overly-cheerful airhead. And through the first season she mostly remains the same, with a few changes here and there, but that was fine because the focus wasn't really on her. However, they drag out her natural klutz personality to hell and back, and drive it through and through for forever. Another trait of hers was a lack of motivation and indecisiveness - which comes into play this season, and holy hell does it overstay its welcome. It's used as nothing but a plot device, and it's as obvious as well. It's used to create drama. At one point, here actions just stop making sense, and, just the same, you stop caring. She becomes a walking bore and annoyance, and I really didn't want it to end up this way - but I should have figured out it would. You can make your audience laugh because your character is an unaware airhead only so many times, after all ...\\n\\n\r\nThe set of supporting characters from Paris Hen returns this time around as well, and are given ... way too much space, if you ask me. I understand the need to flesh out your side-characters, but we already knew that they were never supposed to be the focus because writer literally abandoned everyone from season 1 aside from Oldy-Pervy. Yet, their problems and struggles come into focus here and take way too much time to resolve, sidelining main story and the progress of main characters. Yes, there are some nice moments here and there, it felt nice knowing more about who these people are, but ultimately they're still just a fodder. They barely interact with the main story - I'd go so far as to say that they have no actual impact on it. And this was supposed to be a finale - thing that wraps up the entire series - not a season that sets up your side-characters. This also ties in to the pacing problems I talked about before, and overall leaves a bitter taste. A few more pairings bear fruition, and there's an introduction of a random Japanese girl midway through that had even less point that the original sensei. I have absolutely no idea what was that girl doing there, and I'm happy she stayed only for about 10 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shinichi is still the best character in my opinion. Unfortunately, he's given less and less focus as the series progresses. He's often thrown into random journeys across Europe just to get him out of the picture for a while, so that we can focus on Nodame. For me, it backfired, as he was always the one leading the show, and Nodame was the one following. They reversed the roles and it didn't work. Too bad. \\n\\n\r\nIt'd be a lie if I said I didn't enjoy Nodame Cantabile as whole, because I did. I love this series, and will probably re-watch it more than once. However, if I compare my enjoyment from 1st season to Finale, they're worlds apart. Here, instead of enjoying things, I spent far more time questioning motives, actions, characters and story, and trying to understand what the hell was with that ending. \\n\\n\r\nI still wholeheartedly recommend Nodame Cantabile - it's definitely the best anime about music that I've seen to date, and whether you're a fan of classical music or not, it has some outstanding pieces. From the familiar Bach and Mozart tunes, to some that your average Joe would have never heard of. First season was definitely its high point, but the entire 3 are worth watching without a doubt. \\n\\n\r\n*If you wish to discuss the review, feel free to leave me a comment. Thanks for reading.",

As for Chiaki, the dream of meeting his teacher come true that the scene is a tear-jerking. I thought that Franz von Stresemann will not appear, but it tends that he have the highest rolein this series. The art and the sound are maintained. The thing is I'm kind of frustrated in this prequel. Although, the author did not give a full resolution to the agonizing feeling of Nodame. Again, the anime did not put labels in the relationship of two, the proposal is kind of hurry. It is filled with flashbacks. The finale was shorter into episode 10 and 11. For me, I think the way the first season ended should also be given in this prequel. In the end, I still enjoyed this, although with a long sigh...",

            "content": "Anime and Quality Films?\r\nJust to let clear my situation as a reviewer, I followed the series timeline until the very end. After having watched the first season, I gave myself the chance to review it. One that I, personally, recognize more as a non-spoiling guide or introduction. Wait. What about season 2? Well, it failed to achieve my expectations, so I'm not giving a chance. It was only useful such as a bridge for third season.\r\nThe third season somehow manages to conquer another failure that was pretty clear in the Paris presentation one: the bad calibration between its exposure from show to viewer and thecharacters alongside the story timeline. Going easy on you, this season, as its ancestor, has around 11 episodes, which wasn't the case for the first, which had twice of each. Somewhere during this, it will be mentioned how long it took from the beginning of the main characters' lives in France until the very point they are then. That will be the strangest moment in this streaming experience.\\n\r\nNow, about the title, it is not the perfect studying relationship, such would be books, especially classics, but given it is a totally different art, I decided to express the idea using a closer term which can be still given good use. When I think about Quality Films I don't think about a Martin Scorsese's, a Christopher Nolan's, a Tarantino's. No. I think about a Steve McQueen's or a Lars Von Trier's. Why? Because it is not about building an interesting story, it is building an interesting way to develop a concept, a reflection, your personal opinion using Humanity, people, as tools, to comprehend themselves. Cult Films isn't their main reference, yet, is understandable. You have found the big step into understanding how the story will grow. This is the huge picture this season extends for the whole series. Whatsoever, in anime style, using characteristic clich\u00e9s of this industry.\\n\r\nAnd, still, I gave it a 7/10... Yes, it took my time, trust me, but that first argument, although it may not seem much, affects completely the viewing experience. And the whole season falls due to such. The characters are hardly developed and, other thing to mention, the concept studied lays too restricted/ limited in its undergoing. The story keeps changing directions, which is something that can be amazing when fulfilled nicely, and it also could have been in this show, even if 11-episodes short. Here, you don't feel the attention is worth it. Also, it can go indifferent according to the viewer, but the collision between languages, better, the way it is avoid, can be a itch on your back.\\n\r\nOne thing is certain, the idea thought regarding season one will change after you see the full series. You will understand things differently (although my initial review keeps solid), possibly giving a re-watch.\\n\r\nThe whole \"Nodame Cantabile\" is about life, desires and concerns. Again, it is not what you achieve, is the walk you walk.",

This last part of the series proved to be an enjoyable watch like its prequels, however was lacking in the conclusiveness and depth of character development. I feel several plot articles were rushed and the end to not fully satisfy (hence needing me read the Opera-hen). \r\nRegardless the finale of the anime, was very much, adagio cantabile. Song-like, floating and passing through all the twists and turns. The music used throughout the finale proved to be great selection, and the WAY the musicwas used brought out the nostalgic memories of old and worked my emotions into this series.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend watching the prequels prior to enjoying this amazing ending.",

            "content": "At last, we can see the closure to the one of much seen series of today\u2019s anime.\r\nIn this series Nodame and Chiaki\u2019s relationship is put to a test while pursuing their dreams. While Chiaki is a genius who learns and does music splendidly, Nodame on the other hand relays more in her instincts when it comes to music. Even though both are talented, Nodame is in a really different caliber. Chiaki keeps on moving forward and making so much success in the music world leaving behind Nodame. At this point, Nodame struggles so much and keeps on envying Chiaki so much to the point oflosing her motivation. She wanted to rush things and ended up feeling more inferior from Chiaki. Again! I really don\u2019t understand why she has to be jealous of Chiaki when she is so much more talented than him. The problem with Chiaki he forces Nodame to be greater and to dream even more considering she is so talented. It becomes a problem because Nodame is the type of a musician who\u2019s really hard to comprehend. She is like those famous artists who have a very complicated set of mind and forcing them can really break them. With her character, it should be done one step at a time. It\u2019s like he\u2019s holding Nodame so tight that he ended up losing her. Now, the problem with Nodame she keeps on trying to follow Chiaki when his already leaving her behind. This is the problem when a couple pursues their dreams in the same industry. They wanted to be together but ended up getting more far away from each other with their differences. And just when he thought she will be alright with the success of her first debut, she decided to stop playing the piano anymore. Anyways, it still ended well when both realized their differences and what they have done wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI was hoping more from it considering it was the finale after all. Though I am expecting too much because this series is one of my favorites it is still satisfying enough. I am going to miss it so much especially Nodame with her unique antics of her Mukya and Gyabo!\\n",
