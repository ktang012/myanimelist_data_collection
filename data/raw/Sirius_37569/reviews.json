            "content": "Although vampires have always been quite popular in the western culture they have never been mainstream in the anime medium. There are only a few titles which have the 'let's kill the vampires' premise, like Owari no Seraph and Hellsing, and they all have their own folklore and way to depict vampires. Now, does Sirius bring anything new to the table? Let\u2019s find out.\r\nThis review contains some spoilers.\r\nSTORY\r\nSet in 1930, Sirius the Jaeger follows the story of Yuliy and the \u201cJaegers\u201d, a vampire-hunter group which is chasing the Ark of Sirius, the plot device that gathers both sides of the conflict. As the Jaegers starttheir race to find the mysterious item, they find out they\u2019re not the only ones interested in the Ark, since vampires are also chasing it. Although the premise sounds really cool on paper, its execution was rather poor not only because of the extremely linear plot and uninteresting characters, but also because of the weak way everything was presented: the dreadful main character, the unexplored setting, the forgettable villains, just to name a few things.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the author forgot a crucial thing about making a vampire story: that the audience actually cares about the vampires. In Sirius, they\u2019re just boring creatures with not much detail and there\u2019s just nothing that differentiates them from other shows that have vampires in them. The only things about the vampires that should have been explained in order to enrich the world building are unexplained so that the audience can figure them out. And even if they are given an objective \u2013like being immortal- the vampires are presented in a very shallow way, so you won\u2019t care when they are killed. If you want the audience to care about the enemies of your story don't just present them as one-dimensional monsters whose only trait is to kill humans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main problem with Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is that it doesn\u2019t really do anything with its setting or characters. You have a cool group of guys that kill vampires and carry their weapons in musical instrument boxes and you don\u2019t do anything with it? It could have worked perfectly as a rule-of-cool type of show or even as a drama, but somehow they managed to make it a typical action show with nothing new. At least the battles are great, right? Unfortunately, no. Despite being well animated, there are no tactics or strategies involved in any of the fights, it\u2019s just a typical combat with no real way to know what each character will come up with or if they\u2019re going to use an inventive way to take down their enemies. The only thing you know for sure is that Yuliy is somehow going to win.\\n\\n\r\n-MAJOR SPOILERS-\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I should mention is that the last episode seems completely disconnected from the rest, pulling things that were not foreshadowed or mentioned before \u2013like the role of a Sirius saving the world and to let humanity live in peace with other races or the other sirius box that literally comes out of nowhere-. So I guess the sales are going well and P.A Works thought it would be a good idea to end the show hinting a second season.\\n\\n\r\n-END OF SPOILERS-\\n\\n\r\nNot everything is wrong with this anime, though, and it\u2019s actually satisfying that it doesn\u2019t try to be melodramatic or sad except for a few scenes and it always keeps its serious -no pun intended- tone, without adding unnecessary comedy. Plus, its pacing is actually bearable for the first part, since most of the chapters have a decent amount of action to keep things interesting and the plot doesn't seem as rushed as the second part, but that\u2019s just it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is that one we\u2019ve seen dozens of times ever since Attack on Titan came out: I want to kill all the titans-, I mean vampires! Yeah, he is also the only one the conveniently survives the massacre of his village and conveniently gets chased by only 1 werewolf and conveniently awakens his true powers, wow! How original was that? Even if he's given some development, it feels so rushed and disconnected from his original character that it makes it laughable. He changes at the very end of the story with nothing happening in between that would make him start thinking in another way.\\n\\n\r\nAll the secondary characters are just blank pieces of paper and serve no purpose in the story since they never have a big impact in the grand scheme of things and most of them are not even fleshed out. In a 12-episode series, you would generally expect to have at least 2 or 3 important characters on the spotlight for a couple of minutes but here no one is allowed to kill the enemies except for the main character. If the author at least bothered giving each of the Jaegers a backstory or some sort of development this wouldn't be so significant. The thing is, we don't know anything at all about them! The only member of the group which is given some screentime is Phillip and even that doesn't really tell us anything about him. The others -Dorothea and Fallon- are completely useless and are not given any sort of development.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s another particular character which for practical purposes I\u2019ll be calling the \u2018stalker girl\u2019. She is basically the generic love interest that is constantly trying to get some attention from the main guy. The stalker girl also constantly follows the main character wherever he goes (imagine if it was the other way around) and for some reason she is at least given some focus throughout the story. The funny part is\u2026 She was completely useless! She didn\u2019t have any purpose to be in the show and things would have been exactly the same if she wasn\u2019t there.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the villains\u2026 they\u2019re just as bad as the rest of the cast. When the first episode came out and a dozen villains were introduced it was quite obvious that they would be the generic one-dimensional villains that the good guys defeat in a single episode and you wouldn\u2019t remember their names afterwards. Also, as I mentioned before, there are a lot of things that were not explained about them. What\u2019s the origin of vampires and why is the rest of humanity not aware of their presence if they\u2019ve been around for so long? Not answered. What\u2019s up with the vampires\u2019 decease? Where does it come from? Not answered either.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, it is decent enough. The art style reminds me of other Bones shows, and especially resembles a lot to Bungo Stray Dogs (they even share the main character's voice actor). Most of the fights are, although bland, really well choreographed, the animation is fluid most of the times and the backgrounds are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe art director worked on many great titles like Gundam: The Origin and Cowboy Bebop and the one behind the sound direction was the legendary Jin Aketagawa, so you can expect quite a lot from the production values. The music in particular was actually really fitting, and the guy who composed it also produced Fate/Apocrypha and Iron-Blooded Orphans soundtrack, which are enjoyable at least. The voices are done by all well-known actors which play the same roles as they usually do (like Takehito Koyasu and Kenjirou Tsuda playing the villains) but nobody really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sirius is a forgettable, shallow and generic show. It doesn\u2019t do anything with its setting or characters and apart from the soundtrack or animation, there\u2019s really nothing fresh or new that would make it stand out from any other vampire show. If you are looking for good vampire action go watch Hellsing Ultimate or Vampire Hunter D. The first one is more of a rule-of-cool with silly comedy while the second one holds a more serious tone. In any case, both shows deliver a more compelling story and at the same time have a much more interesting cast.",

            "content": "Once in a while, I tend to enjoy a vampire theme show that is packed with action heroes and drama. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t remember any series of similar nature that intrigued me from these past few years. Many of them run with recycled concepts that includes Beauty and the Beast romance tales or the same survival themes over and over again. Then came along this show called Sirius the Jaeger.\r\nIt\u2019s quite unusual for P.A. Works to jump into a show with a vampire genre. They\u2019re mostly known for their slice of life shows and coming of age stories. Sometimes, they can pull out a surpriseor two like Spring 2016\u2019s Kuromukuro. However, this isn\u2019t mecha so you\u2019re not going to encounter giant robots. Instead, Sirius the Jaegar deals with a time of crisis when vampires are on the loose in the city. In the year of 1930, we are introduced to a group known as the Jaegers who act as specialized hunters with a goal to exterminate vampires. The plot focuses on a young man named Yuliy with a vengeance to kill vampires after his hometown was terrorized by them.\\n\\n\r\nSirius the Jaeger marks its spot very early in the show with its beautiful setting of the 1930s. The dark domain of Tokyo looks and feels like it\u2019s a time era for revolution. In fact, the first minutes of the episode had my eyes glued just at the background setting. P.A. Works are well known for their well-polished cinematography and production quality. In this series, they didn\u2019t disappoint with that in any way. The eerie alleyways, artistic architectures, and the old fashioned vehicles are just a few innovations to admire. Still, I think what people mostly are interested in here is the story. Vampire storytelling tends to be very niche these days that often involve in soap-opera like modern stories. For this show, it takes on a darker tale of revenge and self-discovery.\\n\\n\r\nIn wasting no time, we discover quickly that vampires are ravenous monsters with little care about mortality. In essence, they are beings with a desire to eat and kill humans for their own desire. Some vampires in the show are more sophisticated than others but most if not all possesses a insatiable appetite. They attack a party in the first episode while Yuliy and his gang of Jaegers hunts them down. It established them as a mercenary-like group who work like professional hunters. Yuliy tracks down a vampire named Agatha and the expression on his face says it all. It immediately gave me the impression that his hate of vampire runs much deeper than just what they are. Through flashbacks, we also learn about his past and how he became the person he is today. It\u2019s a tragic story that changes a person forever and he still seeks vengeance for his loss. Meanwhile, the vampires themselves have their own goal in the story and that\u2019s to find a mysterious object known as the Ark of Sirius. \\n\\n\r\nAt the heart of the show is still Yuliy. No matter how you look at it or accept him for who he is, it\u2019s very plot driven about his character. Yuliy is bent on revenge although he also cares about his comrades and certain people in the show that he encounters. This includes a girl named Ryouko who gets involved in his affairs. While not being an official member of the Jaegers, she does learn much more about the nature of vampires and occasionally provides assistance. The series also made it obvious that she develops affections towards him although their relationship doesn\u2019t really become a loving couple. This falls under a bit of the character clich\u00e9 that I\u2019ve seen over and over again in vampire theme shows. However, there are several other characters in the show that are worth looking into. First, there\u2019s Williard, a man who acts as commander of the Jaegers. He genuinely cares about his comrades and the show makes it clear how far he is willing to go to make the world into a better place. Dorotha is introduced as the main female of the group. With her expertise using firearms, she provides invaluable assistance on their missions. Similar to Yuliy, we also meet Philip, who shares a hate for vampires. Fallon offers more of the muscle for the group as the Jaegars needs a balanced team to get their business done. As impressive as this cast is, don\u2019t expect too much characterization on them. Yuliy is the one that gets the most spotlight and his character relationship with others is quite important.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most prominent character relationship in the series is between Yuliy and a man named Mikhail. Rather, they are actually brothers but now stands on the opposite side of each other. While Yuliy plays the role of an action hero, Mikhail follows a darker path that resulted in him becoming a vampire. As such, he is now the very embodiment of what Yuliy despises in the world. Their complicated relationship is told through meaningful dialogues, flashbacks, and how much each have changed. It sort of gave me the impression of a show called Owari no Seraph so for those who are familiar with that, this anime may be a treat for you. On the other hand, the vampire side of this series is mostly clouded in mystery. We meet characters like Yevgraf and Kershner with mysterious motives. Others like the vampire girls in the series are mostly added to bring in more action. There\u2019s even a mad scientist named Klarwein who allied himself with vampires for his experiments. I\u2019m also quite disappointed that one of the vampires advertised for this show  got killed off way too quickly. In retrospect, I think there\u2019s a big gap between the antagonists of and heroes of this series in terms of presentation. And unfortunately, the vampires took the pitfall.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal series made by P.A. Works can be a bit of a hit or miss. But as I mentioned before, it\u2019s hard not to take eyes off of the exceptional visual quality of this series. From the very first episode to the end, everything looked fluid and in style of the 1930s. Vampires are designed with a menacing look and their action speaks for themselves. Expect graphic violence to happen often in the show including blood being spilled by being bitten brutally or limps being torn off. It sells its fan service to make the vampire society look as dangerous as they can be. The Jaegars themselves also have distinctive looks especially for Yuliy\u2019s trademark blue eyes and hair style. Others such as Mikhail and Yevgraf are dressed in a more gentleman-like manner as a deception of their true nature. I should also mention that characters in the series all speak in their native tone regardless of their origins. Most of them deliver their personalities to the bone. Similarly, the theme songs in the show adds a feeling of dark melodrama with and unsettling mood. \\n\\n\r\nI think in the end, Sirius the Jaegar is a show that took on the vampire theme and made it into an action thriller with a feeling of suspense. P.A. Works remains one of my favorite studios for not just their production quality but also being able to continuously reinvent itself. For this particular show, it managed to do that by taking on a darker side of storytelling. To me, that\u2019s a thing of beauty.",

            "content": "Vampire series that are actually worth a praise are rarer than tinder users looking for serious relationship. My expectations were similar: 5/10 experience offering momentary satisfaction and some sucking. Turns out it has a story to tell, presents it with some humor and it's something bit different from the usual. \r\nStory:\r\nEven after 3 gigazillion different anime series about the same subject, the vampires still haven't learnt no matter who kicks their asses and how. This time our blood-sucking vampires are on rampage and give no shit about anything or anyone, baka. Lucky for us, intergalactic jazz band lands to Tokyo with their airship, and startskicking vampire butts in a way that goes beyond your wildest imaginations! Unless you have already seen the movie 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' in which case you will be entertained in the animated manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty bro. Our main characters are part of this vampire hunting organization which is almost like a mafia where everyone is part of the family. They go from place to another and save the day because they are real heroes and real men (/women). All of this is pretty based, of course, but its cliches are mainly presented in comedic manner, making sure viewers realize that the author is well aware that these are general tropes under these settings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLittle boys descending ropes while one handedly using a minigun. Rambo and Arnold make way, new GAR Jesus is in town and he weights like 60lbs. Another dude is probably Donatello's cousin or otherwise has mastered his art. There is also a dude who wears a monocle because he used to slaughter vampires before it was kewl. The real main character who can tell from the smell of a flower how well its roots are doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe vampires aren't typical villains who go insane and love murder because they do. Rather,  seem to have similar thing going on among themselves as the vampire hunters have. Our characerts are also not heavily protected by plot armors and nakama powers because characters can actually die in this narrative. \\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nInteresting choices exist here. The approach is rather similar to Princess Principal which had similar settings within almost the same time period. We get tons of scenery and design from the early 20th century from cars to city lights within the atmospheric towns. The art isn't amazing, but slightly above of the current medium quality. The series is not super detailed either, but some ideas have been executed in quite respectable manner, moon shots, for example. Seiyuu works aims to deliver seriousness and achieves it. The OP is also my personal favorite from this season, easily.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is fun as heck. Vampires drop like it's Skrillex with bass. It's almost hard to contrabass how well Jaegar succeeds with its entertainment value. \\n",

Don't skip over this one.\r\nA lot of people are hating on this piece because of the whole vampire/werewolf cliche. To be somewhat candid, if you hate cliches you probably don't actually like anime. Cliches are what defines genres in this scene and it's really not indicative of a series being bad or not (although it can definitely seem that way since so many badanime use a terribly large number of cliches).\\n\\n\r\nForget about that for a second and you'll find beautiful artwork, an engaging story line, great soundtracks, vibrant characters, smooth plot progression, well balanced tropes, and just an overall well coordinated anime. Now at the time of this review 4 episodes have come out so I'll definitely end up changing my final score for this anime (will almost probably drop from a 9 to an 8 in the middle and definitely drop again towards the end) and I really wish MAL would block people from reviewing anime until the whole series comes out but in any case here's my 2 cents on this in the hopes that you won't be deterred by the cliches!",

            "content": "You know what we have a lack of lately? Good vampire anime. Which is a shame because vampire anime can be diverse from the typical Horror anime to a more light hearted comedy anime. Normally, vampire anime land in the former with vampires either being the main villains or just being bad asses as the main character. Thankfully, P.A works has given us a vampire anime following a group of vampire hunters hoping to wipe them all out and stop any plans that they may have. But is the anime just style or does it have substance as well? \r\nSit back, relax and burn allcopies of Twilight and then show the fans what a real f*****g vampire looks like as I present to you the anime review of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger.....wait. When did they decide to change the name? Oh never mind. Lets begin shall we?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, vampires have been manipulating humanity for a very long time, influencing events so that they can maintain a food source, like the entire Earth is just one entire farm for them. However, once people starts realising what's going on, they will retaliate. Enter the Jagers, group of vampire hunters vowed to hunt down every single vampire. One Jager, Yuliy, has a bigger reason than most since he is the last survivor of his village which was destroyed by vampires. That is until his brother, Mikhail, returns from the dead and says that the vampires are looking for their peoples' greatest treasure, The Arc of Sirius. So Yuliy and the Jagers must stop their plans and kill all vampires that stand in their way to obtain The Arc of Sirius. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a pretty good base for a story right? Well, when you start watching it, yes. The show does start out good with some bad ass vampire slaying and an overarching major plot element that is building in the background. But it then starts to slow down and the momentum of this show starts to halt. Now I blame this on the fact that the story just doesn't have substance to it. There are side plots in this show that don't get developed enough to make them interesting and can make them forgettable. But these side plots could have helped make the story more dynamic and added some context to some of the characters motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus is always placed on stopping the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius, but it stumbles in that area too. It lacks detail and context behind some elements in the plot that can help make the plot more interesting and dynamic to help give intrigue of what the actions of the heroes and villains could cause to the main plot of the show. I've watched all episodes and I still have no idea what The Arc Of Sirius actually is. Instead, things just simply happen and we then move on to the next part of the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe shows biggest weakness is without a doubt its characters. Outside of one character, the cast of characters are just either boring, bland or just one note. Yuliy exemplifies this because he has no unique qualities. He is single minded and filled with revenge against the vampires for destroying his village. He sees his life have no purpose outside of killing vampires and when he hears about The Arc of Sirius, he realises he has a purpose in life but he must do it alone because only he can do this task and must shut out everyone. Talk about being boring and generic. When I saw that Uemura Yutto was voicing Yuliy (who also voiced Hiro from Darling in the Franxx this year, who I also thought was generic and boring), I knew that we were getting a generic character. What Yuliy says and what he does doesn't surprise or intrigue me because his motives are nothing new or unique from what I've seen from other main characters so I get an idea what he will say and do next. \\n\\n\r\nThis also applies to the Yagers as they are just as uninteresting as Yuily. Willard is the level headed leader of the group. Fallon is the happy and strong \"bro\" character. Dorothea is the smart but sexy female character. And Phillip is the back talking, sarcastic t**t character. The fact that I dismissed these characters with one sentence just shows how uninteresting they are. Willard is the only one that has some intrigue due to his backstory but not enough to get me interested. There is even a love interest, Ryouko, that goes nowhere. Like seriously, she has no relevance to the plot whatsoever and normally ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only interesting character is Mikhail, Yuliy's brother. Since he became a Vampire after their village was destroyed, he essentially becomes a point of conflict with Yuliy's desire to kill all vampires. But even though he his essentially the enemy, there are hints that he might be indirectly helping Yuliy stop the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius. He becomes a more intriguing character than Yuliy because you don't know where his true loyalties lie until near the end of the series. Does he want to help Yuliy or does he merely manipulate Yuliy to trust him only to betray him later on? \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show's animation is fantastic. Whether it is from the art direction or the fight scenes, everything in Sirius the Yager looks superb. The 1930s setting is greatly captured here with the character and environment designs being very distinct from one another. Now, in terms of the animation in the fight scenes, it is important that the fight scenes are fluid through the animation itself or though its use of clever cinematography to capture each scene. Thankfully, P.A works capture this very well and the fights are just an enjoyment to watch every single time due to the fluidity to it all. It helps distract the viewer of the poor story and characters because it is fun just seeing them slaughter vampires and show them who's boss. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is something that also captures the scenes but not enough to make it stand out. But unlike other shows, I know that it is there and is does help set an atmosphere and I appreciate that. Rather the sound effects were more noticeable to make it sound more realistic and add to the scenes. This especially true in the fight scenes where the clashing of weapons helps us feel the impact of each swing and clash. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Sirius\" by Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets is a very solid opening. Its use of silhouettes in its imagery help set a rather dark and broody atmosphere with the song being catchy enough to make the opening enjoyable to watch and listen to. The ending is again, very solid. It helps emphasise the fact that Yuliy and Mikhail were very close as brothers and had a lot of fun together before being torn apart when the vampires attacked their village. Kind of sad when you think about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem that I have with this show above everything else is that the overall show is just....boring outside of its animation quality. It's difficult to review something that does not do anything good but not anything bad, but instead is just bland. I said earlier that does this show just have style or does it have substance? No. It is all but style and little substance. The high quality animation can only carry this show so far before its story and characters have to help carry this show but it then stumbles when this happens. It doesn't develop its plot well enough and its overall characters are just too one note and boring to make me care. I like to prioritise story and characters to look for good anime since animation and sound only enhance the anime. This show is the opposite of this and it is a shame because I wanted to enjoy this show. It looks and sounds good but unfortunately, that is all there is to it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6.1/10  Recommendation: Don't Bother",

            "content": "Watching this series reminded me so much of spectacular vampire-supernatural series that have gone by like Hellsing Ultimate or Owari no Seraph. It's a good series through and through, and although there are many whom have milked the genres and put their own spin on it (only to fail badly), Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger offers something up its sleeve to the point of being captivating, and yet being so underrated.\r\nStory:\r\nSimilar to series like Princess Principal for the old 20th Century London-esque time period, we have the usual Van Helsing or Constantine type of shows, where said person arrives in some place that is chock-full ofvampires to hunt, then meet up with people (presumably the Japanese government) that liaise to do and deal the same treatment: investigate, plan, seek, kill and destroy the source. That's what Yuily and his team of vampire exterminators are here for this purpose.\\n\\n\r\nFor Yuliy, it's a fight that has been overbearing since his childhood days: The village of Dogville, the people residing there may look normal, but with Yuliy being the last of its kind as Sirius, there presents an unescapable fate with what is the triggering catalyst: \"The Arc of Sirius\", a ball-shaped item of powers unimaginable meant to keep both Jaegers and vampires away that could reshape humanity according to the user's wish. This is protected by Yuily's father, in preparation for the future to come, and for both survivors of the massacre, Mikhail (older brother) and Yuliy (younger brother) must both protect at all costs. Midway, the unexpected betrayal ensues that Mikhail changed sides to help the vampires (with Yevgraf), presumably to keep his life intact from protecting Yuliy from the vampires. With that in mind, Yuliy has a number on his shoulders to not just fend off vampires alone, but to awaken his brother back to his senses.\\n\\n\r\nFor such a story, it's refreshing to have an omage to certain series and the tried-and-true methods past. However, you're gonna have to plunder through boring and slow parts (say for the majority of the series), but when it picks up steam, that's when the story gets more interesting and engaging with the ever-so-constant build-up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe \"Jaeger\" team: Yuliy, Dorothea, Philip, Professor Williard + the side counterparts (Fallon etc.)\\n\r\nA merciless band of vampire slayers crafted from their usual expertise, I must say that these characters, as fun as there is to watch their every move, they give the sense that for all their strengths and weaknesses, they balance well together, making up for the subtle differences which testifies their skills to a T. And if you can tell from the usual cliche of a team of men and a woman, where the female is the damsel in distress? Sorry, but that ain't the case as Dorothea is a skilled shooter herself, firm and able to be trusted with much. \\n\\n\r\nThe commoner team: Ryouko, Hideomi (and I know I've missed a few others)\\n\r\nFor once, I thought that her love obsession with Yuliy was just for show...but for her to follow Yuliy along with his plan is underwhelming to say the least. At most, she's just there for story exposition to make Yuliy's life a bit more interesting, but other than that, a filler character. At least there are people in the Japanese government would be concerned\\n\\n\r\nThe vampire team: Yevgraf, the vampire Twins (vaguely shown), Kershner, Klarwein, Mikhail (through blood pact), the catalyst Agatha\\n\r\nYevgraf is the epitmony of evil: the Devil incarnate himself. Awaiting the Arc of Sirius that has been laid dormant for the vampires for an insane amount of time, he does not stop at anything to achieve his ambitions, at the expense of others. The fearsome enemy who uses a blood pact to hold those who has been resurrected as vampires, and then sees them as a tool to help aid in his efforts. Kershner is no different, except that he sees it as being Yevgraf's strategist and most capable helpline to him. Same issues and characteristics with Klarwein, the insane experimentalist (equal to Back to the Future's Doc Brown). All are committed to seeing Yevgraf's vision happen, with the side-effects of being tools just for the moment.\\n\\n\r\nAn overall (almost) well-rounded character lineup, but the problem of being one-dimensional is truly the weakest connection here.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nWhenever P.A. Works are down for almost any anime, I'm a hardcore fan for whatever shows they make for their beautiful artwork and great animation, and Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger doesn't disappoint. Since it's an action-oriented show, what better way to call forth a director who handles good action, and that name is Masahiro Andou, known for his works on Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell and more.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that this series is a major departure from their usual SoL or coming-of-age of works past, but what's best to know is that everything about it is left intact, and is safe to say that this series stands out because of impressive art and animation. Good game and a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nDamn, yet another area where the series nailed it to perfection. The OST is a spectacular pickup just for the series alone. Both the OP and ED helped set the pace for the series to follow, shadowing the events that lie ahead for everyone (especially Yuliy and Mikhail), and is a blast listening to. As with any action series, the SFX really gets loud under load so much so that it causes some distortion and causes a major distraction sometimes. It's noticeable, yet it feels just about any other action anime would be at its best caliber.\\n\\n\r\nTenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is quite the production, but production itself can't tell the whole story, and that's where the series' Achilles Heel start to show up: The slow and methodical story along with the characters, emotionless and only care about their field of range (or mission). After being burnt by so many vampire series, I'd say this is at a level where it's neither good nor bad, but the hopes of knowing whatever the heck is going on here is least to say the best. Good try, but one could hope there's improvements to be made. Recommendations though? Just purely for action alone.",

            "content": "- Story -\r\nSeems like a fairly standard story involving different factions, the main two being the Jaegers and the Vampires. As of episode 4, the pacing feels a little slow for my taste. Most of the story elements are all things that we have seen before in other anime, and they are told in a very familiar way, as well.\r\n- Art / Animation -\r\nVery solid and consistent so far. The fight scenes are 90% the reason why I'm still watching this.\r\n- Sound -\r\nSound is great, especially during fight scenes. No complaints here.\r\n- Character - \r\nThis is where the anime fails for me. In the firstepisode, we are introduced to Ryoko, a character that falls in love with the MC (not sure why). Her character feels completely useless to the story and she does not seem to serve any purpose other than the writers wanting to shove an unnecessary love story down our throats. She is given way more screen time than she deserves, screen time that could have been used to develop other interesting characters (i.e. the MC or the Jaegers). \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, she is the character that is most removed from any of the conflict in the show, therefore offering us a unique perspective. Unfortunately, her perspective is boring af, she is simply uninteresting and irritating. IMO, some of her actions are irrational and make little sense for a girl her age, and make her character even more insufferable. \\n\\n\r\nBecause they are giving her a fair amount of screen time, I believe they are planning some type of arc for her trash character. Which is a shame, because I just don't see it paying off, and I would have liked to learn more about the other characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment -\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell so far, I really enjoy the fight scenes, they are certainly the highlight of this show for me. However, the slow pacing, partially due to the writers giving a shitty useless character too much screen time, is really making my viewing experience unenjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n- Overall -\\n\r\nStory feels unoriginal, but not too cliched or tropey. \\n\r\nAnimation and fight scenes are great, so far.\\n\r\nRyoko is a shit character and I hope she dies. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR\\n\r\nWould have been a perfectly fine - good anime if it weren't for a POS character.\\n\\n",

But be warned that there is an element in this show that, at least for me broke my enjoyment to where it became unwatchable.\r\nTenrou: Sirius the Jaeger has a lot of promise, but at least for me it was bogged down by the one aspect of anime that can make or break a show; the romance element.\r\n Character is the lifeblood of a visual medium as we the audience have no other means to immerse ourselves in the world we arepresented in than through the characters presented. For the most part, the main cast look promising with every flavor of character type you usually run into in action anime. However, what goodwill I have for the story stops the minute the designated romance character enters stage left. You will know her when you see her, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the minute this character shows up and every scene that follows with her she annoys. She feels like less a character and more a device set up solely for the purpose of being with the main character. You just know the story will bend to the will of the writers insistence on her importance and her being with the main character, and that is the saddest part.\\n\\n\r\nNow of course, I could be wrong about all of this. However, from the 5 episodes I watched, it became increasingly more plausible that the story would suffer with her inclusion. \\n\\n\r\nJust a warning to anyone wishing to actually watch an enjoyable anime and not just self insert like this is a visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/5\\n\r\nMusic:4/5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Groanworthy/5\\n\\n",

I was sure that this would be a strong runner for the best anime of the season.\r\nBut from this anime, I realize a lot of series could be measured using a two-number metric. The first number is the episode where you cringe for the first time. The second number is the episode whereyou feel like everything is falling apart; the art quality is no longer brilliant, the directing is no longer interesting, the plot has succumbed to cliches and boring tropes, the characters no longer have a distinct shine.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, for this anime, these two numbers were 7 and 10.",

            "content": "The nature of P.A. Works is defined by the company's ability to sustain itself with primarily original works with only the odd adaptation here and there with major influence by the company itself.\u00a0 And so here we're presented with 'Sirius the Jaeger', P.A.'s take on vampires and a war against them.\r\nStory:\r\nIn the town of Dogville lies an ancient artifact known as the 'Ark of Sirius', an object filled with such insurmountable power that all major countries in the world (seemingly) wish to possess it.\u00a0 It's here where we meet the last Sirius, Yuliy, and the vampire hunting Jaegers who try to uncover and thwart theplan of the vampires that've set foot in Nihon land in search for the Ark for unknown reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning a vampire defeating plot that lasts a cour, Sirius is a show set in 1930's Japan that follows many of your typical revenge plot tropes in order to sustain its story.\u00a0 Yuliy, being the last surviving member of his people after they were slaughtered by vampires, sets out to 'KILL ALL THE VAMPIRES' in order to get his vengeance.\u00a0 It's a show that has a decently paced by the numbers story that doesn't try to overstep its boundaries before the conclusion.\u00a0 It's because of this that I find few positives to note cause nothing about its storyline is even that memorable, yet still manages to be a decent viewing experience despite that.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, given how this is a P.A. Works show, the importance of the story lies in its ending, as the company's history of floundering to the finish line becomes evident the closer episode twelve reaches.\u00a0 Reason being is the show just throws down reasons in front of the audience for things like like why the vampires are searching for the Ark in the first place towards the end like it fixes the innate issue.\u00a0 The attempt at sympathy and explaining previously untouched details so close to the end doesn't impact things too much, but instead misses the show's overall potential as the motivations and overall storytelling could've been drastically improved had it been revealed and built upon earlier, instead of being an \"Oh crap, we forgot to add some things\" moment that muddies the overall ending.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, Sirius the Jaeger ends with the same P.A. Works standard of 'Good idea, bad execution', as some aspects like the Sirius as a people was one that had potential, but failed due to the show never bothering with giving them the time they needed to be fully fleshed out.\u00a0 Its slower climb to the climax ultimately hurts it, which is a darn shame considering the amount of innate potential that could've happened should the series have gotten its feet off the ground a little sooner.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent pacing\\n\r\n+ Good slow buildup\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Way too fast of a climax\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I describe Yuliy as a discount first season Eren Jaeger, as our protagonist's main quirk in the series erupts from his desire to avenge his people after vampires slaughtered them all seventeen years ago.\u00a0 Thankfully rage isn't his only character trait, and we instead get to see a lost puppy looking for answers for a greater majority of the series.\u00a0 There honestly isn't much to say about Yuliy, as the plot is pretty much the only drive he has to even do anything.\u00a0 His motivations come from the events of the story, and any decisions he makes only seem to be a natural progression that results in the show's conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this sadly is a fact that the rest of the cast faces as the show's is the only real driving motivation for them.\u00a0 Any actual motivation for Yevgraf, the show's supposed antagonist, is revealed so late (episode 11) that there's almost no reason for the audience to care because of it.\u00a0 Sure you get some quirkiness like banter between the Jaegers and the apparent obsession of the vampire mad scientist Klarwein, but most of that is just fluff and doesn't add anything to note aside from drawing lines in the sand to note who's on what side and add the illusion to flavor in an otherwise straightforward and kind of bland show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Entire cast is just kinda...there\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNow, this being a P.A. Works show, I don't actually have a lot of complaints for it because of how consistent the company usually is in its production.\u00a0 A few off scenes here and there did happen, but Sirius is otherwise a show that's presented in the P.A. Works style with very few negatives to really speak of.\u00a0 It's crisp, there's fluidity in the action, this is one of the company's aspects that deserves its share of praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAptly titled \"Sirius\", by\u00a0Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets is a song rock/action piece that's really grown on me to become one of my favorite openings in recent memory.\u00a0 Its mix of soft and louder tones at various points in the song lend it to become something that I find worth being memorable and repeat listens to.\u00a0 Again, a feat that P.A. Works is surprisingly good at achieving.\u00a0 By comparison,\u00a0\"Hoshie\" by sajou no hana is a more somber piece that I find isn't as memorable as its OP sister, but still has its fair share of memorable points being a song that ties more into the emotional aspects of Yuliy's existence as the last Sirius, which exemplifies the point more even if the show doesn't do much to aid it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe mantra I have for P.A. Works as a whole seems to always trail back to \"Good ideas, bad execution\".\u00a0 It's happened to Charlotte, it's happened to Nagiasu, Angel Beats!, hell I'll even extend that notion to Kuromukuro despite that project's rockiness from the start.\u00a0 Because of this, I came into Sirius with very cautious expectations, reminding myself that things still can and will go wrong later down the line, which was an unfortunate truth that came into being, though thankfully the crash wasn't nearly from very high up.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I still found Sirius the Jaeger to still be an enjoyable viewing experience.\u00a0 While I don't trust that the company will ever find its footing, it's nice to see the diversity in their works and how they still have the heart and soul to create original projects even though they don't always work out like they may have originally intended.\u00a0 Many things like the lore of the Sirius and that copout of an antagonistic motivation, as well the mess that was Ryouko's sideplot (which wasn't even a necessary aspect of the show aside from cheap excuse for some romance) REALLY could've used work, but it's still all in all a decent show that makes a good callback to original portrayals of vampires as people preying, grotesque, transformed creatures of the night.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to watch it if you feel inclined, as its good for a piece of non-fanservicy entertainment, but not one that can garner a lot of praise due to numerous flaws and overall lack of anything new to bring to the table.\u00a0 Not much more can be said, but I'm at least glad P.A. Works is taking smaller risks with their original content.\u00a0 Wouldn't want another Charlotte incident, now would we?",

            "content": "When the first episode aired, I seriously was in awe. I found Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger attractive in the art and I was drawn to its world, eagerly waiting for a new episode each week with great expectations that were never truly met.\r\nI was struck by beautiful animation and introduced to a plot about vampires, action, fight and interesting characters. And the way the first episode ended was when I said to myself: it's perfect, what else could I ask for?\r\n[ STORY ]\r\nWell, thing is, story-wise, I don't find it engaging. It lacks depth to actually make me invested in what's going on and itfeels to me like everything's a bit messy and thrown around here and there so the pace is weird as well as the progression of the plot which by episode 7, we still don't know a lot of. It just feels so \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nI also don't know why they try to force \"romance\" (because I don't really know what to call it) in there when it's clearly unnecessary. I'd rather focus on the plot than having an annoying character serving absolutely no other purpose than being MC's forced love interest to use yet another clich\u00e9 trope that I can see as being the anchor of the MC for existential purposes (considering that this whole thing is taking up from 40% to 50% of an episode...).\\n\\n\r\n[ ART ]\\n\r\nThe art is really good and to me, it's one of the strengths of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger. The animation is fluid, the fights are animated well and delightful to watch and I just love the whole universe they recreated and the vibe it throws.\\n\\n\r\n[ SOUND ]\\n\r\nWell, to be honest, as I write this I don't even remember what the soundtracks or the OP sound like so it sums it pretty well, I'd say. Forgettable.\\n\\n\r\n[ CHARACTERS ]\\n\r\nThe same goes for the characters. The chara-design is very unique to each character and very enjoyable but it's a bit disappointing that we don't get to dig deeper into their stories and their personalities. It'll all on the surface and just as the plot, they lack depth.\\n\r\nOur MC gets a good backstory though, but the way he evolves to the present day and connects with the plot doesn't do it for me (especially because they use a trope that we could easily foresee). It could have been so much better. In the early episodes, I was expecting a strong character development coming from him with which we could connect strongly but it never happened. \\n\\n\r\n[ ENJOYMENT & OVERALL ]\\n\r\nIt's still entertaining as is but mainly because I watch this weekly. I don't think I'd binge-watch the whole thing with what I've seen so far but maybe there's still a way for this anime to repent, eh? Though I don't think so.\\n\r\nAlso, I don't really care about neither the plot nor the characters and what's happening which is a shame. I really try to connect but I just can't.",

            "content": "Oh Lord, where do I begin with this anime.\r\nFirst things first, I have a bit of a weak spot for trashy vampire animes. I'd had my eye on this one for a while and finally decided to boot it up on Netflix to play in the background while I worked. I was a bit concerned at first that I might miss parts of the plot, but...yeah...I'll get to that.\r\nSo Sirius the Jaeger is basically another Vampire vs Werewolves show with a magical macguffin that one side wants to use to have ultimate power, blah, blah. It's far from groundbreaking, but that's part of the fun.The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch and I binged all of the way to episode ten without hesitation. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it's good, this show is on a potential par to shows like FMA (some arcs of it really reminded me of FMA). When it's bad, it's a mess, and for the most part it's a mess.\\n\\n\r\nSirius the Jaeger suffers from SEVERE pacing issues and a lot of that comes down to its 12 episode run time. The story line, world and characters simply don't get the time, love and attention they need, except for Sirius, which again, I'll come to later. In one scene, it's revealed that there's conflict between two of the main characters because of something very bad that happened in the past (trying to avoid spoilers), but it's not really touched on ever again. Early on there's a plotline with a doctor that reminded me of the Tucker arc in FMA, where the doctor character lives with his cute daughter and is doing desperate experiments. It's a really interesting arc and given a good deal of gravitas...but soon afterwards that plotline is quite literally dropped and when we hear about it again it's played up for a weird kind of comic relief by a villain who literally falls down a cliff face after what might as well be a five second fight and is never heard from again. Like...what?? Discount Shou Tucker didn't die for this level of disrespect. Even the final battle falls flat to the point of being funny because there is no build up or tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing also causes issues with continuity. One character basically leaves home and their family follow them (to ANOTHER country I might add), only for them to come back a couple of episodes later like yup, I was being young and stupid I'll be good now...and it's literally NEVER commented on or addressed. Did the family ever find out? Are they still randomly stuck overseas? Are they still looking for them?\\n\\n\r\nWe never really find out much about the mysterious order that Sirius and the others belong to. Heck, we don't even find out much about the Ark, which is the core of the plot. I got all of the way to the end of episode 12 without really understanding what it was beyond the fact that the Vampires shouldn't get it because That Would Be Bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets a decent character arc is Sirius, which I don't mind because he is semi decent as an anime protagonist for the first half of the show. By the second half, the storyline about his brother and the Ark and his tribe borders on contrived and at the end I was pretty bored of him because he fell into almost every protag cliche in the book. Run away to deal with things on your own even though it just...DEFIES logic? Check. Keep the valuable object on your person even though you KNOW you're going to end up in a fight soon and it's probably going to get stolen? Check. The final episode has a very, very emotionally charged scene, but it falls completely flat because of the terrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, this show isn't awful, but it could have been so much more. It's fun to watch, but that's about it. It's not going to leave you thinking afterwards, but it will leave you wanting more (if that makes sense).\\n\\n\r\nEnd note: are his tribe supposed to be Inuit? Because if so that's HILARIOUS",

            "content": "Sirius the Cringe Beast Review (Minor Spoilers You Won't Really Care About)\r\nI think the most analogous scene to summarize the whole of this series can be found halfway through the end of its final episode. In that scene our main character says this, \"I know what to do, I've finally found my path\" and he is then immediately punched straight in the face and sent plummeting into the depths of the Atlantic fucking ocean. Visually, this is a pretty great looking show, the lighting effects and fight scenes can be pretty entertaining, but it is also somewhat inconsistent with quite a few instances of comicallyjanky animation in less action-oriented scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of a ragtag group of the most bare bones, stereotypical members of your party in literally every JRPG ever made. There's jolly buff guy with beard, special agent d cups, edgy guy with dark past, elderly mentor wearing a monocle and of course, twink, how could we forget about good ol' twink? The antagonists on the other hand are stock mini bosses and minions ripped straight out of Castlevania led by possibly the most insufferable Shakespearean twat with a top hat in the history of anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo get a good grasp on the entertainment value of this show, here's a description of a portion of its epic final battle. An insufferable twat with a top hat eats a big marble and transforms into a gargoyle with the face of Anthony Hopkins, but also somehow transforms his full suit into a bedazzled black unitard with sparkling elf shoes that somehow grow back even after you cut his legs off. Now that's anime. The first 3/4ths of the show were actually decently engaging and entertaining, but man oh man, grab yourself a couple of buddies and brews and you will have a banger of a time watching the bombastic circus fire it devolves into for the final quarter. Sirius the Jaeger is an initially average anime that evolves into such supreme trash as it goes on that I'd have to classify it as a 4 out of 10, so bad it's good.",

            "content": "Ahhh this anime frustrated me; because SO many elements were done wonderfully. But there were just some foundational things that made it a complete mess.\r\nLet's start with the good: \r\n1. Character Design and Setting--BEAUTIFUL. All the characters are visually bright, diverse, interesting and modern despite the time period of the setting. Quite a few hotties here, and that's never a bad thing.\r\n2. Action-- FANTASTIC! From the start, it's fast-paced, engaging and there are many moments where I was literally on the edge of my seat. There's a fairly badass train scene that I watched multiple times, actually.\r\n3. Story (Kind of)--There's also some bad with this,but this is the \"good\" section so let me focus. The back story in particular was very well crafted. It made me care, and I easily became invested within the main characters after a few short episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow the bad:\\n\\n\r\n1. Story-- Waaaay too complicated and overwrought. There are literally three organizations at play (and some of them have multiple code names... I had to watch it twice to figure that piece out), and it's just too much. They could have taken out an entire organization and had the same story line. I ended up just ignoring it and focusing on the other things. I'm not here for all that.\\n\\n\r\n2. Silly Female Character that Doesn't Belong--Need I say more? Every time she came on screen, I literally yelled, \"What is your purpose??\" It's like she accidentally wandered in from the shojo anime next door, and no one has told her where the exit is. So frustrating. But to be fair, she has guts. No one told her where the exit is, but she's doing the best she can in the meantime.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Ending--Sucks. They spent the entire story leading us as an audience in a particular direction, then they TOTALLY dropped the ball. Why would you do that!? And you mean to tell me that no one in this entire project saw this blatant misstep?? Nobody said, \"Hey guys, maybe we shouldn't end it this way?\" I can't understand. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a fun watch. Ignoring the politics and complex details of the plot-- the hotties, beautiful artwork and action scenes are what drove me to finish. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend? Sure. But with caution. When they start to get weirdly and overly political, just ignore it and focus on how pretty it is.",

Everything you'd want is there, so where's the unfortunate part?\r\nThis show has a serious pacing issue. It moves a mile a minute, never taking the proper time to set up conflicts and build the stakes. By the time you get to the climax, you don't really know what will happen if the bad guy wins,you just know it will bad, and that is supposed to be enough. \\n\\n\r\nThey flesh out a handful of the key players and the rest of the not that massive cast of heroes and villains are lucky if they a couple minutes of backstory to flesh them out.

A group of people who make their mission to find and battle vampires. However, the execution of it was just . . . lightly put, EXTREMELY subpar. Ryouko's character didn't add ANY substance to the plot at all, and in fact, was more so a hindrance. When you add a character, there has to be some development and growth that the character adds to the other characters or to him/herself. But nope, she was just blindly in love with Yuliy (MC) and followedhim blindly and didn't even cause trouble to clean up! Just a minor subplot that again, didn't add to anything. Another thing that bothered me was Mikhail's character. He reminded me of Uchiha Itachi in his relationship to Yuliy/Sasuke. He was good turned evil and wanted his brother to stop chasing vengeance. But due to the episode constraints, the development of this relationship was too fast and ultimately too little of a buildup towards the ending. The only character I liked was Hideomi Iba, the detective guy. He was witty and well-developed, showing background of the military while simultaneously funny. In contrast to the other tropes mentioned, he added background to the story and ultimately was what made me continue watching. All in all, I would not recommend this anime at all, but if you're looking for something that has good art, sound, and a semi-decent plot, here's something for you.",

            "content": "Although vampires have always been quite popular in the western culture they have never been mainstream in the anime medium. There are only a few titles which have the 'let's kill the vampires' premise, like Owari no Seraph and Hellsing, and they all have their own folklore and way to depict vampires. Now, does Sirius bring anything new to the table? Let\u2019s find out.\r\nThis review contains some spoilers.\r\nSTORY\r\nSet in 1930, Sirius the Jaeger follows the story of Yuliy and the \u201cJaegers\u201d, a vampire-hunter group which is chasing the Ark of Sirius, the plot device that gathers both sides of the conflict. As the Jaegers starttheir race to find the mysterious item, they find out they\u2019re not the only ones interested in the Ark, since vampires are also chasing it. Although the premise sounds really cool on paper, its execution was rather poor not only because of the extremely linear plot and uninteresting characters, but also because of the weak way everything was presented: the dreadful main character, the unexplored setting, the forgettable villains, just to name a few things.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the author forgot a crucial thing about making a vampire story: that the audience actually cares about the vampires. In Sirius, they\u2019re just boring creatures with not much detail and there\u2019s just nothing that differentiates them from other shows that have vampires in them. The only things about the vampires that should have been explained in order to enrich the world building are unexplained so that the audience can figure them out. And even if they are given an objective \u2013like being immortal- the vampires are presented in a very shallow way, so you won\u2019t care when they are killed. If you want the audience to care about the enemies of your story don't just present them as one-dimensional monsters whose only trait is to kill humans.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main problem with Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is that it doesn\u2019t really do anything with its setting or characters. You have a cool group of guys that kill vampires and carry their weapons in musical instrument boxes and you don\u2019t do anything with it? It could have worked perfectly as a rule-of-cool type of show or even as a drama, but somehow they managed to make it a typical action show with nothing new. At least the battles are great, right? Unfortunately, no. Despite being well animated, there are no tactics or strategies involved in any of the fights, it\u2019s just a typical combat with no real way to know what each character will come up with or if they\u2019re going to use an inventive way to take down their enemies. The only thing you know for sure is that Yuliy is somehow going to win.\\n\\n\r\n-MAJOR SPOILERS-\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I should mention is that the last episode seems completely disconnected from the rest, pulling things that were not foreshadowed or mentioned before \u2013like the role of a Sirius saving the world and to let humanity live in peace with other races or the other sirius box that literally comes out of nowhere-. So I guess the sales are going well and P.A Works thought it would be a good idea to end the show hinting a second season.\\n\\n\r\n-END OF SPOILERS-\\n\\n\r\nNot everything is wrong with this anime, though, and it\u2019s actually satisfying that it doesn\u2019t try to be melodramatic or sad except for a few scenes and it always keeps its serious -no pun intended- tone, without adding unnecessary comedy. Plus, its pacing is actually bearable for the first part, since most of the chapters have a decent amount of action to keep things interesting and the plot doesn't seem as rushed as the second part, but that\u2019s just it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is that one we\u2019ve seen dozens of times ever since Attack on Titan came out: I want to kill all the titans-, I mean vampires! Yeah, he is also the only one the conveniently survives the massacre of his village and conveniently gets chased by only 1 werewolf and conveniently awakens his true powers, wow! How original was that? Even if he's given some development, it feels so rushed and disconnected from his original character that it makes it laughable. He changes at the very end of the story with nothing happening in between that would make him start thinking in another way.\\n\\n\r\nAll the secondary characters are just blank pieces of paper and serve no purpose in the story since they never have a big impact in the grand scheme of things and most of them are not even fleshed out. In a 12-episode series, you would generally expect to have at least 2 or 3 important characters on the spotlight for a couple of minutes but here no one is allowed to kill the enemies except for the main character. If the author at least bothered giving each of the Jaegers a backstory or some sort of development this wouldn't be so significant. The thing is, we don't know anything at all about them! The only member of the group which is given some screentime is Phillip and even that doesn't really tell us anything about him. The others -Dorothea and Fallon- are completely useless and are not given any sort of development.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s another particular character which for practical purposes I\u2019ll be calling the \u2018stalker girl\u2019. She is basically the generic love interest that is constantly trying to get some attention from the main guy. The stalker girl also constantly follows the main character wherever he goes (imagine if it was the other way around) and for some reason she is at least given some focus throughout the story. The funny part is\u2026 She was completely useless! She didn\u2019t have any purpose to be in the show and things would have been exactly the same if she wasn\u2019t there.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the villains\u2026 they\u2019re just as bad as the rest of the cast. When the first episode came out and a dozen villains were introduced it was quite obvious that they would be the generic one-dimensional villains that the good guys defeat in a single episode and you wouldn\u2019t remember their names afterwards. Also, as I mentioned before, there are a lot of things that were not explained about them. What\u2019s the origin of vampires and why is the rest of humanity not aware of their presence if they\u2019ve been around for so long? Not answered. What\u2019s up with the vampires\u2019 decease? Where does it come from? Not answered either.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\\n\r\nVisually speaking, it is decent enough. The art style reminds me of other Bones shows, and especially resembles a lot to Bungo Stray Dogs (they even share the main character's voice actor). Most of the fights are, although bland, really well choreographed, the animation is fluid most of the times and the backgrounds are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe art director worked on many great titles like Gundam: The Origin and Cowboy Bebop and the one behind the sound direction was the legendary Jin Aketagawa, so you can expect quite a lot from the production values. The music in particular was actually really fitting, and the guy who composed it also produced Fate/Apocrypha and Iron-Blooded Orphans soundtrack, which are enjoyable at least. The voices are done by all well-known actors which play the same roles as they usually do (like Takehito Koyasu and Kenjirou Tsuda playing the villains) but nobody really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sirius is a forgettable, shallow and generic show. It doesn\u2019t do anything with its setting or characters and apart from the soundtrack or animation, there\u2019s really nothing fresh or new that would make it stand out from any other vampire show. If you are looking for good vampire action go watch Hellsing Ultimate or Vampire Hunter D. The first one is more of a rule-of-cool with silly comedy while the second one holds a more serious tone. In any case, both shows deliver a more compelling story and at the same time have a much more interesting cast.",

            "content": "Once in a while, I tend to enjoy a vampire theme show that is packed with action heroes and drama. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t remember any series of similar nature that intrigued me from these past few years. Many of them run with recycled concepts that includes Beauty and the Beast romance tales or the same survival themes over and over again. Then came along this show called Sirius the Jaeger.\r\nIt\u2019s quite unusual for P.A. Works to jump into a show with a vampire genre. They\u2019re mostly known for their slice of life shows and coming of age stories. Sometimes, they can pull out a surpriseor two like Spring 2016\u2019s Kuromukuro. However, this isn\u2019t mecha so you\u2019re not going to encounter giant robots. Instead, Sirius the Jaegar deals with a time of crisis when vampires are on the loose in the city. In the year of 1930, we are introduced to a group known as the Jaegers who act as specialized hunters with a goal to exterminate vampires. The plot focuses on a young man named Yuliy with a vengeance to kill vampires after his hometown was terrorized by them.\\n\\n\r\nSirius the Jaeger marks its spot very early in the show with its beautiful setting of the 1930s. The dark domain of Tokyo looks and feels like it\u2019s a time era for revolution. In fact, the first minutes of the episode had my eyes glued just at the background setting. P.A. Works are well known for their well-polished cinematography and production quality. In this series, they didn\u2019t disappoint with that in any way. The eerie alleyways, artistic architectures, and the old fashioned vehicles are just a few innovations to admire. Still, I think what people mostly are interested in here is the story. Vampire storytelling tends to be very niche these days that often involve in soap-opera like modern stories. For this show, it takes on a darker tale of revenge and self-discovery.\\n\\n\r\nIn wasting no time, we discover quickly that vampires are ravenous monsters with little care about mortality. In essence, they are beings with a desire to eat and kill humans for their own desire. Some vampires in the show are more sophisticated than others but most if not all possesses a insatiable appetite. They attack a party in the first episode while Yuliy and his gang of Jaegers hunts them down. It established them as a mercenary-like group who work like professional hunters. Yuliy tracks down a vampire named Agatha and the expression on his face says it all. It immediately gave me the impression that his hate of vampire runs much deeper than just what they are. Through flashbacks, we also learn about his past and how he became the person he is today. It\u2019s a tragic story that changes a person forever and he still seeks vengeance for his loss. Meanwhile, the vampires themselves have their own goal in the story and that\u2019s to find a mysterious object known as the Ark of Sirius. \\n\\n\r\nAt the heart of the show is still Yuliy. No matter how you look at it or accept him for who he is, it\u2019s very plot driven about his character. Yuliy is bent on revenge although he also cares about his comrades and certain people in the show that he encounters. This includes a girl named Ryouko who gets involved in his affairs. While not being an official member of the Jaegers, she does learn much more about the nature of vampires and occasionally provides assistance. The series also made it obvious that she develops affections towards him although their relationship doesn\u2019t really become a loving couple. This falls under a bit of the character clich\u00e9 that I\u2019ve seen over and over again in vampire theme shows. However, there are several other characters in the show that are worth looking into. First, there\u2019s Williard, a man who acts as commander of the Jaegers. He genuinely cares about his comrades and the show makes it clear how far he is willing to go to make the world into a better place. Dorotha is introduced as the main female of the group. With her expertise using firearms, she provides invaluable assistance on their missions. Similar to Yuliy, we also meet Philip, who shares a hate for vampires. Fallon offers more of the muscle for the group as the Jaegars needs a balanced team to get their business done. As impressive as this cast is, don\u2019t expect too much characterization on them. Yuliy is the one that gets the most spotlight and his character relationship with others is quite important.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most prominent character relationship in the series is between Yuliy and a man named Mikhail. Rather, they are actually brothers but now stands on the opposite side of each other. While Yuliy plays the role of an action hero, Mikhail follows a darker path that resulted in him becoming a vampire. As such, he is now the very embodiment of what Yuliy despises in the world. Their complicated relationship is told through meaningful dialogues, flashbacks, and how much each have changed. It sort of gave me the impression of a show called Owari no Seraph so for those who are familiar with that, this anime may be a treat for you. On the other hand, the vampire side of this series is mostly clouded in mystery. We meet characters like Yevgraf and Kershner with mysterious motives. Others like the vampire girls in the series are mostly added to bring in more action. There\u2019s even a mad scientist named Klarwein who allied himself with vampires for his experiments. I\u2019m also quite disappointed that one of the vampires advertised for this show  got killed off way too quickly. In retrospect, I think there\u2019s a big gap between the antagonists of and heroes of this series in terms of presentation. And unfortunately, the vampires took the pitfall.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal series made by P.A. Works can be a bit of a hit or miss. But as I mentioned before, it\u2019s hard not to take eyes off of the exceptional visual quality of this series. From the very first episode to the end, everything looked fluid and in style of the 1930s. Vampires are designed with a menacing look and their action speaks for themselves. Expect graphic violence to happen often in the show including blood being spilled by being bitten brutally or limps being torn off. It sells its fan service to make the vampire society look as dangerous as they can be. The Jaegars themselves also have distinctive looks especially for Yuliy\u2019s trademark blue eyes and hair style. Others such as Mikhail and Yevgraf are dressed in a more gentleman-like manner as a deception of their true nature. I should also mention that characters in the series all speak in their native tone regardless of their origins. Most of them deliver their personalities to the bone. Similarly, the theme songs in the show adds a feeling of dark melodrama with and unsettling mood. \\n\\n\r\nI think in the end, Sirius the Jaegar is a show that took on the vampire theme and made it into an action thriller with a feeling of suspense. P.A. Works remains one of my favorite studios for not just their production quality but also being able to continuously reinvent itself. For this particular show, it managed to do that by taking on a darker side of storytelling. To me, that\u2019s a thing of beauty.",

            "content": "Vampire series that are actually worth a praise are rarer than tinder users looking for serious relationship. My expectations were similar: 5/10 experience offering momentary satisfaction and some sucking. Turns out it has a story to tell, presents it with some humor and it's something bit different from the usual. \r\nStory:\r\nEven after 3 gigazillion different anime series about the same subject, the vampires still haven't learnt no matter who kicks their asses and how. This time our blood-sucking vampires are on rampage and give no shit about anything or anyone, baka. Lucky for us, intergalactic jazz band lands to Tokyo with their airship, and startskicking vampire butts in a way that goes beyond your wildest imaginations! Unless you have already seen the movie 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' in which case you will be entertained in the animated manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty bro. Our main characters are part of this vampire hunting organization which is almost like a mafia where everyone is part of the family. They go from place to another and save the day because they are real heroes and real men (/women). All of this is pretty based, of course, but its cliches are mainly presented in comedic manner, making sure viewers realize that the author is well aware that these are general tropes under these settings. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLittle boys descending ropes while one handedly using a minigun. Rambo and Arnold make way, new GAR Jesus is in town and he weights like 60lbs. Another dude is probably Donatello's cousin or otherwise has mastered his art. There is also a dude who wears a monocle because he used to slaughter vampires before it was kewl. The real main character who can tell from the smell of a flower how well its roots are doing.\\n\\n\r\nThe vampires aren't typical villains who go insane and love murder because they do. Rather,  seem to have similar thing going on among themselves as the vampire hunters have. Our characerts are also not heavily protected by plot armors and nakama powers because characters can actually die in this narrative. \\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nInteresting choices exist here. The approach is rather similar to Princess Principal which had similar settings within almost the same time period. We get tons of scenery and design from the early 20th century from cars to city lights within the atmospheric towns. The art isn't amazing, but slightly above of the current medium quality. The series is not super detailed either, but some ideas have been executed in quite respectable manner, moon shots, for example. Seiyuu works aims to deliver seriousness and achieves it. The OP is also my personal favorite from this season, easily.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is fun as heck. Vampires drop like it's Skrillex with bass. It's almost hard to contrabass how well Jaegar succeeds with its entertainment value. \\n",

Now at the time of this review 4 episodes have come out so I'll definitely end up changing my final score for this anime (will almost probably drop from a 9 to an 8 in the middle and definitely drop again towards the end) and I really wish MAL would block people from reviewing anime until the whole series comes out but in any case here's my 2 cents on this in the hopes that you won't be deterred by the cliches!",

            "content": "You know what we have a lack of lately? Good vampire anime. Which is a shame because vampire anime can be diverse from the typical Horror anime to a more light hearted comedy anime. Normally, vampire anime land in the former with vampires either being the main villains or just being bad asses as the main character. Thankfully, P.A works has given us a vampire anime following a group of vampire hunters hoping to wipe them all out and stop any plans that they may have. But is the anime just style or does it have substance as well? \r\nSit back, relax and burn allcopies of Twilight and then show the fans what a real f*****g vampire looks like as I present to you the anime review of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger.....wait. When did they decide to change the name? Oh never mind. Lets begin shall we?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, vampires have been manipulating humanity for a very long time, influencing events so that they can maintain a food source, like the entire Earth is just one entire farm for them. However, once people starts realising what's going on, they will retaliate. Enter the Jagers, group of vampire hunters vowed to hunt down every single vampire. One Jager, Yuliy, has a bigger reason than most since he is the last survivor of his village which was destroyed by vampires. That is until his brother, Mikhail, returns from the dead and says that the vampires are looking for their peoples' greatest treasure, The Arc of Sirius. So Yuliy and the Jagers must stop their plans and kill all vampires that stand in their way to obtain The Arc of Sirius. \\n\\n\r\nSounds like a pretty good base for a story right? Well, when you start watching it, yes. The show does start out good with some bad ass vampire slaying and an overarching major plot element that is building in the background. But it then starts to slow down and the momentum of this show starts to halt. Now I blame this on the fact that the story just doesn't have substance to it. There are side plots in this show that don't get developed enough to make them interesting and can make them forgettable. But these side plots could have helped make the story more dynamic and added some context to some of the characters motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe focus is always placed on stopping the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius, but it stumbles in that area too. It lacks detail and context behind some elements in the plot that can help make the plot more interesting and dynamic to help give intrigue of what the actions of the heroes and villains could cause to the main plot of the show. I've watched all episodes and I still have no idea what The Arc Of Sirius actually is. Instead, things just simply happen and we then move on to the next part of the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe shows biggest weakness is without a doubt its characters. Outside of one character, the cast of characters are just either boring, bland or just one note. Yuliy exemplifies this because he has no unique qualities. He is single minded and filled with revenge against the vampires for destroying his village. He sees his life have no purpose outside of killing vampires and when he hears about The Arc of Sirius, he realises he has a purpose in life but he must do it alone because only he can do this task and must shut out everyone. Talk about being boring and generic. When I saw that Uemura Yutto was voicing Yuliy (who also voiced Hiro from Darling in the Franxx this year, who I also thought was generic and boring), I knew that we were getting a generic character. What Yuliy says and what he does doesn't surprise or intrigue me because his motives are nothing new or unique from what I've seen from other main characters so I get an idea what he will say and do next. \\n\\n\r\nThis also applies to the Yagers as they are just as uninteresting as Yuily. Willard is the level headed leader of the group. Fallon is the happy and strong \"bro\" character. Dorothea is the smart but sexy female character. And Phillip is the back talking, sarcastic t**t character. The fact that I dismissed these characters with one sentence just shows how uninteresting they are. Willard is the only one that has some intrigue due to his backstory but not enough to get me interested. There is even a love interest, Ryouko, that goes nowhere. Like seriously, she has no relevance to the plot whatsoever and normally ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only interesting character is Mikhail, Yuliy's brother. Since he became a Vampire after their village was destroyed, he essentially becomes a point of conflict with Yuliy's desire to kill all vampires. But even though he his essentially the enemy, there are hints that he might be indirectly helping Yuliy stop the vampires from obtaining The Arc of Sirius. He becomes a more intriguing character than Yuliy because you don't know where his true loyalties lie until near the end of the series. Does he want to help Yuliy or does he merely manipulate Yuliy to trust him only to betray him later on? \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show's animation is fantastic. Whether it is from the art direction or the fight scenes, everything in Sirius the Yager looks superb. The 1930s setting is greatly captured here with the character and environment designs being very distinct from one another. Now, in terms of the animation in the fight scenes, it is important that the fight scenes are fluid through the animation itself or though its use of clever cinematography to capture each scene. Thankfully, P.A works capture this very well and the fights are just an enjoyment to watch every single time due to the fluidity to it all. It helps distract the viewer of the poor story and characters because it is fun just seeing them slaughter vampires and show them who's boss. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is something that also captures the scenes but not enough to make it stand out. But unlike other shows, I know that it is there and is does help set an atmosphere and I appreciate that. Rather the sound effects were more noticeable to make it sound more realistic and add to the scenes. This especially true in the fight scenes where the clashing of weapons helps us feel the impact of each swing and clash. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Sirius\" by Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets is a very solid opening. Its use of silhouettes in its imagery help set a rather dark and broody atmosphere with the song being catchy enough to make the opening enjoyable to watch and listen to. The ending is again, very solid. It helps emphasise the fact that Yuliy and Mikhail were very close as brothers and had a lot of fun together before being torn apart when the vampires attacked their village. Kind of sad when you think about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem that I have with this show above everything else is that the overall show is just....boring outside of its animation quality. It's difficult to review something that does not do anything good but not anything bad, but instead is just bland. I said earlier that does this show just have style or does it have substance? No. It is all but style and little substance. The high quality animation can only carry this show so far before its story and characters have to help carry this show but it then stumbles when this happens. It doesn't develop its plot well enough and its overall characters are just too one note and boring to make me care. I like to prioritise story and characters to look for good anime since animation and sound only enhance the anime. This show is the opposite of this and it is a shame because I wanted to enjoy this show. It looks and sounds good but unfortunately, that is all there is to it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 6.1/10  Recommendation: Don't Bother",

            "content": "Watching this series reminded me so much of spectacular vampire-supernatural series that have gone by like Hellsing Ultimate or Owari no Seraph. It's a good series through and through, and although there are many whom have milked the genres and put their own spin on it (only to fail badly), Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger offers something up its sleeve to the point of being captivating, and yet being so underrated.\r\nStory:\r\nSimilar to series like Princess Principal for the old 20th Century London-esque time period, we have the usual Van Helsing or Constantine type of shows, where said person arrives in some place that is chock-full ofvampires to hunt, then meet up with people (presumably the Japanese government) that liaise to do and deal the same treatment: investigate, plan, seek, kill and destroy the source. That's what Yuily and his team of vampire exterminators are here for this purpose.\\n\\n\r\nFor Yuliy, it's a fight that has been overbearing since his childhood days: The village of Dogville, the people residing there may look normal, but with Yuliy being the last of its kind as Sirius, there presents an unescapable fate with what is the triggering catalyst: \"The Arc of Sirius\", a ball-shaped item of powers unimaginable meant to keep both Jaegers and vampires away that could reshape humanity according to the user's wish. This is protected by Yuily's father, in preparation for the future to come, and for both survivors of the massacre, Mikhail (older brother) and Yuliy (younger brother) must both protect at all costs. Midway, the unexpected betrayal ensues that Mikhail changed sides to help the vampires (with Yevgraf), presumably to keep his life intact from protecting Yuliy from the vampires. With that in mind, Yuliy has a number on his shoulders to not just fend off vampires alone, but to awaken his brother back to his senses.\\n\\n\r\nFor such a story, it's refreshing to have an omage to certain series and the tried-and-true methods past. However, you're gonna have to plunder through boring and slow parts (say for the majority of the series), but when it picks up steam, that's when the story gets more interesting and engaging with the ever-so-constant build-up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe \"Jaeger\" team: Yuliy, Dorothea, Philip, Professor Williard + the side counterparts (Fallon etc.)\\n\r\nA merciless band of vampire slayers crafted from their usual expertise, I must say that these characters, as fun as there is to watch their every move, they give the sense that for all their strengths and weaknesses, they balance well together, making up for the subtle differences which testifies their skills to a T. And if you can tell from the usual cliche of a team of men and a woman, where the female is the damsel in distress? Sorry, but that ain't the case as Dorothea is a skilled shooter herself, firm and able to be trusted with much. \\n\\n\r\nThe commoner team: Ryouko, Hideomi (and I know I've missed a few others)\\n\r\nFor once, I thought that her love obsession with Yuliy was just for show...but for her to follow Yuliy along with his plan is underwhelming to say the least. At most, she's just there for story exposition to make Yuliy's life a bit more interesting, but other than that, a filler character. At least there are people in the Japanese government would be concerned\\n\\n\r\nThe vampire team: Yevgraf, the vampire Twins (vaguely shown), Kershner, Klarwein, Mikhail (through blood pact), the catalyst Agatha\\n\r\nYevgraf is the epitmony of evil: the Devil incarnate himself. Awaiting the Arc of Sirius that has been laid dormant for the vampires for an insane amount of time, he does not stop at anything to achieve his ambitions, at the expense of others. The fearsome enemy who uses a blood pact to hold those who has been resurrected as vampires, and then sees them as a tool to help aid in his efforts. Kershner is no different, except that he sees it as being Yevgraf's strategist and most capable helpline to him. Same issues and characteristics with Klarwein, the insane experimentalist (equal to Back to the Future's Doc Brown). All are committed to seeing Yevgraf's vision happen, with the side-effects of being tools just for the moment.\\n\\n\r\nAn overall (almost) well-rounded character lineup, but the problem of being one-dimensional is truly the weakest connection here.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nWhenever P.A. Works are down for almost any anime, I'm a hardcore fan for whatever shows they make for their beautiful artwork and great animation, and Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger doesn't disappoint. Since it's an action-oriented show, what better way to call forth a director who handles good action, and that name is Masahiro Andou, known for his works on Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the Shell and more.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention that this series is a major departure from their usual SoL or coming-of-age of works past, but what's best to know is that everything about it is left intact, and is safe to say that this series stands out because of impressive art and animation. Good game and a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nDamn, yet another area where the series nailed it to perfection. The OST is a spectacular pickup just for the series alone. Both the OP and ED helped set the pace for the series to follow, shadowing the events that lie ahead for everyone (especially Yuliy and Mikhail), and is a blast listening to. As with any action series, the SFX really gets loud under load so much so that it causes some distortion and causes a major distraction sometimes. It's noticeable, yet it feels just about any other action anime would be at its best caliber.\\n\\n\r\nTenrou: Sirius the Jaeger is quite the production, but production itself can't tell the whole story, and that's where the series' Achilles Heel start to show up: The slow and methodical story along with the characters, emotionless and only care about their field of range (or mission). After being burnt by so many vampire series, I'd say this is at a level where it's neither good nor bad, but the hopes of knowing whatever the heck is going on here is least to say the best. Good try, but one could hope there's improvements to be made. Recommendations though? Just purely for action alone.",

            "content": "- Story -\r\nSeems like a fairly standard story involving different factions, the main two being the Jaegers and the Vampires. As of episode 4, the pacing feels a little slow for my taste. Most of the story elements are all things that we have seen before in other anime, and they are told in a very familiar way, as well.\r\n- Art / Animation -\r\nVery solid and consistent so far. The fight scenes are 90% the reason why I'm still watching this.\r\n- Sound -\r\nSound is great, especially during fight scenes. No complaints here.\r\n- Character - \r\nThis is where the anime fails for me. In the firstepisode, we are introduced to Ryoko, a character that falls in love with the MC (not sure why). Her character feels completely useless to the story and she does not seem to serve any purpose other than the writers wanting to shove an unnecessary love story down our throats. She is given way more screen time than she deserves, screen time that could have been used to develop other interesting characters (i.e. the MC or the Jaegers). \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, she is the character that is most removed from any of the conflict in the show, therefore offering us a unique perspective. Unfortunately, her perspective is boring af, she is simply uninteresting and irritating. IMO, some of her actions are irrational and make little sense for a girl her age, and make her character even more insufferable. \\n\\n\r\nBecause they are giving her a fair amount of screen time, I believe they are planning some type of arc for her trash character. Which is a shame, because I just don't see it paying off, and I would have liked to learn more about the other characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment -\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell so far, I really enjoy the fight scenes, they are certainly the highlight of this show for me. However, the slow pacing, partially due to the writers giving a shitty useless character too much screen time, is really making my viewing experience unenjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n- Overall -\\n\r\nStory feels unoriginal, but not too cliched or tropey. \\n\r\nAnimation and fight scenes are great, so far.\\n\r\nRyoko is a shit character and I hope she dies. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR\\n\r\nWould have been a perfectly fine - good anime if it weren't for a POS character.\\n\\n",

But be warned that there is an element in this show that, at least for me broke my enjoyment to where it became unwatchable.\r\nTenrou: Sirius the Jaeger has a lot of promise, but at least for me it was bogged down by the one aspect of anime that can make or break a show; the romance element.\r\n Character is the lifeblood of a visual medium as we the audience have no other means to immerse ourselves in the world we arepresented in than through the characters presented. For the most part, the main cast look promising with every flavor of character type you usually run into in action anime. However, what goodwill I have for the story stops the minute the designated romance character enters stage left. You will know her when you see her, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the minute this character shows up and every scene that follows with her she annoys. She feels like less a character and more a device set up solely for the purpose of being with the main character. You just know the story will bend to the will of the writers insistence on her importance and her being with the main character, and that is the saddest part.\\n\\n\r\nNow of course, I could be wrong about all of this. However, from the 5 episodes I watched, it became increasingly more plausible that the story would suffer with her inclusion. \\n\\n\r\nJust a warning to anyone wishing to actually watch an enjoyable anime and not just self insert like this is a visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/5\\n\r\nMusic:4/5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Groanworthy/5\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime confuses me so much.\r\nAs some others have pointed out, it's rare for PA Works to go into this kind of action, thriller anime.\r\nIt started out brilliant. The first few episodes were clever. It made no shounen anime-like pitfalls, no cringes, and very clever directing, full of unexpected and interesting cuts. I was sure that this would be a strong runner for the best anime of the season.\r\nBut from this anime, I realize a lot of series could be measured using a two-number metric. The first number is the episode where you cringe for the first time. The second number is the episode whereyou feel like everything is falling apart; the art quality is no longer brilliant, the directing is no longer interesting, the plot has succumbed to cliches and boring tropes, the characters no longer have a distinct shine.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, for this anime, these two numbers were 7 and 10.",

            "content": "The nature of P.A. Works is defined by the company's ability to sustain itself with primarily original works with only the odd adaptation here and there with major influence by the company itself.\u00a0 And so here we're presented with 'Sirius the Jaeger', P.A.'s take on vampires and a war against them.\r\nStory:\r\nIn the town of Dogville lies an ancient artifact known as the 'Ark of Sirius', an object filled with such insurmountable power that all major countries in the world (seemingly) wish to possess it.\u00a0 It's here where we meet the last Sirius, Yuliy, and the vampire hunting Jaegers who try to uncover and thwart theplan of the vampires that've set foot in Nihon land in search for the Ark for unknown reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning a vampire defeating plot that lasts a cour, Sirius is a show set in 1930's Japan that follows many of your typical revenge plot tropes in order to sustain its story.\u00a0 Yuliy, being the last surviving member of his people after they were slaughtered by vampires, sets out to 'KILL ALL THE VAMPIRES' in order to get his vengeance.\u00a0 It's a show that has a decently paced by the numbers story that doesn't try to overstep its boundaries before the conclusion.\u00a0 It's because of this that I find few positives to note cause nothing about its storyline is even that memorable, yet still manages to be a decent viewing experience despite that.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, given how this is a P.A. Works show, the importance of the story lies in its ending, as the company's history of floundering to the finish line becomes evident the closer episode twelve reaches.\u00a0 Reason being is the show just throws down reasons in front of the audience for things like like why the vampires are searching for the Ark in the first place towards the end like it fixes the innate issue.\u00a0 The attempt at sympathy and explaining previously untouched details so close to the end doesn't impact things too much, but instead misses the show's overall potential as the motivations and overall storytelling could've been drastically improved had it been revealed and built upon earlier, instead of being an \"Oh crap, we forgot to add some things\" moment that muddies the overall ending.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, Sirius the Jaeger ends with the same P.A. Works standard of 'Good idea, bad execution', as some aspects like the Sirius as a people was one that had potential, but failed due to the show never bothering with giving them the time they needed to be fully fleshed out.\u00a0 Its slower climb to the climax ultimately hurts it, which is a darn shame considering the amount of innate potential that could've happened should the series have gotten its feet off the ground a little sooner.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent pacing\\n\r\n+ Good slow buildup\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Way too fast of a climax\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I describe Yuliy as a discount first season Eren Jaeger, as our protagonist's main quirk in the series erupts from his desire to avenge his people after vampires slaughtered them all seventeen years ago.\u00a0 Thankfully rage isn't his only character trait, and we instead get to see a lost puppy looking for answers for a greater majority of the series.\u00a0 There honestly isn't much to say about Yuliy, as the plot is pretty much the only drive he has to even do anything.\u00a0 His motivations come from the events of the story, and any decisions he makes only seem to be a natural progression that results in the show's conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this sadly is a fact that the rest of the cast faces as the show's is the only real driving motivation for them.\u00a0 Any actual motivation for Yevgraf, the show's supposed antagonist, is revealed so late (episode 11) that there's almost no reason for the audience to care because of it.\u00a0 Sure you get some quirkiness like banter between the Jaegers and the apparent obsession of the vampire mad scientist Klarwein, but most of that is just fluff and doesn't add anything to note aside from drawing lines in the sand to note who's on what side and add the illusion to flavor in an otherwise straightforward and kind of bland show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Entire cast is just kinda...there\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNow, this being a P.A. Works show, I don't actually have a lot of complaints for it because of how consistent the company usually is in its production.\u00a0 A few off scenes here and there did happen, but Sirius is otherwise a show that's presented in the P.A. Works style with very few negatives to really speak of.\u00a0 It's crisp, there's fluidity in the action, this is one of the company's aspects that deserves its share of praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAptly titled \"Sirius\", by\u00a0Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets is a song rock/action piece that's really grown on me to become one of my favorite openings in recent memory.\u00a0 Its mix of soft and louder tones at various points in the song lend it to become something that I find worth being memorable and repeat listens to.\u00a0 Again, a feat that P.A. Works is surprisingly good at achieving.\u00a0 By comparison,\u00a0\"Hoshie\" by sajou no hana is a more somber piece that I find isn't as memorable as its OP sister, but still has its fair share of memorable points being a song that ties more into the emotional aspects of Yuliy's existence as the last Sirius, which exemplifies the point more even if the show doesn't do much to aid it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe mantra I have for P.A. Works as a whole seems to always trail back to \"Good ideas, bad execution\".\u00a0 It's happened to Charlotte, it's happened to Nagiasu, Angel Beats!, hell I'll even extend that notion to Kuromukuro despite that project's rockiness from the start.\u00a0 Because of this, I came into Sirius with very cautious expectations, reminding myself that things still can and will go wrong later down the line, which was an unfortunate truth that came into being, though thankfully the crash wasn't nearly from very high up.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I still found Sirius the Jaeger to still be an enjoyable viewing experience.\u00a0 While I don't trust that the company will ever find its footing, it's nice to see the diversity in their works and how they still have the heart and soul to create original projects even though they don't always work out like they may have originally intended.\u00a0 Many things like the lore of the Sirius and that copout of an antagonistic motivation, as well the mess that was Ryouko's sideplot (which wasn't even a necessary aspect of the show aside from cheap excuse for some romance) REALLY could've used work, but it's still all in all a decent show that makes a good callback to original portrayals of vampires as people preying, grotesque, transformed creatures of the night.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to watch it if you feel inclined, as its good for a piece of non-fanservicy entertainment, but not one that can garner a lot of praise due to numerous flaws and overall lack of anything new to bring to the table.\u00a0 Not much more can be said, but I'm at least glad P.A. Works is taking smaller risks with their original content.\u00a0 Wouldn't want another Charlotte incident, now would we?",

            "content": "When the first episode aired, I seriously was in awe. I found Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger attractive in the art and I was drawn to its world, eagerly waiting for a new episode each week with great expectations that were never truly met.\r\nI was struck by beautiful animation and introduced to a plot about vampires, action, fight and interesting characters. And the way the first episode ended was when I said to myself: it's perfect, what else could I ask for?\r\n[ STORY ]\r\nWell, thing is, story-wise, I don't find it engaging. It lacks depth to actually make me invested in what's going on and itfeels to me like everything's a bit messy and thrown around here and there so the pace is weird as well as the progression of the plot which by episode 7, we still don't know a lot of. It just feels so \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nI also don't know why they try to force \"romance\" (because I don't really know what to call it) in there when it's clearly unnecessary. I'd rather focus on the plot than having an annoying character serving absolutely no other purpose than being MC's forced love interest to use yet another clich\u00e9 trope that I can see as being the anchor of the MC for existential purposes (considering that this whole thing is taking up from 40% to 50% of an episode...).\\n\\n\r\n[ ART ]\\n\r\nThe art is really good and to me, it's one of the strengths of Tenrou: Sirius the Jaeger. The animation is fluid, the fights are animated well and delightful to watch and I just love the whole universe they recreated and the vibe it throws.\\n\\n\r\n[ SOUND ]\\n\r\nWell, to be honest, as I write this I don't even remember what the soundtracks or the OP sound like so it sums it pretty well, I'd say. Forgettable.\\n\\n\r\n[ CHARACTERS ]\\n\r\nThe same goes for the characters. The chara-design is very unique to each character and very enjoyable but it's a bit disappointing that we don't get to dig deeper into their stories and their personalities. It'll all on the surface and just as the plot, they lack depth.\\n\r\nOur MC gets a good backstory though, but the way he evolves to the present day and connects with the plot doesn't do it for me (especially because they use a trope that we could easily foresee). It could have been so much better. In the early episodes, I was expecting a strong character development coming from him with which we could connect strongly but it never happened. \\n\\n\r\n[ ENJOYMENT & OVERALL ]\\n\r\nIt's still entertaining as is but mainly because I watch this weekly. I don't think I'd binge-watch the whole thing with what I've seen so far but maybe there's still a way for this anime to repent, eh? Though I don't think so.\\n\r\nAlso, I don't really care about neither the plot nor the characters and what's happening which is a shame. I really try to connect but I just can't.",

            "content": "Oh Lord, where do I begin with this anime.\r\nFirst things first, I have a bit of a weak spot for trashy vampire animes. I'd had my eye on this one for a while and finally decided to boot it up on Netflix to play in the background while I worked. I was a bit concerned at first that I might miss parts of the plot, but...yeah...I'll get to that.\r\nSo Sirius the Jaeger is basically another Vampire vs Werewolves show with a magical macguffin that one side wants to use to have ultimate power, blah, blah. It's far from groundbreaking, but that's part of the fun.The first few episodes are really good and fun to watch and I binged all of the way to episode ten without hesitation. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it's good, this show is on a potential par to shows like FMA (some arcs of it really reminded me of FMA). When it's bad, it's a mess, and for the most part it's a mess.\\n\\n\r\nSirius the Jaeger suffers from SEVERE pacing issues and a lot of that comes down to its 12 episode run time. The story line, world and characters simply don't get the time, love and attention they need, except for Sirius, which again, I'll come to later. In one scene, it's revealed that there's conflict between two of the main characters because of something very bad that happened in the past (trying to avoid spoilers), but it's not really touched on ever again. Early on there's a plotline with a doctor that reminded me of the Tucker arc in FMA, where the doctor character lives with his cute daughter and is doing desperate experiments. It's a really interesting arc and given a good deal of gravitas...but soon afterwards that plotline is quite literally dropped and when we hear about it again it's played up for a weird kind of comic relief by a villain who literally falls down a cliff face after what might as well be a five second fight and is never heard from again. Like...what?? Discount Shou Tucker didn't die for this level of disrespect. Even the final battle falls flat to the point of being funny because there is no build up or tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing also causes issues with continuity. One character basically leaves home and their family follow them (to ANOTHER country I might add), only for them to come back a couple of episodes later like yup, I was being young and stupid I'll be good now...and it's literally NEVER commented on or addressed. Did the family ever find out? Are they still randomly stuck overseas? Are they still looking for them?\\n\\n\r\nWe never really find out much about the mysterious order that Sirius and the others belong to. Heck, we don't even find out much about the Ark, which is the core of the plot. I got all of the way to the end of episode 12 without really understanding what it was beyond the fact that the Vampires shouldn't get it because That Would Be Bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who gets a decent character arc is Sirius, which I don't mind because he is semi decent as an anime protagonist for the first half of the show. By the second half, the storyline about his brother and the Ark and his tribe borders on contrived and at the end I was pretty bored of him because he fell into almost every protag cliche in the book. Run away to deal with things on your own even though it just...DEFIES logic? Check. Keep the valuable object on your person even though you KNOW you're going to end up in a fight soon and it's probably going to get stolen? Check. The final episode has a very, very emotionally charged scene, but it falls completely flat because of the terrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, this show isn't awful, but it could have been so much more. It's fun to watch, but that's about it. It's not going to leave you thinking afterwards, but it will leave you wanting more (if that makes sense).\\n\\n\r\nEnd note: are his tribe supposed to be Inuit? Because if so that's HILARIOUS",

            "content": "Sirius the Cringe Beast Review (Minor Spoilers You Won't Really Care About)\r\nI think the most analogous scene to summarize the whole of this series can be found halfway through the end of its final episode. In that scene our main character says this, \"I know what to do, I've finally found my path\" and he is then immediately punched straight in the face and sent plummeting into the depths of the Atlantic fucking ocean. Visually, this is a pretty great looking show, the lighting effects and fight scenes can be pretty entertaining, but it is also somewhat inconsistent with quite a few instances of comicallyjanky animation in less action-oriented scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast consists of a ragtag group of the most bare bones, stereotypical members of your party in literally every JRPG ever made. There's jolly buff guy with beard, special agent d cups, edgy guy with dark past, elderly mentor wearing a monocle and of course, twink, how could we forget about good ol' twink? The antagonists on the other hand are stock mini bosses and minions ripped straight out of Castlevania led by possibly the most insufferable Shakespearean twat with a top hat in the history of anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo get a good grasp on the entertainment value of this show, here's a description of a portion of its epic final battle. An insufferable twat with a top hat eats a big marble and transforms into a gargoyle with the face of Anthony Hopkins, but also somehow transforms his full suit into a bedazzled black unitard with sparkling elf shoes that somehow grow back even after you cut his legs off. Now that's anime. The first 3/4ths of the show were actually decently engaging and entertaining, but man oh man, grab yourself a couple of buddies and brews and you will have a banger of a time watching the bombastic circus fire it devolves into for the final quarter. Sirius the Jaeger is an initially average anime that evolves into such supreme trash as it goes on that I'd have to classify it as a 4 out of 10, so bad it's good.",

            "content": "Ahhh this anime frustrated me; because SO many elements were done wonderfully. But there were just some foundational things that made it a complete mess.\r\nLet's start with the good: \r\n1. Character Design and Setting--BEAUTIFUL. All the characters are visually bright, diverse, interesting and modern despite the time period of the setting. Quite a few hotties here, and that's never a bad thing.\r\n2. Action-- FANTASTIC! From the start, it's fast-paced, engaging and there are many moments where I was literally on the edge of my seat. There's a fairly badass train scene that I watched multiple times, actually.\r\n3. Story (Kind of)--There's also some bad with this,but this is the \"good\" section so let me focus. The back story in particular was very well crafted. It made me care, and I easily became invested within the main characters after a few short episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow the bad:\\n\\n\r\n1. Story-- Waaaay too complicated and overwrought. There are literally three organizations at play (and some of them have multiple code names... I had to watch it twice to figure that piece out), and it's just too much. They could have taken out an entire organization and had the same story line. I ended up just ignoring it and focusing on the other things. I'm not here for all that.\\n\\n\r\n2. Silly Female Character that Doesn't Belong--Need I say more? Every time she came on screen, I literally yelled, \"What is your purpose??\" It's like she accidentally wandered in from the shojo anime next door, and no one has told her where the exit is. So frustrating. But to be fair, she has guts. No one told her where the exit is, but she's doing the best she can in the meantime.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Ending--Sucks. They spent the entire story leading us as an audience in a particular direction, then they TOTALLY dropped the ball. Why would you do that!? And you mean to tell me that no one in this entire project saw this blatant misstep?? Nobody said, \"Hey guys, maybe we shouldn't end it this way?\" I can't understand. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a fun watch. Ignoring the politics and complex details of the plot-- the hotties, beautiful artwork and action scenes are what drove me to finish. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend? Sure. But with caution. When they start to get weirdly and overly political, just ignore it and focus on how pretty it is.",

I loved the character designs. The environments they get to play in are varied and interesting. There are lots of cool fights. Everything you'd want is there, so where's the unfortunate part?\r\nThis show has a serious pacing issue. It moves a mile a minute, never taking the proper time to set up conflicts and build the stakes. By the time you get to the climax, you don't really know what will happen if the bad guy wins,you just know it will bad, and that is supposed to be enough. \\n\\n\r\nThey flesh out a handful of the key players and the rest of the not that massive cast of heroes and villains are lucky if they a couple minutes of backstory to flesh them out. So when there's a scene where two of these characters are in a bad situation, I feel zero tension because I don't really know these folks beyond being bad ass. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is they were telling an origin story, unfortunately that origin story clearly had at least two major story arcs in the manga, and the studio decided to jam them together and trimmed too much fat. The style and action are great, but I was having trouble caring as I was not very invested in the characters or world.",

This anime is nothing new in the Genre where you have 2 main groups, one the vampires and the other the Jaegars which is an organization that hunts vampires. You will notice there are a lot similarities between this and 2 really good anime if you pay attention (FMA and D-grayman). \r\nThe story starts out really well and seems unique minus the vampires part where the time and setting is historically based in after WW1 japan. This period in japan is rarelycovered in anime so seeing it and watching how japan was really refreshing and the interactions with foreign characters. But then as the story gets going the its seems rushed where in the beginning its slow and at the end everything comes to an conclusion in one episode (a problem with most 12 episode anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem to be diverse an cool but you don't get to see more of the background of the other characters other then Yuliy (Main) and his brother. The villains are not that special and don't really have back story either.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This was a mess, and I don't write reviews, yet this will be my first. The premise of the anime was great. A group of people who make their mission to find and battle vampires. However, the execution of it was just . . . lightly put, EXTREMELY subpar. Ryouko's character didn't add ANY substance to the plot at all, and in fact, was more so a hindrance. When you add a character, there has to be some development and growth that the character adds to the other characters or to him/herself. But nope, she was just blindly in love with Yuliy (MC) and followedhim blindly and didn't even cause trouble to clean up! Just a minor subplot that again, didn't add to anything. Another thing that bothered me was Mikhail's character. He reminded me of Uchiha Itachi in his relationship to Yuliy/Sasuke. He was good turned evil and wanted his brother to stop chasing vengeance. But due to the episode constraints, the development of this relationship was too fast and ultimately too little of a buildup towards the ending. The only character I liked was Hideomi Iba, the detective guy. He was witty and well-developed, showing background of the military while simultaneously funny. In contrast to the other tropes mentioned, he added background to the story and ultimately was what made me continue watching. All in all, I would not recommend this anime at all, but if you're looking for something that has good art, sound, and a semi-decent plot, here's something for you.",

There were quite a few things they showed but didn't talk a lot about, again this leave potential for a better second season. The story was different for sure, but some aspects were similar to other stories. Really good visuals andoverall I enjoyed it as a nice side anime, nothing that makes it stand out from others, maybe the fact that its about vampires and werewolves but they didn't really call them \"werewolves\" and that is something we don't get a lot of in recent anime.",

            "content": "Sirius the Jaeger is yet another vampire anime to add to the list. But, in this case, it's a good vampire anime that does a lot of things right. \r\nSo, as far as the story, it's pretty good. There's a group of Jaegers (vampire hunters) doing their job plus some related drama with the main character and a hometown relic. At first, some things don't really seem to be closely related. It starts out with somewhat of a broad story line and then things become more connected. \r\nMost of the characters don't really change. Yuliy is somewhat of a copy of Yuuichiro Hyakuya (from Seraphof the End). Both of them are apart of a group that kills vampires and they start out with revenge being their only reason to live. Also, that reason to live changes as the series progresses. There are some differences though. Yuu is more of a tsundere while Yuliy is simply a more mature, nice guy struggling with some things. Ryouko changed as well but she simply matured with age. So, while the characters are consistent, there isn't much development. \\n\\n\r\nThe art's nice. I love the character designs and the animation is pretty good as well. The fight scenes are done well. There aren't any choppy scenes or anything that looks weird to look at. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound's great. Both the opening and ending sound nice and the OSTs were actually kinda memorable. They were timed well and were effective. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sirius the Jaeger is a good watch, especially for people who prefer short, action anime.

            "content": "There are a few popular titles like Owari no Seraph, Rosario to Vampire and Hellsing, but i\u2019d still say we\u2019re lacking a good vampire show. Our latest addition is Tenrou: Sirius of the Jaeger, which is the show I\u2019ll be analysing in more detail. Warning, this contains spoilers\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story follows the secret organisation called the \u2018Jaegers\u2019, a vampire hunter group who kills vampires, and have been tasked in finding the secret artefact called the Ark of Sirius, before the vampires who are also trying to get their hands on it. \r\nThe ark is stated to be a national treasure from the village called Dogville,which contains immeasurable power and anyone who possesses can become \u201ca god or a devil\u201d. Basically, the ark serves as a plot device that gathers both sides into the conflict to advance the plot.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the 1930s, but the writer does nothing with it. What\u2019s the point in having your story set in this age if you aren\u2019t going to explore it? The story could have been set in the modern era and it would have made no difference. Poor world building \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I have is the weapons the Jaeger use. For a group of hunters who\u2019s assigned to killing vampires all the time, there\u2019s nothing unique or creative about them. We don\u2019t see these weapons used in any innovative way during fights. I would have rather the weapons be special enhanced tech designed to kill vampires than your typical standard staff that anyone can use. It would have added some characterisation giving them diverse weapons which complemented their personalities well. Hell, most of the time it seemed the Jaegers (besides Yuily) were using guns to kill vampires.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nOne of the weaker parts with this show I have to say is the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Yuily, is the last survivor from Dogville and a royal member of Sirius. His initial goal is to kill all the vampires that killed his clan. Does this remind you of a certain Sasuke? Yuily\u2019s is a annoying, reckless kid with a revenge arc and a relationship with his nii-san (older brother). Luckily, Yuily\u2019s motivation slowly shifts from wanting to kill all the vampires to wanting to retrieve the ark that\u2019s sealed away, as he takes responsibility being the last Sirius member to try uphold the dream his father envisioned where humans and vampire united and lived together peacefully. Yuily\u2019s development is handled well as it spans over several episodes, so it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a drastic change in motivation like Shippuden Sasuke felt. However, one of my main problems with Yuily is he never learns anything about teamwork. Everyone is saying \u201cCalm Yuily!\u201d \u201cSlow down!\u201d, yet the amount of times this fool runs off acting recklessly trying to fight the vampire, only to either: get shot several times, cause someone else to get hurt, let the ark to stolen or has to be rescued becomes annoying. Even in the last episode Mikhail has to come to his aid and rescue him  \\n\\n\r\nMikhail is Yuily\u2019s older brother who was turned into a vampire, but still looks out for his brother from the shadows.\\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Yuily and his nii-san is one of the crux and best aspects about this show. Despite how similar the characters and their relationships are to Sasuke and Itachi, this ones a lot more healthy and you can tell that they genuinely love each other.  \\n\\n\r\nThe worst character who brings this show down is Ryuoko. I swear, I hate this girl with a passion because of how pointless she is and adds nothing to the overall story. Ryuoko is the \u2018female lead\u2019, except she\u2019s fails at being one. She chases Yuily around the world like some obsessive, love struck stalker- fully aware of how dangerous the mission the Jaegers are on. Remove Ryuoko\u2019s scenes and the story would still function without her. The writer tried setting her up as this strong swordsman, but she does next to no combat afterwards. It\u2019s as if the writers didn\u2019t know what to do with her. Ryuoko\u2019s love for Yuily is as one sided and poorly written as Sakura\u2019s is for Sasuke. Piss off with the \u201cI learnt a lot from Yuily on my journey\u201d in the last episode, you barely had any meaningful interactions together and barely talked! \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s barely any indication that Ryuoko likes Yuily for any other reason, besides his looks. Yuily does not give a fuck about Ryuoko, he does not mention her and cares more about his relationship with his brother, the Professor and the Jaegers. I rant about Ryouko because she\u2019s a pointless character that\u2019s nothing more than a love interest, which took up valuable screentime that could have better been used fleshing out or developing the Jeagers and the Vampires.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care for most of the Jaegers tbh, besides probably the Professor and that\u2019s mainly because of his relationship with Yuily. They don\u2019t recieve enough development or screentime for me to bother remembering their names. Partially, the problem is Yuily\u2019s fault because he constantly runs off on his own and the team are separated from him for most of the episodes. It\u2019s only the first few episodes where we actually see them being a team and actually bonding. Even Yuily and the Professor\u2019s relationship isn\u2019t developed that well. We don\u2019t receive enough backstory on them for the viewer to witness this \u201cfather-son\u201d relationship they supposedly have, besides a scene of the Professor finding Yuily and riding on a train with him. Had we got more scenes of the Professor raising Yuily I could have bought what the show was trying to portray, but when Yuily finally called the Professor \u201cdad\u201d it fell flat and did nothing for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother crucial aspect this show fails at is exploring the vampires. In Sirius, they\u2019re depicted as generic vampires with nothing that differentiates them from other shows about vampires aside from their design. The lack of characterisation about the vampires that should have been expanded on in order to enrich the vampire lore is left unexplained. For example, where do these noble vampires originate from? How did the vampires get stricken by this disease? How did they came to be? Is Yevgraf even related to the twins?! \\n\\n\r\nThe writer sets up an interesting objective by having the vampires being plagued with a deadly disease that will kill them them without the ark, but it\u2019s not executed well enough for the viewer to sympathise and want to root for them. The story wants to maintain the status quo of the vampires being the bad guys and that\u2019s further enhanced by the last episode when Yevgraf\u2019s objective becomes seeking immortality through the ark, being consumed by power and becoming your typical, generic villain with a evil laugh. It\u2019s a shame that the vampires are presented in such a shallow way, that you won\u2019t care about them enough to remember their names when they\u2019re killed. Yevgraf had potential to be a compelling villain. Kershner died too early on and was wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and were smooth at the start, but it gets worse in the last few episodes \\n\\n\r\nSounds: 6\\n\r\nThe opening was alright. The osts were mostly forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThe show tried to cover too much content in 12 episodes. Sirius should have gotten two cours (24 episodes). With that many episodes we could have seen more from the other Jaegers- their backstories and given them character arcs, the fight leading up till Bishop becoming a vampire and his team that were massacred- that way his motivation would have held more weight, we could have gotten more worldbuilding, lore about Sirius and the vampires, fleshed out the vampires, gave Ryouko a proper role and spotlight, developed some relationships better e.g. Yuily and the Professor, Yuily and the rest of the Jaegers, Yuily and Ryouko.\\n\\n\r\nSirius had potential to being a great vampire story, but it failed to captualise in anything that would have made this show great and became mediocre.",

It started out incredible strong (great music, great storytelling, perfect pace, incredible fights, superb animation, interesting characters) - what else do you want? \r\nI honestly don't even remember when it was the last time I was so excited about a show. Everything looked so perfect and high quality. It cannot get any better, I thought. \r\nFor me it went downhill with episode 7. Suddenly the pace was rushed, the emotional scenes were cheesy (and not subtle and smart like earlier), the show started to look more shounen-ish, the fights became silly andnot as well animated and choreographed compared to earlier episodes, the animation wasn't as clear, smooth and beautiful either. The big revelation about the box of Sirius ... well, I don't want to spoil. I'm just sitting here and wondering why this show was able to fool me in thinking this would be something special, something great, something perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe end was cheesy and predictable. A beloved character died. I thought they wouldn't go down that route, because it's too cliche. Boy, was I wrong! The big bad guy transformed into a funny looking monster ... seriously. I don't understand what happend. Budget problems? Or were different people working on this? This show had some incredible storytelling and some very smart and deep dialouges. At the end it was just cheesy and superficial. Watching the last episodes I constantly raised my eyebrows in disbelieve. What remains is a depressing feeling of disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nWhatever. I enjoyed it after all, but I cannot bring myself to rate it higher. \\n\\n",

            "content": "It started out quite strong with great action scenes and animation, but like many original anime, lost it somewhere in the latter episodes. In terms of genre it's somewhat similar to a less edgy Hellsing, Owari No Seraph, B the Beginning, with some Naruto thrown in it.\r\n*Minor Spoilers*\r\nStory:\r\nIt's actually quite simple and straightforward, which isn't a bad thing at all. The problem is that for the sake of 'mystery' and misdirection the plot unfolds ridiculously slowly, for instance we don't find out the main villain's true intentions until episode 10. Some plots which seemed relevant in the first half of the series turn out tobe just a waste of time and you're left wondering why didn't they concentrate on the main storyline instead. Some overall themes in the story are quite engaging and touching, even if they're not offering anything new. Others, are just unimaginative. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art if beautiful for the most part. Characters' designs are all interesting and intriguing. The fight scenes are mostly well animated, some of them are excellent. Unfortunately they don't keep this high standards of animation throughout the series, and the latter episodes have some pretty bad animation and underwhelming action. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe only character that has some growth and development is MC. Some of the supporting characters are explored briefly and rather well and their relationships with each other can be quite poignant, however everyone else is underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains, characters I consider an incredibly important part of the story, are played mostly as a straight baddie trope, which is boring. They have a tendency for maniacal laughs which genuinely made me giggle (and I don't think I was meant to react that way). At some point they attempt a redemption arc, but it's sloppy because that character is introduced too late in the story to have any emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nFemale characters get the worst end of the stick. The one character who gets the most focus is often clumsily forced into the story, 11 episodes in and I still don't really understand her purpose other than being the love interest, I guess. The other female characters are basically non-entities. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound is great, OST is very good as well and compliments the aesthetic. All the VA are good, which is to be expected as most of them are very well known and experienced. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was by no means blown away. There's still one episode to go so that might change, but I doubt it. Mostly it had some good ideas and animation, but was poorly executed in many parts. I give it a 6/10 overall, as it's decent enough, but could have been far better.",

And Yuliy is a sirius and as main character is one of them, he kill vampires because his village is destroyed by them so he want to take revenge.Why the vampires destroyed his village? They in the brink of extention thanks tosomewhat unknown disease that is fatal and could kill them and they believe that the cure is obtainable in knowledge that's been kept in Ark of Sirius. So this is a story about Yuliy and the vampires.\\n\\n\r\nOkay that's been said the first part of the series(before Yuliy meet his brother) is actually good in my opinion, the premise is interesting and the action choreography simply amazing. BUT that's it after that the series simply become boring for me, I still continued to watch it simply because I expecting more of it, like what actually the Ark of Sirius and how will they use it, but none of them fulfilled so I regret finished it. The action scene is mediocre when its not Yuliy that fighting because they all use guns and well yknow how will it become, even the boss battle is not like a battle at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that being said the most disappointing aspect is the ending aka how they end it, this series doesn't have a compact and decisive ending making me have \"Wha!?That's it?\" moment, instead they make open ending thats carving continuation while its obvious thats the end.\\n\\n\r\nWell if someone ask me to watch this or no?My answer is no, you better watch other series like 134:The Beginning or A.I.C.O atleast those better watch(enjoyable category) in my opinion. I can't bring myself recommend this show to others. But if you like light vampires theme then maybe just give it a try.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT\\n\r\nSince to write a review giving numeral scores is mandatory in mal, I'll just assume this\\n\r\n-dropped=1\\n\r\n-not enjoyable=3\\n\r\n-finished and regret=5\\n\r\n-enjoyable=7\\n\r\n-masterpiece=9\\n\r\nWhy no 0 and 10? Well 0 is just trash where 10 is just overrated in my casexD",

A solid 6.5, maybe even 7 if I'm feeling generous.\r\nIt's decently entertaining, has a likable-enough main character and some beautiful art design. The rest of the cast, though rather unmemorable in personality, have been designed very well and are at least memorable/pleasing in their aesthetic. Not to mention the backgrounds were nice to look at too. There is also a visible effort made at establishing some atmosphere, although those effortsare excuted a bit clumsily. The story, while messy and poorly plotted, was never a hindrance to my enjoyment. The real appeal of this show is it's animation, with the fight scenes never failing to excite. They were for sure the strongest aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you would watch Sirius the Jaeger really comes down to taste and expectations. Personally, I loved the character design, the music (OP and ED especially), and the fun action. It's flaws mattered little to me because I had reasonable expectations going in. I knew it was not going to be my next favorite anime, and so I was able to enjoy the experience for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, shows like these are worth the attention in spite of some obvious flaws because they symbolize effort and everything I actually like about this medium. And I would rather show my support for something that tries it's hardest to be cool and original (while still failing somewhat) than mindlessly consuming something I know is bad and makes no effort to be different.\\n\\n\r\nCertain things, like the predictability of character arcs and generally awkward story-telling surely will turn some people off.

Follows a group of sorta vampire hunters named jaegars, one of whom is a human like beast named a Sirius hence the title, as they try to hunt down the last remnants of the vampires whom are searching themselves for an item called the Arc of the Sirius to save themselves from a vampire disease. So safe to say that where it starts and where it ends are two very different places. It's a very all over the place show. Narrative wise and quality wise. \r\nLikeI said to start it's definitely got style and flair that few shows can have. Fights scenes are incredible to see and the animation keeps pace pretty much all the way through. The characters are pretty interesting for the most part. The main character Yuliy is ok. Nothing that separates him from any other random action series protagonists. Sense of duty, tragic past, fights well, yadda yadda been there done that. Other characters are cool like his older brother Mikhail, probably my favorite part of the show was their bond tbh, and the other Jaegers he's teamed with. But the main villain Yevgraf is hokey as can be and the girl Ryoko, the main love interest I guess you would call her, isn't much more of anything really.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot also leaves a lot unexplained. I don't think it ever once have a concrete answer as to what the Arc did. It sorta laid it out but not really. Extremely cryptic about it despite tons of time dedicated to backstory and history lessons. Solid answers yee will not find. \\n\\n\r\nThat's really the series biggest hold up. It's super basic. I'm willing to bet you've seen the basic structure of this story dozens of times. Doesn't really do much to stand out or set itself apart. So while it's a great action fest there isn't much else. The plot relies on that stupid mcguffin of the Arc of Sirius for way too much of the driving force. It's really dumb. A lot of the plot points are easily predictable too. If I had to some this show up in one word it'd be: basic. The action is awesome but the plot gets downright dumb sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nExtremely by the numbers but the action gets its style points from me. \\n\\n\r\n7/10.",

Although we're nearing the end of 2018, we're still full of big-eyed, brightly colored girls everywhere, so to see a relatively realistic color palate and art style was refreshing. \r\nNow for the actual substance. It was a strange experience. Mild, lukewarm. Hard to explain, but here's my effort.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story itself was one you'd find these days in a teen fantasy novel. That being said, it was handled rather well, with dialogue that wasn't ridiculous and character drama that wasn't shoved in your face. The series was written by a writerwith level thinking, and I found no line exaggerated or out of place.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what keeps it from reaching that elusive 10/10 is that it just lacks that extra mile. While not ridiculous, or so bad it makes your stomach churn, it simply adds nothing different. It's like soup - nice while you have it, but instantly forgotten when you have steak.\\n\r\nYes, Sirius the Jaeger is like soup.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters were stand-out. Not a single one was annoying, or overbearing, and although they did follow a stereotype backbone, they didn't have those irritating qualities or lines that most anime will allow their characters to have. \\n\r\nThe characters not being irritating is probably why I watched this show to the end. That and the art.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8\\n\\n\r\nComing from P.A.Works, art and sound are to be expected, and they didn't fail. It was probably one of the better animated shows of the season, and was, like I said before, the reason I started it in the first place. Because strangely, although we're almost in 2019, good animation is still so hard to come by, especially when you have an action-centered anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and concluding thoughts: 6.7--> 7\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think of Sirius a year or two from now, I'll think \"oh right, that show about vampires, (although the vampires weren't your typical saintly faultless beings). It had pretty decent art. And some good fight scenes.\"\\n\r\nAnd that's probably it.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a show that I watched every now and then to pass the time. And it served its purpose well.

            "content": "This happens over and over. You find a new show, it starts off good, and then it\u2019s as if everyone in the studio decided to tumble down the stairs and take the show with them. Jaeger is very much one of these. An action show that seemed like it will be a great ride but slowly but surely keeps losing the sight of made it good.\r\nThe premise is extremely simple. You have vampires and vampire hunters.  Vampires are also looking for a powerful macguffin which is a good excuse for some globetrotting and throwing in other factions into the mix to complicate things. Whenstory is this light, that usually means characters and the adventure they\u2019re on will be a main focus of the show. For the first half or so, Sirius does just that. The main cast is relatively varied in their personalities and looks. We get to know them a bit better as times goes on and even though though there\u2019s not much depth to all of them combined, expressive animation and snappy dialogue makes them feel a bit more alive than just generic cardboard cutout and it made me get attached to them even if a little. \\n\\n\r\nAction was always a real highlight however. Animation quality in this show is consistently very high (even though it\u2019s not without blemishes throughout the 12 episode run). The first episode or two do a good job of setting the tone for the kind of fighting we\u2019ll be seeing. As supernatural as everything is, the violence here is quick and brutal. Vampires getting cut in half, their heads blown off with a shotgun or chests riddled with bolts and bullets. It\u2019s all very visceral and satisfying and most of the time the stakes feel appropriate. A meager fight with some grunts is not much but when it comes to royal vampires and other more threatening enemies, the high agility and power of both fighters really comes through in the animation and every hit looks like it could be the last if it lands right. I don\u2019t usually talk about the visuals so early on but it\u2019s a real highlight of the shows and one of the bigger reasons to watch it. From character designs to backgrounds it almost always looks great and when it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s easy to overlook. Music enhances all this significantly. Even though the show is set in early 20th century the soundtrack is not at all period appropriate and I feel like the reason for that is that it seeks to fit the tone and aesthetic of characters rather than the setting. A lot of the time the events on screen are accompanied with smooth electronic beats that make even more mundane things actions seem like they\u2019re being done by the best of the best with utmost confidence and finesse. When we switch to action it also becomes obvious that this is the same composer as the one that worked on Gundam IBO because his string focused action tracks are almost comically similar to the music he did for IBO. Yet it still does a great job of accompanying show\u2019s hectic action scenes and making them feel like important and dangerous clashes between deadly opponents. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately at about episode 7 the show starts the downfall. It has some great actions and a few of the better character building moments in the show but it\u2019s also where the balance starts to shift from characters and action towards story. That might not seem like a flaw in and of itself but the problem with Sirius is that it didn\u2019t really have a story to properly focus on, they should\u2019ve just ignored it and made it about the parts that did have promise and appeal. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing going on with the story of Sirius is the Ark, something that used to be nothing but a macguffin, a plot device. To explain this a bit more, the Ark is a powerful artifact that Yuily\u2019s werewolf people tribe used to guard in their village away from everybody. Unfortunately they do a shit job of it cause everyone and their mom are onto it which eventually leads to vampires ransacking their village and killing everyone in it with only Yuliy being able to escape thanks to his brother. Our main story starts about 10 years after that, everyone and their mom are still looking for the Ark and vampires seem to be getting closer than ever. At that point you don\u2019t really care much about the Ark because it\u2019s used right. It\u2019s used to justify characters coming together in the same places, interacting and possibly derailing into something else. To give you another example of this plot device being used extremely well, look at One Piece. The actual treasure, One Piece, is nothing but a tool to bring everyone together on the same quest. What it actually is, where exactly it came from and all the other details don\u2019t matter. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly it should\u2019ve have mattered what the Ark is, what matters is how we get to it and what happens on the way. We don\u2019t need to know what kind of effect Ark had on the people of Dogville cause Dogville and everyone in it and the entire species of Sirius don\u2019t matter. We know nothing about them and don\u2019t have much of a reason to care what did or will happen to them or their species. We don\u2019t need a giant detour for the a large portion of the cast just so that could find a counter macguffin that justifies something later on that could\u2019ve been dismissed much easily.\\n\\n\r\nBy putting so much emphasis on the Ark instead of characters and action the weight of the narrative also starts to rest on the Ark. If we shifts the focus from characters and action to the Ark the payoff of the story also shifts. If the first half can bring satisfaction from seeing how Fallon messes with Philip or Yulyi\u2019s attachment to Willard, the second one has to deliver on what it builds up to so much, the Ark itself. And it fails miserably. \\n\\n\r\nBy episode 10 the Ark that grants you the godlike powers is casually unsealed thanks to Yulyi having the special blood of royal werewolves like his Daddy. The reason he unseals it is so that everyone can coexist, even the vampires. Why he cares about the vampires so much after wanting to eliminate them completely? Well obviously cause his brother is half vampire and one of the vampire lolis he fought before had sad eyes and then there was another vampire that was a nice guy. Those three I guess entirely redeem vampires who previously were complete edgelords intent on ruling the world and killing everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter though, we\u2019re here to see what the Ark can do. It doesn\u2019t activate right away cause apparently it needs werewolf blood. Luckily Yulyi\u2019s brother awkwardly activates it and tosses it to the flying vampire lolis. At this point you\u2019re probably supposed to be excited or worried at the prospect of this godlike thing being delivered to the number 1 bad guy who was already exceedingly strong. You sure you\u2019re ready for the grandiose final battle? Well then fuck you. Vampire dude eats the ball, seemingly gets a bit stronger though it\u2019s hard to tell. Then he morphs into a more monster looking form and we get a final battle where Yulyi chops him up until Vampire dude stops regenerating. Apparently the power was just too much for him\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThis is what the show built up to. It build up to a completely flaccid final battle where an incredibly powerful villain get the most powerful thing in the world and completely fails to do anything even remotely noteworthy with it. Yulyi then gets the ball, he already has a counter ball so that his body won\u2019t go crazy from taking on such huge power. Now maybe we\u2019ll finally get to see what the Ark that we heard so much about is capable of? Haha nope, get pranked bro, Yulyi pretty much disappears and becomes a traveling hermit for\u2026 reasons I guess and everyone else moves on doing what they\u2019ve been doing before. \\n\\n\r\nSo now not only did we miss out on proper fun with characters but also the most powerful artifact that was so revered eneded up doing absolutely nothing, leaving us with an ending that\u2019s neither satisfying or conclusive. What a damn disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this I still think this show is worth a watch if you\u2019re into action and good animation cause there\u2019s plenty of it here. First 6 episodes in particular do a good job or ramping up the action and the show could\u2019ve been fantastic if it could keep that up and even though we don\u2019t get to see some characters anywhere close to as much as we should have, the stuff that is there is usually pretty good and endearing.",

            "content": "Upon watching the trailer, I have high expectations on this anime. I'm hunting for good anime to recommend to my friends so I dive into everything and this happens to be one of the anime I anticipate. Let's get on the review. \r\nTitle: 5/5\r\nWell the title make sense since it's about a Sirius who is one of the Jaegar, hunting vampires. \r\nOP/ED: 3/5\r\nI prefer the ending song of this anime. Try to listen to them! It's good. \r\nArt: 5/5\r\nAmazing graphics. I thoroughly enjoy the graphics. \r\nSound: 4/5\r\nIt's good but I still feel like it can be improved. More could be polished and added especially duringthe dramatic moments. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 4/10\\n\r\nOn first look, I don't feel like this is cliche. It draws me in. However, the pacing of this anime is slow. I actually need to push myself to click the next episode. I wasn't eager to know what happen. As the story unravels, it becomes mediocre and soon, it becomes cliche. Orphan, special, beastly (follow his instincts a lot), tragedy falls upon them, revenge, etc. Basically, you know the drill. It's taking a long time to reach the climax and even the climax, it feels like I'm left hanging. It does not exactly show the true power of the Ark, does not exactly show it's speciality or why everyone is fighting to obtain it. There are unnecessary fragments inserted between the actual plot due to unnecessary character but we'll get back to that part later. \\n\\n\r\nFighting Scene: 8/10\\n\r\nI love it. I like the 'goriness' it portrays. It's likeable enough but I do feel like I want more. It is not censored but not described in detail. Good but can be improve. Good but just not there. BUT, I expect more power, more intense fight considering it's a fight between vampires and a sirius which is a Jaegar on top of that. I'm expecting more stunts and I expect more power from the Ark. More power from the so-called speciality of a Sirius. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nI'm not going to dive into each character. Just the good ones and also the bad ones. \\n\\n\r\nMisha: I love love love him. He is cool character, limited strength due to not being a noble. A bit cliche though but his character make sense. \\n\\n\r\nYuliy; Eren. You watch this, you'll understand why I put Eren in this review. Eren at least shows his power he has but Yuliy, it just isn't enough. I don't feel the specialness in him. I need more. MORE. The main character feels like Eren- feels a lot like the characters that shares the same archetype as Eren. Has an element of Owari No Seraph.\\n\\n\r\nRyouko: Alright, lets get to the nasty part. I don't think her character is necessary. I hate weak pretending to be strong character. Her love interest for Yuliy is definitely not needed in this anime. I got annoyed whenever she tries to tag along with the group. Like seriously, I definitely feel her character is a pain in the ass. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all: 33/50\\n\\n\r\nIt's a mediocre anime for me. Some annoying characters, can be improved. I recommend this anime for those who would like to enjoy gory scenes. \\n",

            "content": "I came into this series with low expectations and came out with an extremely mixed set of feelings.\r\nHaving binge watched this series over the course of three or so days, I can safely say this is probably the most mediocre anime I have ever seen. That's not to say it's bad, but that is to say it's nothing special or groundbreaking at all either.\r\nIn short, it's a fairly poorly executed idea for an original anime series with some high hopes from its backers, a respectable studio at the helm, but just an absolutely poor execution of just about everything in this series, from start tofinish.\\n\\n\r\nMy immediate complaint with this series when I first started it was the amount of information, names, and players being dropped on us that felt like an overload of information, a confusing mess for what was beginning to sound like a series with a large conspiracy in its plot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series immediately removes all of that by at least the sixth episode, where the anime makes things simple and brings us down to our simple dilemma of \u201cHunters vs Vampires\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole issue with this series is this waste of time in its writing to effectively convey this world to me. What year is it? What sort of alternate history is this? What exactly is the politics like? What safe assumptions can I make? And within the span of the series, these questions become fairly clear to you the viewer, but it can come off as overwhelming at first, then again that could be just me.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the heart of this series is the issues in its writing and pacing. I honestly feel like this could have been something fairly decent, but the pacing of its plot, getting to know its characters and world, and so forth is so marred by a feeling of a rush that shouldn\u2019t even be there. \\n\\n\r\nA rush to what? The next action sequence? This series is a yawn in its fights, so if that\u2019s the offering on the table, I must refuse because there is not a single fight where anything felt interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to writing, I can\u2019t help but feel like this script was rushed out the door just to be animated. The only proof I have is the fact nobody on staff with any form of English capabilities asked \u201cHey, is Dogville really what we are going to call this one important place?\u201d. Nobody asked that, ever. So either someone never noticed, or someone played a really big joke, because that was a nuisance of a name right there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I recommend just passing on this series and watching something else. You might be able to get a more enjoyable experience from 2006s \u201cBlack Blood Brothers\u201d, which was something this series made me nostalgic for in a lot of respects. There\u2019s no similarities really, just some nostalgia really.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, this series absolutely failed in making our protag turn into a werewolf. I was sitting here for many episodes waiting for that to happen, and it never did. It\u2019s so obvious that\u2019s what was going on here, and it didn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s better anime than this out there, and there\u2019s far worse anime than this. I wouldn\u2019t have written a glorified blog post called a review if I hadn\u2019t watched this series to the end and didn\u2019t have hopes it would get better. It sort of did, but not in a way that would have redeemed it.",

            "content": "Capture the Flag, McGuffin chase. With Vampires. \r\nSo this story is interesting. In essence you have Vampires vs. Vampire Hunters, and they're all chasing a McGuffin. What is a McGuffin you ask? A McGuffin is a plot device, an object that everyone wants for some reason that no one can explain. In this anime it's an object of great power and everyone mysteriously wants it for some reason that no one can really explain why or what they need it for, and even when they have reasons for needing it, they can't explain why it will help them with their need. All we get isthem chasing this mysterious object, that is \"powerful\" and grants \"mysterious powers\" and everyone wants it. And along the way theres lots of vampires, and werewolves, and vampire hunters and secret agents, and battles where everyone wants the McGuffin and wants to kill each other for the McGuffin, and for reasons of simply they don't like each other. That's the anime in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty cool. I'd say it's along the lines of Blood the Last Vampire in terms of quality. Maybe a little less, but it's pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Really not that great in terms of musical score. Mostly just kinda repetitive actions swishes and clangs and stab noises and the usual blood gurgling splatters as people get hit or killed or injured. Lots of closeups as people stab one another.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where this show really shines, lots of neat character design. Unfortunately we don't really get to see much backstory for most of them. Really only two characters get a decent backstory explained and allows us to go in depth with them which is kind of the focus of the story anyway, but at the same time it kinda leaves you wanting for more, and wanting to know more about the other characters. But their design is cool at least. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Battle royale over a McGuffin chase. Vampires vs. Warewolves and Vamprie Hunters and Secret agents. That's the story pretty much. And I mean not all at once of course, they draw it out with different encounters, travels and battles, and then calm spots inbetween but that's pretty much the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I mean I liked the art and character design. And it's got good action. It definitely had a lot of potential with deeper story and character development though. If there's a Season 2 I'd definitely want to see some actual explanation on what the hell the McGuffin device actually is that they've been chasing and what it does, but I mean, if you just want an action anime, with lots of swishing of blades and fighting then this will definitely give you that. So when you're in one of those moods, this satisfies. \\n\\n\r\nI guess I'd recommend it if you like the Vampire genre, and it's been a while since you've had a good vampire action. Don't expect a great deal of plot, it's mostly a capture the flag over the McGuffin. But within that, there's some fun along the way, and hints at possible future plot expansion in a second season but this first one is mostly just capture the flag.",

            "content": "This was my second vampire anime and I was glad that it turned about to be better than the first one I watched (servamp). I think this anime would've had the potential to be big, but it's not that easy for anime to become popular with 12 episodes. In fact, a lot of people don't like how short a good anime is because the pace gets too fast and the character development is not good at all. You have to understand the fact that the reason why studios make 12 eps is because they don't have enough budget so they want to see how goodthe first season of an anime goes before they can make more. It's only a coincidence that other anime become pretty popular with more than 12 eps, but that's because their studio is taking the risk into putting most of their money towards that one show.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, I also think they went a little too fast, but if the anime was a bit longer, it could've turned into a big success. Right now, i'm not wishing for another season not because it wasn't good; it was good, the plot was amazing. But they ended the story at the end, so I can't really imagine what can happen next without making the story confusing too much. Everything about this anime was done ideally great, but I think the director wasn't too sure on how to end it.",

            "content": "This can contien some spoilers...\r\nThe beggining looked good, even with the cliche werewolf vs vampire plot. An interesting enviroment, a good character desing I guess and some other things that may promised.\r\nThe main problem to me was the characters, they didnt have any developement, just July, his brother, the professor just a bit, and thats it. (Even some tertiary characters like the oldman had more developement than the others).\r\nThe secondary characters and the enemies were just a piece of paper with nothing behind, (Even with only 12 chapters, they wasted that time in another things not so importants for the plot, like the story ofthe girl and his father) and most of them didnt do so much in their time in screen. The only that matters were July and his brother (I mean they are the main characters after all, but even so they dont have the charisma to take all the show only for them).\\n\\n\r\nPuting that a side, the behind plot was good but too simple, not so interesting with out a deeper view. And I felt that the rest of the world \"Looking for the ark\" (Box, Hako, whatever) was unexistant, nothing else was happening, the best comparison in that sense is \"Shingeki no Bahamut\" the entire world was moving, but this is not that kind of show so I cant ask for that much. And some secondary things like the mad scientist, the short time with the little girl and the doctor, etc didnt have any real value for the story, so many things just ended up in the air without finishing.\\n\r\n12 episodes were not enough to make all of that, but anyways those weak points are visible.\\n\\n\r\nSome battles were good, the animation is remarkable but the final battle was sh*t, the desing of the final boss was f*cking horrible and the battle wasnt more than just a couple of hits and a chase.\\n\r\nBut I have to acept that the end was good, very nostalgic.\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "Found this anime by chance and wasn\u2019t expecting much out of it, just wanted to kill some time. Scrolled through anime recommendations and recent anime before chancing upon this. At first glance, the anime just seemed like an adventure anime like Grancrest Senki. The profile picture of Sirius here did not do justice to the anime itself. Not saying that the anime was an amazing masterpiece yet since I am only half way through the anime, however, I would say that in my case, I was bearing much expectations for this anime after looking at the picture. Therefore, I went to search up some imageson the anime and I finally got to watching it after being swayed by the blue eyes of the main character.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise, I would say it is not as memorable as those hits in other anime like Sword Art Online, Tokyo Ghoul and Your Lie in April (just to name a few), though it could grow on me if I gave it a few tries in the upcoming episodes I have not watched.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway into the episodes and I would say I had the impression of this anime being a rip-off from Owari no Seraph based on the plot, just a little darker. Both have their own pros and cons, however, I liked how the confrontations were portrayed. It was more realistic in Sirius. I appreciated how the smaller numbers in the protagonist group and the fact that there was little bromance like how you can ship literally any two guys together in Owari no Seraph.\\n\\n\r\nMay I just say that the voice-acting was really on point? I liked the voice actor of Mikhail, as expected of the voice actor of Sting from Fairy Tail. Mikhail calling out Yuliy was heavenly and gave me chills (just my personal preference).\\n\\n\r\nAnother point to note is that I liked that the vampires were not portrayed as beautiful as that in Owari no Seraph, yet I felt that it was better than those in ONS like Ferid and Crowley.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely worth watching. I take interest in the vampire genre though there have not been many of such anime. To end off, I am anticipating more since I\u2019m only halfway through but I think that there are much more surprises packed for us viewers.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I do think that Alexei has a much more significant role although I may be mistaken. Additionally, I\u2019m looking forward to how Yuliy and Mikhail\u2019s story would unfold.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n",

And to be honest, he doesn't age well. The 'Jaeger' team of which our protagonist is a member consists of characters who are drawn and clothed in a manner that gives them an initial aura of intrigue and power, but as the show continues, we realize that their only real talent is being loyal to each other and knowing how to shoot guns. One character in particular makes a stellar contribution by merely throwing her sword. And she's present for almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was rather a waste of time having to sit through this. The only reason I watched it fully is because by the time I realized that the show is bad, I had already put myself through 8 episodes. And if I was going to trash this show, I wanted to make sure that I trashed it after watching it completely.",
