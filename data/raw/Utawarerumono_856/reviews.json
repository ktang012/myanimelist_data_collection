            "content": "Utawarerumono manages to be one of those harem animes that anyone can possibly find enjoyable, even if they don't particularly like the concept of harems. Based on the ero-game with the same title, Utawarerumono focuses on an amnesiac man who is found critically injured in a rural village. With the kindness of the villagers, he recovers and spends his days peacefully with them. However, the peaceful times quickly end with a heart shattering event that throws the man and his fellow villagers into a life of war.\r\nStory\r\nThe story in Utawarerumono is somewhat simplistic at first, with a majority of the anime following a simple formulaof battles, battles and even more battles while introducing new characters. One may find that the way the story unfolds in this show is quite repetitive. However, if you're a fan of war stories with occasionally comedic situations and intelligent strategies to undermine the enemy you will most likely overlook the lack of variation. Despite what has been said, Utawarerumono also has a number of twists and turns (especially in the second half of the show) that should keep the viewer glued to their chairs long enough to see the story through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAnimation is both a positive and negative point in Utawarerumono. While the animation actually animates the characters in combat (compared to other anime that may just use still images and lines to indicate action) with a good amount of detail, recycled animation occurs. The reused animation is unfortunately quite noticeable (although not too frequent) and may detract one's enjoyment of the battles. The CG animation present in this show is a mixed bag. Some may like it, some may not. Either way, the CG is only used occasionally so it shouldn't be a huge issue. Character designs are more or less consistent, detailed and interesting, albeit one (or more) episode(s) may have the characters looking slightly more odd then usual due to different animators.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound is also quite a mixed bag; you may like it or hate it. The opening song is quite catchy, although there is nothing particularly memorable about it. The ending song also proves to have a unique flair to it, with the overall tone of the music befitting the ambiance of this anime. As Utawarerumono contains a number of battle scenes, the background music does well in giving out the proper mood that is needed to set atmosphere of the show. The voice acting is decent, with no one really standing out but with everyone befitting their character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nUtawarerumono being a harem anime contains the usual female stock characters that you would find from other harems. The serious one, the flirtatious one, the cute one, the shy one and etc. However, due to the majority of the show focusing on war, thankfully most of the female characters are not just part of the harem and play a role in the story. Not every character is developed, most likely due to time constraints (although I'm not sure whether the original game developed the ones missed out in this show). Thankfully the main character and a number of other major characters are given some development and time to flesh out their backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs for why I enjoyed Utawarerumono - I have natural bias against anything that would be considered a harem anime, but the nicely animated action scenes and character designs won this series over for me. Storywise I thought most of the show didn't really offer much, but I was quite suprised towards the second half of the show where a number of twists were thrown in, making the overall story of this anime much more interesting. I also found almost all the characters to be likeable, except for the certain few which are obviously meant to be hated by the viewers. I only wish some other characters besides the ones given time were developed more properly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOverall, Utawarerumono manages to deliver an enjoyable package to the casual anime viewer. One may desire to watch this show more then once due to the presence of foreshadowing and a good amount of the background story told in different episodes. Either way, Utawarerumono has a little bit of everything for everyone. It has fan service-like scenes and characters, a large amount of intense action scenes and an intriguing and somewhat deep plot for those seeking something less mindless and profound. It may not prove to be strong in any given area, but it delivers a show that should leave most anime fans somewhat satisfied with what they've just seen.",

            "content": "For about 4/5 of the series, I really enjoyed myself. I&rsquo;m not usually into science fiction/supernatural anime series, so I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to anything when I started watching Utawarerumono. However, I was proven wrong. Utawarerumono was just so exciting and fun to watch and I really liked it &ndash; 4/5 of the 26 episodes. For the last 1/5, I didn&rsquo;t like it too much. I don&rsquo;t wanna give out any spoilers, so I&rsquo;ll just say that the last arc was too weird and it didn&rsquo;t register.\r\nAll the characters were really likable and I felt sorry for them whenever another war or battle emerges. It&rsquo;sa good thing they laugh and make me laugh now and then. My favorite was Oboro &ndash; I loved watching him fight alongside Dori and Gura, the adorable twins. I love Touka too. I&rsquo;m still wishing that he&rsquo;s secretly a guy so my crush on Touka would be justified, but that will never happen. Aruruu was just so adorable and I like her WAY more than her older sister Eruruu. I just find Eruruu a bit weak and bland. I really didn&rsquo;t like the idea of Hakuoro and Eruru as a couple. It&rsquo;s just too weird since Aruruu thinks of him as her dad. The villains were also as irritating as the main characters are likable. They really convinced me to hate them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was above average. Everything was well drawn and surprisingly, I&rsquo;m OK with the earthy color palette. The CG is something I have to think about. It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not good either. It reminds me of early PlayStation1 video game graphics, similar to Suikoden 2&rsquo;s graphics. The fight scenes were impressive (and exciting) &ndash; I love how the characters move swiftly and smoothly when fighting.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not familiar with most of the voice actors, but they were all very impressive. I have to admit that I was iffy with Hakuoro&rsquo;s voice at first, since I thought it was too manly and old for him, but in the end it turned out well. Everyone was able to bring out their respective character&rsquo;s personalities and that is what&rsquo;s important.\\n\\n\r\nAs a stand alone, I probably won&rsquo;t like the music that much. It&rsquo;s because the music was really tailored for the series. If I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy the music, I have to watch Utawarerumono along with it. On that note, I really love the opening theme. Whenever I watch Utawarerumono I just have to sing along with it. The BGM was good too. Most of it sounded tribal, for lack of a better word, which also went well with the theme and feel of the series. I also noticed that the music, although it sounds tribal and almost authentic, it would have sounded better if it was less synthesized.\\n\\n\r\nIt almost made my favorites list if it weren&rsquo;t for the last 4-5 episodes that were too weird for me. Overall I did like it, in fact I like it a lot and it&rsquo;s one of those series that left a strong impression on me.",

            "content": "What comes to mind when a visual novel gets an anime adaptation? Usually I think average guy, a bunch of overly cute unattainable girls and some kind of story arc surrounding each girl. However Utawarerumono disregards this overused high school romantic formula, with girls that require conquering like a RPG boss and goes for a more fascinating approach. \r\nUtawarerumono is an Action Adventure set in a world of Fantasy. Just think Lord of the Ring, but minus the Ring and Hobbits. Following the disturbing opening scene, we our introduced to our protagonist, a mysterious masked man with no recollection of who he is and whyhe has an immovable mask on his face. Now this amnesia plot device is one of the most over used but taking into account that this is based of a visual novel, it\u2019s certainly a good way for the player to start off with a clean slate. Now as for the story, a good amount of time is spent bringing this fantasy world to life, in what looks to be a very mild mannered series. But soon after being lulled into a false sense of security, the story develops into that of a war between nations. So instead of harem filled romance you can expect bloody battle after battle, in an ever developing storyline. Sure it would have been better if more thought was put into how to kick start this warfare plot but as a whole, the series did prove to be very exciting to watch. If only it remained that way throughout however in the last batch of episodes you\u2019ll witness one of the most thoughtless plot developments ever, which did a good enough job in ruining whatever impression I had of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist did suffer from this drastic change but before that he was a really interesting and mysterious character. It\u2019s a great thing seeing him develop from a nameless nobody to a charismatic figure and the other characters that gravitate towards him certainly have their own appeal or role in the story. Not to forget the female characters, who are what make it this an obvious adaptation from a visual novel but that isn\u2019t really a bad thing. The only negative aspect is the few really stupid and annoying characters (the Emperors) that stifle the quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really good as there\u2019s a fair amount of detail put into the characters and environments with some good water, fire & smoke effects. Yet a lot of corners were cut, like when it came to animating the fight scenes. At times it just looked cheap, with a lot of recycled scenes and who could forget the poorly implemented CGI character models in the armies. At least the music is truly special as it manages to go well with the anime, especially during the battles or when it is building up to something epic and I am particularly fond of the ending theme (R.I.P Eri Kawai).\\n\\n\r\nOverall Utawarerumono turned out to be a great Fantasy, Action, Adventure that pulled off a tale about one man and his journey onto greatness. There is quite a lot going for this show to get anyone into it, like the way the characters interact with one another and how the battles & politics were handled. Personally I was disappointed by the number of flaws that plagued the show, from the corners cut in animation, to the terribly erratic pacing and the few stupid decisions the characters made. But none of that really compares to how appalling the last couple episodes were handled. If you can overlook these then you\u2019ll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "one of my all time favorites, this show is a crowd pleaser.  disguised fanservice and comedy are inlcuded but do not mess with the plot.  if your going to watch this watch in japanese with english subs(see sound for explanation)\r\nStory:10/10\r\nthe story is very unique.  war is a prevailant theme but other themes are displayed throughout.  themes like love, compassion, vengeance, courage, friendship.  they all leave their mark on this show.  masterfully delivery of the amnesia portion of the plot.  flashbacks shedding light on the story and hakouro's past in small amounts at perfect moments.  based off aeroge game the  plot reflects the harem it was created after and adds romance to the story.  however as war and combat are just as prevailant it is my decision not to characterise this as a shounen or a shoujo anime.  it is both.  the fact that it managed to pull off such a feat so masterfuilly has earned it a 10 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nthe art is one of the best qualities of this anime.  all the characters are drawn consistantly well with no mistakes throughout the series.  character emotions are very vivid as are the landscapes.  the true beauty of this anime is the battle sequences though.  in most anime the animators will show still images depicting large scale combat.  this anime however went all out and animated entire battle scenes with hundreds of soldiers(with extremely few art flaws) without lagging.  this in itself was a feat of epic proportions.  now you may be wondering...why did it only get a 9?  in all honesty i would have given it a 9.5 however that is not possible on this site.  it deserves a 9 because while the animation is awesome a few animated sequences are repeated.  not enough to ruin the show but enough to slightly obvious. nevertheless i wish i could shake the hands of the animators for such quality work(i know how hard it is to animate combat so full battles deserves serious credit).\\n\\n\r\nsound:10/10\\n\r\nthe quality of sound is great in this anime.  it has a great soundtrack which seriously sets the mood for the series.  timing is perfect throughout(steel clashes when it should and lip snch is right on).  the opening theme and ending theme are specially tailored for the show and as such are not cheesey j-pop singles.  they fit the show and are catchy.  often i find myself humming them at random times.  i feel the need to get the OST(if i can find it).  the voice acting is simply amazing.  all of the voice actors fit their respective characters perfectly and bring out the personality and emotion very well.  all in all the selection of the cast was great.\\n\r\nthe english dubbed version was a different story enirely.  the dub sucked...badly. it was on par with the naruto dub(maybe worse) believe it!  i couldnt even make it through the first episode. watch it in japanese(with subs) or not at all. the dub is that bad.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:10/10\\n\r\nthe character set for this show is explained quite deeply throughout the show.  each character has their own distinct personality(except dori and gura, they share) and background.  as such when certain characters die(not telling who) the viewer is feeling every bit of the emotion and grief rolling off the screen by the characters.  since the show is based of a eroge(harem themed) there is the stereotypical female cast(shy, tomboyish, innocent, sisterlike, etc.) as well as the shounen cast(warriors all, nuff said)  while some characters are obviously designed to be the object of hatred from the viewers and others are your run of the mill expendable characters(*cough* soldiers), many are unforgettable characters whose personalities are things to be desired in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyement:10/10\\n\r\ni personaly enjoyed this anime a lot.  so much so im going to buy the DVD when i get the chance.  i like shoujo anime(yes im a romance junkie) and i enjoy shounen(battle and blood woohoo) and i must say this anime is my cup of tea.  everything i like sitting before me like a buffet.  i loved it. \\n\\n\r\noverall:10/10\\n\r\nit is as i said before, a crowd pleaser.  if you like comedy, romance, drama, harem, war.  give this one a shot.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite anime shows I have to say. The thing is, it will touch you in ways your emotions have never been touched before, or ways that will surprise you. Some of you might have heard of this show from the game of the same name released in 2002. The game is listed as an \u2018adult tactical role-playing visual novel\u2019 (that\u2019s a mouthful of itself) by a company called Leaf. For those not into gaming lingo, a tactical role-playing game is a type of video game where you have role-playing and strategy into one game. I believe \u2018Final Fantasy Tactics\u2019 fallsdown that same sort of line if I was to use a more well known title. Visual Novels on the other hand have a game play that is more based on amazing graphics and almost a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 aspect. And if we are going to break apart the genre even more, Adult really means that there are some rather \u2018erotic\u2019 points or that it is full of violence. The reason why I am breaking this down for you is because Utawarerumono was based off this really interesting genre and though I have not played the game, I feel that from what little I have seen, it sticks rather close to the idea of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is based around a man named Hakuoro, or at least that\u2019s the name they call him. He is a man who lost his memory and can\u2019t even remember who he is or why he has a mask on his face that will not come off. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u2018She calls everything a stereotype so she probably will call this a stereotype as well\u2019. The truth is your right. I will call this a stereotype but in this case, I think it actually works rather well to a point. There are major spoilers that will help answer why he lost them and it\u2019s not just a bump on the head, but for the reasons they do give us it just does work for this type of story line. Since it\u2019s based off of a game series, the main character is normally the one we play as. For this, it seems logical to have that character not know anything about his past in order to explain why he would select an answer to a question in the way he does. It also helps you learn more of his past through his eyes. I do understand why people use it, but it is over used. \\n\\n\r\nGoing back to Hakuoro, his personality is sort of bland. Sure he acts like a true leader, someone clothed in mystery and experience beyond his years, but sadly that seems to be the only thing that he has. That is sort of the \u2018point\u2019 where the stereotype point doesn\u2019t seem to want to work. You can give a person amnesia and have him still have a personality, but here he just seems like a cardboard cut out with how serious he takes things all the time\u2026 until a point. You see, this show has a strange way of making everything that happens as a spoiler so it\u2019s hard to talk about. I can say though that at that point you really do see the layers of Hakuoro that are really in depth. Where up until that point, he seems as though he is the perfect person in the world and then it makes you think he might not be that perfect after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe next characters are the two sisters that act as his adopted family. It doesn\u2019t seem right introducing them separate as they are so close. We will start with the youngest first I think. Aruru is a rather fun loving girl although we start out with her being rather timid. She has a really shy personality that makes me smile whenever I see her acting so curious. There really isn\u2019t much else about her except that she acts her age. She is a really believable little girl who I think might be around 6 or 7 years old. Eruru on the other hand is a very motherly figure. She cares not only for Aruru but for everyone around her. She is so many things that its surprising such a young girl can do all the things she does. She\u2019s not only a big sister to Aruru but she consoles Haruoro whenever he is torn between his discussions, calms those that need to be calmed, heals those who are sick both inside her group of friends and outside in the town, and somehow is still able to manage herself. I am surprised she doesn\u2019t break, making what she proclaims in the first episode \u2018country girls are strong\u2019 make a lot of sense. \\n\\n\r\nNow there are so many characters in this show that it is really hard to talk about every single one of them. Most of them are even spoilers for parts of the show which makes this review a living nightmare to try to do without spoiling anything. So instead of talking about the rest of the characters, I guess I will use this area to talk about the setting of the show. The show is based loosely around an indigenous people from Japan known as the Ainu (Aynu). Think of them as the Native American\u2019s of Japan (in a very very loose based way). They hunted and gathered their food, lived in small communities, and had a culture that was very based on the land. If you look at Haruoro\u2019s name, it actually is an Ainu word that I believe loosely means \u201cWhite Emperor\u201d (I am not an Ainu nor do I know how to speak Ainu, it\u2019s something I found online). They mixed the Ainu culture with a Feudal Japan culture in order to make a rather interesting war torn country, much like in historic times. The only difference is that in the show, everyone (except for Haruoro it seems) is an anthropomorphic creature. They have the bodies of humans with ears and tails (or wings) of an animal. Many of the strange things seem to point to it being an alternate timeline to our own but every once in a while, they sneak in a bit of technology that doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense. It just adds to the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a strange way of jumping up and down a lot. As was stated many times before now, this is a show based on the rise and fall of nations doing battle. As such, there are many different battles that are fought through the course of the series. Between each battle however, we are given a couple small breaks between the actions. These can be as boring as political debates on the next course of action to a slice of life following the lovable antics of Aruru and her friends. I think part of this is to show exactly how war is carried out, but also I just think it\u2019s partly for our psychological relief. This show is 26 episodes long; if we had a battle that lasted that whole time, we would be up in arms the whole time wanting our side to win. We wouldn\u2019t have time to get into the characters heads, no time for us to become emotionally connected to them, to hear the story of their past, to understand why they are fighting. These breaks do give us that time to get to know them, and sometimes to introduce new characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so beautiful at times, and then we will get points that just seem rather standard. Backgrounds are always so detailed and colored so amazing that it\u2019s hard to notice the little things that don\u2019t look quite right though. There are small times that the show used CG to show off some of the action scenes but I don\u2019t blame them. The fact that this is a battle heavy anime means that there are a ton of extras that would have to be drawn over and over again. CG helps cut the corners of this and if done right, it looks really good. I could barely see the differences for the most part between the CG and the animation so I think that is a win on their side. The times they didn\u2019t use the CG stuff was actually rather good as well, with characters movements being rather fluid and not many hiccups in design. I love how for most of the comedy, they kept to the same style as the rest of the show instead of trying to go chibi all the time. One of the main things I found so attractive of this show is the colors they work with. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful but they change the brightness to fit the mood. It can be so bright with fun colors and then suddenly have rather dark deep colors to show a very serious mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe music has this sort of haunting tone to it that seems to be sad but also a little mysterious. I am not sure if they were trying to match the concept of Hakuoro or just a sort of haunting nature of the people but it worked rather well. Pretty much all of the music besides the opening and the ending song were only instrumental, and captured the mood nicely. I do not know how close it is to Ainu music but it felt like it could be part of it. The English Voice acting I think was right on the mark with a lot of the characters. I sort of fell for Hakuoro\u2019s rather soft and yet forceful voice for some reason. Jogn Gremillian did such a beautiful job making Hakuoro sound like a caring man but also a man who can take charge when it was needed. For what little lines Aruru had, Sasha Paysinger did a very good job with the rather cute voice that actually didn\u2019t get on my nerves at all. For real, it wasn\u2019t a high pitched moe character that normal people do, but a more sweet style that I love. Kira Vincent-Davis did the voice for Eruru, and though it was rather good, I somehow feel a little disappointed in that the character sounds close to others she has done. Also, big props on Vic Mignogna who actually for once in his life played a character that was most of the time serious and didn\u2019t freak out all the time! (Ok, so that might not be exactly true on this being the only character he played like that, but most of his characters do tend to freak out.) \\n\\n\r\nThis show had very few flaws to it in my opinion, and had to be one of my favorite shows to jump into. You could feel the great chemistry between the characters, the amazing look of the battles, and the rather calming moments of the breaks.",

            "content": "There are two words that best describe my thoughts of Utawarerumono that not too many folks would like me to utter: otaku bait. I know this would seem kind of shallow-minded to anyone that may like this series. But considering mostly every prominent character in this series has some sort of animal ears and tail plus look ridiculously cute or physically attractive (along with this anime being an eroge strategy game adaptation), I rest my case with these two words being uttered.\r\nFor the most part, Utawarerumono's characters and plot developments are pretty formulaic and straight-forward. The series runs into several arcs with Hakuoro and hisallies running into some hostile enemy threat trying to either halt his revolt or take over his kingdom, Hakuoro coming up with a clever plan to halt said threat, gaining new allies from offing said threat and then a breather episode with comedy highlights coming from the quirks of the characters or everyday scenes with Hakuoro, Eruru and Aruru. While the first arc was okay with Hakuoro leading the commoners to revolt against their corrupt glutton of a ruler, the later arcs do get monotonous with their developments with every country in sight seemingly wanting a piece of Hakuoro and his kingdom for shallow reasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development with new characters in these arcs is limited to their appearances in said arcs and once they become one of Hakuoro's allies, their roles become mostly downplayed to being loyal soldiers to Hakuoro when they participate in a battle. Other than Hakuoro and a few major characters, you don't get to see too many developments with these ass-kicking characters after they become one of his comrades, which is kind of a shame as a couple of them had their interesting traits and backgrounds during their debut arcs, mainly Oboro and Touka. A number of the major villains confronted in these arcs are so over-the-top and ridiculous with their appearance, behavior and/or mannerisms that they are laughable, especially Hauenkua who reminds me enough of how nuts Escaflowne's Dilandau was.\\n\\n\r\nThe other prominent focus of the series is on Hakuoro's mysterious past which the series drops hints of in the not-so-entertaining later arcs of the show. Amnesiac hero storylines normally have a good amount of potential in unveiling some interesting developments for said main hero and a show's plot. But while Hakuoro's character is an interesting and likeable one, what I come to learn of his origins and background comes across as quite a big contradiction to the type of world Utawarerumono had set up throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series does sport good looking scenery and characters (despite the latter's clear \"appeal\") with vivid colors and a decent amount of detail applied to them. The show's animation is average at many points with occasional use of shortcuts and some bad use of CG animation in the rendering of armies during battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did get some enjoyment out of seeing Hakuoro and some other characters in their struggles throughout Utawarerumono, the show's cliched plot setup, weak focus on other prominent characters and ridiculous reveal on Hakuoro's origins greatly weakened the quality of the series in my eyes. This is a good example of why I'm cautious with approaching anime adaptations of eroge games as the quality of said title tends to vary and usually won't translate too well when made into an anime.",

            "content": "I think this anime was just poorly executed.\r\nThe overall story is actually good and interesting, at the beginning and again at the end, it was just buried under piles of nonsense and extremely forgettable characters. The story follows Hakuoro, who after being found and rescued by a small village he becomes the leader of a rebellion, emperor of a country and then spends his time fight wars with every other country around. \r\nA major plot twist happens near the end that was so unexpected and weird that my initial reaction was \"I am just going to pretend that didn't happen...\"and even when it gets explainedin the end and you no longer have to pretend it didn't happen, I was still thinking, \"it could have been better.\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause there were so many \"mini-wars\" they all ultimately blended together because they weren't very memorable. Characters were introduced and I had high hopes for what their future actions would be and how they would affect the plot but then the plot would change because of a different war in a different country and then those expectations just crumble into dust. There are some parts of this series that are completely boring as sin.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty enough, but this series, which is based on war, didn't have any memorable fight scenes of bad-assery. Seriously, even with the flat characters this would be more entertaining to watch if the characters at least could kick some ass in awesome fights. But the fights were boring and predictable. On the other hand, the characters being completely flat doesn't help. It's hard to get excited about a fight if you simply don't care whether or not a character dies.\\n\\n\r\nI always believed that good, well developed characters can carry a plot no matter how contrived it is, but in this case the characters are so bad, you're just sitting there thinking \"Who cares?\"\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really liked the opening song for this anime, so it was my favourite part of watching. \\n",

            "content": "In Utawarerumono, there are two gods that fight for eternity. This explanation as an answer to the mystery that surrounds the anime until about a half is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion. E gives rise to a final ultra-romantic, and so very unpleasant.\r\nHowever, the idea made me reflect. It was another anime that I felt sick to finish. Not as much as X, but almost. It's a sad ending (after all, it's ultra-romantic), in which many are hit and confirms that a destination of suffering for one of the main characters. Something forceful means to an anime that will gradually captivating, at least until themiddle of the plot. Once captivated, feel more impacts with those fictitious persons.\\n\\n\r\nThe reflection reminded me a bit of Nietzsche, the Greek philosophers of antiquity and also Milan Kundera, in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being A concept I never studied law: the eternal return.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea that I could infer the eternal return, which may be distorted with respect to the above references conceived, but I built up here has the following premise: we carry our past. The drama of Hakuoro, the anime, is precisely that of not remembering his past, not knowing what he carries. A drama that becomes more painful to the extent that he suspects not to remember his past. But how to get rid of it?\\n\\n\r\nHow Karura says, \"it is impossible to completely disconnect from the past.\" As it becomes worse for a god who returns to experience several lives forever? The hidden horror of the anime Utawarerumono is something that resembles the curse of Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel. It is the inescapable destiny to live forever, forever come back to life.\\n\\n\r\nMilan Kundera says in his most famous novel by celebrated and that is the French Revolution, for example, how would react if we were to repeat it forever, always cutting heads, an eternal return? What would be the weight of it? Einmal ist keinmal, says the German adage (\"once is never\"). There is a mystique around binarity, and very curious. It is as if there were only two numbers, where one equals zero, and the rest reaches infinity. The light would live once, only once, so that the experience would equal to nothing, perhaps because it is something finite in an infinite time. Interestingly, I remember having spoken about equality of existence and nonexistence. I ended up dropping it again somehow. The heavy, in turn, would live forever, forever returning to live. Again, I remember having mentioned the question of \"whether or not a story to an end.\" The target heavy does not give us that chance.\\n\\n\r\nIn Utawarerumono, does not explain how these gods were born. They may have arisen from mere humans. It is possible that they, the gods are nothing but ourselves. It is possible that we humans, for which accumulate more knowledge, nothing more than able to awaken the consciousness of the eternal return which we are stuck.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's terrible for a man found in the woods, injured, not remembering his days until then, how terrible it would be for us to be in the same situation? Assuming then that there is something like an afterlife, or something that brings us back to an experience ... how terrible it would be to ignore the past that pervaded by several lifetimes? Worse, how terrible would not realize that we are beginning to remember that?\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the chance of revival can not be disputed, we need not go that far. Simply we exchange of god. Just think that the god in question is not a human being, but humanity itself. As a member of humanity, can we, each of us, off the streets, watching the sky, hit the ground and even see how we treat each other and still say that what others have done before us has nothing to see us?\\n\\n\r\nAssume then that humanity is the god who is destined to fight with himself, guiding other beings with their power. God attached to the eternal return. Coincidence or not, Hakuoro is the only fully human person, ie, does not have ears or tails of animals like all other characters. The difference is that Hakuoro has a mask that can not get out. The question is if that mask is the hallmark of the link between apes and humans or whether technological remnant of an advanced civilization that perished - we do not have the answer to the curse which it represents (not sure if Benawi also not human, what would the only odd exception, as I remember). When this god despair, crushed by his fate, would be annihilated. But not even the black winged angel, created by him, Mutsumi, can do it.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming then that we, all of us, this god. What do you think? It is a god that is divided in two because it indulges in his wrath, and will pay for this act forever as the eternal return will bring back the anger. Every act is heavy. Every mistake is perpetual.\\n\\n\r\nI must confess I underestimated Parmenides. He said that in his philosophy that everything was very complicated being, that motion, time and change were illusions, also said that everything was binary. And in all groups associated dichotomies associated with the good and the bad. The pair light-heavy, so if associated respectively to the good-bad. I have always considered him a reluctant to accept the flow of things, like his contemporary Heraclitus said, today I must admit that he was more intelligent than I supposed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat shall we do with our mistakes? What shall we do with the sins of mankind? What awaits us?\\n\\n\r\nIf everything was light ... live with ease. Eruru not carry the suffering that comes from the Mikoto, Hakuoro could live without mask. Bastar\u00edamos live with and hope our story will end. So would fly over our destinies. And we would be so light and so scattered, like cirrus clouds. Our existence is no more than an imperceptible and tremendously ephemeral blur, a flash of blink of an eye.\\n\\n\r\nI have overcome the terror that comes over us when we first understand what it is to live once. But assuming the truth involving one of only two numbers of binarity existential, which would be more terrible? Living or once living forever? We would have to live only by our successes, that should sparkle on any errors that surely commit more frequently. What is harder then? Isolate themselves, cling to faint and rare warmth amid the eternal darkness and always retornantes or bet everything on one chance to live a simple and final time?\\n",

Anyone that seriously has a passion for action/adventure anime will be fooled and disappointed with the ratings and genre. \r\nConcept: 8/10\r\nIf there is anything good about this anime, it is the concept of the plot.The story briefly is about an injured man with a wierd mask that is saved by the people of a small village, that man suffers with amnesia and that village quickly becomes his home. Because of his wisdom and kindness, he quickly becomes the leader and then his forgotten past begins to haunt him. The anime involves many war sequences, some strategies involved, loyalties, betrayals and violence. Sounds like a good concept for a action/adventure lover.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Characters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe director of the anime did come up with a good concept, but failed miserably in translating a good concept to enjoyment. I thought the potential of a very good concept was totally wasted. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character in the anime suits perfectly for this kind of story, the major problem is some of the characters that surround him. There is very little character development and everyone else just pops out of the blue, you will know very little about every major character of the anime by the time you finish. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is purely for simpleminded people, trust me, there is NOTHING genius about this anime. It had little to no twists and turns in the plot, everything seemed predictable. There are NO scenes where you will be amazed, there are NO scenes where you will get fired up. The whole concept of war is made a joke. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no humor in the anime, some will say there is some, but that is for simpleminded ones. There is absolutely NO humor in the anime and the very little efforts of humor add to the problems.\\n\\n\r\nBe prepared for some very annoying characters that are sadly major characters in the anime, a female girl named Eruru and her little sister Aruru. The main character of the series (Hakuoro) is looked upon as father by the little sister Aruru while the older sister Eruru loves him. In one of the middle episodes of the anime, Hakuoro tells  publicly that Eruru is like his sister, yet Eruru continues to love him. There is excessive romance between Hakuoro and Eruru, by romance I mean situations that involve Eruru showing her love, but Hakuoro showing indifference to her love. I personally could not take a pseudo incest relationship, every episode will have some. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have moronic scenes that do not make any sense. Eruru and Aruru care a lot about Hakuoro and will insist on accompanying him to the wars and he agrees. I am talking about roughly a 17 year old girl with no fighting skills that wants to stay close to her lover at any cost and a 8 year old girl that just does not want to stay away from her dad even for few hours. They both accompany him to wars where there is massive killing happening around them, hardcore I mean. These kind of situations will make you feel \"I could have done a better job directing this\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good for the most part, but the fight sequences could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nBy end of the day I did not learn anything from this anime, dropped watching a couple of times in middle and still picked up because I had nothing else to watch, ultimately repented for the time I invested.",

After the first episode I sought myself wanting more and more and then before i realized it i had finished all 26 episodes. \r\n-The story was quite interesting as well. I thought to myself why the heck would i want to watch an anime about a guy who cant remember his past and is unable to take off a mask that had no meaning throughout the story?(minor spoiler) Anyways when I continued on through the anime I was gaining more and more knowledge about what the meaning of hismask and his life overall and what had happened to him in the past. Its kind of hard for me to explain exactly what i liked about the story without giving you a spoiler. All i can say is dont judge a book by its cover. This show is very entertaining and will have you wanting more just like it did me.\\n\\n\r\n-The art was the probably the best thing about this show. I was very intrigued by the art form that made up the anime. The characters and setting were all very very well done. My favorite aspect of the art was that it really brought out old and modern Japanese culture. Watch this anime and you will be amazed by how astonishing the artwork is.\\n\\n\r\n-The sound was well done as well. I cannot compare it to the subbed version because i only watched the dubbed. If i do get around to rewatching this show i will watch it in the subbed version and then update this post. Anyways theres not much to say about the sound because it was really good the actors did a good job and  the songs that were played  were very suited to be in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters were all great. I loved all of them. They were very well designed and brought something new to the table whenever there was a new character introduced. They were all very skilled warriors and made the battles very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n-My enjoyment as you can tell by the rating its pretty high. I never saw myself losing interest in this show. Everything from the action to the melo drama that was introduced kept me very entertained. If you give this show a shot you will not be disappointed!!\\n\\n\r\n-Overall. As you can tell my ratings and statements you can see that i love this show. Everything came together nicely and concluded with a good ending that i was very satisfied with.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review I hope this somewhat helps you decide to give this show a shot.",

            "content": "Story: An anime based of a H-Visual Novel may not seem like the premise of a good anime but it is. The plot may seem to repeat at times but it's just building up to some mind blowing plot twists in the end, I assure you, you won't see it coming. The plot has everything, massive battles won by brilliant strategies, amazing character interaction and a romance plot that you actually care about, I was never once bored and simply hoping that the episode would just finish so like so many animes do. It's so good that I was depressed when the anime was oversimply because it ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is simply gorgeous, it really sets the fantasy setting and brings life to the character. I have never seen any other anime with a art style just like this so that is simply a bonus. The characters (at least the important ones) all have a distinctive look that really fits there character. If there is one flaw in this anime is they will repeat animations during battles at times but it is never enough to take away from the enjoyment of watching the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is incredible, both the music and voice acting is done spectacularly well, I can only say this for the Japanese version for I never watch an anime in English if I can help it. There is no character who whenever they open their mouth you flinch because it's so annoying or and thank god there are no &quot;Believe It&quot;'s to speak of. The voice acting is definitely some of the best I have ever heard and that brings a lot of emotion into the story. The lip syncing is never of an the soundtrack is simply incredible, the music always fits the mood perfectly and it doesn't get old, if I could get the soundtrack I would never stop listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: While the plot is amazing, the art is gorgeous and the sound is incredible, what really makes this anime the best anime ever (in my own humble opinion of course) is the characters. Unlike in most animes where I find myself liking only a couple of the characters and just apathy towards the rest of the characters I genuinely care about each and every character. These are characters who, if I met them in real life, I would look up to and want to be friends with. I found myself getting depressed because something bad happened to one of the main characters and happy simply because they were happy. And I'm not one of the people that happens to that often, each character has their own subplots and each is there own character, you don't go yeah, just another sasuke fan girl, except for twins each character is their own character and you won't see characters like Hakuoro in any anime but Utawarerumuno. The character interaction is the best I've seen in any anime and like I said before the romance subplot is the best I've ever seen and one you will genuinely care for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well like I said, best anime ever, in fact their is no book, movie or TV show I have enjoyed more than Utawarerumono. The roller coaster of emotions, the beautiful artwork, mind blowing plot and genuine characters will insure you never have a dull moment and will want to rewatch it again, again and again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Simply put Best Anime Ever",

            "content": "This is such an awesome show...I really was not expecting this show to be  as good as it was but maybe by everyone saying it was 'so good' you might pick up this series thinking it's this EPIC masterpiece of an anime like a ROBOTECH, Cowboy Bebop or Fullmetal Alchemist....when it really isn't. So I don't think you should let you expectations go overboard either.  I'm just saying that if maybe you see the cute dog-boys and cat-girls and bird people and that's not your thing or you think \u201cgreat this is one of those shows!\u201d where everything is all cutesy lovely, thenyes you will be surprised.....because this show is definitely not cutesy and lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good. This show offers some nice-looking characters and there is great use of colors. They did reuse some of the fight scenes, especially the one where the lead character, Haruko, does this killer move with his fan/weapon...which kind of felt like deja vu. But scene looping and stuff doesn't annoy me unless they really over do it and I don't think it will bother you either unless that's your pet peeve. There is good animation movement in this series and you can tell that there was some CG work used as well because the way some of the battle scenes were laid out and how the camera panned or the way the lizard-horses were moving. It was all very cool.\\n\\n\r\nThis show seems to have an all star cast when it comes the voice actors, I see a lot of names from a lot of other series. I really am not good with voices and names except for a very limited few, but these names I have seen the a lot of times from shows like Inuyasha and FullMetal Alchemist. They are all very good actors and they make watched dubbed shows very enjoyable. The music is OK but not really a 'must have' or anything. The best song for me is probably the ending song probably because I don't know if I would classify it as J-POP or Rock or what, but it sounds good though.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning you will get hooked because it is kind of a mystery, the lead character has amnesia and he does not know who, what or where he is not even his name. Anyway that's how I got hooked, I saw episode one on Anime Channel's VoD and I needed to know how it turned out. I think a lot of people who are into action and military type of anime will also like this one! There are a lot of brutal battle scenes with blood and violence, these are always pluses for me when it comes to selecting anime shows to watch, but you might as well know that it does get pretty gruesome. There is also some comedy in there, so this is really not a really heavy hard-hitting series or anything. One main issue I have with the story though is that there seems to be no essence of time. It could be 5 minutes, 5 years or 5 months the show doesn't really have a firm grasp of depicting time passing. You get the feeling that some time has passed somewhat but then again, just how much time...no one knows.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not into cat-bird-people or beast-people too much, I like just plain human looking people, but this was tolerable. It's not like they had complete tiger faces or Minotaurs or anything like that, thank goodness. The were relatively attractively drawn people and they all had nice personalities, especially the core group of characters. Just like how I was talking about the strange \u201ctime-warping\u201d issue that occurs with the story narrative, you can really get that sense with some of the characters popping in for a bit then poof they disappear and their side of the story seems unresolved or maybe kinda rushed.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this show though, mainly because it so very much surprised me as to the type of anime I thought it was going to be. I really thought it was just going to be some fluffy nice [shoujo-style] anime and it wound up being this fantastic, gritty and gory series. That really changed my opinion of this show, but maybe it might freak you out if you are not into that kind of show,\\n",

            "content": "To start this off I just want to say that I will attempt to contain any and all spoilers to the \"story\" section of my review.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is just as the synopsis states: Utawarerumono is based on a masked man with amnesia who wakes up in a strange new world. Just reading this synopsis may make some people think that Utwarerumono is simply your typical shounen story where the protagonist recovers his memory half way into the story and he broods over his past in which he did something he regrets to a loved one. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. I'mgoing to go out and say that yes, Hakuoro does recover his memory somewhere throughout the story but the main drama surrounding him is him struggling to grasp just who he was. I won't go into details here but there are a few twists in which the audience couldn't possibly expect surrounding just who Hakuoro is and what he was doing prior to being found by Eruruu. There are some things that aren't covered in the anime such as why Kamyu sucked Aruruu's blood and honestly you're better off not knowing since the answer is strange and may ruin her character for certain people.\\n\r\nRight up until the ending there is information that may mess with your view of the world that Utawarerumono has created and about who Hakuoro is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMy view on the art of this series may differ from other reviews as I had watched the Blu-ray version in which animation studios fix mistakes and improve the overall quality of the animation at times.\\n\r\nThe art in this series looked fantastic all the way through from the backgrounds to the characters in the foreground. There were a few times when a character's face wasn't directly in view that the face or character looked like a blob of scribbles but the times this happened could be counted on one hand. The animation was smooth however once or twice animation was reused entirely. An example of this is in the later episodes in which Hakuoro is fighting off a few soldiers with his fan and less than five minutes later the exact same fight sequence is played again for whatever reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound quality for this series was very well done. During battle sequences it felt like you were there and could hear the swords clank next to you. The village scenes felt very serene and calming and the town scenes felt like you were in the center of a bustling street with street vendors talking over one another and everything.\\n\r\nOne complaint though is that there was only one opening sequence for every episode and it gave several major spoilers including all of the major villains for the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were varied and didn't all follow standard tropes laid out for them. Hakuoro who is normally the calm monotone person has several outbreaks of emotion and character. Of course some characters such as Oboro fit their character tropes to a t. My biggest complaint regarding characters though has to do with Mukkuru. Mukkuru is a white tiger and the pet/friend of Aruruu. However, Mukkuru displays the opposite behaviours that a cat would display. For example, when Mukkuru is happy he may wag his tail similar to a dog; however, when a cat wags it's tail that doesn't mean \"I'm happy\" it means more along the lines of \"I'm angry/annoyed\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm honestly a bit mad at myself for watching this show. I enjoyed it so much that I haven't been able to enjoy some shows that have been on my backlog as I can't help but say \"Utawarerumono did ____ better\". I'm not even sure how I came across this show but I am glad I found it as it is among my top 10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nUtawarerumono is not perfect and thus it does not deserve a perfect score. However, the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone that likes fantasy or anime about war.",

            "content": "So when I first found out about this title, the first thing came into mind is, \u201cWhat the hell does Utawarme\u2026.Utaworm\u2026..Uta\u2026Damn it, I can\u2019t even say it right!! What does\u2026that damn word mean?\u201d Well, after that, the title of the show is translated into English as, \u201cThe One Being Sung\u201d, which does describe one of the character\u2019s rise in the series and funny thing about this being based on a videogame and how it was supposed to be a harem, considering I didn\u2019t see the whole harem part in this, but more on that later.\r\nA man awakens in an unfamiliar village with no memory ofhis past or identity. The only clue: a devil-horned mask which conceals the upper half of his face but cannot be removed. Still recovering from the bad wounds he had when he was found and without any clear direction, the man settles in to village life and soon becomes not only a valued and respected member, but effectively a member of the family of healers \u2013 old Tsukuru, young Eruru, and even younger Aruruu \u2013 who helped him recover, even taking on the name Hakuoro, which belonged to the long-dead father of the girls. Trouble won\u2019t leave the village alone, however, as a discontented former villager tries to exploit their resources, a tiger-like forest god threatens to rampage, and an unfortunate series of events leads to unintended rebellion. Throughout it all Hakuoro stands as a stoic source of inspiration even though he is deeply troubled by haunting images of his past.\\n\\n\r\nI got to say right off the bat; the story does have an interesting plot of an amnesiac main character that probably has a disturbing past of him and he probably does once you get further into the show. There is the aspect of war and how you think everything is going to be fine but it isn\u2019t as worse shit continues to happen to them, deaths that can hit you hard emotionally if you really wanted them to live, and the trials of rebelling against the higher authority. Now, I know this is based on an adventure/role-playing/eroge game (or just Japanese adult visual novel) and I guess like the adaptations of that, you sense no trace of them nor do did I find any typical harem traits aside from the amount of girls there with wolf ears (then again, mostly everybody in the show has either wolf, cat, dog, rabbit, etc. ears) but saying it\u2019s a harem because there\u2019s lots of girls (or guys if it\u2019s a reverse harem) doesn\u2019t exactly make it one (OK: Maybe that one or two times). I will say that it does get too sappy at sometimes but just enough to not be overbearing melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are 90/10 on the love/hate scale although it is more of an ensemble cast of characters and most of them have these different stories to them, like Hakuoro and his unknown past, why later in the series people thinking he was a murderer and why he can\u2019t take off that mask. I would have like to know more about the sisters Eruru & Aruruu and most of their family life but it was more preoccupied with the long war and all that. Oh yeah, one character that I couldn\u2019t stand in fucking Nuwangi. I just cannot stand that guy and desperately either wanted him easily defeated or killed off. Luckily, he\u2019s not in the show for long but he was still annoying as hell.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is actually great here and it\u2019s expected being at the 2006-2007 anime boom year. The show was made by animation studio Oriental Light and Magic, the same studio that did not-so-great animation for a great series (Berserk). Like I said, the show does have a very playful nature to it, but during the battle scenes, expect a lot of bloodshed in there but luckily, it isn\u2019t overly excessive and violence for the sake of being violent. The opening theme is\u2026.dangerously catchy to listen to, but you might need to listen to it several times to not forget about it. Overall, the music is fairly decent for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub by ADV Films (later re-licensed by FUNimation) is a great effort done with the script being close to the original source and although there aren\u2019t any standouts, the performances of John Gremillion as Hakuoro and Kira Vincent-Davis as Eruruu deliver some great dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Utawarerumono is a delightful and ambitious show that has its playful side with the characters and also the more darker-toned and serious side of itself that seems to fit within and since FUNimation rescued it from obscurity, you can easily buy the whole series or watch it on their website if you want. It\u2019s a watch recommendation from me.\\n",

            "content": "Studio OLM that brought the world Berserk and Pokemon in the late 90\u2019s now brings an anime in 2006 that can best be described as anime-nerd-bait aka otaku bait. Together with new director Tomoki Kobayashi (Galaxy Angel Z) they attempted to adapt this eroge strategy game. At first, the product of Utawarerumono started off with an interesting high fantasy with semi-interesting characters and then takes a left-turn along the way.\r\nThe show begins with a cute wolf-type girl finding an injured man in the woods wearing a mask he cannot remove. She and her family nurse him back to health, but the man still does nothave any memories of his past. Slowly, the audience learns the land, society, and the slow progression to war with strategic battle ensuing. \\n\\n\r\nMostly, Utawarerumono is formulaic in the characters with typical trope characters such as the quiet adorable little sister character. Even the plot is fairly simple from the start with oppressed people fighting back against the tyrants. Over the course of the anime there is little in character development and more towards the main group gathering other character arch-types to join the team. Basically, this anime wanted to be what The Vision of Escaflowne was. This was a show with a compelling premise that pretty much fails in its goal.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, the people behind Utawarerumono decided to drop the story they were telling for almost zero reason like something anime fans had seen in something out of Votoms in the 80s as an example. Unlike Votoms though, the characters in Utawarerumono have the personality of either a stone or a carebear. Even the character art and animation does not seem much better than Studio OLM\u2019s past works like Berserk and Pokemon from the 90\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say the show is completely terrible. Some scenes of battles and the fantasy world are interesting, but ultimately with predictable characters and a plot that is shallow, the show is just flat. There are plenty of other fantasy shows to recommend like The Vision of Escalflowne over this anime. In the end Utawarerumono should stay as an eroge game and was not a good adaptation.",

            "content": "The One Being Sung tells the story of a man called Hakuoro who finds himself in a sword and sorcery world with no memory of who he is. Soon after being welcomed into the local village, the villagers rally behind Hakuoro against their emperor and the revolution begins. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nWhat I really like about the story for this anime is it isn't just action, but also delves into some of the politics and planning of war. For example, after their country is invaded Hakuoro has to make the decision do they retaliate by invading the enemy country or do they first secure their boarders andrecover from the last battle. It's refreshing to see a protagonist like Hakuoro who stops to make a plan and just doesn't attack without thinking. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't get the wrong idea, this anime isn't just talking, there's some really good action too like full-scale battles between armies. The battles are definitely the best part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has an over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning who he use to be before he lost his memory. Throughout the anime, Hakuoro experiences these flashbacks, but it isn't fully explained how all these different flashes of memory Hakuoro has connect until the end. However, after I watched the final episode, I was still a little confused and had some unanswered questions. I don't want to spoil anything, but I feel like there should've been more exposition. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nHakuoro: Hakuoro's best quality is his leadership skills. Hakuoro really does consider his friends his family and everything he does is to protect them and their country. However, there are a few scenes where Hakuoro does lose his calm attitude, when he begins to question what if the person he was before he lost his memory was some kind of monster. \\n\\n\r\nEruruu: What I like about Eruruu is she's like the mother of the main characters as in she's always worrying about everyone else, but also manages to smile and be so positive all the time which brightens the mood of the show. Furthermore, I admire Eruruu's loyalty to Hakuoro and it shows how much she cares about him. \\n\\n\r\nKarura: Hakuoro's my favorite character, but Karuras my second. I love how she fights like the Incredible Hulk as in she just smashes whats ever is in front of her and so effortlessly destroys her enemies. \\n\\n\r\nTouka: Touka is the opposite of Karura; first Touka fights with this very graceful and precise fighting style and always has this focused look in her eye. Also, while Karura has a disrespectful, carefree attitude, Touka is the opposite and will do anything for her master and do what she thinks is right. They make an interesting pair to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nBenawi: I really like Benawi because he's such a great fighter and like Hakuoro is a great leader too, but I was disappointed nothing about his background is revealed. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSomething I really like about the character designs is how you really know you're in another world (not just in the past) because most the character aren't purely human. Karura's got cat ears and a tiger tail; Touka has bird wings for ears; and Urtori and Kamyu have angel wings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI really liked this anime for the action with the epic battles and the characters were all great. It's only the over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning about his past that I found confusing. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I think I liked this show?  I will explain my thoughts a bit, but there are slight spoilers so I'll put some spaces before I begin.\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\nSo the show starts off as a fairly average fantasy show and the main character drives technological and tactical development in a medieval world.  It is nothing special, but enjoyable.  However, halfway or more through, the show goes in a completely different direction.  At first it seems like they've got gundams, but then you realize that they're more like the machines from Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The plot suddenly gets very confusing and the show doesa poor job explaining what happens.  They touch on human experimentation, reincarnation, sateliite lases, and divinities.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character has gathered his allies, which include a few good characters, but when they bring in the mobile suits, those characters are basically useless.  All the character development of his allies is essentially wasted.  It was like the first half and second half were done by completely different people.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has no idea what it wants to be and the viewer has the experience of a fantasy show suddenly changed in direction that was never foreshadowed in the early parts.  It was like if an author wrote an entire book with no magic and no hints of magic, then the ending was solved by the main character with, \"oh yeah I can do magic.\" (This is my example of an idea, not what happens in the show.)  When you set up the rules for a fictional world, the author needs to obey those rules, and if they want to change things then foreshadowing is necessary.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to pin down my feelings on everything because I really liked a few of th characters, but in my opinion the show really went off the rails.  Too much is unexplained to the viewer.  It is also difficult to figure out what the target audience is, the beginning and ending are just so different.  I took a little while to stew before writing this review, because honestly, I felt a bit mad after the show ended.  This was a decent universe that was squandered.",

XD The music was ok i guess..nothing bad but nothing grand either and the animation i would say..it is average...nothing worht while but too bad either.\\n\\n\r\nThe Only few flaws i found in it..is that it really focuses a bit to much on jumping from situation to the next,,what i mean is that the pacing really starts to get really fast with shifting from one story to the next and maybe the focus on war conflicts and action were a bit to much..they should have given it more breathing room, to develop the characters..dont get me wrong they had plenty of development but i could say they could focused a bit more on there background.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line i would give it a 8/10...it is a rather interesting story and for those who like a little bit of fantasy, action and war drama i would recommend to give this a shot.\\n\r\nI know there is a second season that just recently got released..but i am going to stop for now and wait for the dub to come out....yeah i watched the first season dubbed and i would say it is pretty good,,especially from the time period it was released. \\n\\n\r\nGranted i could watch the second season sub only...it wont be the first time...but since i got a little advance that the second season is part 1 of a two parter and that a possible s3 is coming out when the game that it is based on it comes out. \\n\\n\r\ni mgiht as well wait a little while...if the s3 starts airing before the dub is out than il just watch it before it does.",

I loved all the female characters and i loved when more kept being added\r\nbut its not just a simply harem because their are a lot of male cast too (Benawi, Oboro, the twins)\r\nthen i love the OP theme (and the ED ones too)\r\nand the concept of slowly overcoming difficult hurdles and eventually leading andbuilding an empire was very satisfying. The abilities of all the characters as well as the main characters background is truly gratifying \\n\\n\r\nthe story was intelligently made and the art is cute and fun (we've got adorable characters, sexy characters, cool characters all the like)\\n\\n\r\ni think the best part is the fact the main character becomes an emperor and has many faithful companions.

            "content": "Utawarerumono manages to be one of those harem animes that anyone can possibly find enjoyable, even if they don't particularly like the concept of harems. Based on the ero-game with the same title, Utawarerumono focuses on an amnesiac man who is found critically injured in a rural village. With the kindness of the villagers, he recovers and spends his days peacefully with them. However, the peaceful times quickly end with a heart shattering event that throws the man and his fellow villagers into a life of war.\r\nStory\r\nThe story in Utawarerumono is somewhat simplistic at first, with a majority of the anime following a simple formulaof battles, battles and even more battles while introducing new characters. One may find that the way the story unfolds in this show is quite repetitive. However, if you're a fan of war stories with occasionally comedic situations and intelligent strategies to undermine the enemy you will most likely overlook the lack of variation. Despite what has been said, Utawarerumono also has a number of twists and turns (especially in the second half of the show) that should keep the viewer glued to their chairs long enough to see the story through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAnimation is both a positive and negative point in Utawarerumono. While the animation actually animates the characters in combat (compared to other anime that may just use still images and lines to indicate action) with a good amount of detail, recycled animation occurs. The reused animation is unfortunately quite noticeable (although not too frequent) and may detract one's enjoyment of the battles. The CG animation present in this show is a mixed bag. Some may like it, some may not. Either way, the CG is only used occasionally so it shouldn't be a huge issue. Character designs are more or less consistent, detailed and interesting, albeit one (or more) episode(s) may have the characters looking slightly more odd then usual due to different animators.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound is also quite a mixed bag; you may like it or hate it. The opening song is quite catchy, although there is nothing particularly memorable about it. The ending song also proves to have a unique flair to it, with the overall tone of the music befitting the ambiance of this anime. As Utawarerumono contains a number of battle scenes, the background music does well in giving out the proper mood that is needed to set atmosphere of the show. The voice acting is decent, with no one really standing out but with everyone befitting their character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nUtawarerumono being a harem anime contains the usual female stock characters that you would find from other harems. The serious one, the flirtatious one, the cute one, the shy one and etc. However, due to the majority of the show focusing on war, thankfully most of the female characters are not just part of the harem and play a role in the story. Not every character is developed, most likely due to time constraints (although I'm not sure whether the original game developed the ones missed out in this show). Thankfully the main character and a number of other major characters are given some development and time to flesh out their backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs for why I enjoyed Utawarerumono - I have natural bias against anything that would be considered a harem anime, but the nicely animated action scenes and character designs won this series over for me. Storywise I thought most of the show didn't really offer much, but I was quite suprised towards the second half of the show where a number of twists were thrown in, making the overall story of this anime much more interesting. I also found almost all the characters to be likeable, except for the certain few which are obviously meant to be hated by the viewers. I only wish some other characters besides the ones given time were developed more properly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOverall, Utawarerumono manages to deliver an enjoyable package to the casual anime viewer. One may desire to watch this show more then once due to the presence of foreshadowing and a good amount of the background story told in different episodes. Either way, Utawarerumono has a little bit of everything for everyone. It has fan service-like scenes and characters, a large amount of intense action scenes and an intriguing and somewhat deep plot for those seeking something less mindless and profound. It may not prove to be strong in any given area, but it delivers a show that should leave most anime fans somewhat satisfied with what they've just seen.",

            "content": "For about 4/5 of the series, I really enjoyed myself. I&rsquo;m not usually into science fiction/supernatural anime series, so I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to anything when I started watching Utawarerumono. However, I was proven wrong. Utawarerumono was just so exciting and fun to watch and I really liked it &ndash; 4/5 of the 26 episodes. For the last 1/5, I didn&rsquo;t like it too much. I don&rsquo;t wanna give out any spoilers, so I&rsquo;ll just say that the last arc was too weird and it didn&rsquo;t register.\r\nAll the characters were really likable and I felt sorry for them whenever another war or battle emerges. It&rsquo;sa good thing they laugh and make me laugh now and then. My favorite was Oboro &ndash; I loved watching him fight alongside Dori and Gura, the adorable twins. I love Touka too. I&rsquo;m still wishing that he&rsquo;s secretly a guy so my crush on Touka would be justified, but that will never happen. Aruruu was just so adorable and I like her WAY more than her older sister Eruruu. I just find Eruruu a bit weak and bland. I really didn&rsquo;t like the idea of Hakuoro and Eruru as a couple. It&rsquo;s just too weird since Aruruu thinks of him as her dad. The villains were also as irritating as the main characters are likable. They really convinced me to hate them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was above average. Everything was well drawn and surprisingly, I&rsquo;m OK with the earthy color palette. The CG is something I have to think about. It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not good either. It reminds me of early PlayStation1 video game graphics, similar to Suikoden 2&rsquo;s graphics. The fight scenes were impressive (and exciting) &ndash; I love how the characters move swiftly and smoothly when fighting.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not familiar with most of the voice actors, but they were all very impressive. I have to admit that I was iffy with Hakuoro&rsquo;s voice at first, since I thought it was too manly and old for him, but in the end it turned out well. Everyone was able to bring out their respective character&rsquo;s personalities and that is what&rsquo;s important.\\n\\n\r\nAs a stand alone, I probably won&rsquo;t like the music that much. It&rsquo;s because the music was really tailored for the series. If I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy the music, I have to watch Utawarerumono along with it. On that note, I really love the opening theme. Whenever I watch Utawarerumono I just have to sing along with it. The BGM was good too. Most of it sounded tribal, for lack of a better word, which also went well with the theme and feel of the series. I also noticed that the music, although it sounds tribal and almost authentic, it would have sounded better if it was less synthesized.\\n\\n\r\nIt almost made my favorites list if it weren&rsquo;t for the last 4-5 episodes that were too weird for me. Overall I did like it, in fact I like it a lot and it&rsquo;s one of those series that left a strong impression on me.",

            "content": "What comes to mind when a visual novel gets an anime adaptation? Usually I think average guy, a bunch of overly cute unattainable girls and some kind of story arc surrounding each girl. However Utawarerumono disregards this overused high school romantic formula, with girls that require conquering like a RPG boss and goes for a more fascinating approach. \r\nUtawarerumono is an Action Adventure set in a world of Fantasy. Just think Lord of the Ring, but minus the Ring and Hobbits. Following the disturbing opening scene, we our introduced to our protagonist, a mysterious masked man with no recollection of who he is and whyhe has an immovable mask on his face. Now this amnesia plot device is one of the most over used but taking into account that this is based of a visual novel, it\u2019s certainly a good way for the player to start off with a clean slate. Now as for the story, a good amount of time is spent bringing this fantasy world to life, in what looks to be a very mild mannered series. But soon after being lulled into a false sense of security, the story develops into that of a war between nations. So instead of harem filled romance you can expect bloody battle after battle, in an ever developing storyline. Sure it would have been better if more thought was put into how to kick start this warfare plot but as a whole, the series did prove to be very exciting to watch. If only it remained that way throughout however in the last batch of episodes you\u2019ll witness one of the most thoughtless plot developments ever, which did a good enough job in ruining whatever impression I had of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist did suffer from this drastic change but before that he was a really interesting and mysterious character. It\u2019s a great thing seeing him develop from a nameless nobody to a charismatic figure and the other characters that gravitate towards him certainly have their own appeal or role in the story. Not to forget the female characters, who are what make it this an obvious adaptation from a visual novel but that isn\u2019t really a bad thing. The only negative aspect is the few really stupid and annoying characters (the Emperors) that stifle the quality of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is really good as there\u2019s a fair amount of detail put into the characters and environments with some good water, fire & smoke effects. Yet a lot of corners were cut, like when it came to animating the fight scenes. At times it just looked cheap, with a lot of recycled scenes and who could forget the poorly implemented CGI character models in the armies. At least the music is truly special as it manages to go well with the anime, especially during the battles or when it is building up to something epic and I am particularly fond of the ending theme (R.I.P Eri Kawai).\\n\\n\r\nOverall Utawarerumono turned out to be a great Fantasy, Action, Adventure that pulled off a tale about one man and his journey onto greatness. There is quite a lot going for this show to get anyone into it, like the way the characters interact with one another and how the battles & politics were handled. Personally I was disappointed by the number of flaws that plagued the show, from the corners cut in animation, to the terribly erratic pacing and the few stupid decisions the characters made. But none of that really compares to how appalling the last couple episodes were handled. If you can overlook these then you\u2019ll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "one of my all time favorites, this show is a crowd pleaser.  disguised fanservice and comedy are inlcuded but do not mess with the plot.  if your going to watch this watch in japanese with english subs(see sound for explanation)\r\nStory:10/10\r\nthe story is very unique.  war is a prevailant theme but other themes are displayed throughout.  themes like love, compassion, vengeance, courage, friendship.  they all leave their mark on this show.  masterfully delivery of the amnesia portion of the plot.  flashbacks shedding light on the story and hakouro's past in small amounts at perfect moments.  based off aeroge game the  plot reflects the harem it was created after and adds romance to the story.  however as war and combat are just as prevailant it is my decision not to characterise this as a shounen or a shoujo anime.  it is both.  the fact that it managed to pull off such a feat so masterfuilly has earned it a 10 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nthe art is one of the best qualities of this anime.  all the characters are drawn consistantly well with no mistakes throughout the series.  character emotions are very vivid as are the landscapes.  the true beauty of this anime is the battle sequences though.  in most anime the animators will show still images depicting large scale combat.  this anime however went all out and animated entire battle scenes with hundreds of soldiers(with extremely few art flaws) without lagging.  this in itself was a feat of epic proportions.  now you may be wondering...why did it only get a 9?  in all honesty i would have given it a 9.5 however that is not possible on this site.  it deserves a 9 because while the animation is awesome a few animated sequences are repeated.  not enough to ruin the show but enough to slightly obvious. nevertheless i wish i could shake the hands of the animators for such quality work(i know how hard it is to animate combat so full battles deserves serious credit).\\n\\n\r\nsound:10/10\\n\r\nthe quality of sound is great in this anime.  it has a great soundtrack which seriously sets the mood for the series.  timing is perfect throughout(steel clashes when it should and lip snch is right on).  the opening theme and ending theme are specially tailored for the show and as such are not cheesey j-pop singles.  they fit the show and are catchy.  often i find myself humming them at random times.  i feel the need to get the OST(if i can find it).  the voice acting is simply amazing.  all of the voice actors fit their respective characters perfectly and bring out the personality and emotion very well.  all in all the selection of the cast was great.\\n\r\nthe english dubbed version was a different story enirely.  the dub sucked...badly. it was on par with the naruto dub(maybe worse) believe it!  i couldnt even make it through the first episode. watch it in japanese(with subs) or not at all. the dub is that bad.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:10/10\\n\r\nthe character set for this show is explained quite deeply throughout the show.  each character has their own distinct personality(except dori and gura, they share) and background.  as such when certain characters die(not telling who) the viewer is feeling every bit of the emotion and grief rolling off the screen by the characters.  since the show is based of a eroge(harem themed) there is the stereotypical female cast(shy, tomboyish, innocent, sisterlike, etc.) as well as the shounen cast(warriors all, nuff said)  while some characters are obviously designed to be the object of hatred from the viewers and others are your run of the mill expendable characters(*cough* soldiers), many are unforgettable characters whose personalities are things to be desired in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyement:10/10\\n\r\ni personaly enjoyed this anime a lot.  so much so im going to buy the DVD when i get the chance.  i like shoujo anime(yes im a romance junkie) and i enjoy shounen(battle and blood woohoo) and i must say this anime is my cup of tea.  everything i like sitting before me like a buffet.  i loved it. \\n\\n\r\noverall:10/10\\n\r\nit is as i said before, a crowd pleaser.  if you like comedy, romance, drama, harem, war.  give this one a shot.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite anime shows I have to say. The thing is, it will touch you in ways your emotions have never been touched before, or ways that will surprise you. Some of you might have heard of this show from the game of the same name released in 2002. The game is listed as an \u2018adult tactical role-playing visual novel\u2019 (that\u2019s a mouthful of itself) by a company called Leaf. For those not into gaming lingo, a tactical role-playing game is a type of video game where you have role-playing and strategy into one game. I believe \u2018Final Fantasy Tactics\u2019 fallsdown that same sort of line if I was to use a more well known title. Visual Novels on the other hand have a game play that is more based on amazing graphics and almost a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 aspect. And if we are going to break apart the genre even more, Adult really means that there are some rather \u2018erotic\u2019 points or that it is full of violence. The reason why I am breaking this down for you is because Utawarerumono was based off this really interesting genre and though I have not played the game, I feel that from what little I have seen, it sticks rather close to the idea of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is based around a man named Hakuoro, or at least that\u2019s the name they call him. He is a man who lost his memory and can\u2019t even remember who he is or why he has a mask on his face that will not come off. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u2018She calls everything a stereotype so she probably will call this a stereotype as well\u2019. The truth is your right. I will call this a stereotype but in this case, I think it actually works rather well to a point. There are major spoilers that will help answer why he lost them and it\u2019s not just a bump on the head, but for the reasons they do give us it just does work for this type of story line. Since it\u2019s based off of a game series, the main character is normally the one we play as. For this, it seems logical to have that character not know anything about his past in order to explain why he would select an answer to a question in the way he does. It also helps you learn more of his past through his eyes. I do understand why people use it, but it is over used. \\n\\n\r\nGoing back to Hakuoro, his personality is sort of bland. Sure he acts like a true leader, someone clothed in mystery and experience beyond his years, but sadly that seems to be the only thing that he has. That is sort of the \u2018point\u2019 where the stereotype point doesn\u2019t seem to want to work. You can give a person amnesia and have him still have a personality, but here he just seems like a cardboard cut out with how serious he takes things all the time\u2026 until a point. You see, this show has a strange way of making everything that happens as a spoiler so it\u2019s hard to talk about. I can say though that at that point you really do see the layers of Hakuoro that are really in depth. Where up until that point, he seems as though he is the perfect person in the world and then it makes you think he might not be that perfect after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe next characters are the two sisters that act as his adopted family. It doesn\u2019t seem right introducing them separate as they are so close. We will start with the youngest first I think. Aruru is a rather fun loving girl although we start out with her being rather timid. She has a really shy personality that makes me smile whenever I see her acting so curious. There really isn\u2019t much else about her except that she acts her age. She is a really believable little girl who I think might be around 6 or 7 years old. Eruru on the other hand is a very motherly figure. She cares not only for Aruru but for everyone around her. She is so many things that its surprising such a young girl can do all the things she does. She\u2019s not only a big sister to Aruru but she consoles Haruoro whenever he is torn between his discussions, calms those that need to be calmed, heals those who are sick both inside her group of friends and outside in the town, and somehow is still able to manage herself. I am surprised she doesn\u2019t break, making what she proclaims in the first episode \u2018country girls are strong\u2019 make a lot of sense. \\n\\n\r\nNow there are so many characters in this show that it is really hard to talk about every single one of them. Most of them are even spoilers for parts of the show which makes this review a living nightmare to try to do without spoiling anything. So instead of talking about the rest of the characters, I guess I will use this area to talk about the setting of the show. The show is based loosely around an indigenous people from Japan known as the Ainu (Aynu). Think of them as the Native American\u2019s of Japan (in a very very loose based way). They hunted and gathered their food, lived in small communities, and had a culture that was very based on the land. If you look at Haruoro\u2019s name, it actually is an Ainu word that I believe loosely means \u201cWhite Emperor\u201d (I am not an Ainu nor do I know how to speak Ainu, it\u2019s something I found online). They mixed the Ainu culture with a Feudal Japan culture in order to make a rather interesting war torn country, much like in historic times. The only difference is that in the show, everyone (except for Haruoro it seems) is an anthropomorphic creature. They have the bodies of humans with ears and tails (or wings) of an animal. Many of the strange things seem to point to it being an alternate timeline to our own but every once in a while, they sneak in a bit of technology that doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense. It just adds to the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a strange way of jumping up and down a lot. As was stated many times before now, this is a show based on the rise and fall of nations doing battle. As such, there are many different battles that are fought through the course of the series. Between each battle however, we are given a couple small breaks between the actions. These can be as boring as political debates on the next course of action to a slice of life following the lovable antics of Aruru and her friends. I think part of this is to show exactly how war is carried out, but also I just think it\u2019s partly for our psychological relief. This show is 26 episodes long; if we had a battle that lasted that whole time, we would be up in arms the whole time wanting our side to win. We wouldn\u2019t have time to get into the characters heads, no time for us to become emotionally connected to them, to hear the story of their past, to understand why they are fighting. These breaks do give us that time to get to know them, and sometimes to introduce new characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so beautiful at times, and then we will get points that just seem rather standard. Backgrounds are always so detailed and colored so amazing that it\u2019s hard to notice the little things that don\u2019t look quite right though. There are small times that the show used CG to show off some of the action scenes but I don\u2019t blame them. The fact that this is a battle heavy anime means that there are a ton of extras that would have to be drawn over and over again. CG helps cut the corners of this and if done right, it looks really good. I could barely see the differences for the most part between the CG and the animation so I think that is a win on their side. The times they didn\u2019t use the CG stuff was actually rather good as well, with characters movements being rather fluid and not many hiccups in design. I love how for most of the comedy, they kept to the same style as the rest of the show instead of trying to go chibi all the time. One of the main things I found so attractive of this show is the colors they work with. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful but they change the brightness to fit the mood. It can be so bright with fun colors and then suddenly have rather dark deep colors to show a very serious mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe music has this sort of haunting tone to it that seems to be sad but also a little mysterious. I am not sure if they were trying to match the concept of Hakuoro or just a sort of haunting nature of the people but it worked rather well. Pretty much all of the music besides the opening and the ending song were only instrumental, and captured the mood nicely. I do not know how close it is to Ainu music but it felt like it could be part of it. The English Voice acting I think was right on the mark with a lot of the characters. I sort of fell for Hakuoro\u2019s rather soft and yet forceful voice for some reason. Jogn Gremillian did such a beautiful job making Hakuoro sound like a caring man but also a man who can take charge when it was needed. For what little lines Aruru had, Sasha Paysinger did a very good job with the rather cute voice that actually didn\u2019t get on my nerves at all. For real, it wasn\u2019t a high pitched moe character that normal people do, but a more sweet style that I love. Kira Vincent-Davis did the voice for Eruru, and though it was rather good, I somehow feel a little disappointed in that the character sounds close to others she has done. Also, big props on Vic Mignogna who actually for once in his life played a character that was most of the time serious and didn\u2019t freak out all the time! (Ok, so that might not be exactly true on this being the only character he played like that, but most of his characters do tend to freak out.) \\n\\n\r\nThis show had very few flaws to it in my opinion, and had to be one of my favorite shows to jump into. You could feel the great chemistry between the characters, the amazing look of the battles, and the rather calming moments of the breaks.",

            "content": "There are two words that best describe my thoughts of Utawarerumono that not too many folks would like me to utter: otaku bait. I know this would seem kind of shallow-minded to anyone that may like this series. But considering mostly every prominent character in this series has some sort of animal ears and tail plus look ridiculously cute or physically attractive (along with this anime being an eroge strategy game adaptation), I rest my case with these two words being uttered.\r\nFor the most part, Utawarerumono's characters and plot developments are pretty formulaic and straight-forward. The series runs into several arcs with Hakuoro and hisallies running into some hostile enemy threat trying to either halt his revolt or take over his kingdom, Hakuoro coming up with a clever plan to halt said threat, gaining new allies from offing said threat and then a breather episode with comedy highlights coming from the quirks of the characters or everyday scenes with Hakuoro, Eruru and Aruru. While the first arc was okay with Hakuoro leading the commoners to revolt against their corrupt glutton of a ruler, the later arcs do get monotonous with their developments with every country in sight seemingly wanting a piece of Hakuoro and his kingdom for shallow reasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development with new characters in these arcs is limited to their appearances in said arcs and once they become one of Hakuoro's allies, their roles become mostly downplayed to being loyal soldiers to Hakuoro when they participate in a battle. Other than Hakuoro and a few major characters, you don't get to see too many developments with these ass-kicking characters after they become one of his comrades, which is kind of a shame as a couple of them had their interesting traits and backgrounds during their debut arcs, mainly Oboro and Touka. A number of the major villains confronted in these arcs are so over-the-top and ridiculous with their appearance, behavior and/or mannerisms that they are laughable, especially Hauenkua who reminds me enough of how nuts Escaflowne's Dilandau was.\\n\\n\r\nThe other prominent focus of the series is on Hakuoro's mysterious past which the series drops hints of in the not-so-entertaining later arcs of the show. Amnesiac hero storylines normally have a good amount of potential in unveiling some interesting developments for said main hero and a show's plot. But while Hakuoro's character is an interesting and likeable one, what I come to learn of his origins and background comes across as quite a big contradiction to the type of world Utawarerumono had set up throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series does sport good looking scenery and characters (despite the latter's clear \"appeal\") with vivid colors and a decent amount of detail applied to them. The show's animation is average at many points with occasional use of shortcuts and some bad use of CG animation in the rendering of armies during battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did get some enjoyment out of seeing Hakuoro and some other characters in their struggles throughout Utawarerumono, the show's cliched plot setup, weak focus on other prominent characters and ridiculous reveal on Hakuoro's origins greatly weakened the quality of the series in my eyes. This is a good example of why I'm cautious with approaching anime adaptations of eroge games as the quality of said title tends to vary and usually won't translate too well when made into an anime.",

            "content": "I think this anime was just poorly executed.\r\nThe overall story is actually good and interesting, at the beginning and again at the end, it was just buried under piles of nonsense and extremely forgettable characters. The story follows Hakuoro, who after being found and rescued by a small village he becomes the leader of a rebellion, emperor of a country and then spends his time fight wars with every other country around. \r\nA major plot twist happens near the end that was so unexpected and weird that my initial reaction was \"I am just going to pretend that didn't happen...\"and even when it gets explainedin the end and you no longer have to pretend it didn't happen, I was still thinking, \"it could have been better.\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause there were so many \"mini-wars\" they all ultimately blended together because they weren't very memorable. Characters were introduced and I had high hopes for what their future actions would be and how they would affect the plot but then the plot would change because of a different war in a different country and then those expectations just crumble into dust. There are some parts of this series that are completely boring as sin.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty enough, but this series, which is based on war, didn't have any memorable fight scenes of bad-assery. Seriously, even with the flat characters this would be more entertaining to watch if the characters at least could kick some ass in awesome fights. But the fights were boring and predictable. On the other hand, the characters being completely flat doesn't help. It's hard to get excited about a fight if you simply don't care whether or not a character dies.\\n\\n\r\nI always believed that good, well developed characters can carry a plot no matter how contrived it is, but in this case the characters are so bad, you're just sitting there thinking \"Who cares?\"\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really liked the opening song for this anime, so it was my favourite part of watching. \\n",

            "content": "In Utawarerumono, there are two gods that fight for eternity. This explanation as an answer to the mystery that surrounds the anime until about a half is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion. E gives rise to a final ultra-romantic, and so very unpleasant.\r\nHowever, the idea made me reflect. It was another anime that I felt sick to finish. Not as much as X, but almost. It's a sad ending (after all, it's ultra-romantic), in which many are hit and confirms that a destination of suffering for one of the main characters. Something forceful means to an anime that will gradually captivating, at least until themiddle of the plot. Once captivated, feel more impacts with those fictitious persons.\\n\\n\r\nThe reflection reminded me a bit of Nietzsche, the Greek philosophers of antiquity and also Milan Kundera, in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being A concept I never studied law: the eternal return.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea that I could infer the eternal return, which may be distorted with respect to the above references conceived, but I built up here has the following premise: we carry our past. The drama of Hakuoro, the anime, is precisely that of not remembering his past, not knowing what he carries. A drama that becomes more painful to the extent that he suspects not to remember his past. But how to get rid of it?\\n\\n\r\nHow Karura says, \"it is impossible to completely disconnect from the past.\" As it becomes worse for a god who returns to experience several lives forever? The hidden horror of the anime Utawarerumono is something that resembles the curse of Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel. It is the inescapable destiny to live forever, forever come back to life.\\n\\n\r\nMilan Kundera says in his most famous novel by celebrated and that is the French Revolution, for example, how would react if we were to repeat it forever, always cutting heads, an eternal return? What would be the weight of it? Einmal ist keinmal, says the German adage (\"once is never\"). There is a mystique around binarity, and very curious. It is as if there were only two numbers, where one equals zero, and the rest reaches infinity. The light would live once, only once, so that the experience would equal to nothing, perhaps because it is something finite in an infinite time. Interestingly, I remember having spoken about equality of existence and nonexistence. I ended up dropping it again somehow. The heavy, in turn, would live forever, forever returning to live. Again, I remember having mentioned the question of \"whether or not a story to an end.\" The target heavy does not give us that chance.\\n\\n\r\nIn Utawarerumono, does not explain how these gods were born. They may have arisen from mere humans. It is possible that they, the gods are nothing but ourselves. It is possible that we humans, for which accumulate more knowledge, nothing more than able to awaken the consciousness of the eternal return which we are stuck.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's terrible for a man found in the woods, injured, not remembering his days until then, how terrible it would be for us to be in the same situation? Assuming then that there is something like an afterlife, or something that brings us back to an experience ... how terrible it would be to ignore the past that pervaded by several lifetimes? Worse, how terrible would not realize that we are beginning to remember that?\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the chance of revival can not be disputed, we need not go that far. Simply we exchange of god. Just think that the god in question is not a human being, but humanity itself. As a member of humanity, can we, each of us, off the streets, watching the sky, hit the ground and even see how we treat each other and still say that what others have done before us has nothing to see us?\\n\\n\r\nAssume then that humanity is the god who is destined to fight with himself, guiding other beings with their power. God attached to the eternal return. Coincidence or not, Hakuoro is the only fully human person, ie, does not have ears or tails of animals like all other characters. The difference is that Hakuoro has a mask that can not get out. The question is if that mask is the hallmark of the link between apes and humans or whether technological remnant of an advanced civilization that perished - we do not have the answer to the curse which it represents (not sure if Benawi also not human, what would the only odd exception, as I remember). When this god despair, crushed by his fate, would be annihilated. But not even the black winged angel, created by him, Mutsumi, can do it.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming then that we, all of us, this god. What do you think? It is a god that is divided in two because it indulges in his wrath, and will pay for this act forever as the eternal return will bring back the anger. Every act is heavy. Every mistake is perpetual.\\n\\n\r\nI must confess I underestimated Parmenides. He said that in his philosophy that everything was very complicated being, that motion, time and change were illusions, also said that everything was binary. And in all groups associated dichotomies associated with the good and the bad. The pair light-heavy, so if associated respectively to the good-bad. I have always considered him a reluctant to accept the flow of things, like his contemporary Heraclitus said, today I must admit that he was more intelligent than I supposed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat shall we do with our mistakes? What shall we do with the sins of mankind? What awaits us?\\n\\n\r\nIf everything was light ... live with ease. Eruru not carry the suffering that comes from the Mikoto, Hakuoro could live without mask. Bastar\u00edamos live with and hope our story will end. So would fly over our destinies. And we would be so light and so scattered, like cirrus clouds. Our existence is no more than an imperceptible and tremendously ephemeral blur, a flash of blink of an eye.\\n\\n\r\nI have overcome the terror that comes over us when we first understand what it is to live once. But assuming the truth involving one of only two numbers of binarity existential, which would be more terrible? Living or once living forever? We would have to live only by our successes, that should sparkle on any errors that surely commit more frequently. What is harder then? Isolate themselves, cling to faint and rare warmth amid the eternal darkness and always retornantes or bet everything on one chance to live a simple and final time?\\n",

            "content": "If you are a fan of shonen anime like One Piece and Bleach that boil your blood, fan of innovative anime like Monster, Hunter X Hunter that makes you appreciate the time you spent, mystery like Full Metal Alchemist that drives you crazy, humor like Gintama that will make you rofl, THIS ANIME IS NOT FOR YOU. \r\nThis is one of the most overrated animes I have come across. Anyone that seriously has a passion for action/adventure anime will be fooled and disappointed with the ratings and genre. \r\nConcept: 8/10\r\nIf there is anything good about this anime, it is the concept of the plot.The story briefly is about an injured man with a wierd mask that is saved by the people of a small village, that man suffers with amnesia and that village quickly becomes his home. Because of his wisdom and kindness, he quickly becomes the leader and then his forgotten past begins to haunt him. The anime involves many war sequences, some strategies involved, loyalties, betrayals and violence. Sounds like a good concept for a action/adventure lover.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Characters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe director of the anime did come up with a good concept, but failed miserably in translating a good concept to enjoyment. I thought the potential of a very good concept was totally wasted. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character in the anime suits perfectly for this kind of story, the major problem is some of the characters that surround him. There is very little character development and everyone else just pops out of the blue, you will know very little about every major character of the anime by the time you finish. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is purely for simpleminded people, trust me, there is NOTHING genius about this anime. It had little to no twists and turns in the plot, everything seemed predictable. There are NO scenes where you will be amazed, there are NO scenes where you will get fired up. The whole concept of war is made a joke. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no humor in the anime, some will say there is some, but that is for simpleminded ones. There is absolutely NO humor in the anime and the very little efforts of humor add to the problems.\\n\\n\r\nBe prepared for some very annoying characters that are sadly major characters in the anime, a female girl named Eruru and her little sister Aruru. The main character of the series (Hakuoro) is looked upon as father by the little sister Aruru while the older sister Eruru loves him. In one of the middle episodes of the anime, Hakuoro tells  publicly that Eruru is like his sister, yet Eruru continues to love him. There is excessive romance between Hakuoro and Eruru, by romance I mean situations that involve Eruru showing her love, but Hakuoro showing indifference to her love. I personally could not take a pseudo incest relationship, every episode will have some. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have moronic scenes that do not make any sense. Eruru and Aruru care a lot about Hakuoro and will insist on accompanying him to the wars and he agrees. I am talking about roughly a 17 year old girl with no fighting skills that wants to stay close to her lover at any cost and a 8 year old girl that just does not want to stay away from her dad even for few hours. They both accompany him to wars where there is massive killing happening around them, hardcore I mean. These kind of situations will make you feel \"I could have done a better job directing this\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good for the most part, but the fight sequences could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nBy end of the day I did not learn anything from this anime, dropped watching a couple of times in middle and still picked up because I had nothing else to watch, ultimately repented for the time I invested.",

After the first episode I sought myself wanting more and more and then before i realized it i had finished all 26 episodes. \r\n-The story was quite interesting as well. I thought to myself why the heck would i want to watch an anime about a guy who cant remember his past and is unable to take off a mask that had no meaning throughout the story?(minor spoiler) Anyways when I continued on through the anime I was gaining more and more knowledge about what the meaning of hismask and his life overall and what had happened to him in the past. Its kind of hard for me to explain exactly what i liked about the story without giving you a spoiler. All i can say is dont judge a book by its cover. This show is very entertaining and will have you wanting more just like it did me.\\n\\n\r\n-The art was the probably the best thing about this show. I was very intrigued by the art form that made up the anime. The characters and setting were all very very well done. My favorite aspect of the art was that it really brought out old and modern Japanese culture. Watch this anime and you will be amazed by how astonishing the artwork is.\\n\\n\r\n-The sound was well done as well. I cannot compare it to the subbed version because i only watched the dubbed. If i do get around to rewatching this show i will watch it in the subbed version and then update this post. Anyways theres not much to say about the sound because it was really good the actors did a good job and  the songs that were played  were very suited to be in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters were all great. I loved all of them. They were very well designed and brought something new to the table whenever there was a new character introduced. They were all very skilled warriors and made the battles very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n-My enjoyment as you can tell by the rating its pretty high. I never saw myself losing interest in this show. Everything from the action to the melo drama that was introduced kept me very entertained. If you give this show a shot you will not be disappointed!!\\n\\n\r\n-Overall. As you can tell my ratings and statements you can see that i love this show. Everything came together nicely and concluded with a good ending that i was very satisfied with.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review I hope this somewhat helps you decide to give this show a shot.",

            "content": "Story: An anime based of a H-Visual Novel may not seem like the premise of a good anime but it is. The plot may seem to repeat at times but it's just building up to some mind blowing plot twists in the end, I assure you, you won't see it coming. The plot has everything, massive battles won by brilliant strategies, amazing character interaction and a romance plot that you actually care about, I was never once bored and simply hoping that the episode would just finish so like so many animes do. It's so good that I was depressed when the anime was oversimply because it ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is simply gorgeous, it really sets the fantasy setting and brings life to the character. I have never seen any other anime with a art style just like this so that is simply a bonus. The characters (at least the important ones) all have a distinctive look that really fits there character. If there is one flaw in this anime is they will repeat animations during battles at times but it is never enough to take away from the enjoyment of watching the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is incredible, both the music and voice acting is done spectacularly well, I can only say this for the Japanese version for I never watch an anime in English if I can help it. There is no character who whenever they open their mouth you flinch because it's so annoying or and thank god there are no &quot;Believe It&quot;'s to speak of. The voice acting is definitely some of the best I have ever heard and that brings a lot of emotion into the story. The lip syncing is never of an the soundtrack is simply incredible, the music always fits the mood perfectly and it doesn't get old, if I could get the soundtrack I would never stop listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: While the plot is amazing, the art is gorgeous and the sound is incredible, what really makes this anime the best anime ever (in my own humble opinion of course) is the characters. Unlike in most animes where I find myself liking only a couple of the characters and just apathy towards the rest of the characters I genuinely care about each and every character. These are characters who, if I met them in real life, I would look up to and want to be friends with. I found myself getting depressed because something bad happened to one of the main characters and happy simply because they were happy. And I'm not one of the people that happens to that often, each character has their own subplots and each is there own character, you don't go yeah, just another sasuke fan girl, except for twins each character is their own character and you won't see characters like Hakuoro in any anime but Utawarerumuno. The character interaction is the best I've seen in any anime and like I said before the romance subplot is the best I've ever seen and one you will genuinely care for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well like I said, best anime ever, in fact their is no book, movie or TV show I have enjoyed more than Utawarerumono. The roller coaster of emotions, the beautiful artwork, mind blowing plot and genuine characters will insure you never have a dull moment and will want to rewatch it again, again and again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Simply put Best Anime Ever",

            "content": "This is such an awesome show...I really was not expecting this show to be  as good as it was but maybe by everyone saying it was 'so good' you might pick up this series thinking it's this EPIC masterpiece of an anime like a ROBOTECH, Cowboy Bebop or Fullmetal Alchemist....when it really isn't. So I don't think you should let you expectations go overboard either.  I'm just saying that if maybe you see the cute dog-boys and cat-girls and bird people and that's not your thing or you think \u201cgreat this is one of those shows!\u201d where everything is all cutesy lovely, thenyes you will be surprised.....because this show is definitely not cutesy and lovely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good. This show offers some nice-looking characters and there is great use of colors. They did reuse some of the fight scenes, especially the one where the lead character, Haruko, does this killer move with his fan/weapon...which kind of felt like deja vu. But scene looping and stuff doesn't annoy me unless they really over do it and I don't think it will bother you either unless that's your pet peeve. There is good animation movement in this series and you can tell that there was some CG work used as well because the way some of the battle scenes were laid out and how the camera panned or the way the lizard-horses were moving. It was all very cool.\\n\\n\r\nThis show seems to have an all star cast when it comes the voice actors, I see a lot of names from a lot of other series. I really am not good with voices and names except for a very limited few, but these names I have seen the a lot of times from shows like Inuyasha and FullMetal Alchemist. They are all very good actors and they make watched dubbed shows very enjoyable. The music is OK but not really a 'must have' or anything. The best song for me is probably the ending song probably because I don't know if I would classify it as J-POP or Rock or what, but it sounds good though.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning you will get hooked because it is kind of a mystery, the lead character has amnesia and he does not know who, what or where he is not even his name. Anyway that's how I got hooked, I saw episode one on Anime Channel's VoD and I needed to know how it turned out. I think a lot of people who are into action and military type of anime will also like this one! There are a lot of brutal battle scenes with blood and violence, these are always pluses for me when it comes to selecting anime shows to watch, but you might as well know that it does get pretty gruesome. There is also some comedy in there, so this is really not a really heavy hard-hitting series or anything. One main issue I have with the story though is that there seems to be no essence of time. It could be 5 minutes, 5 years or 5 months the show doesn't really have a firm grasp of depicting time passing. You get the feeling that some time has passed somewhat but then again, just how much time...no one knows.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not into cat-bird-people or beast-people too much, I like just plain human looking people, but this was tolerable. It's not like they had complete tiger faces or Minotaurs or anything like that, thank goodness. The were relatively attractively drawn people and they all had nice personalities, especially the core group of characters. Just like how I was talking about the strange \u201ctime-warping\u201d issue that occurs with the story narrative, you can really get that sense with some of the characters popping in for a bit then poof they disappear and their side of the story seems unresolved or maybe kinda rushed.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this show though, mainly because it so very much surprised me as to the type of anime I thought it was going to be. I really thought it was just going to be some fluffy nice [shoujo-style] anime and it wound up being this fantastic, gritty and gory series. That really changed my opinion of this show, but maybe it might freak you out if you are not into that kind of show,\\n",

            "content": "To start this off I just want to say that I will attempt to contain any and all spoilers to the \"story\" section of my review.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is just as the synopsis states: Utawarerumono is based on a masked man with amnesia who wakes up in a strange new world. Just reading this synopsis may make some people think that Utwarerumono is simply your typical shounen story where the protagonist recovers his memory half way into the story and he broods over his past in which he did something he regrets to a loved one. However, this couldn't be farther from the truth. I'mgoing to go out and say that yes, Hakuoro does recover his memory somewhere throughout the story but the main drama surrounding him is him struggling to grasp just who he was. I won't go into details here but there are a few twists in which the audience couldn't possibly expect surrounding just who Hakuoro is and what he was doing prior to being found by Eruruu. There are some things that aren't covered in the anime such as why Kamyu sucked Aruruu's blood and honestly you're better off not knowing since the answer is strange and may ruin her character for certain people.\\n\r\nRight up until the ending there is information that may mess with your view of the world that Utawarerumono has created and about who Hakuoro is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMy view on the art of this series may differ from other reviews as I had watched the Blu-ray version in which animation studios fix mistakes and improve the overall quality of the animation at times.\\n\r\nThe art in this series looked fantastic all the way through from the backgrounds to the characters in the foreground. There were a few times when a character's face wasn't directly in view that the face or character looked like a blob of scribbles but the times this happened could be counted on one hand. The animation was smooth however once or twice animation was reused entirely. An example of this is in the later episodes in which Hakuoro is fighting off a few soldiers with his fan and less than five minutes later the exact same fight sequence is played again for whatever reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music and sound quality for this series was very well done. During battle sequences it felt like you were there and could hear the swords clank next to you. The village scenes felt very serene and calming and the town scenes felt like you were in the center of a bustling street with street vendors talking over one another and everything.\\n\r\nOne complaint though is that there was only one opening sequence for every episode and it gave several major spoilers including all of the major villains for the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were varied and didn't all follow standard tropes laid out for them. Hakuoro who is normally the calm monotone person has several outbreaks of emotion and character. Of course some characters such as Oboro fit their character tropes to a t. My biggest complaint regarding characters though has to do with Mukkuru. Mukkuru is a white tiger and the pet/friend of Aruruu. However, Mukkuru displays the opposite behaviours that a cat would display. For example, when Mukkuru is happy he may wag his tail similar to a dog; however, when a cat wags it's tail that doesn't mean \"I'm happy\" it means more along the lines of \"I'm angry/annoyed\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm honestly a bit mad at myself for watching this show. I enjoyed it so much that I haven't been able to enjoy some shows that have been on my backlog as I can't help but say \"Utawarerumono did ____ better\". I'm not even sure how I came across this show but I am glad I found it as it is among my top 10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nUtawarerumono is not perfect and thus it does not deserve a perfect score. However, the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone that likes fantasy or anime about war.",

            "content": "So when I first found out about this title, the first thing came into mind is, \u201cWhat the hell does Utawarme\u2026.Utaworm\u2026..Uta\u2026Damn it, I can\u2019t even say it right!! What does\u2026that damn word mean?\u201d Well, after that, the title of the show is translated into English as, \u201cThe One Being Sung\u201d, which does describe one of the character\u2019s rise in the series and funny thing about this being based on a videogame and how it was supposed to be a harem, considering I didn\u2019t see the whole harem part in this, but more on that later.\r\nA man awakens in an unfamiliar village with no memory ofhis past or identity. The only clue: a devil-horned mask which conceals the upper half of his face but cannot be removed. Still recovering from the bad wounds he had when he was found and without any clear direction, the man settles in to village life and soon becomes not only a valued and respected member, but effectively a member of the family of healers \u2013 old Tsukuru, young Eruru, and even younger Aruruu \u2013 who helped him recover, even taking on the name Hakuoro, which belonged to the long-dead father of the girls. Trouble won\u2019t leave the village alone, however, as a discontented former villager tries to exploit their resources, a tiger-like forest god threatens to rampage, and an unfortunate series of events leads to unintended rebellion. Throughout it all Hakuoro stands as a stoic source of inspiration even though he is deeply troubled by haunting images of his past.\\n\\n\r\nI got to say right off the bat; the story does have an interesting plot of an amnesiac main character that probably has a disturbing past of him and he probably does once you get further into the show. There is the aspect of war and how you think everything is going to be fine but it isn\u2019t as worse shit continues to happen to them, deaths that can hit you hard emotionally if you really wanted them to live, and the trials of rebelling against the higher authority. Now, I know this is based on an adventure/role-playing/eroge game (or just Japanese adult visual novel) and I guess like the adaptations of that, you sense no trace of them nor do did I find any typical harem traits aside from the amount of girls there with wolf ears (then again, mostly everybody in the show has either wolf, cat, dog, rabbit, etc. ears) but saying it\u2019s a harem because there\u2019s lots of girls (or guys if it\u2019s a reverse harem) doesn\u2019t exactly make it one (OK: Maybe that one or two times). I will say that it does get too sappy at sometimes but just enough to not be overbearing melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are 90/10 on the love/hate scale although it is more of an ensemble cast of characters and most of them have these different stories to them, like Hakuoro and his unknown past, why later in the series people thinking he was a murderer and why he can\u2019t take off that mask. I would have like to know more about the sisters Eruru & Aruruu and most of their family life but it was more preoccupied with the long war and all that. Oh yeah, one character that I couldn\u2019t stand in fucking Nuwangi. I just cannot stand that guy and desperately either wanted him easily defeated or killed off. Luckily, he\u2019s not in the show for long but he was still annoying as hell.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is actually great here and it\u2019s expected being at the 2006-2007 anime boom year. The show was made by animation studio Oriental Light and Magic, the same studio that did not-so-great animation for a great series (Berserk). Like I said, the show does have a very playful nature to it, but during the battle scenes, expect a lot of bloodshed in there but luckily, it isn\u2019t overly excessive and violence for the sake of being violent. The opening theme is\u2026.dangerously catchy to listen to, but you might need to listen to it several times to not forget about it. Overall, the music is fairly decent for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub by ADV Films (later re-licensed by FUNimation) is a great effort done with the script being close to the original source and although there aren\u2019t any standouts, the performances of John Gremillion as Hakuoro and Kira Vincent-Davis as Eruruu deliver some great dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Utawarerumono is a delightful and ambitious show that has its playful side with the characters and also the more darker-toned and serious side of itself that seems to fit within and since FUNimation rescued it from obscurity, you can easily buy the whole series or watch it on their website if you want. It\u2019s a watch recommendation from me.\\n",

            "content": "Studio OLM that brought the world Berserk and Pokemon in the late 90\u2019s now brings an anime in 2006 that can best be described as anime-nerd-bait aka otaku bait. Together with new director Tomoki Kobayashi (Galaxy Angel Z) they attempted to adapt this eroge strategy game. At first, the product of Utawarerumono started off with an interesting high fantasy with semi-interesting characters and then takes a left-turn along the way.\r\nThe show begins with a cute wolf-type girl finding an injured man in the woods wearing a mask he cannot remove. She and her family nurse him back to health, but the man still does nothave any memories of his past. Slowly, the audience learns the land, society, and the slow progression to war with strategic battle ensuing. \\n\\n\r\nMostly, Utawarerumono is formulaic in the characters with typical trope characters such as the quiet adorable little sister character. Even the plot is fairly simple from the start with oppressed people fighting back against the tyrants. Over the course of the anime there is little in character development and more towards the main group gathering other character arch-types to join the team. Basically, this anime wanted to be what The Vision of Escaflowne was. This was a show with a compelling premise that pretty much fails in its goal.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, the people behind Utawarerumono decided to drop the story they were telling for almost zero reason like something anime fans had seen in something out of Votoms in the 80s as an example. Unlike Votoms though, the characters in Utawarerumono have the personality of either a stone or a carebear. Even the character art and animation does not seem much better than Studio OLM\u2019s past works like Berserk and Pokemon from the 90\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say the show is completely terrible. Some scenes of battles and the fantasy world are interesting, but ultimately with predictable characters and a plot that is shallow, the show is just flat. There are plenty of other fantasy shows to recommend like The Vision of Escalflowne over this anime. In the end Utawarerumono should stay as an eroge game and was not a good adaptation.",

            "content": "The One Being Sung tells the story of a man called Hakuoro who finds himself in a sword and sorcery world with no memory of who he is. Soon after being welcomed into the local village, the villagers rally behind Hakuoro against their emperor and the revolution begins. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nWhat I really like about the story for this anime is it isn't just action, but also delves into some of the politics and planning of war. For example, after their country is invaded Hakuoro has to make the decision do they retaliate by invading the enemy country or do they first secure their boarders andrecover from the last battle. It's refreshing to see a protagonist like Hakuoro who stops to make a plan and just doesn't attack without thinking. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't get the wrong idea, this anime isn't just talking, there's some really good action too like full-scale battles between armies. The battles are definitely the best part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has an over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning who he use to be before he lost his memory. Throughout the anime, Hakuoro experiences these flashbacks, but it isn't fully explained how all these different flashes of memory Hakuoro has connect until the end. However, after I watched the final episode, I was still a little confused and had some unanswered questions. I don't want to spoil anything, but I feel like there should've been more exposition. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nHakuoro: Hakuoro's best quality is his leadership skills. Hakuoro really does consider his friends his family and everything he does is to protect them and their country. However, there are a few scenes where Hakuoro does lose his calm attitude, when he begins to question what if the person he was before he lost his memory was some kind of monster. \\n\\n\r\nEruruu: What I like about Eruruu is she's like the mother of the main characters as in she's always worrying about everyone else, but also manages to smile and be so positive all the time which brightens the mood of the show. Furthermore, I admire Eruruu's loyalty to Hakuoro and it shows how much she cares about him. \\n\\n\r\nKarura: Hakuoro's my favorite character, but Karuras my second. I love how she fights like the Incredible Hulk as in she just smashes whats ever is in front of her and so effortlessly destroys her enemies. \\n\\n\r\nTouka: Touka is the opposite of Karura; first Touka fights with this very graceful and precise fighting style and always has this focused look in her eye. Also, while Karura has a disrespectful, carefree attitude, Touka is the opposite and will do anything for her master and do what she thinks is right. They make an interesting pair to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nBenawi: I really like Benawi because he's such a great fighter and like Hakuoro is a great leader too, but I was disappointed nothing about his background is revealed. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSomething I really like about the character designs is how you really know you're in another world (not just in the past) because most the character aren't purely human. Karura's got cat ears and a tiger tail; Touka has bird wings for ears; and Urtori and Kamyu have angel wings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI really liked this anime for the action with the epic battles and the characters were all great. It's only the over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning about his past that I found confusing. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I think I liked this show?  I will explain my thoughts a bit, but there are slight spoilers so I'll put some spaces before I begin.\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\nSo the show starts off as a fairly average fantasy show and the main character drives technological and tactical development in a medieval world.  It is nothing special, but enjoyable.  However, halfway or more through, the show goes in a completely different direction.  At first it seems like they've got gundams, but then you realize that they're more like the machines from Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The plot suddenly gets very confusing and the show doesa poor job explaining what happens.  They touch on human experimentation, reincarnation, sateliite lases, and divinities.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character has gathered his allies, which include a few good characters, but when they bring in the mobile suits, those characters are basically useless.  All the character development of his allies is essentially wasted.  It was like the first half and second half were done by completely different people.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has no idea what it wants to be and the viewer has the experience of a fantasy show suddenly changed in direction that was never foreshadowed in the early parts.  It was like if an author wrote an entire book with no magic and no hints of magic, then the ending was solved by the main character with, \"oh yeah I can do magic.\" (This is my example of an idea, not what happens in the show.)  When you set up the rules for a fictional world, the author needs to obey those rules, and if they want to change things then foreshadowing is necessary.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to pin down my feelings on everything because I really liked a few of th characters, but in my opinion the show really went off the rails.  Too much is unexplained to the viewer.  It is also difficult to figure out what the target audience is, the beginning and ending are just so different.  I took a little while to stew before writing this review, because honestly, I felt a bit mad after the show ended.  This was a decent universe that was squandered.",

            "content": "Well been putting it off for quite a while, but now i have finally seen it and let me give you my opinion on it.\r\nSeries Name: Utawarerumono\r\nStory: The story is rather interesting, for the most part while it has elements of science fiction and fantasy, the majority of the series seems to focus a amenisaic man who becomes an emepror and must defend his nation and people against those who wish to do harm to it so it focuses mostly on war and fighting, at the same time there is background story that focuses on the history of the main lead and the truth ofhis origin and his relation with the history of the world.\\n\\n\r\nReview: I actually enjoyed this series as i watched it, I would not say that is one of the best anime or has one of the best storied but it is an interesting one and has plenty of action and drama to balance each other out with a little comedic moments in between, did i mention that everybody has animal ears and tails and some wings, now that is interesting to say the least. XD The music was ok i guess..nothing bad but nothing grand either and the animation i would say..it is average...nothing worht while but too bad either.\\n\\n\r\nThe Only few flaws i found in it..is that it really focuses a bit to much on jumping from situation to the next,,what i mean is that the pacing really starts to get really fast with shifting from one story to the next and maybe the focus on war conflicts and action were a bit to much..they should have given it more breathing room, to develop the characters..dont get me wrong they had plenty of development but i could say they could focused a bit more on there background.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line i would give it a 8/10...it is a rather interesting story and for those who like a little bit of fantasy, action and war drama i would recommend to give this a shot.\\n\r\nI know there is a second season that just recently got released..but i am going to stop for now and wait for the dub to come out....yeah i watched the first season dubbed and i would say it is pretty good,,especially from the time period it was released. \\n\\n\r\nGranted i could watch the second season sub only...it wont be the first time...but since i got a little advance that the second season is part 1 of a two parter and that a possible s3 is coming out when the game that it is based on it comes out. \\n\\n\r\ni mgiht as well wait a little while...if the s3 starts airing before the dub is out than il just watch it before it does.",

The story follows the MC on his journey to discover who he truly is and overcome the obstacles that are thrown at this man as he meets new allies and faces his past.\r\n2. The character are all lovely and great, they each bring something to the table with their own quirks and personalities. Even the antagonists are well done for the time era that theworld is in.\\n\r\n3. The art is brilliant, for being an anime made so long ago, it doesn't bother you at all, it doesn't feel dated in the slightest and manages to make you appreciate everything about it. It does dabble with CG though at some points but it's small bits so it doesn't distract you too much.\\n\r\nOverall without giving away too much i'd say give it a try, it's definitely an oldie but a goodie. I love this one for many aspects and part of the wonder is just diving in, whether you've played the game or not this anime is for anyone who loves action, story, arty, and drama.",

            "content": "Utawarerumono is an incredibly long complicated title that took me forever to pronounce correctly, and it translates to: \"the one being sung\".  I would have never found this anime if it weren't for a friend of mine, and I have to say that this could have been one of my favorites had it not have such a terrible ending.  It creates an interesting fantasy setting, it has incredibly likable characters, and if the ending didn't have such an awkward tonal and directional shift: this could have been a perfect family animated show.  Like seriously, about halfway I was like: \"finally an animethat could a appeal to a wide audience that doesn't have to be dark, super serious and depressing.\"  This anime seems to be underrated, and kind of under the radar, which is a shame because there is a lot to like in this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (good)\\n\r\nOne thing that is very well done (until the last 6 episodes) in this show is pacing.  Something is always happening, whether it is a new conflict, an interesting hint to a mystery, or some funny and enjoyable interactions between the cast.  This show is very entertaining and I found it hard to get bored.  The setting is established really well.  You will be surprised how attached you become to the small little village you start out in, and when the characters feel at home at the palace, so do you.  This is what separates this fantasy show from others: you feel a sense of attachment to characters that feel real, and to a world that you don't want to stop visiting.  Strategy, battles, rallying... everything you need to make a medieval-type fantasy work is done very well.  The battles are very engaging and fun to watch, but its because of HOW its done rather than WHAT is done.  There is a great build up to these fights, and the well executed and clever plans by the protagonist will always put a little smile on your face.  Plus there is always a clear goal, none of the fighting is mindless, there is always some cost or conflict to be invested in.  The plot balances humor and dramatic moments very well, which is essential for the main theme of this anime: family.  No matter how hard things are, you'll always find a bright spot in life with family and friends which is what makes these moments between characters so strong.  What kills the narrative is the absolutely terrible last 6 episodes (more on that later), watch up to episode 19 and stop. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 (fantastic)\\n\r\nEasily the strength of the show in my opinion.  The main protagonist Hakuoro is very underrated, and is pretty unique to the anime genre.  He is an adult character that makes adult decisions, which is refreshing from the typical high school protagonist (plus he actually has his shit together, unlike many wimpy underdog male characters).  He has amnesia, which has been done before, but isn't often done this well.  What makes his character so compelling is that he stands out in this world precisely because he doesn't have memories.  He looks at the world from a completely unbiased perspective, he was never brought up with beliefs (the tiger goddess arc at the beginning illustrates this) or was brought up by society to establish morality.  He develops his own morality based on the kindness of the people around him, and becomes an incredibly relatable character that simply wants to protect the ones that he loves.  The most engaging part of the series was his rise to power.  He didn't desire power or conflict, but was forced in a situation where he had to adopt a leadership role, because it was necessary to keep the only life he knew and grew to cherish.  He is a natural leader and a brilliant strategist.  It is a joy to see him outwit his opponents and kick ass with a very impractical but awesome unique weapon that he uses.  The side characters are also great, each with a distinct and memorable personality.  Eruru and Aruru are the characters that stick with Hakuoro and are his family.  Eruru is an incredibly likable tomboy character who is supportive and adopts a very motherly role.  Aruru is shy and cute, but is also rebellious and surprisingly energetic when pursuing something she wants.  These three characters make up most of the emotional core of this series.  The soldiers and comrades that serve under Hakuoro are also a joy to watch each having their own colorful personalities and place in the war.  If there is to be some flaw within the characters it could be the villains.  They are kind of one dimensional and are just kind of dicks.  However, they do a good job at making you hate these characters, which makes taking them out so incredibly satisfying.          \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound: 8/10 (very good)\\n\r\nOpening songs and ost are great.  They are catchy, and complement the anime very well.  The art and animation isn't anything too spectacular there are some copy-paste and awkward 3d models, but it does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime... 19 episodes of it.  The ending is what hold me back from completely loving it.  The last 6 episodes is some of the worst coma inducing garbage that I have ever seen.  It takes a turn for the worst and in my opinion contradicts a lot of what the series seemed to be working towards.  It is unnecessarily dark, convoluted would be an understatement, and the more you think about it the worst it gets.  Seriously, I tried to go with it, and I thought about what they were going for.  But the more I tried the more plot holes and inconsistencies I found.  They raise more questions (not in a good way) then it answers.  Additionally, why explain things that really don't need to be explained?  Its like scientifically explaining what the force is in the Star Wars prequels, we don't really need one.  Plus its devoid of humor, you barely see the side characters you grow to love, and the elements that are introduced feel so incredibly out of place.  It also has easily the most underwhelming and boring final confrontation that I have ever seen (I fell asleep and was forced to see the episode again).  Despite how terrible this last portion is, the journey getting there was worth it, and stopping at episode 15 or 19 in my opinion is already a satisfying enough conclusion.  So please, please, please, I implore you to stop at episode 19 and don't go on anymore than that unless you want to try to laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (very good)\\n\r\nIf you like fantasy that doesn't have to be dark to be good, then I really can't see you not liking this.  Give this show a chance, and I am pretty sure you will find a memorable, entertaining and enjoyable experience.  Watching it sub or dub doesn't matter too much IMO, either is good.  So as long as your not a sub purist, english dub is an option.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I created an account on this site just because someone listed this anime as a recommended one for Berserk lovers, and I'm here to set the record straight. This anime is a feeble minded kids anime that takes every anime cliche and throws it into one series. Go ahead, read the other reviews and you'll see they mention the run of the mill story, and standard anime characteristics. This review will let you know how dumb this anime is. No plot spoilers, but a preview of some crap to come. \r\nFirst you start off with a man who wakes from a coma. So you're thinkingcool, now we have to find out who this guy is and why he's wearing that mysterious mask. Then we find out he's in a feudal time period. All of a sudden there are elf like people and people with cat ears. Ok WAIT!!! now they all ride on dinosaurs?!?!!? Then the protagonist befriends a couple of angels? Now they jumped from fighting bows and arrows to giant mech like robots? Finally the writers say, JUST KIDDING and hit you with a bunch of Sci-Fi BS and now we know why he wears the mask and.....no one cares. EPIC FAIL\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is clearly a children's anime. Whoever recommended this to Berserk fans should be shot in the face. The characters are flat. To have a \"deep\" character there must be conflict within the character, these characters are the same from start to finish. Some reviews say there is something in this anime that everyone could like, and it's true because this anime THREW EVERYTHING INTO ONE STORY AND TRIED TO MAKE YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I only finished the anime hoping to find some redeeming attribute but as other reviews say the ending let them down. The whole series will let you down. \\n\\n\r\nI felt it was necessary to create an account on this site and inform people about how truly horrible this anime is. Maybe my expectations are skewed because I only watch good anime filtered through word of mouth, so if you like watching horrible anime to have a greater appreciation of the animes that are truly great, then this is a must see. If you don't want to soil your eyes and mind and stick to just watching good anime, then definitely skip this one.",

But it's a shame the show doesn't focus on them heavilly (but apparently the original game does). So yeah the character focus is a bit off and thats sad. \r\nThe fighting is alright. But nothing special. It's not fast (with some exceptions) but it's well coordinated.And most of the time it's not like the single animation still action shots (most of the fighting is REALLY animated haha)\\n\\n\r\nStory is fun. But it's very slow. I didn't realize this at first. But the pacing is very bad. The developments are fun to watch. Especially as the cast becomes bigger.\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't much of a issue. Sword clanging is heard alot but it's not annoying. \\n\\n\r\nFor Enjoyment. I would say it's enjoyable. But you won't want to rewatch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. Give it a watch if you want a nice feudal war anime. \\n\\n\r\nNote: Tears to Tiara (which hasn't aired) has the story by the same people (the VN company Leaf).",

            "content": "Utawarerumono is an enigmatic story simplified into the fantasy/adventure genres, before flashing nuances of science fiction themes, leaving more questions in the end than answers for the viewers, no matter how attentive or enthralled by the story they are.\r\nJudging by this very critical synopsis, it may seem that I enjoyed the story more than I should have. But the truth is, at the end of the day, Utawarerumono could still be described as a tale of an amnesiac who would work to the ends of the world to protect his newfound family. Of course, the latter description by itself, sounds like something senseless and unexplained,which unfortunately, is one of the key flaws of Utawarerumono. However, in a very warped sense, it's as if the director/game developers (for the source material) themselves knew of this flaw, and for whatever conscious reason, decided to keep working on the story with that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, the thematic and genre discontinuity as well as the overall illociticy regarding the cause of the characters' interactions are perhaps the greatest downfall of this show, which without these factors, Utawarerumono could have still set up the same degree of mystery that is presumed to be desired. What I mean by that is, in simple words, the motives behind the protagonist's actions seem slightly out of place, as the question of his drive is never truly raised besides the fact that he wants to discover the truth in his past. In this sense, it feels like Utawarerumono doesn't attempt to expand any further beyond the sub-genre specifics involving amnesiac characters.\\n\\n\r\nI really do want to discuss the ending a little bit, because like the 2016 sequel to Utawarerumono that I watched before the original, the ambiguity of the ending (which I will not critically tear apart, as I'm still presuming the creators understood the repercussions of attempting such an ambiguous ending) leaves an empty feeling in my stomach. The feeling isn't as if the story is incomplete, or even sad and meant to be empty, but moreso due to the imcomprehensible nature of the story. That, in addition to the fact that not just themes, but entire GENRES are added in the closing episodes of the story, are again, the only reason that I believe this anime is flawed from being considered a great example of what it's attempting to do.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to word these feelings, but I will say that this anime is quite enjoyable, if one is a fan of the fantasy/adventure genres, especially if you enjoy an occasional plot twist. I think for those of you who have seen this anime, this review is probably a lot easier to understand, but nonetheless, this is a recommended series from me.",

Since it got high score from MAL, i decided to give a shot at this.\r\nUnfortunately, after watching almost half of this series, i can conclude that this story is extremely, overly, overrated. This anime is extremely not interesting. I wonder why it got such high rating. Most probably due to the nostalgia..\r\nThis anime got almost all characteristics that any weak/terrible anime have.\r\n1. Stupid story that make no sense with no background whatsoever plus with stupid, weak story-telling. extremely fast paced, skipping time frame, plus nothing about the world of this anime is explained.\r\nAll thesemakes me feel everything about this anime is dumb and stupid.\\n\r\n2. Stupid, annoying, typical trope of characters with weak seiyuu.\\n\r\n3. Inconsistent and terrible animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good bout this anime is the music but it is just OK at best. Nothing great.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste of anime it could be a bit more interesting if it was executed/done properly. STAY AWAY from this crap. Stop wasting your time.",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impression, so my first impressions where along the lines of ok so this is about some guy with amnesia who gets involved in the civil war to overthrow the current emperor so this going to be some sort of war epic sounds promising enough.\r\nStory, 6/10.\r\nSo the premise of Utawarerumomo.\r\nstarts off pretty simple  With  the  protagonist haku who is found badly injured by a local village girl and is taken in by the local villagers while he recovers from his injuries and also amnesia. While under the care of the local villagers a local \"noble\" causes somebig trouble for the villages which in turn though a series of events helps kick start a massive rebellion against the local emperor with the main character leading this rebellion and eventually he becomes the new emperor with him now Running this country and dealing with the problems of those who bear the role of leader have to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story of utawareumomo is basically a slice of life how to run a kingdom/ war drama / harem because this is based of an hentai game.\\n\r\nAnd your now probably asking please explain so  very well I will explain.\\n\\n\r\nNow the reason I say slice of life is because about half the time it is basically that.\\n\r\nThere are literally parts of this show where people are basically doing jack shit nothing except doing paper work, Having meetings, getting drunk and Other madame things.\\n\r\nAnd to me these parts did get a bit tedious at times. But in retrospect it dose help with the setup of the the war drama aspects because when I think about it these nothing really is happening moments are used to make you and the characters drop their  guard and then out of nowhere there is an attack and your like oh crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe war dama parts are for the most part taken very seriously.\\n\r\nWhich I can always appreciate when a story take the concept of war with the kind of seriousness it needs.\\n\r\nThere is tactics involved, there is also lots of death that they actually show you, there are parts where villagers are getting pillaged and burned to the ground.\\n\\n\r\nThese parts are kind of used to help learn about the world this takes place in and more about the main character past.\\n\\n\r\nWhere we find out that this isn't a fantasy world.  but is in actually a post apocalyptic earth in the future where humanity fuck up to point where thay couldn't live on earth any more and that the main character is a God like being. \\n\r\nWhich begs the question of  how did humans end up in that state like this and how come we have magic in a world that seems it was made by science but at the same time is a fantasy world with I shit you not angel like being that can do magic and the main character who has god like abilities. That make little to no sense of how this all connected.\\n\r\nSo what I am trying to say in that thay never really expands on it and it's just comes out disjointed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow last and not  least  is the reason why a say there is a harem element in the show.\\n\r\nNow some of you are probably going to say or think the that the harem aspect of the story kind of brings down the serious nature of this story.\\n\r\nBut to my shock  it didn't do that really.\\n\r\nBecause for one it really doesn't much of a prescience. its kind of just there for you to enjoy and easy going. \\n\r\nAesthetically it kind of fits because this world that the live in is lightly based of medieval Japan and if you read any history books you would probably know that emperors in history getting harems happen quite a lot So it more of a favoring than any thing else.\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you where looking for fan service there really isn't that much of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ending kind of came out of nowhere but it was fore shadowed enough that could have it not bother me that much. Even though it did kind of end open.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character haku was some what interesting.\\n\r\nhe is a  naturally good leader who also likes women  which kind makes interesting a bit.\\n\r\nBut the problem is that he has amnesia and it kind of makes him a little bland at times. But at the same time it dose lead him to deal with a lot of issues like who he was or what has he done in life and what not.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty one note.\\n\r\nBecause I can pretty much sum up most of the characters in sentence.\\n\\n\r\nBecuse most of the characters are mostly defined though only a few personally trats.\\n\\n\r\nFor example there one character who I can sum up as the  lawful good warrior type of character.  So yah they can be pretty much be summarized pretty quickly.\\n\r\nSo the characters are kind of written poorly.\\n\r\n But I do believe that the character interaction helps make up with it.\\n\r\nBecause I did find the character interaction enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is kind of average even when I compare it to other shows that came out that same year. But at the Same time it dose add some grit to it which kind of works because this is a show about war so I give it a pass for that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's art style is kind of generic\\n\r\n Nothing really special here.\\n\\n\r\nNow the character designs where Kind of different but still generic.\\n\r\nLike it kind of fun to see all these animal people designs.\\n\r\nBut it still has the problem of being dated.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the op and ending themes were catchy but I am afraid that is all they are is catchy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ost is kind of forgettable. Like for the life of me I can't really remember much of it.\\n\r\nSo if your looking for a ost you should definitely pass on this you won't get my much out of it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\r\nNow when it came to the enjoyment of this show I guess I can mention a few things.\\n\r\nOne thing I quite like about this show is how serious it was and how ambitious it was for a hentai game story.which did find make it a pretty interesting ride over all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10\\n\r\nIf your looking a for above average war drama then utawarumono will be a pretty good ride.\\n\r\n But if the lack of  characters and art and sound bothers your the you should probably go watch something  else.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

From story concept to execution to characterization to music score...everything was so well done it amazed me from first to last episode.\r\nFunny is, I have never been a fan of fantasy and at first it seems a fantasy story, but it gripped my attention from the very fist episode...then the story unfolds and slowly you see that it is one of the best written science fiction stories ever made, mixng spirituality with science fiction magistraly well. The only thing left unexplained was the nature of Hakuoro's power...though there is hints of an ancient alien device (the mask).Remember that the only thing capable to control/restrain him was the space platform stationed upon Earth, controled by a kind of spirit (program?) left as a kind of controller. It was not claer in the end if the station was built by humans or not...the only thing sure was that it could control/restrain something almost Godlike (as a sceince fiction fan/writer I could magine it as a kind of quantum device...maybe buit left on Earth to develop intelligence...or left there by mistake...you can choose)\\n\\n\r\nEspecially beautiful is the spiritual link between the main characters...\\n\\n\r\nAs we see it to the end, we rejoice in seing that the main character was able, after thousands of years, to rejoin his lost love and beloved child so bruttaly murdered in the past, reincarnated in the sisters Aruruu and Eruruu, who received him as a friend and mentor, though the first encounter with Eruruu was not that pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nI cried, I laughed, I cheered with this anime!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must to any anime fan, and a jewel to any collection!",

            "content": "Utawarerumono - One of my new favorite anime, and one of only 2 to score a 10; this is truly a work of art.\r\nStory: 9.3 (rounded down to 9)\r\n- One of my biggest peeves I have with any show is predictability; I should have an idea of what's next, but I should also be surprised (depends on the genre, but in this case I think my statement holds true). This show really does it best in this area. It is seldom I wont have some sort of idea of what's next based on the information revealed so far, but I always seem to question thosethoughts. Sometimes I'm right, other times I'm not. When I don't have an idea, the characters don't seem to either. It really does suck you in, and it makes you feel like you are part of the story.\\n\r\n- Any cliche present in this show really didn't reveal itself. That means they flowed well in the story. It's not really a problem anyway as this has quite an original story, especially later on in the series.\\n\r\n- While I did say it was an original story, for the first half is was a tad bit unoriginal. Even so, the underlying reasons and emotions are different.\\n\r\n- The story is a captivating mix of adventure, self discovery, action, and romance. It balances the characters, plot, and setting well, with very little filler. It is one of the best stories I have encountered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.6 (rounded up to 10)\\n\r\n- Throw away characters: the worst solution to a poor story element. I'm happy to say this anime refrains from such practice. Every single character is important to the story, even the ones who just lay around all day (quite literally). Every single character with some importance plays a role.\\n\r\n- Character development is second to none. While going from one episode to  the following one, you won't notice much change in a character, except after some major event. You dont think \"Are you sure that's the same person?\" What's amazing is if you look back several episodes, you can clearly tell the character is different; he/she has changed.\\n\r\n- The characters are relatable, unique, and well thought out. Unlike so many other anime, they are made for the story as much as the story was made for them. They are memorable, and almost like \"real people\". \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\n- The animation is fluid, with no ghost speech (what I call it when a character talks but doesn't move their lips). Movements seem natural.\\n\r\n- Fight/action scenes are quite good. They are fun to watch while not being overbearing and hard to follow. \\n\r\n- There is little fan service. While you may find this to be a bad thing, I find it distracts the viewer, pulls him/her away, and ruins serious moments. When there is fan service, it doesn't seem to be there for the fun of it. It usually reveals a little about the character. It is occasionally is in there for humor, but it is subtle and occurs at the same rate it would appear in normal real life conversation.\\n\r\n- The art is pretty and the animation doesn't look like it was made in PowerPoint. With a semi-unique style that fits the story, the art was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5 (rounded up to 10)\\n\r\n- As someone who usually skips the opening theme and ending theme, This anime really surprised me. I watched it and enjoyed it every time (Coming from a classic rock lover such as Led Zeppelin, BOC, Billy Joel, etc.).\\n\r\n- The ambient music was fitting in all the right places. It did it's job and then some. No song was over played, and it didn't distract the viewer.\\n\r\n- The voice acting was right on the money. There was a few hiccups occasionally where you could tell there was a drop in quality, but it's easy to look past it.\\n\r\n- The dubs are great. They sound phenomenal and natural, and they match the mouth movements of the characters. \\n\r\n- With outstanding opening and ending themes, superb ambient music, great voice acting, and above average dubs, this anime goes above the competition.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime. I highly recommend you watch it. I found myself always enjoying the series, looking forward to whats next. It was a grand gem. With an average score of 9.6 (rounded up to 10) It is one of the highest scoring anime I have watched. You really do become attached to the characters and get immersed in the story. This gets my stamp of approval.",

            "content": "Utawarerumono is a decent fantasy anime which although light on plot surprises does take an unexpected direction early in the series.\r\nThe story centres around Hakuowlo a man discovered badly injured in the woods with a mask on his face and no memory of who he is and how he got where he is. When he recovers from his wounds his leadership skills become apparent enabling him to lead those around him as events unfold through the story and persuading former enemies and vaious other waifs and strays to join his group.\r\nVisually Utawarerumono is very pleasing with very good character design where the fantasy of thestory is enhanced as the characters, with the exception of Hakuwlo, have animal ears and tails or wings. I wouldn't say any of the characters were spectacular individually but individually they all added something to the story.\\n\\n\r\nFor about 20 episodes I really enjoyed the show with battle scenes and lots of action but then it started to get all trippy. Almost as if the creators rolled up a joint or took something else illegal because all of a sudden we get a modern or futuristic laboratory scenes, fantasy mecha robots and monsters. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I felt the laboratory scenes, robots and monsters were unnecessary and kind of ruined the end of the story. The last episode is really an attempt to salvage a decent ending which was done to a certain extent but a lot of damage was done already which was a big shame as if they kept it more simple the ending would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a very good anime ruined by the bizarre end to the story.",

Certain events entail and he becomes the leader of the village after tragic events occur.  Because of the main character's sound advise, people begin to trust him and follow in his reign. Warring occurs using normal swords and polearms, etc.\r\nI am really enjoying this anime by now.\r\nAnd then something happens. Supernaturally powerful characters appear who are attributed with devastating strength.  Hmm that's odd, but okay I guess that acceptable ( since the folk here ride raptors instead of horses ),this isn't too far out of the ordinary.  Then the story line begins to add new enemies into the plot without explaining their background.  Furthermore, it appears like the enemies are slowly adding to the story line, until they are miraculously eliminated while leaving the viewer with far too many questions.\\n\\n\r\nNow I am confused, but thinking that the anime will jump back to its original story line and we can finish this safe and sound.\\n\\n\r\nSuddenly, ROBOTS appear.  Holy cow! I mean, how does a world living in the medieval era harness robots to do their bidding. Great, okay. Let me just get through these episodes now. Oh wait, the robots are easily slaughtering everything and everybody? We have a weapon to destroy them? Sure, just slash them a few times and they begin to bleed.\\n\\n\r\nMy patience for this anime has now left the building.

Thats kinda what I got...\r\nThe anime starts out fairly calm and seems to be a fantasy slice-of-life anime but around ep 5 the anime flips, now I am trying not to spoil anything but its hard to talk about everything without spoilers... Anyways the anime suprisingly takes its turn into a war anime wich it perfectly fits, the characters have been build up so it makes sence with their relations and it makes sence for them to akt theway they do.\\n\\n\r\nThe moments in this anime are real... There are a couple of sad moments and I almost found  myself crying to one of the scenes wich says a lot since I stood through Clannad without crying once. Sadly the one really sad moment felt a bit rushed but thats the only thing I have to complain, the sadness luckily also wore of fast so there wasn't that sad after-effect (If I know what I mean).\\n\\n\r\nNow lets get to the criteria\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nNow the story is actually not bad but it gets a bit confusing around the end, the story is based around Hakuroro who has lost all his memory and is building a new life with his new family, like I said before the story kinda turns around so I can't say anything about that but I can say that the family part stays... Its entertaining and has sad moments, its a rollercoaster of emotions\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe Art for its time is pretty good but sadly they resued many clips of for example things running but they did put other background behind them so its not that bad but its pretty obvious sometimes\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, the voice acting is well done and the music is good\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Characters are very well done, every character is unique and there are almost no sterio types, the characters are very well developed and you can clearly see their relation, all actions characters make make sence and their are fairly understandable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot and I think it is a lot to underated, every episode was well done and made me want to watch the next one without having to put cliffhangers!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI know when you add everything up it gives this anime 9.2 points but I would give it more points if I could so I am rating it 10/10, it is very enjoyable and everything is well done! Characters are all unique and all have their own backstory! I would recommend it to anyone whatever type of anime you like! Go watch it!\\n\\n\r\n-Laurin",

            "content": "This anime is an has an exceptional story, interesting characters, and huge medieval style battles that few anime pull of as well. Unlike many other anime this one has a story that doesn't feel like a retelling of another story (at least to my knowledge) and comes off as a new fresh experience even when i go back to re-watch it.\r\nThe story sets you up right away with a mystery that draws your right in. The mystery, in part, is actually a huge underlying plot element that keeps coming back throughout the series. The mystery is of course, the main character's true identity. The storycontinues on and you begin to get a feel for the world they live in, which in a nutshell is sort of like a fantasy medieval world with only a handful of things that make it a fantasy world. As the story goes on you slowly become more involved with the main character and those around him, the anime doesn't try to shamelessly get its viewers attention by throwing bigger and bigger battles each episode, it will often will take time to have character development, which is a surprising thing to see as it would be a simple task for them to forgo that in favor of non-stop fighting. However this adds to the overall quality of the story because then you actually begin to care about the characters and it gets you much more involved in the story.\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, honestly originally I was gong to say that while many of the characters are just stereotypes they are done well. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized, that I couldn't think of a single character that was just a simple stereotype (save a few minor characters), and realized that not only was most every major character in the story unique and real, I also actually liked most of them. as for the main character he is extremely humanistic in the way he carries himself. Everything he does just seems like a natural human reaction from a man in his position, and it really translates well for the story when the main character is so much of a real person.\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is actually really good and very catchy and even when I would re-watch the series again, I found myself listening to the opening every time. While its no masterpiece, it certainly gets you pumped and excited for the next episode, whether it be action packed or a day where a little more character development is explored, the opening does a great job of hyping you up for the next episode.\\n\r\nOverall this anime stands out from the crowd, bringing you a creative and well written story, as well as highly developed and very humanistic characters. Not only is the action awesome and fun to watch the story is extremely thorough and draws you in as well. I'd very highly recommend this anime to most anyone, whether it be someone who wants to see epic action with large scale battles, someone who wants to see a story that stands out from the crowd, or someone who wants a bit more substance in the main characters, nearly everyone would be happy they watched this anime. Creative, well written, and mesmerizing to the very end, this is Utawarerumono. \\n",

            "content": "What you are in store for is a whole gathering of genres. Mecha, Kaiju, Romance, Comedy, War, Sci-Fi, Magic, and so much more!\r\nUtawarerumono is an anime adaptation of a visual novel, with a twist... This is not your usual \"cute school girls\" and \"lovey-dovey\" anime, instead you get an epic. The anime has fantastic opening and ending songs, along side a great OST. The animation is not perfect, but is pretty soothing to watch. The characters are fantastic and you get a unique variety of characters! Not to mention that most of the characters either have fluffy ears and a tail or wings. You canread the summaries for a detailed summary of the story, but here is a quick one. A man wakes up with a mask he cannot remove, a beautiful young woman finds him and helps him get back into shape. He then enters a world filled with wars and governmental issues. I enjoyed the series for it's intriguing mystery, which keeps throwing twists at you, one after the other. You get a wonderful cast, and I loved each and every one of the main characters. My personal favorite was \"Karura\". This anime has an element which I crave, but is very rare in anime, kaiju. But this isn't a tale of Godzilla or a E.G.E. in the creature(s) case(s). It has fantastic re-watchability, I'm just waiting to get it on DVD. Make sure to check out the sequel \"Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen\", as some of the characters from this series are rumored to appear!",

            "content": "This anime was really solid with an okay plot. The cliche amnesia idea was used well in this story, as we follow the rise of Hakuoro to power, along with the help of a small village of people. Then from there, its pretty basic, he rids of all corrupt leaders and becomes a righteous leader for a huge land of people, Of course later we learn there's more to his loss of memory and the somewhat tacky mask stuck to his face.\r\nThe elements in this story consist of mostly action, where battles occur all across the land, with huge armies. There is also a tadbit of comedy from time to time, when they aren't fighting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's kinda weird about this anime is *SPOILER ALERT* how it goes into a Gundam feel towards the end (if you know what I mean). Plus the way he kisses what I believe is his daughter, is really weird (seriously someone explain this to me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, nothing really new, but a good way to kill some time.",

            "content": "I have no intentions of denying this series the spiel it gets, since it manages to do the one thing any ambitious anime should do well: characters. More that that, this series concentrates on its cast, looking closely into it, and tracking its experience of the ruthless times and situations they're thrown into.\r\nAnd that is very good. Some may see what I'll say next as nitpicking, and I admit that this kind of anime is not my cup of tea, but here goes. Although the characters, or rather showing how they're influenced by the current tragedy is done very well, there certainly are flaws tothis anime. The story itself at the beginning is not logical enough for anime that concentrates on times of war. There is a lot of brutality and blood, and most of the villains are lunatics doing their best to piss audience off to maximize satisfaction it gets from watching them being mashed into bloody puddle of gore. And when Team MC starts faring a bit too well, there are magical giant robot combat exoskeletons introduced to scar the heroes better.\\n\r\nIf you enjoy that, well, that anime's for you.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing. While art and sound were, well, sufficient at least, I simply have to say this: OP is, for reasons, a horrendous bastard born from union between blues, anime trash music, and softcore porn background soundtrack, completely killing any and all tension pre-OP scene might've built up. I recommend skipping, should you opt to give this series a go.",

The characters are hilarious with their individual personalities, Hakuoro's calm, wise and gentle demeanor. Elulu's sweet, kind and humble demeanor. Aruru's shy and quiet but brave and blunt attitude is my favorite. The series had lots of funny moments but was also intense during each arc, some people didn't like the last arc but i found it pulled everything together in a sort of confusing way. which is good because it gets you thinking. Bottom line, Amazing anime you should watch. the manga however, isn't as in tune with thestory. or what i've read so far isn't. its more of their little adventures within the anime",

            "content": "For those who have yet to watch this anime I strongly suggest doing so! and heres why:\r\nStorey:\r\nThe storey is very well put together, which makes it easy to follow and understand. It also has many emotions within it, from sad, to exiting, to action filled, to humor, and finally relaxing. The episodes are divided into two groups: Fighting/War episodes and Peaceful/Relaxing episodes which makes it great for separating the two.\r\nI found there was too much non essential fighting like random attacks and giant robotic warriors, this was absolutely stupid, yet essential for the upcoming scenes after them.\r\nArt:\r\nI liked the designs of the characters. The twinarchers were the most eye catching. I like the setting too, a nice peaceful countryside that can be safely assumed is set in the past. There is a wide use of animal features on the characters like cat tails and ears for example!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe characters voices really suited them. The biggest example of this is Eruru and Yuzuha (their voices were the best for their characters). The background music was carefully chosen and was played at the right moment, such as dramatic music for battles and encounters and sad music for sad or supernatural scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening scene and its music is one of my favorites too!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI really wish i could favorite more than ten characters because i have never loved so many characters from a single anime quite like Utawarerumono. \\n\\n\r\nEruru and Aruru have a strong sisterly bond which is cute. Yuzuha is soft spoken and is kind to others for her current health status which is fitting as it is touching. Benawi is the most epic of the characters, being a master warrior and a great general. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from start to finish. There are no non essential scenes which keeps you entertained forever and wanting to watch more after you finish an episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is a good anime that i loved watching! I think that most readers of this will go ahead and watch it, and write their own positive reviews! I may consider rewatching Utawarerumono in the future.\\n\r\nThis review is not biased or exaggerated; but is my exact thoughts as i watched the anime and wrote the review.",

I think I enjoyed the non-action parts of the show a lot more, the character iteraction was enjoyable to watch.The action scenes just got a little bit repetitive at times. But, if war anime is your thing then this is probably one for you, though it doesn't feel like a very adult show. Early on this series flowed very well, most episodes were enjoyable and the mystery of the lead characters past always kept me interested. For me, however, the later part of the series was a little bit underwhelming. A fairly solid ending but nothing special. Itdid, at least, bring a proper closure to the series. I personally don't think this series has much replay value in it. It feels like a pretty basic series, looking back at it now and the latter part of the series really does spoil the flow of the series.",
