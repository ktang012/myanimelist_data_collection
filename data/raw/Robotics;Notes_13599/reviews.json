            "content": "I was really looking forward to an anime adaptation of Robotics;Notes, the third visual novel written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi for the collaboration of 5pb. and Nitroplus, because previous two series came from it were really neat with Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd being a rather promising start and Steins;Gate being just stellar. So no wonder I have a lot of things to tell now.\r\nRobotics;Notes begins with our protagonists, Yashio Kaito and Senomiya Akiho, the only members of school\u2019s robotics club, trying to save the said club from shutting down. And that\u2019s a huge step down from Steins;Gate in terms of a story. I mean, Steins;Gate had university students asmain characters who invent and mess up with crazy gadgets, and all Robotics;Notes has to offer is yet another clich\u00e9d story about saving a school club. Ouch. But to be fair, one can still pull out a good plot from that, and Robotics;Notes has an interesting start despite me being biased against its premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series starts off with Yashio and Senomiya entering some sort of Japanese Robot Wars tournament. It\u2019s a great hook for the series and it made me change my initial opinion of the show. I\u2019m pretty sure that the idea of crushing and smashing enemy robots with your own one is appealing to every geek, who is interested in technology. We are all children when it comes to this. If you liked playing around with screwdrivers and other instruments, disassembling stuff and building simple mechanisms when you were small, then you understand the overall feeling that Robotics;Notes is trying to show you \u2014 the technology is awesome, and through it you can make miracles come true like a bloody mage.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Robotics;Notes serves mainly as an introduction of the characters, just like in Steins;Gate.\\n\r\nYashio is a good male protagonist to me. He has a lazy attitude but essentially is a nice and caring fellow who just doesn\u2019t want to show it off. Sometimes he lacks character because of that but I think that\u2019s fine in general.\\n\r\nSenomiya Akiho is a cheerful, merry girl. She is really important for this story because she is the key to the mood Robotics;Notes is trying to pull you in. Senomiya absolutely loves robots and never stops talking about how classy they are. Actually, it\u2019s a double-edged sword, because, depending on a viewer, she can either be irritating or having a certain appeal to her.\\n\r\nOf all other characters I want to mention Furug\u014dri Kona, resident computer fairy. I mentioned in my Steins;Gate review that I liked how Hashida Itaru was a pretty nice depiction of a geek. Furug\u014dri is exact opposite, a walking stereotype: a shut-in, a fujoshi and speaks in slang full of memes. The thing is, she is probably my favourite character here, maybe because of her over-the-top behaviour and facial expressions or maybe because she has a certain drama to herself. Nevertheless, I think Furug\u014dri\u2019s antics are the funniest part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah\u2026 Enough praising here. You\u2019ve probably seen my rating and are now wondering why it is so low after all I said. Well, both Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes have a good first half, but while Steins;Gate in its second half becomes one of the best anime series I\u2019ve ever seen, Robotics;Notes follows the wrong way and starts to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot becomes bloody nonsensical. A lot of threads are left forgotten and unresolved, and I think that I should put part of the blame for this on the blokes who wrote script for the series because it feels like they did a bad job in condensing several routes of the visual novel into one big story. But there are things I can\u2019t see any excuse for. Some events of the past that the characters constantly mentioned in a vague way are never fully explained. What a tease. Other big events happened during the course of the series just don\u2019t get enough attention in my eyes. Major things going in Tokyo? Yep, it looks totally important because all description I get is about thirty seconds of footage and a couple of posts in bland name Twitter. The world is in turmoil? Casually mentioned in the news and that\u2019s it. I just can\u2019t sense the scale they want me to feel. It\u2019s like spending all day wasting time in your house, watching the telly and so on, and then some fellow suddenly shows up and tells you that boom, you saved the world by doing nothing. That is wonderful but just doesn\u2019t feel like a major accomplishment, does it?\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters lost their appeal to me in the second half because they just stopped being relevant to the main plot. It\u2019s just like they are written in for the sake of one single scene or for the pure purpose of exposition. The antagonist is also meh because he lacks any motivation or traits that could have made him a memorable villain. Just what is he going to do after he succeeds? Why is his plan so overly complex and relying heavily on rather small and obscure details? I guess I\u2019ll never know.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing. As I mentioned before, what defined Robotics;Notes and made it likeable to me in the first place is the sense of awe it gave to technology and constructing stuff. I loved that message, but then the creators completely screwed it up with inconsistency and technobabble. Sure, there is a lot of technobabble in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd and in Steins;Gate, but at least it is believable to some extent. And here we have magnetic monopoles \u2014 red glowing thingies that just fall from the sky for unexplained reason. There is a friendly neighbourhood PhD in physics, whom I went to the same school with. When I told her about this concept, well\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget those cold eyes of a person with murderous intent so strong it can make you die of fear. No, seriously, you cannot write a love letter to science with plot devices like monopoles that come out from bloody nowhere. It sort of undermines the whole message that technology can make miracles in good hands and save the world in hopeless situations because it turns out that to create technology you need a really miraculous event to happen first. Ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes is major disappointment for me. Akin to Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd and Steins;Gate, it was rather promising in the beginning, with Robot Wars, urban legends and augmented reality quest bits, but unlike those two, its story had too much build-up leading out to literally nothing, so it just collapsed by its own weight.",

            "content": "my main impression:  whoever came up with the original concept as well as the script writers for this anime need a really good editor, who can wrangle their ideas into something that actually hangs together structurally and makes sense.  because there were plenty of ideas here, quite possibly too many, and the result is a hodgepodge of giant plot holes held together by spit and enthusiasm.\r\ni can't remember the last time i watched an anime that was so meticulously produced, so overall pretty, so well animated and orchestrated, and found it such an unholy mess on the inside, which ultimately left me unfulfilled.\r\nstory:there are two main stories here; one consists of a high school's robotics club trying to put together a giant robot, the other is pretty much at the other end of the spectrum: saving the world from mysterious villainy.  the first part is decently executed (love the battle bots!), but it soon takes a back seat to the second one, which is sadly not executed well at all.  i liked the twist, which i did not see coming, but i didn't like the hurried exposition explaining it all.  the pacing of this story is all over the map; IMO 22 episodes are enough time to handle it much better. \\n\\n\r\nanimation/art: production IG, need i say more?  it's beautiful.  so much detail, and characters even change their clothes and hair styles several times!  backgrounds showcase tanegashima (an island off the south coast of kyuushuu), where japan's actual space facilities are located -- i want to go!.  smooth animation, good cinematography.  i have no complaints here; it is a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nsound: my reviews tend to lack good notes on sound because, while i know good music when i hear it, i don't have a knowledgeable vocabulary to convey its nuances.  i like the BGM here, i also like the OP and ED songs (i'm becoming a fan of itou kanako; a strong, non-cutesy female voice). the voice talent is decent -- shinichiro miki is wasted as sawada, morikawa toshiyuki does a fair but kinda bland job voicing kimijima (for which he probably should not be blamed), and nazuka kaori steals the show with her interpretation of fraukoujiro.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters:  great visual design, sub-par personalities.\\n\r\n1. senomiya akiho, super-enthusiastic president of the robotics club with a serious inferiority complex about her older sister misaki who first had the idea of building a giant robot for the famous anime \"gunvarrel\" 9 years ago.\\n\r\n2. yashio kaito, whose sole interest at the start is playing a giant-robot battle game, at which he excels.  otherwise he doesn't seem to care about anything, doesn't want to do anything, and basically just lays around, only moving when aki drags him around.\\n\r\n3. daitoku junna, a moe blob with a fear of robots (she has reason).\\n\r\n4. hidaka subaru, megane guy with delusions of bishounen/liberace grandeur, heavily into robots, serious to a fault\\n\r\n5. fraukoujiro / furugoori kano, shut-in, geek, gamer, genius programmer, fujoshi, equal-opportunity lecher\\n\r\n6. yukifune airi, AI interface\\n\\n\r\nthat doesn't sound so bad, you say?  well, it's not bad bad, but it's just... there isn't enough character development here.  we get a bare bones skeleton for most of them, and while we might find out a secret or two, we don't really get to know these people, and they feel almost generic (except that their character design is very good).  except furugoori, who is quite a unique character, albeit bordering on caricature.\\n\\n\r\naki and kaito both drive the show; everybody else feels like an extra.  aki bulldozes ahead on the robot-building side, while kaito investigates the odd occurrences that start with an alleged ghost.  he becomes a little more interesting as time goes on, but i had a hard time warming up to him because he is just not innately curious (unlike me, *wry grin*), and keeps dragging his feet, almost lackadaisically stumbling across serious secrets, and showing little intellectual curiosity.  he frustrated me a lot until fairly late in the anime when he grows a pair.  his saving grace all along is that he does care about those he considers his friends, and he will act to help them, often quietly behind the scenes.  i am happy to say what little romance this anime involves is actually well done, no typical stupidity involved.\\n\\n\r\ni can't talk about the villain(s) without spoilering, but that's probably my biggest disappointment -- we get no good villain.  there is no proper motivation for the villainous intent, and frankly, most fights between good and evil just bore me; i prefer conflict between good-yet-flawed characters, dilemmas that make me think.  don't get that here.  oh, and i could have done without the parrot ex machina intervention at the convenient moment; i actually laughed -- not what i should feel moved to do in a life-or-death situation\\n\\n\r\nso where the heck did the monopoles come from?  is that ever explained and i just missed it?\\n\\n\r\nin short, i enjoyed watching it, but the pay-off didn't materialize, and the 7 is primarily there because the production is so good, and i average all values to get my overall score.  i don't think that i would recommend it to my friends.",

            "content": "I want to note this is my first review. I was 11 episodes within the series when I had written this review. Please keep in mind I was hyped from some important climatic events. Seeing this series with only two reviews at the time (poor and shrewd); I decided to step up. This is also spoiler free until noted.\r\nStory & Plot:\r\nRobotics;Notes has slice of life related elements while maintaining a hint of supernatural. As the story progresses, the story unfolds of how Earth will face it's doom and our little high school club may be the only ones that can actually do anything about it.It compares to Steins;Gate, which had a slow paced story with major impact during later episodes. Everything slowly unravels for a sickeningly twisted plot of how everyone and everything is connected. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe show features a very diverse set of characters. Our main heroin female is spunky and full of dreams and our protagonist is a laid back gamer. As our two main characters set off to save their club from disbandment it begins to introduce the set cast and how everyone plays a dire role. From the quirky moe internet junky to our shy, full of impact karate impressionist, the Robotics Club is balanced in every which way. Robotics;Notes leads on to a huge set of character based comedy where the more you like the character the funnier their actions are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork & Animation:\\n\r\nThe shadings for the environment look stunning as an overall piece while the mecha blend perfectly into each scene. Unlike most CGI looking clockworks we're deceived by today, Robotics;Note doesn't leave anything for imagination in this category (all in good retrospect). Character design comes at a stand point of an acceptable, but typical anime character. However character detail shines unprecedented. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Opening/Ending\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes background music always fits perfectly as something unique for what's happening at that point. Whether they're discussing something serious or posing the lighter side in semantics, the music is latent enough to pull you into the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening, it's uplifting. It features the cast starting a new day alongside the Robotics Club. The ending focuses on a cute patsy character that might make a good selling point. The music itself is an upbeat tune following the character taking on the world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes stands out for me simply based off story progression. Even though we begin with this slice of life \"can we build it story?\" it evolves into \"what's going on and is this true?\" To better understand, if you've seen shows like Mawaru Penguindrum or Durarara!! you're stuck in a world where nothing makes sense until you're nearly done with the series. When they reveal certain aspects of the series' universe you just want to see what happens next, and how they pull through. Robotics;Notes delivers to keep you interested in the same manner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be Expected (my rendition of harmless spoilers):\\n\r\n- Priority Numero Uno! There aren't any large breasted females; it's not unorthodox in character design. \\n\r\n- There are mecha fight scenes.\\n\r\n- Various character based comedy.\\n\r\n- Light physical powers, persay.\\n\r\n- Unraveling the future of Earth fighting against an evil company.\\n\r\n- Next generation technology.",

            "content": "Okay, so Robotics;Notes. I admit it. I am a big fan of Nitrosplus and their works. Hell, remember Steins;Gate? That scientific thriller was one hell of a ride. When I heard that they were going to do another anime adaptation of the science fiction genre, I was very excited. No, I was ecstatic. However, after completing this series, it left me nothing of what I originally had hoped for. Don't get me wrong. I don't like comparing other works from the same company much especially since neither has close resemblance. However, the experience that came out of this series was worlds apart.\r\nNow, regarding technology...\r\nThe worldof technology can do wonders. In today's world, technology has provided us with so many new innovations for our common lives. In fact, without technology, our lives would not be the same as many of us know as of today. Perhaps one of the most interesting technology we may be curious about is the idea of robotics. Yes, robots! It's a mechanical unit with artificial intelligence that is programmed by a computer system that can make our lives much easier. It is automatic. It is useful. It is futuristic. Who knows? In maybe about ten, twenty, or thirty years, our world may never ever be the same again. If there's one change though, robots might be a word that would come to most people's minds. Evolution is inevitable and technology evolves every day.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Robotics;Notes, robots has become a fascinating phenomenon. By its tagline, \u201cWhat would happen if you really tried to make a giant robot?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes is an anime series with production handled by Production I.G that began airing on noitaminA (Animation written backwords) during the Fall of 2012. The series is based off of a Japanese visual novel developed by 5pb who are known for their previous science fiction works such as Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. The series takes place in 2019 on a southern island known as Tanegashima in Japan. In a futuristic world, technology has evolved and people have become interested in robots. One such group of people known as the Robot Research Club is keen on unlocking its secrets, exploring the ideas of robotics, and make the most of it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the series is a standalone anime. It is NOT a prequel or sequel of any of Nitroplus' other works. Despite being in the mainstream and having highly successful ratings, Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes has little similarity beyond one or the other with the exception of a cameo character and some references. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the series takes place at Chuuoutanegashima High School. (how the hell do you even pronounce that?) It is here where the Robot Research Club do their daily activities. Unfortunately though, the club does seem to suffer a bit of...uh, population in terms of membership. As a matter of fact, its status is weak and it's up to its two members  (Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio) to save it. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of the series, Robotics;Notes gives off a slice-of-life feeling where the atmosphere is very lighthearted, casual, and occasionally can cause some snoozing reactions. Luckily, we have Akiho and Kaito to maybe wipe out some of those boredom. For one thing, I found these two protagonists very likeable to watch especially in regards to their interactions and dialogues. Their personalities doesn't seem to match well though. On the surface, Akiho seems to be a very enthusiastic girl who wants to explores ideas (namely robotics for the club). Her goal is to make a giant robot for the world to see and hoping that dream will become a reality. She also seems to be a big fan of GUNVARREL, and surprise surprise, that's about robotics as well. On the other hand, there's Kaito. Unlike Akiho, he only seems to be interested in spending his days playing games, namely the fighting game Kill-Ballad. He is unenthusiastic but continues to stand by Akiho's side for a specific reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe club only has two members from the beginning. It's hard to make the most of it for the duo especially if they want to convince others to join their club. For that, they must earn other students' respect, support, and rights. Perhaps the best way to accomplish this task is to make a name for themselves at school. And hey, what better way to do it than making a giant robot?! \\n\\n\r\nThe way these two start off from the beginning is a bit frustrating to watch. Their lack of progress puts Akiho on stress especially with their club in danger of being closed. Trust me though, I want them to succeed. But that's a lot easier said than done because not only does the club seems to lack members, but also funding as well. There does seem to be opportunities presented that could help with that but one must win the rights for it. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of opportunities, by the first few episodes, viewers might be turned off with its themes and the presentation. In fact, this series can even be labeled as slice-of-life at many occasions by the way it seems to progress its episodes. It's no surprise though as Nitroplus' other works tend to follow a similar trending; shows starts off slow, gets intense, and concludes with a definite finish.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, that intensity and progression gets under way later on. Like an invention, the series progresses itself through its themes such as actual robot combat and later on, even conspiracy from the government. It also gets more emotional as well especially regarding Subaru (another student at the school) and his father. Furthermore, there is a lot of mysteries developing seemingly behind the scenes. For one thing, Kaito seems to have discovered something out of this world in the form of a young girl trapped in his game tablet. It opens up a strange boundary towards the mystery field as viewers may want to know who she is, what's she's there for, and why she is there in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series itself does drag quite a bit. Even I found it boring at many circumstances. Robotics;Notes just seems to drag itself way too slow with its slice-of-life feeling. As a matter of fact, each episode seems off balance. The \u201clet's build a robot to make our names known to the world\u201d genre has becomes stale after so many episodes. Furthermore, the mechanics behind the construction of the robot is almost nonexistent or mentioned very briefly in one of the beginning episodes. The series' all so likeable duo also becomes a bit repetitive to watch as there seems to be little to no development between Akiko and Kaito. As a matter of fact, the duo continues live on their daily lives as if there's almost nothing going on and about. Their relationship remains intact but we want to see more than that. We want to seem the two succeed and accomplish what their goal \u2013 building that robot of their dreams and showing it to the world to make a name of themselves. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen or at least far too slow in progress. Well, I guess the ending of this little duo was cute. But marvelous? Hell no. Finally, I would say that although R;N makes a way of seemingly foreshadowing events, it is stale. At the very least, it didn't give me that thriller like feeling. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the theme of robots and technology remains intact. To add to this package, there is also a very peculiar girl who speaks and acts like a otaku of the modern days. Her name is Frau (real name is  Kona Furug\u014dri) and she's one girl with a genius mind. Behind that head of hers though lies a somewhat tragic past especially related to her parents. Furthermore, her character develops a bit and becomes one of the pivotal moments during the latter half of the series after an unprecedented event. With the help of her new friend, she finds hope in this world of technology. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hope, there seems to be more of that later on for the Robotics Club as well! \\n\\n\r\nThe club recruits some new members and gets their interests through. In fact, even Kaito becomes interested in some of the phenomenon going around especially regarding one of the mysterious factors he discovers on his game tablet as mentioned earlier. Because the series has 5bp and Nitroplus involved, expect some correlations. In fact, a cameo from its highly successful anime series Steins;Gate makes their debut later on as well as various references. It's science all over again! Duhuhu\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Robotics;Notes only maintains an average stance of artwork. The school has its posture that looks like an average looking school rather than some viewers may originally expected; a possibly advanced academy with super technology. No, it's just a normal school with normal people. Ichirou Tatsuta handles the art direction who is known for his work in other titles such as Ghost Hound,  Shiki, and Usagi Drop. The characters themselves also look mostly normal and to themselves (with a little peculiarity added to Frau). Chikashi Kubota (Anohana, Shinsekai Yori, Corpse Princess) is responsible for the characters' animation designs. He gives most of the series' characters a soft touch of lightheartedness rather than making them stand out too much. Most of them gives off that natural look with some technical attributes here and there such as Airi. Ah, that cute little thing..\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of the series stands slightly above mediocre. The OP song, Junjou Spectra by Zwei, for the first half is very catchy with its montage of characters as well as some of the technology dealing with robotics. The second OP song drops the ball a bit but still gives off that technical outlook. The overall OST of the series is lighthearted with some emotional melodies played during some of the more melancholic scenes. It's hard to take it serious at many variances because the series feels like a slice of life with everything moving slowly. The soundtrack has that slow feeling as well. It's boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, enjoying Robotics Notes for me was hard. The series starts off slow and has that slice of life feeling. That feeling follows throughout the series despite some of the intertwined arcs presented such as conspiracy, robot building, and the mysterious girl in the game tablet. The duo of Kaito and Aki are fun to watch at first but it might be hard to take it too well after so their ever-so-slow development. In fact, there is hardly much at all despite them being the main stars of the show. Their personality collides often and makes it seem strange to watch them interact at times. Luckily, robots exist in the show that gives the title its meaning. Technology plays roles too especially with the mind of a young genius girl. There is also minimal fan service that gives the series a more innocent outlook on the futuristic world as opposed to a dark dystopian setting five or ten years from our time. Ultimately though, R;N stands only barely at a '6' for me. If it wasn't for a certain cool 2D girl with her cool pixel hair style, I probably would of snoozed through this. Duhuhuhu...\\n\\n\r\nNow I do have to wonder though, what would you do if you had a giant robot?",

            "content": "A short warning: This is kind of long and I'm a bit of a potty-mouth (I tried to take the cursing out, but some might still be in there). Also, please leave some feedback, especially if you don't like the review. All criticism is appreciated.\r\nThe setting is basically this: The Robotics Club at Central Tanegashima High School want to build a huge mecha, and the series follows its members in their struggles with funding and other stuff. Pretty basic. Obviously there's more under the surface than the characters just going at it with spanners, including a mystery slowly being revealed about a conspiracy that wouldseverely endanger a sweeping majority of the people on Earth. It's pretty far-fetched and we're never given a proper explanation why the plan is in motion any way. The series is very episodic and each episode usually focuses on one of the side characters and how Kaito fits in and helps them.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with some negativity, my main gripe with the series, is that it feels so very standard. Generic is another word I could use, but it feels too negative. Robotics;Notes takes what you find in most series nowadays: A cast of rather quirky characters that compliment each-other's quirk/weirdness and go with it. It embraces the stereotypic tropes usually associated with anime and doesn't shy away from using them.\\n\\n\r\nA positive to be found is that the animation is of very good quality. It's not Makoto Shinkai level of quality, but not much out there is. I'm far from an artist myself, so that's about all I'll say about it. One of the few good things with the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting, it's  mostly solid. Fukuda Nobuaki stands out as \"Doc\" in an emotional episode at about the middle of the series. Most others are good, but not outstanding. Part of the soundtrack stand out, but others are pretty run-of-the-mill pieces. Sound department ends up being a little above average, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nTo the characters: \\n\r\nAkiho (the female protagonist) is super energetic and ambitious, while Kaito (male protagonist) is when the series begins depicted as a sloth and generally disinterested in doing anything but playing Kill-Ballad (an on-line fighting game with mechas) which he apparently is one of the top people in the world at. As the series goes forward, Kaito's character is all over the place. Junna is what I like to put in the category of \"moe-blob. Basically, she's a throwaway character that's in the series to be cute and once or twice pop into the main plot-line for an episode or two. Contrasting her is Subaru, ambitious and helpful dude, who was told by his father to stop building, and competing with, robots. Then there's Kona, the epitome of stereotypic nerds in Japanese culture; She's a shut-in; almost entirely communicates in memes; is incredibly perverted and is generally pictured as a bit of a nut-case. That said, she does have a back-story that ties into the main story which is intriguing for the peculiarly short time it's given to develop. There's also the obligatory crazy director guy who's completely obsessed with boobs, and has a parrot that's trained (or is just damaged for being around him too long) to chant along in his craving for beholding boobs, as well as the oddball teacher who seems to be the most stupid and unreliable person on earth, but ends up being a person you should count on. You know you've seen these character types before if you've watched more than a couple anime.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem the series has initially, is the fact that it takes a long time to get going. It starts with an in medias res scene, with the group starting up a big mecha and getting it started. After that we're showed the lives and struggles of Akiho and Kaito in their strife to get the robot working. They get some more members shortly, but the two are unquestionably the main characters. So, basically, the first episodes are for introducing the characters and the basic plot, which is usually fine. The problem is that the main characters aren't really that interesting, and neither is the main story to begin with. Viewers who stick around will have a passable series to watch, but there's not a whole lot keeping you in attached to the show or its characters. Let's see why:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, with focus on the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nKaito - the series main protagonist, mind you- is an extremely bland and terribly boring character. He rarely shows interest in doing anything at all and seems to be sticking around \"just because\". In the beginning, coming off as eternally sceptical and non-committal, though at times showing intense caring and emotion, Kaito is a character that's all over the place, everything at once. It's not that he breaks out of his usual behaviour once or twice, it's that he doesn't have a starting point. Which is something you can say about the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nAkiho - sharing main protagonist duties with Kaito - is a very energetic character who strongly believes in herself and her vision of building the robot her sister started building years previously. I can see her being a character that splits the audience, like a Haruhi. Infectious and happy-go-lucky personality that can alienate some viewers and enamour others.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring problem with the side-characters is that they're used mainly as plot devices. Characters pop in and out of relevance when it's convenient to the story, and few are consistent throughout the series. So, even when there are scenes that are supposed to evoke emotional responses, we as viewers haven't been given enough to care about the characters and their fates. Every scene should get some sort of reaction or give you something as a viewer. Tons of scenes and some episodes could and should have been cut out to give the viewer more information and background.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, which takes the back seat to introducing the characters. The mecha launching stuff in the opening moments of the show is a set-up for other things to happen in the second half of the series and the main story takes a few episodes to even enter the series. The story is told very episodically, in fragments between the episode-long character arcs, where you get more information about the characters and at times ending that characters arc entirely. Like seriously, what ever happened to Subaru's dad going at him for still being into robots? Did he just chill out after Subaru picked one apart in front of him? It was never very clear in the series, or at least not given enough time to appreciate what the arc ultimately did for the character (nothing at all).\\n\\n\r\nIt does pick up a considerable amount later, with some emotional episodes and big events and twists. The middle part of the series is easily its best. Though, with the characters being horribly, infuriatingly uneven, it's hard to fully enjoy the series. Also, some scenes are so ridiculously improbable and out of the blue that any seriousness it's trying to get across gets lost.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've been ragging on it a lot, but honestly, Robotics;Notes is an enjoyable show at times. It's passable as a watch, but if I were to decide on it being good or bad, I have to go with bad. With the story presented, the show has the potential to be a great show, but there are like six episodes dedicated to the story when the disappointing endgame rolls in, filled with deus ex machinas.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise: The series does a poor job at getting the attention and sympathies of it's viewers to begin with and the pacing is way off from where it should be to tell a story that you, as a viewer, should become invested in. Main characters aren't able to carry the show on their own, and as a result the show is pretty flat in the end. It's almost fun how much we're meant to take for granted without any explanation at all. As such, it fails in doing what any series striving to be considered a serious work should do: Make the viewer care. It certainly has some sweet feel-good moments, but they hardly weigh up the series' shortcomings. It's a good try, but in the end it fails more than it succeeds. It falls short of the line between good and bad, and as such, I won't recommend this series to anyone. Maybe I would recommend an aspiring storyteller to watch it, just to know what pits in writing and storytelling to avoid, and that's certainly not something you would want written on the back of the DVD-case.",

            "content": "I went into watching this having already watched Steins;Gate. An anime which I thought was excellent. So I was expecting to have an interesting story with strong and engaging characters at the very least. And despite a few people making their complaints about Robotics;Notes I found it to have all these factors. \r\nThe basic story whilst a little far fetched is indeed interesting. A School Club attempting to build a giant Mecha. Saying it like that it even sounds downright cheesy. But this plays to Robotics;Notes' strengths I felt. Whilst the story is a little out there, 5pb has done a wonderful job of makingit seem perfectly pheasable. I also went in expecting it to be a little more light in comparison to Steins;Gate. Whilst it was a little less heavy at the beginning as you continue after the first three or four episodes it starts to get a lot darker and downright creepy at points. Whenever \"Kagome Kagome\" started playing I got chills down my spine. From a story standpoint I'm willing to say it stands on par with Steins;Gate. Whilst not as compelling as Time Travel, the more you watch it the more you'll come to love it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also well defined and are strong. They also suffer a little from the whole \"clich\u00e8\" thingy a tad. But I found them to be completely compelling and diverse at the same time somehow. It's something that's hard to explain. Just watch. \\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes will not appeal to everybody. But I'll go out on a limb here and say that if you enjoyed Steins;Gate you're going to enjoy this. From what I've seen so far it hasn't yet reached the lofty heights of S;G but its a worthy successor and well worth a watch even if you haven't seen Steins;Gate or Chaos;Head. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth a look at the very least!\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After completing the series I must say that I was quite disappointed, and I would like to rescind some of my comments comparing it to S;G.",

            "content": "Robotics notes is surprisingly good anime, my expectations were pretty low but it actually end up being better than Steins;Gate, going beyond its epicness, especially in terms of characters. Also, the animation is pretty cool.\r\n- no one ever\r\nThe anime is about some guy and some girl who both have some weirdass diseases which are exactly opposite from each others. Elephants, mice and such, literally and apparently but no one honestly knows. There is also some dead sister who is alive, she is also the evilest thing ever except she is actually a good one, at this point I also assume that she is no one'ssister. Someone could say the series is constantly trolling viewers with such a witty writing. Someone could say cat pictures are epic. Who knows. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is some random amount of female characters who have nothing to do with anything but all good series need a harem and one of the girls is voiced by Rie Kugumiya so it's okay. The lads in this series aren't strapping, they are either princes of bishonen or otherwise pretty boys. It's similar to this ginga bishonen thingy from Star Driver, all that galactic prettiness. I assume not everyone knows about it so here is the sum up,\\n\\n\r\nListen, bishonen is never straight but this time it was pretty fucking gay. \\n\r\n- that one guy from the internet \\n\\n\r\nI would talk about their personalities, but wearing glasses randomly and awkwardly for a comedic purposes doesn't really... it's probably some Japanese thing, supposedly hilarious but it's funny only at 4 am when you haven't slept for a week.\\n\\n\r\nWe have fighting tournaments with robots, school club and other original things like mortal peril and such. It's okay, only all anime ever resolves around clubs but who cares, how can you even do a series without a fucking manly badass club? Exactly, totally fucking impossible. We need school and we need clubs. It's a message from Japan, go to school and study because you can't do shit without school, you can't even write a fucking robot fight without school. It's hard, anime and clubs are constantly criticized for cliches, it's hard, no one understand, it's hard, no one wants to understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe only genre tagged is sci fi and that's about all there is to tell because by far nothing much has happened. But lets not judge yet, I mean only 11 episodes are out!!11!! It's not like that amount epicness can bloom with just an 11 episodes, no no, we just have to wait and see. Was S;G so good from the start? No it was not, don't be stupid people, hold your wannabe elitism and stop being haters. You are not professional critics so do not criticize this. It's okay to praise the shit out of this at this point already, though.\\n\\n\r\nR;N is an anime where pacing is not even a word and depth is just another synonym for penetration.\\n\r\n- some pseudo-funny guy from an e-pen gathering\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this, it is just so very bland and not worth of caring about.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is the 2012 anime adaptation addition to the Science Adventure series, which so far consists of three different series which are all connected by alternative settings: Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate and lastly Robotics;Notes.\r\nMade originally by 5pb while the previous series C;H and S;G were a collaboration of both 5pb and Nitroplus, the anime showed much promise to be an engrossing Sci-fi tale about ipad-like devices named Poke-Coms, mecha and robots all in a near future school setting.\r\nTo tell you the truth, for some time after the Visual Novel was announced it was one of top highly anticipated visual novels, and when the anime announcement came beforethe visual novel was even out I was ecstatic. I thought just like the case of Steins;Gate, that we will need to wait a couple of years after the visual novel was out to get the anime adaptation, and in the case of Chaos;Head the anime adaptation came a few months after the visual novel was out. In the case of Robotics;Notes, it was the same, only that the anime was announced before the visual novel was released. \\n\\n\r\nSo, hearing the news about the Robotics;Notes adaptation made me really happy inside. I anticipated the series greatly and hyped in massively in my mind, mainly because of the highly successful and critical acclaimed previous series in the Science Adventure franchise, Steins;Gate. I was certain that after the mistake that was the Chaos;Head anime adaptation we'll get another great adaptation. Steins;Gate was made by White Fox, an unknown studio at the time that quickly gained popularity from the few anime it released. Robotics;Notes however, is made by Production I.G, A respectable studio who is responsible for many good anime adaptations. Chaos;Head was made by Madhouse Studios, another respectable studio, but, butchered the anime adaptation of C;H to bits for some reason. So unlike the case of Chaos;Head, and like the case of Steins;Gate, I was certain we'll get another great anime adaptation, Robotics;Notes.\\n\\n\r\nQ:Was I disappointed?\\n\\n\r\nA:Yes. greatly.\\n\\n\r\nQ:Was the studio responsible for my disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nA:No.\\n\\n\r\nQ:So... what is responsible for my disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nA:Clearly. The source material.\\n\\n\r\nIn the next paragraphs I'll explain exactly what disappointed me about Robotics;Notes. \\n\r\nRead on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe story of Robotics;Notes in the beginning was slow, yet showed much promise. Characters were introduced slowly one by one, and it seemed we have a winning adaptation again, just like Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut...\\n\\n\r\nThat is what was the problem.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes tries to be just like Steins;Gate, but fails in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSub paragraph-Gameplay of the science adventure series:\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel of Chaos;Head came before Steins;Gate, and had the delusional trigger system, which the main character in it, Takumi, triggered delusions in it that can affect the ending the reader can get.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel of Steins;Gate came out a few years prior to Robotics;Notes. This Science Adventure visual novel had the phone trigger system, which the story changed significantly according to some important text messages the reader chooses to send, something like a choice system like in most visual novels, only much cooler.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes developers boasted: 'Those who enjoyed our previous visual novels in the franchise will not be disappointed'. The developers clearly tried making another Steins;Gate, so instead of cell phones, we got Poke-Coms, and with them the reader triggered everything with the Poke-com Trigger, which like Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head, affects the story significantly and decides what ending you'll get.\\n\\n\r\nSo making a system much more similar to Steins;Gate and less to Chaos;Head, is  what I call riding the success of their previous series, which was critically acclaimed.\\n\\n\r\nBut... it wasn't.. Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nStory-Continuation:\\n\r\nMuch like Steins;Gate, the story of Robotics;Notes revolves about conspiracies and in the end about saving the world, but instead of time travel and world line shifting, we get robots to aid out heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts when the MC, Yashio Kaito and main heroine, Senomiya Akiho try to reform a dead robotics club by recruiting more members. Each episode in the beginning introduces characters one by one, Hidaka Subaru, Furugoori Kona, The Karate girl I can't let myself bother remembering her name etc. The story starts so slow... that it feels like nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nLet me break in down for you guys:\\n\\n\r\nFirst episodes: Nothing happened.\\n\r\nMiddle episodes: Nothing happened while the writers tried miserably to write some happenings in the story but failed.\\n\r\nLast episodes: Still nothing happened, while the writers tried to write some happenings in the story, but again, failed.\\n\\n\r\nRobots, grandpas, monopoles, conspiracies, Mr. Pleiades, Robo-One, Death of a minor character, 'The isn't the gunvarrel I know', Furugoori scenes, conspiraces, AI's and much more etc etc, sounds like a story with major happenings?\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, they feel so minor like the story stayed stuck in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one character in the series like to say 'IMPACTO', that is exactly what the story of Robotics;Notes lacked.\\n\\n\r\n'IMPACTO'.\\n\\n\r\nNo Impact. Nothing. When I watched the series I asked myself, 'When will the story start'? Well... it simply didn't even feel like it started.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarities to Steins;Gate-Story:\\n\r\nConspiracies, the committee of 300, sudden romance in the end, sci fi, devices  with communication ability , saving the world, death of a character, circle of friends, tsunderes (Kurisu and Subaru, the male tsundere of the series), a female Daru Furugoori, few character makes minor appearances like a grown up nae and even a certain super hacker etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory-Conclusion:\\n\r\nRiding on the success of a successful series like Steins;Gate doesn't make Robotics;Notes successful too. On the other hand, it makes it much inferior.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the story a 6, the lowest score I give to anything, because for me it was the weakest point of Robotics;Notes. The writing was mediocre, simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAnimation looked fine, but it had QUALITY FACES EVERYWHERE. While the art in the beginning of the series was solid, then the QUALITY kicked in. Many faces were drawn awkwardly, even cheaply. While it was also the case with the Steins;Gate anime adaptation, Steins;Gate had scenes with massive detail in them. Robotics;Notes had none.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe theme songs were extremely catchy. Some are rockish, some are poppish. Unlike previous Science Adventure series, the opening wasn't sung by Itou Kanako, But by Zwei and Haruki. However, the second ending was sung by her.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was on par of every other professional anime, but because of the faulty story, it didn't reach to its true potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nYashio Kaito -  the main character. No Okabe by anime means, not even Takumi. He's just a normalfag who likes fighting games, that's all. \\n\\n\r\nSenomiya Akiho - 2genki4me, though her blushing scenes made my nutbladder go wild.\\n\\n\r\nHidaka Subaru - The tsundere of the series. Yes, he's a male. A male tsundere. He also has his alternative persona, Mr. Pleiades.\\n\\n\r\nFurugoori Kona - Daru? Yes, only female. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nAiri  - A-I that is voiced by Kugyuu. She's in most of the series, just.. useless. Later she developed more, but in the end, she was still useless.\\n\\n\r\nKarate Girl - What was her name again? Ju-- I can't remember. I watched 22 episodes and I can't even remember.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: useless most of time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5\\n\r\nWhile I found the story to be the weakest, at the beginning the anime was somewhat enjoyable, hence an addition of 0.5 to the final score.\\n\r\nMost of the time though, I didn't really enjoy myself. Polarizing to Steins;Gate, because the beginning of Steins;Gate was much less enjoyable from the latter episodes where shit got realer than fuck and the anime was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nMy rating scale goes like this - 10 the highest score, 6 the lowest. If I give an anime a 7, it means I was severely disappointed by it. By any means, this is no Steins;Gate, even if it tries hard to even reach its toes. In the end, Steins;Gate was extremely memorable for me, While Robotics;Notes was the opposite, extremely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation value: low.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Time killer, that's all. Not even a good one.\\n\\n\r\nNext reviews by me:\\n\r\n1.Steins;Gate movie.\\n\r\n2.Main Steins;Gate series, while I watched and rewatched it many times and even read the visual novel, watched the dub, read many of the manga adaptations and listened to the drama CD's, I just delay this review. I'm guessing I'll be done with it in 2036, if I'll be alive by then.\\n\r\n3.Maybe... Just maybe I'll write more reviews outside the science adventure series. But I'm still not sure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes review by DeadEnd2013 reached its dead end. Hope you enjoyed reading.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes, the latest work of  Naotaka Hayashi who is also the writer for Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. If you didn't know that just by seeing the colon in each of the titles then the four lines of pointless philosophy he puts under the titles is bound to tip you off. As someone who has read both his first two works and watched the animes, I can say I have a fairly good grasp of his writing style. Don't worry about any fanboyish interfering with this review. As you can tell, I don't have a high opinion of him. \r\nRobotics;Notes is about robots...or that what it'ssupposed to be about. Wouldn't be the first of this guys works to have false advertising. The first half of the show involves Aki gathering the members of the robotics club and slice of life antics. This is a common thing in this mans works. A section of the story which is held up mostly by the characters and slice of life. It's slow and sadly unlike Steins;Gate the characters are not interesting enough to carry the show. So our only incentive to watch on deals with the mystery of Kimijima Reports. Unfortunately his mystery is slow moving and the significance of these reports only becomes apparent in the second half of the series. \\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the second half could be considered the crash and burn point. If you pay attention you begin to notice that the story in it's efforts to become more dramatic has instead become sillier. Plot holes rear their heads and you come to the conclusion that despite the impression of the first episodes, this show isn't going for something remotely realistic. We enter into a series of  character arcs which are not related to the main plot and anything that takes place here is forgotten and discarded. However when the final episodes come and our main plot returns. This is the point were the writers main weakness comes up and exposes itself. You see the writer has a problem with jumping the shark. He can create a setting with the potential to be something great but he also has the talent of reducing it to garbage if left unchecked. With Chaos;Head he turned an intriguing murder mystery into a shounen battle anime. With Steins;Gate he polluted it with developments which created plot holes. The result wasn't garbage but he was getting close by the end. (You people better be thankful to White fox for adapting the visual novel cleverly into anime and removing the flaws in the original materiel. For example, in the visual novel black holes can not only compress matter, but also data.) But Robotics;Notes takes the cake. I am sure I am not alone in saying that the revelations in those episodes were stupid beyond belief. And my friends if your sense of disbelief isn't shot to shreds, placed in a trashcan and set on fire by this point then a mind numbingly bad deus ex machina involving a parrot is sure to finish the job. In the end we are left with a barrel of plot holes, story developments which make no sense, characters we have long since stopped caring about and a ending which in one of the characters terms, lacks IMPACT0!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is to the degrees I have come to expect from Production IG lately. While not visually stunning they still are above the standards of decent animation. Sound is fairly decent with two openings of J-pop. The second one I am actually fond of. The BGM manages to highlight scenes and do it's job. Not outstanding but I can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Robotic;Notes consist of a optimistic mecha anime fan main heroine called Aki, the gamer Kai who's currently only interested in playing a robot fighting game called Kill Ballad, an overly eccentric computer genius called Frau, a virtual weather girl program called Airi, galactic bishounen wannabe straight man glasses guy and some girl who's only traits are karate and being cute...apparently. I would like to give more info on those last two but that's all I got. Many of these grow tiresome after their one note gimmick loses amusement. The saving grace is Frau. Frau is a depiction of the girl genius which isn't common and her lack of social etiquette and quirkiness make her rather lovable. It's a pity that after her episode arc she is pushed into a support role and her screen time is drastically reduced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Robotics;Notes is not something I would recommend to others. Specifically if they are looking for something on the same level as Steins;Gate, avoid it like the plague. Really it's just a good example of how going too far for dramatic effect can come back to bite you in the ass. If you plan to watch it no matter what I say I give you this piece of advice. Keep your expectations rock bottom, no matter how promising something looks.",

            "content": "The relatively shallow plot disappointed fans of Steins;Gate, but the enlarged scope of events and more action scenes pump more adrenaline. \r\nSTORY\r\nWhen compared with Steins;Gate (the main reason for this sequel's initial popularity), the plot is much shallower but instead wider. In Steins;Gate most of the struggle of Okabe is within the laboratory members and the concept of time. In Robotics;Notes the struggle is not only between Akiho and her sister, but the entire club/school plus JAXA and everyone related with Kimijima's plan. \r\nART\r\nNothing much to say, the art is good and above average, other than the awkwardly drawn characters that can be seen ina few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI enjoyed the background musics and the opening/endings, and overall do contribute to the mood and the intensity of the events occurring. However they are not particularly memorable or exceptionally good. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nWe see many sides of each and every character, something which many anime works neglect upon as they try too hard on other aspects. Senomiya Akiho is especially developed well as we get to know the things she value and her reactions to some of the things that happen to her. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI am personally a fan of conspiracy theories and related stories, so Robotics;Notes was an extremely enjoyable series for me. Other people that I know have criticized Robotics;Notes for being too unrealistic, detached, chaotic, not paced well, etc. I see where they are coming from but the intense plot (which I can't really describe in detail because of spoilers) and the climax kept me excited and wanting to watch the next episode and hence I finished the show in a day.",

            "content": "What started off being a very light-hearted anime quickly turned in an anime that sent chills down my back. I kind of just wanted to write that one sentence as my review because it is what changed my view on this anime and what made me write this review\r\nThe title of this show \u201cRobotics;Notes was quite simple to understand. The first part \u201cRobotics\u201d refers to the club that Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio are trying to keep alive the Robotics Club. The second part of the title \u201cNotes\u201d refers to the Kimishima Report and the notes that Kou Kimishima left behind, and being able tofigure out what they mean. \\n\\n\r\nThe first two people you meet are Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio. Akiho has a dream, and this dream is to complete the robot Gan-tsuke that her sister Misaki started years ago at the same school. Akiho is a character that is full of life and energy, but at the same time isn\u2019t the smartest of the bunch. Kaito, her childhood friend really has no interest in the club and was just dragged along by Akiho, but what he does like is robot fighting games. Not only does he love them, he is completely absorbed/addicted to them and the only way to ask him to do favors is to beat him at the game Kill-Ballad, whom is created by Kona Furugoori. Just to put in very simple words who Kona is\u2026 she is a NEET that is really all you need to know about her for now.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, aside from being about Robots and solving mysteries, also is about friendship and bonding. Now I know tons and tons of animes are about friendship and bonding, but what is particularly special about this anime is how far they are willing to go for each other and to be able to protect this friendship that they have made.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest though, once starting this anime I was not expecting much more than a show that would bring enjoyment, and be able to laugh and maybe watch some cool fights, but this idealistic idea of mine was quickly turned astray. Even though what is happening is very unexpected, this is what makes me super stoked about watching this anime every Thursday (or Friday). On an Enjoyment based level this anime is actually amazing, there is nothing really more you can ask for, when you start watching a show having low expectations and this show completely turning around and being one of my favorite shows from last season. To put a comparison in your head this show is like watching those animes that have robot fights, and when the robots die or loose an arm blood spurts out. If you don\u2019t understand what I am trying to say it is how unexpected this anime really is.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the last thing I can talk about is the op/ed songs. I am just going to say by far the best song used in this anime is the OP (Zwei \u2013 Junjo Spectra). It really just has a nice tempo and beat to it that almost seems very fitting and suitable for this anime. It almost seems as if something amazing is going to happen right after I hear that song, which on the most part is true.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is a wee bit shorter than I expected, but honestly I am not 100% sure what more to add or write about. This show is very underrated and there really wasn\u2019t much \u201chype\u201d for when it started and came out, but I recommend you give this anime a shot, I can almost promise you won\u2019t be disappointed with the outcome.

            "content": "Robotics;Notes: Take Note, It's Highly Underrated\r\nWhen going into the fall 2012 season, I was at a loss at how underwhelming I found the anime year 2012 to be. If there were two animes I felt could possibly save it, it would be Gen Urobuchi's Psycho-Pass and Production I.G.'s other hit show, Robotics;Notes, an indirect sequel in an alternative setting to Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. Unfortunately for Robotics;Notes sake, it seems to draw comparison to Steins;Gate, a tough standard to hold an anime to considering Steins;Gate is considered one of the best animes to come out in recent history. It's also hard to compare since Steins;Gate wasproduced by White Fox and Robotics;Notes was produced by Production I.G. Still, how was Robotics;Notes as a series?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found it to be a pretty solid series in its own right. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece or a great anime, but I did find it to be very good. It had an interesting, quirky cast of characters involved in a pretty interesting mystery plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a HS Robotics Club that is struggling to keep it's club status due to only having two members. Those members are Akiho, an ambitious, fiery girl with an obsession for giant robots, Gunvarrel in particular and Kai, her childhood friend who lazily just hangs around and does nothing but play robot fighting games on his PokeCom...and the only time he'll do anything is if you beat him in a game. Akiho's goal in the Robotics Club is to build a full-scale robot modeled after the famous Gunvarrel, trying to finish a project her older sister started when she was at the school. The series takes an interesting turn into the mystery genre though when Kai discovers he can see an electronic girl through his PokeCom, as well as discovers the mysterious files of a deceased scientist named Kimijima Kou that leads into a potential cover-up of the potential world destruction. Overall, I have to say the story really surprised me and I found the mystery element to be an interesting twist on what you can already consider a school club genre. Although, I did find some weaknesses to the story, as it seemed to lack some development of the character motivations toward the end, the antagonist in particular (which I will not spoil since it is part of the series twist). I found the twists to be very good, which should be no surprise considering it's coming from a 5pb. VN adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters as a whole I found to be extremely likable and interesting. Akiho and Kai's personalities were hilarious to watch clash, but still endearing at the same time. The other members that are recruited into the Robotics Club are excellent as well. You have Subaru, a peculiar boy that has a negative attitude toward the Robotics Club at first with it mostly having to do with his hilarious alter ego and side hobby as well as his parental situation, Junna a shy girl from the karate club that strangely joins the Robotics Club even though she has no interest in robots, and one of my personal favorites...Kona. Kona is a strange, hermit of a girl that spends most of her time in front of a computer and is a bit of a game developer, however she has a strange obsession with speaking in Internet lingo. She is quite possibly one of my favorite characters in any anime just because of her quirky personality and constant Internet references and hilarious laughter. I know I caught myself saying \"Duhuhu\" every now and again. Of course, the mysterious side characters involved made for an interesting watch. Misaki, Aki's older sister seems to have a strong detachment for Aki, which leaves Kai wondering what happened to Misa for her to have such a poor attitude toward Aki. You also have Airi, the electronic girl that assists Kai in discovering the Kimijima Reports, just to name a few of the characters. Overall, the supporting cast for this series was extremely strong as it seemed each character had at least some impact on the story. It's one of the rare times I watched an anime where it seemed like there wasn't a single worthless supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the production was concerned, I thought it was okay. It probably was one of the weakest elements behind this series. There wasn't anything \"breathtaking\" about the animation, especially from a Production I.G. work. Of course, that could have something to do with Kazuya Nomura's inexperience as an anime director. His only other direction work was with the Sengoku Basara series, which is a COMPLETELY different animal than Robotics;Notes. It wasn't that the animation was bad, it just wasn't particularly great. There's nothing about it's animation style that will make me remember it by. However, I will admit the series did redeem itself with its seiyuu work and music. The seiyuu work in this series was great, and I have to applaud Kaori Nazuka (Kona), Yoshino Nanjo (Akiho), and Yoshimasa Hosoya (Subaru) in particular for their passionate performances. Even Ryouhei Kimura did a commendable job voicing Kai as well. Yuki Hayashi, Takeshi Abo, and Chiyomaru Shikura collaborated on the music and I felt they did a commendable job of setting up great tracks for creating an excellent mood for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the series weaknesses are concerned, I'll be honest. I didn't find the final episode's conclusion to be very strong. If nothing else, the ending felt somewhat rushed. On top of that, I just didn't find it to be a satisfying conclusion for an overall great cast of characters, as it is very vague in regards to what happened after the conflict had been resolved. I also found one of the major weaknesses to be that the series antagonist had a weak, or rather unexplained character motivation as to why he was acting the way he was. I don't consider it the best writing when a character close to the antagonist even says why they can't explain why they are acting the way they are. I already mentioned the animation being somewhat weak for a Production I.G. work. For a company that brought us Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Psycho-Pass, which are visually stunning as well as xxxHolic and Usagi Drop, which are artistically stunning, Robotics;Notes just seems sort of cheap and generic with its animation. Like I said, there isn't anything \"bad\" about the animation per se...it just wasn't good or memorable. I also found the pacing to be a little slow at times. It didn't quite bring things to a stand still, but I will admit the first half of the series doesn't get the ball rolling too well on it's overall story. \\n\\n\r\nAs an overall series though, Robotics;Notes is pretty good if you're looking for a club oriented anime with a pretty solid mystery element. If you go into this series expecting the next Steins;Gate, you'll be extremely disappointed as the plot isn't nearly as interesting as Steins;Gate and the animation styling isn't nearly as daring. The \"tone\" of Robotics;Notes is a lot less heavy than Steins;Gate, as you can tell from the bright and vibrant colors of it's animation in comparison to the dark contrast of Steins;Gate. I know I'm drawing a lot of Steins;Gate references, but it's hard not to since it is the adaptation of 5pb.'s 3rd installment to the Science Adventure VN series. Still, on the whole, I do consider Robotics;Notes to be one of the better animes to come out lately and if you enjoy a good mystery, I think Robotics;Notes is at least worth a watch.",

            "content": "Robotics;notes can be summed up with one word: enjoyable.  This anime certainly showed a lot of promise.\r\nThe series follows a few narrative lines which culminate toward a grand finale where all the plot points are meant to converge.  The first and primary one being a young student who is trying to keep her robot club alive and finishing her sister's unfinished dream of making a super-large sized robot from a popular - but mysteriously unfinished - anime series called Gunvarrel.\r\nWhat struck me about the series, and what is perhaps the sole element that carries this anime, is the quirky, fun and humerous characters,namely the protagonist Akiho.  Her counterpart, Yashio, counterbalances Aki's exuberant over-enthusiasm with his blase, nonchalance, making for many enjoyable interactions.  Combined with a few ultra-odd lesser characters, Robotics;notes has all the elements to go anywhere it wants.  The foundation is solid.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the structural elements of this anime let it down.  The story is convoluted, attempting to pack in many narrative plots at various levels of intensity and scope, that it can't quite fit in to the 22 episodes.  The first narrative, keeping the club alive and building the robot, is fun, light hearted and highly enjoyable.  The larger narrative plot regarding the end of the world, just can't be pulled off, and you're left at the end feeling somewhat cheated.  So many things are hinted at, but not explained, until the very last few episodes.  But the explanations are inadequate.  Rewatching it a few times, or perhaps going back and reading the manga might shed some light on what the hell is happening - but otherwise you are mostly left wondering.  The plot holes are gaping.\\n\\n\r\nPart of why the plot doesn't quite make sense is the villain.  The villain is, well, simply put, villainous.  Even one of the characters asks the villain why they are doing what they are doing.  Their response?  Because I want to.  Because I can.\\n\\n\r\nHmmm...  Sounds like the author didn't quite think that one through.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the end tries to tie it all together, what you're left with is a mangled lump of threads mashed into a ball.  The ball sticks, but only barely.  In one of the later episodes, a mysterious shady character sits down with one of our protagonists and lays it all out, telling, essentially, the audience what the hell is happening.  That's not good storytelling.  Even the explanations don't quite add up, and you're either left feeling cheated, or simply are forced to suspend all the annoying, nagging questions you have at the back of your mind in order to move on to the next episode, which unfortunately doesn't seem to help.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, the gaping holes in the story does not mean that the plot is not enjoyable, or that the conclusion is not satisfying.  There are many satisfying elements to this anime, and I would recommend giving it a go.  It's perhaps a shame that they tried to squeeze it into 22 episodes rather than taking their time, spanning it out, and having it make sense.  This could have been really something.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well. Time for my first review I guess. There will be spoilers, but contained to a small section which is labelled appropriately.\r\nRobotics;Notes (R;N) was originally created as a Visual Novel. It was brought to you by the same guys that had previously released Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. While both of them were very unique, I absolutely loved S;G while hating C;H...so going into this I had absolutely no idea what to expect. In the end, I got served a big fat dose of \"meh\".\r\nFirstly I think it;s important to state that if you're looking for a mecha anime, you're going to have a bad time. Thisis even less of a mecha anime than Guilty Crown was. Right, now that's out the way, moving on with some of the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary issue with the series is pacing. Saying the series starts off slow would be a massive understatement. While the plot is developing to an extent, the meatiest chunk of the plot is reserved for the last 4 episodes, with the previous 18 focusing on anything else but the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of plot *SPOILERS START* It really is not explained well. Concepts such as monopoles are never explained. They're just there suddenly and you have to accept that. If this was a 12 episode series, I could accept things being cut out due to time constraints, but this wasn't a 12 episode series and they certainly were not overloaded with content. However, the most damning thing of all is that I cannot even remember Kimijima's reason for wanting to kill the majority of the population. Maybe this says more about my memory than the anime itself, but I've never experienced this in anything else that I've previously watched. Throw in examples of embarrassingly bad use of \"Deus ex machina\" for problem resolution (eg: A bird deflecting a gun) and you're left with a badly executed plot. *SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, they're decent for the most part. Yashio and Akiho are developed well and have a decently executed and interact in a seemingly natural way with each other. This seems to be quite rare in anime with everything being exaggerated, and it's something I really appreciate here. I personally found Frau entertaining and Mizuka is one of the strongest side characters I've come across in anime. However, two of the \"main\" characters could have been completely cut from the series without any real loss. They were just there because it was an adaptation from a VN and therefore the cast was already decided for them. The antagonist of the series was extremely weak with little development given.\\n\\n\r\nFor art and sound, I honestly don't notice unless a series is exceptionally good or bad in these aspects. It isn't either of the two extremes, so I'm not going to comment further on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a watchable series. It's poorly paced and badly explained in parts, however the characters overall are strong. I cannot really compare it to either s;g or c;h. I'm giving it a rating of 6/10 overall, although I do tend to rate harshly according to my score deviance on ratings. I wouldn't advise against watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped and that I didn't waffle on too much.\\n",

            "content": "For this review I will make references and comparisons to two other anime: Chaos;Head(2008) and Steins;Gate(2011). While all three of these anime adaptations were made by separate studios, they drawn upon the same series of visual novels for source material. \r\n     Now to begin the review. I'll start with the story. Like Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate Robotics;Notes has a story line that could only be described as thrilling. While the story started off at a slow pace it gradually built until I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation. They really pulled out all thestops for this show. Even with the slow start, the constant switch between success and failure in the attempt to build a giant robot as well as the mystery of the Kimijima reports was more than enough to keep my interest. In spite of the mystery, though, the plot was much easier to follow than either Chaos;Head or Steins;Gate. Personally I liked those complex stories that required an acute attention to detail, but that might not be a plus for everyone. As the story progresses it does take on a darker tone, but I found it nowhere near as grim as Chaos;Head or Steins;Gate. The story is overall logical and well thought out. My only qualm was that robots seemed far to advanced and integrated into society for the year 2019, but in spite of this the show does feel very realistic at times. The phone-tablets that everyone uses seemed like a very accurate prediction of the future. I can also understand why robotics needed to have become as advanced as it was for plot purposes. With so few negatives I felt that the story was perhaps the best part of Robotics;Notes.\\n\r\n     The art was quite impressive as well. The animation was beautiful and fluid. Several of the Character designs were a bit generic (Akiho and Subaru), but I really liked the uniqueness of some characters like Kona. Action scenes, which were few and far between, were underwhelming in terms of animation, but the focus of this show was not action. When all was said and done, though, I thought the art was very aesthetically pleasing. \\n\r\n     I'm not exactly a connoisseur of music, so I don't have to much to say about the sound. The soundtrack was enjoyable and had some excellent tracks within it, but it was not a masterpiece. It was definitely not a detriment to the show however. Like I said, certain tracks were absolutely fantastic. \\n\r\n     Character development was good but not great. I thought characters like Akiho and Kaito received excellent development. They were round characters, not bound by the basic traits they were introduced with. Others characters, however, received far less development. Of the shows cast I would have to say that Kona was my personal favorite. She received excellent character development and had the most interesting personality of all the main characters. Kaito, the protagonist, was not the greatest character I've ever seen, but he was far from generic and boring. I found him to be quite a likeable character with a realistic personality. In comparison to Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes is far superior in terms of character development. However, its characters were not as impressive and those of Steins;Gate. That about sums it up for characters. \\n\r\n     Since enjoyment is a very subjective factor, I don't include it in reviews. Overall is just the combination of the previous factors, so there's not a ton to say for it. Robotics;Notes was superior to Chaos;Head in just about every way, however, it does not reach the same heights as Steins;Gate which I consider as masterpiece. At the end of the day though, I think most anyone would really like this show.",

            "content": "Whenever I watch an anime I get an initial impression or a promise. The anime will usually promise me that it's going to be one way or the other. Just from looking at the cover and watching the first few episodes and the main gist if the anime told me I was getting into an anime full of inspiration about a group of kids trying to make their dreams come true through the building of a robot. It could have been that or an Angelic Layer style robot tournament. I wouldn't have even minded a slice of life with a little robot building hobbies onthe side. However this anime so far has introduces so many concepts that for the sake of not spoiling anything I will not mention. Lets just say some of those concepts were pretty... earth shattering. Anyway, I really don't know what this anime is suppose to be, I don't think it knows what it wants to be. The reason why I brought up impressions and promises earlier is because I need to commit my feelings to something, at times it's ok to willfully betray the viewers initial impressions like in Madoka Magika, to get a certain effect, but this anime didn't seem to have a goal in mind as it popped question after question in my mind. Even at this point in the anime I feel like there were so many odd ball occurrences that were completely out of context that they could very well end up being plot holes by the end of the series unless they do some serious tying of the strings. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to touch on is the Characters. I felt like in the context of this ever vacillating story, the characters could not plant their roots firmly enough to make significant development. The characters all have very strong personalities and they are all very likable. I just wish that I could come to draw even closer to them especially by now. \\n\\n\r\nSo far my mid series review is this:\\n\\n\r\nStory: There really isn't much of one at this point, I am having a hard time even pegging it as a slice of life anime. There are too many themes that are picked up and dropped to be able to understand what the anime is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's quite good. It;s very befitting of the overall mood of the story and it is quite pleasing to look at for long periods of time. Very smooth animations and pleasant backgrounds. Very Slice O' Lifey.\\n\\n\r\nSound: My hands are together for Asami Tachibana, Takeshi Abo, and Yuuki Hayashi for putting together such a wonderful soundtrack. If anything, the sound kept the mood relevant throughout the anime. I especially liked some of the more ongoing pervasive melodies as they were very nostalgic and just put me into a very good mood. I would definitely purchase an album if made available to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The storyline aside, the characters were very lovable. They all stood out in their own way and if anything is the reason to watch this show as these character would probably make a better episode by episode anime rather than a show with an intricate plot that divides and ties together at the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Frankly, I found my attention drifting. It really hasn't riveted me as much as I'd like. Nitroplus has been known to make other animes that have been more or less slower at the beginning like Steins;Gate which is probably one of my favorite anime ever alongside Bokurano which also has a slow beginning. The thing is, even those anime had enough promise to keep me watching the show until the kicker, when i was fully submersed. I can't say that even up to this point I am fully submersed in the show. I'd even go as far as to say that it's because of Steins;Gate that didn't get truly interesting until ep 11 that I am even giving this as much of a chance as I have (Along with the fact that once I have gotten this far into something it has to be really bad for me to not commit till the end. The only anime that bad was Star Driver but that's another review).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Once again this is a mid way review and my thoughts may change but usually the first half of the anime marks the point at which it will not get any worse and the first half of this has set the bar pretty low, so I am just eagerly awaiting. Until then, I will continue to enjoy the gorgeous soundtrack and lighthearted humor that this anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is the kind of anime that I have to force myself to review. The truth is, I like it. I really like it. That's why it has a 6 and not a lower score: because for all its flaws, it is remarkably enjoyable.\r\nBut this is a review, isn't it? I can't just harp on about how fun it is without pointing out how horrifically flawed it is. The primary issues that Robotics;Notes experiences is this:\r\na) It isn't as intelligent as it thinks it is.\r\nb) It tries to do too much.\r\nI'll begin by clarifying that second point. Picture an anime akin to The Melancholy ofHaruhi Suzumiya: a sci-fi re-imagining of a typical romantic comedy, some decent characters, good comedy and the potential for some seriousness mixed in there. Then take a show like Steins;Gate (which I have yet to watch): a hyper-intelligent sci-fi thriller with a serious tone. Robotics;Notes wants to be both of these. But the result is rather like mixing vodka and lager together: they can be pretty enjoyable on their own, but the mixing of the two just doesn't seem to work. I can't escape the thought that had the creators decided to make either a sci-fi rom-com OR a sci-fi thriller, then the result would've been fantastic. But Rob;Not tends to flicker schizophrenically between light-hearted comedy/drama and serious psychological mystery while keeping the two largely disconnected. Characters like Subaru and Junna are completely irrelevant to the thriller elements of the series, and they shouldn't have been. There's a tendency to develop a likeable character (Kona is the most notable victim of this) and then render them completely unimportant to the plot after their arc is finished. And it's a shame, 'cos Kona in particular was a very good character. If the show had chosen to be a rom-com, then Rob;Not would've been able to provide a tighter character focus without making seemingly important characters seem arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nNow to clarify point (a). The issue that Rob;Not has (which can also be seen in its sister-anime Chaos;Head) is that it just isn't as intelligent as it thinks it is. Convenience writing is not a sign of an intelligent series. But Rob;Not has a tendency of coming up with convenient plot devices (the monopoles, Kai's slow-motion ability, the links between the bad guys and an anime production company) and then establishing a weak explanation in order to make these points seem important. I'm going to have to venture into spoiler territory here, so I apologise. Why, if the villain is planning to destroy the world, does he bring attention to his plan by creating hidden files? And why can the main character conveniently locate these files? Why are the monopoles falling from the sky? What did they hope to achieve on the SS Anemone? What role does Airi play in any of it?  Rob;Not seems to be under the impression that in order to be an intelligent thriller, it has to include as much non-existent sci-fi stuff as possible, but that isn't the case. A decent twist without such obvious and poorly-justified convenience writing would've been much more intelligent, even if they'd had to ditch many of the sci-fi plot devices. There's an assortment of blatant plot holes on show with almost no justification beyond lazy writing. Everything the villain does seems to give the main character more and more power that he can use to bring an end to the evil plan. There's no realistic psychology on display.\\n\\n\r\nThinking about it, Rob:Not may have been better off as a rom-com, 'cos that seems to be what it does best. The characters are actually quite likeable at times (Kona and Airi being my personal favourites) and the show is at its best when it focuses on the relationships between them all. Despite being the primary element of the series, the thriller aspect just seems to get in the way of an enjoyable twist on school-life drama. That said, there are effective thriller moments, with the highlight being an almost disturbingly graphic death scene in episode 16 that still seemed completely unnecessary. It can be dramatic and fun, but not effectively serious, and so a lot of potential is lost.",

I would classify this anime as underrated and the reason is people who watch this anime have the same expectations as they would if watching Stein's;gate, that's the problem. Robotics;Notes is not Stein's;gate. I highly suggest watching this anime and lowering your standards just a bit and you will definitely come out pleased with the ending.\r\nNow, onward to the actualreview. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story of Robotic;Notes is very well thought while at times it may be easy to predict whats going to happen, it's very easy to enjoy watching as things slowly unfold.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 The artwork is absolutely beautiful as expected.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 The music is well placed and fits each and every scenario also the OP songs are pretty darn good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 This is where this show loses a little face. The two main characters are relatively bland. There is really no sort of character development. The main male character doesn't do anything and when he does it's not much of a surprise, he's predictable and boring. I will say this though, the side characters are interesting and are very good at getting laughs out of the viewer!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 It's a good anime if you want to take things slow the journey there is nice!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd rate this anime a solid 7.5 with a standard deviation of .5 meaning, at times it's an 8 while others a 7. I highly recommend this anime because I put it off, and I don't want another person to make the same mistake. this anime deserves to be watched.",

            "content": "Robotic;Notes the 3rd visual novel made by 5pb collaborated with Nitroplus as most people mention. Overall the anime was pretty good giving consideration to the number of episode length and amount of story line needed to be incorperated.\r\nSci-fi genre stories are almost always interesting with having a grandiose scale conflict that is built up or connected to smaller events that occur among the characters. Didn't like how each individual character conflict was so simply considered resolved especially with Subaru, practically no resolution for him. Deux ex machina was used a bit too extensively for the story, most likely due to cutting out parts of thevisual novel storyline (like in the opening you see them having fireworks at the bench but there wasn't any episode). Also the story skipped quite often from one point in the story to the next with connection to each episode, as well as some plot holes made from them. However the story was overall good, it was unique and represented 5pb & Nitroplus' theme of 1% fantasy 99% science story style. \\n\\n\r\nArt was decent, expressions, reactions etc were well made most of the time. The design of the robots were realistic in terms of the amateur physic knowledge needed to see if such robots could be made. Gunvarrel is pretty awesome looking in my opinion, its nice to have a robotic represent a hero of justice for those childhood dreams.\\n\\n\r\nSound was decent, the background music was suitable though could have been better. The opening song first and second were enjoyable, especially first one in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were nicely made, each personality was unique in some sense. Though, character development could have been done further (if more episodes were given), especially for Subaru and Daitoku. Since it feels as though you only know their problems and how they are typically, no sense of how they wanna purse the future and grow as an individual character. Furugori was well done, background story and character develop was well shown and portrayed. Akiho and Kaito were decently done, not too well done but decently enough I got no complaints except on how Kaito about Airi. Antagonists could have been better, Kou's character was little iffy because of what Airi said yet the flashback scene didn't show it well enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed the story a lot though, Furugori was interesting. The game within the story was interesting wish app store had something like that. Sci-fi was great with those phone droids the character had, concept of elephant-mouse syndrome. Though that syndrome could have been incorporated into the story better. Akiho's version only seemed problematic, Kaito's version was like a special move. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyable to watch! Though the story didn't end in the way I hoped. Wish the story had a better twist, almost thought (spoiler here) that when Misaki got out of the black/purple Sumeragi or the images people saw of the city destroyed through their phone screen that it was an alterate world, or the world acted like a mirror having 2 different possible perspective depending on which side of the world you were in? Anyway, give it a try, its worth watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was really looking forward to an anime adaptation of Robotics;Notes, the third visual novel written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi for the collaboration of 5pb. and Nitroplus, because previous two series came from it were really neat with Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd being a rather promising start and Steins;Gate being just stellar. So no wonder I have a lot of things to tell now.\r\nRobotics;Notes begins with our protagonists, Yashio Kaito and Senomiya Akiho, the only members of school\u2019s robotics club, trying to save the said club from shutting down. And that\u2019s a huge step down from Steins;Gate in terms of a story. I mean, Steins;Gate had university students asmain characters who invent and mess up with crazy gadgets, and all Robotics;Notes has to offer is yet another clich\u00e9d story about saving a school club. Ouch. But to be fair, one can still pull out a good plot from that, and Robotics;Notes has an interesting start despite me being biased against its premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series starts off with Yashio and Senomiya entering some sort of Japanese Robot Wars tournament. It\u2019s a great hook for the series and it made me change my initial opinion of the show. I\u2019m pretty sure that the idea of crushing and smashing enemy robots with your own one is appealing to every geek, who is interested in technology. We are all children when it comes to this. If you liked playing around with screwdrivers and other instruments, disassembling stuff and building simple mechanisms when you were small, then you understand the overall feeling that Robotics;Notes is trying to show you \u2014 the technology is awesome, and through it you can make miracles come true like a bloody mage.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Robotics;Notes serves mainly as an introduction of the characters, just like in Steins;Gate.\\n\r\nYashio is a good male protagonist to me. He has a lazy attitude but essentially is a nice and caring fellow who just doesn\u2019t want to show it off. Sometimes he lacks character because of that but I think that\u2019s fine in general.\\n\r\nSenomiya Akiho is a cheerful, merry girl. She is really important for this story because she is the key to the mood Robotics;Notes is trying to pull you in. Senomiya absolutely loves robots and never stops talking about how classy they are. Actually, it\u2019s a double-edged sword, because, depending on a viewer, she can either be irritating or having a certain appeal to her.\\n\r\nOf all other characters I want to mention Furug\u014dri Kona, resident computer fairy. I mentioned in my Steins;Gate review that I liked how Hashida Itaru was a pretty nice depiction of a geek. Furug\u014dri is exact opposite, a walking stereotype: a shut-in, a fujoshi and speaks in slang full of memes. The thing is, she is probably my favourite character here, maybe because of her over-the-top behaviour and facial expressions or maybe because she has a certain drama to herself. Nevertheless, I think Furug\u014dri\u2019s antics are the funniest part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah\u2026 Enough praising here. You\u2019ve probably seen my rating and are now wondering why it is so low after all I said. Well, both Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes have a good first half, but while Steins;Gate in its second half becomes one of the best anime series I\u2019ve ever seen, Robotics;Notes follows the wrong way and starts to fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot becomes bloody nonsensical. A lot of threads are left forgotten and unresolved, and I think that I should put part of the blame for this on the blokes who wrote script for the series because it feels like they did a bad job in condensing several routes of the visual novel into one big story. But there are things I can\u2019t see any excuse for. Some events of the past that the characters constantly mentioned in a vague way are never fully explained. What a tease. Other big events happened during the course of the series just don\u2019t get enough attention in my eyes. Major things going in Tokyo? Yep, it looks totally important because all description I get is about thirty seconds of footage and a couple of posts in bland name Twitter. The world is in turmoil? Casually mentioned in the news and that\u2019s it. I just can\u2019t sense the scale they want me to feel. It\u2019s like spending all day wasting time in your house, watching the telly and so on, and then some fellow suddenly shows up and tells you that boom, you saved the world by doing nothing. That is wonderful but just doesn\u2019t feel like a major accomplishment, does it?\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters lost their appeal to me in the second half because they just stopped being relevant to the main plot. It\u2019s just like they are written in for the sake of one single scene or for the pure purpose of exposition. The antagonist is also meh because he lacks any motivation or traits that could have made him a memorable villain. Just what is he going to do after he succeeds? Why is his plan so overly complex and relying heavily on rather small and obscure details? I guess I\u2019ll never know.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing. As I mentioned before, what defined Robotics;Notes and made it likeable to me in the first place is the sense of awe it gave to technology and constructing stuff. I loved that message, but then the creators completely screwed it up with inconsistency and technobabble. Sure, there is a lot of technobabble in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd and in Steins;Gate, but at least it is believable to some extent. And here we have magnetic monopoles \u2014 red glowing thingies that just fall from the sky for unexplained reason. There is a friendly neighbourhood PhD in physics, whom I went to the same school with. When I told her about this concept, well\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget those cold eyes of a person with murderous intent so strong it can make you die of fear. No, seriously, you cannot write a love letter to science with plot devices like monopoles that come out from bloody nowhere. It sort of undermines the whole message that technology can make miracles in good hands and save the world in hopeless situations because it turns out that to create technology you need a really miraculous event to happen first. Ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes is major disappointment for me. Akin to Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd and Steins;Gate, it was rather promising in the beginning, with Robot Wars, urban legends and augmented reality quest bits, but unlike those two, its story had too much build-up leading out to literally nothing, so it just collapsed by its own weight.",

            "content": "my main impression:  whoever came up with the original concept as well as the script writers for this anime need a really good editor, who can wrangle their ideas into something that actually hangs together structurally and makes sense.  because there were plenty of ideas here, quite possibly too many, and the result is a hodgepodge of giant plot holes held together by spit and enthusiasm.\r\ni can't remember the last time i watched an anime that was so meticulously produced, so overall pretty, so well animated and orchestrated, and found it such an unholy mess on the inside, which ultimately left me unfulfilled.\r\nstory:there are two main stories here; one consists of a high school's robotics club trying to put together a giant robot, the other is pretty much at the other end of the spectrum: saving the world from mysterious villainy.  the first part is decently executed (love the battle bots!), but it soon takes a back seat to the second one, which is sadly not executed well at all.  i liked the twist, which i did not see coming, but i didn't like the hurried exposition explaining it all.  the pacing of this story is all over the map; IMO 22 episodes are enough time to handle it much better. \\n\\n\r\nanimation/art: production IG, need i say more?  it's beautiful.  so much detail, and characters even change their clothes and hair styles several times!  backgrounds showcase tanegashima (an island off the south coast of kyuushuu), where japan's actual space facilities are located -- i want to go!.  smooth animation, good cinematography.  i have no complaints here; it is a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nsound: my reviews tend to lack good notes on sound because, while i know good music when i hear it, i don't have a knowledgeable vocabulary to convey its nuances.  i like the BGM here, i also like the OP and ED songs (i'm becoming a fan of itou kanako; a strong, non-cutesy female voice). the voice talent is decent -- shinichiro miki is wasted as sawada, morikawa toshiyuki does a fair but kinda bland job voicing kimijima (for which he probably should not be blamed), and nazuka kaori steals the show with her interpretation of fraukoujiro.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters:  great visual design, sub-par personalities.\\n\r\n1. senomiya akiho, super-enthusiastic president of the robotics club with a serious inferiority complex about her older sister misaki who first had the idea of building a giant robot for the famous anime \"gunvarrel\" 9 years ago.\\n\r\n2. yashio kaito, whose sole interest at the start is playing a giant-robot battle game, at which he excels.  otherwise he doesn't seem to care about anything, doesn't want to do anything, and basically just lays around, only moving when aki drags him around.\\n\r\n3. daitoku junna, a moe blob with a fear of robots (she has reason).\\n\r\n4. hidaka subaru, megane guy with delusions of bishounen/liberace grandeur, heavily into robots, serious to a fault\\n\r\n5. fraukoujiro / furugoori kano, shut-in, geek, gamer, genius programmer, fujoshi, equal-opportunity lecher\\n\r\n6. yukifune airi, AI interface\\n\\n\r\nthat doesn't sound so bad, you say?  well, it's not bad bad, but it's just... there isn't enough character development here.  we get a bare bones skeleton for most of them, and while we might find out a secret or two, we don't really get to know these people, and they feel almost generic (except that their character design is very good).  except furugoori, who is quite a unique character, albeit bordering on caricature.\\n\\n\r\naki and kaito both drive the show; everybody else feels like an extra.  aki bulldozes ahead on the robot-building side, while kaito investigates the odd occurrences that start with an alleged ghost.  he becomes a little more interesting as time goes on, but i had a hard time warming up to him because he is just not innately curious (unlike me, *wry grin*), and keeps dragging his feet, almost lackadaisically stumbling across serious secrets, and showing little intellectual curiosity.  he frustrated me a lot until fairly late in the anime when he grows a pair.  his saving grace all along is that he does care about those he considers his friends, and he will act to help them, often quietly behind the scenes.  i am happy to say what little romance this anime involves is actually well done, no typical stupidity involved.\\n\\n\r\ni can't talk about the villain(s) without spoilering, but that's probably my biggest disappointment -- we get no good villain.  there is no proper motivation for the villainous intent, and frankly, most fights between good and evil just bore me; i prefer conflict between good-yet-flawed characters, dilemmas that make me think.  don't get that here.  oh, and i could have done without the parrot ex machina intervention at the convenient moment; i actually laughed -- not what i should feel moved to do in a life-or-death situation\\n\\n\r\nso where the heck did the monopoles come from?  is that ever explained and i just missed it?\\n\\n\r\nin short, i enjoyed watching it, but the pay-off didn't materialize, and the 7 is primarily there because the production is so good, and i average all values to get my overall score.  i don't think that i would recommend it to my friends.",

            "content": "I want to note this is my first review. I was 11 episodes within the series when I had written this review. Please keep in mind I was hyped from some important climatic events. Seeing this series with only two reviews at the time (poor and shrewd); I decided to step up. This is also spoiler free until noted.\r\nStory & Plot:\r\nRobotics;Notes has slice of life related elements while maintaining a hint of supernatural. As the story progresses, the story unfolds of how Earth will face it's doom and our little high school club may be the only ones that can actually do anything about it.It compares to Steins;Gate, which had a slow paced story with major impact during later episodes. Everything slowly unravels for a sickeningly twisted plot of how everyone and everything is connected. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe show features a very diverse set of characters. Our main heroin female is spunky and full of dreams and our protagonist is a laid back gamer. As our two main characters set off to save their club from disbandment it begins to introduce the set cast and how everyone plays a dire role. From the quirky moe internet junky to our shy, full of impact karate impressionist, the Robotics Club is balanced in every which way. Robotics;Notes leads on to a huge set of character based comedy where the more you like the character the funnier their actions are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork & Animation:\\n\r\nThe shadings for the environment look stunning as an overall piece while the mecha blend perfectly into each scene. Unlike most CGI looking clockworks we're deceived by today, Robotics;Note doesn't leave anything for imagination in this category (all in good retrospect). Character design comes at a stand point of an acceptable, but typical anime character. However character detail shines unprecedented. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Opening/Ending\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes background music always fits perfectly as something unique for what's happening at that point. Whether they're discussing something serious or posing the lighter side in semantics, the music is latent enough to pull you into the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening, it's uplifting. It features the cast starting a new day alongside the Robotics Club. The ending focuses on a cute patsy character that might make a good selling point. The music itself is an upbeat tune following the character taking on the world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes stands out for me simply based off story progression. Even though we begin with this slice of life \"can we build it story?\" it evolves into \"what's going on and is this true?\" To better understand, if you've seen shows like Mawaru Penguindrum or Durarara!! you're stuck in a world where nothing makes sense until you're nearly done with the series. When they reveal certain aspects of the series' universe you just want to see what happens next, and how they pull through. Robotics;Notes delivers to keep you interested in the same manner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be Expected (my rendition of harmless spoilers):\\n\r\n- Priority Numero Uno! There aren't any large breasted females; it's not unorthodox in character design. \\n\r\n- There are mecha fight scenes.\\n\r\n- Various character based comedy.\\n\r\n- Light physical powers, persay.\\n\r\n- Unraveling the future of Earth fighting against an evil company.\\n\r\n- Next generation technology.",

            "content": "Okay, so Robotics;Notes. I admit it. I am a big fan of Nitrosplus and their works. Hell, remember Steins;Gate? That scientific thriller was one hell of a ride. When I heard that they were going to do another anime adaptation of the science fiction genre, I was very excited. No, I was ecstatic. However, after completing this series, it left me nothing of what I originally had hoped for. Don't get me wrong. I don't like comparing other works from the same company much especially since neither has close resemblance. However, the experience that came out of this series was worlds apart.\r\nNow, regarding technology...\r\nThe worldof technology can do wonders. In today's world, technology has provided us with so many new innovations for our common lives. In fact, without technology, our lives would not be the same as many of us know as of today. Perhaps one of the most interesting technology we may be curious about is the idea of robotics. Yes, robots! It's a mechanical unit with artificial intelligence that is programmed by a computer system that can make our lives much easier. It is automatic. It is useful. It is futuristic. Who knows? In maybe about ten, twenty, or thirty years, our world may never ever be the same again. If there's one change though, robots might be a word that would come to most people's minds. Evolution is inevitable and technology evolves every day.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Robotics;Notes, robots has become a fascinating phenomenon. By its tagline, \u201cWhat would happen if you really tried to make a giant robot?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes is an anime series with production handled by Production I.G that began airing on noitaminA (Animation written backwords) during the Fall of 2012. The series is based off of a Japanese visual novel developed by 5pb who are known for their previous science fiction works such as Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. The series takes place in 2019 on a southern island known as Tanegashima in Japan. In a futuristic world, technology has evolved and people have become interested in robots. One such group of people known as the Robot Research Club is keen on unlocking its secrets, exploring the ideas of robotics, and make the most of it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the series is a standalone anime. It is NOT a prequel or sequel of any of Nitroplus' other works. Despite being in the mainstream and having highly successful ratings, Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes has little similarity beyond one or the other with the exception of a cameo character and some references. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the series takes place at Chuuoutanegashima High School. (how the hell do you even pronounce that?) It is here where the Robot Research Club do their daily activities. Unfortunately though, the club does seem to suffer a bit of...uh, population in terms of membership. As a matter of fact, its status is weak and it's up to its two members  (Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio) to save it. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first half of the series, Robotics;Notes gives off a slice-of-life feeling where the atmosphere is very lighthearted, casual, and occasionally can cause some snoozing reactions. Luckily, we have Akiho and Kaito to maybe wipe out some of those boredom. For one thing, I found these two protagonists very likeable to watch especially in regards to their interactions and dialogues. Their personalities doesn't seem to match well though. On the surface, Akiho seems to be a very enthusiastic girl who wants to explores ideas (namely robotics for the club). Her goal is to make a giant robot for the world to see and hoping that dream will become a reality. She also seems to be a big fan of GUNVARREL, and surprise surprise, that's about robotics as well. On the other hand, there's Kaito. Unlike Akiho, he only seems to be interested in spending his days playing games, namely the fighting game Kill-Ballad. He is unenthusiastic but continues to stand by Akiho's side for a specific reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe club only has two members from the beginning. It's hard to make the most of it for the duo especially if they want to convince others to join their club. For that, they must earn other students' respect, support, and rights. Perhaps the best way to accomplish this task is to make a name for themselves at school. And hey, what better way to do it than making a giant robot?! \\n\\n\r\nThe way these two start off from the beginning is a bit frustrating to watch. Their lack of progress puts Akiho on stress especially with their club in danger of being closed. Trust me though, I want them to succeed. But that's a lot easier said than done because not only does the club seems to lack members, but also funding as well. There does seem to be opportunities presented that could help with that but one must win the rights for it. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of opportunities, by the first few episodes, viewers might be turned off with its themes and the presentation. In fact, this series can even be labeled as slice-of-life at many occasions by the way it seems to progress its episodes. It's no surprise though as Nitroplus' other works tend to follow a similar trending; shows starts off slow, gets intense, and concludes with a definite finish.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, that intensity and progression gets under way later on. Like an invention, the series progresses itself through its themes such as actual robot combat and later on, even conspiracy from the government. It also gets more emotional as well especially regarding Subaru (another student at the school) and his father. Furthermore, there is a lot of mysteries developing seemingly behind the scenes. For one thing, Kaito seems to have discovered something out of this world in the form of a young girl trapped in his game tablet. It opens up a strange boundary towards the mystery field as viewers may want to know who she is, what's she's there for, and why she is there in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series itself does drag quite a bit. Even I found it boring at many circumstances. Robotics;Notes just seems to drag itself way too slow with its slice-of-life feeling. As a matter of fact, each episode seems off balance. The \u201clet's build a robot to make our names known to the world\u201d genre has becomes stale after so many episodes. Furthermore, the mechanics behind the construction of the robot is almost nonexistent or mentioned very briefly in one of the beginning episodes. The series' all so likeable duo also becomes a bit repetitive to watch as there seems to be little to no development between Akiko and Kaito. As a matter of fact, the duo continues live on their daily lives as if there's almost nothing going on and about. Their relationship remains intact but we want to see more than that. We want to seem the two succeed and accomplish what their goal \u2013 building that robot of their dreams and showing it to the world to make a name of themselves. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen or at least far too slow in progress. Well, I guess the ending of this little duo was cute. But marvelous? Hell no. Finally, I would say that although R;N makes a way of seemingly foreshadowing events, it is stale. At the very least, it didn't give me that thriller like feeling. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the theme of robots and technology remains intact. To add to this package, there is also a very peculiar girl who speaks and acts like a otaku of the modern days. Her name is Frau (real name is  Kona Furug\u014dri) and she's one girl with a genius mind. Behind that head of hers though lies a somewhat tragic past especially related to her parents. Furthermore, her character develops a bit and becomes one of the pivotal moments during the latter half of the series after an unprecedented event. With the help of her new friend, she finds hope in this world of technology. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hope, there seems to be more of that later on for the Robotics Club as well! \\n\\n\r\nThe club recruits some new members and gets their interests through. In fact, even Kaito becomes interested in some of the phenomenon going around especially regarding one of the mysterious factors he discovers on his game tablet as mentioned earlier. Because the series has 5bp and Nitroplus involved, expect some correlations. In fact, a cameo from its highly successful anime series Steins;Gate makes their debut later on as well as various references. It's science all over again! Duhuhu\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Robotics;Notes only maintains an average stance of artwork. The school has its posture that looks like an average looking school rather than some viewers may originally expected; a possibly advanced academy with super technology. No, it's just a normal school with normal people. Ichirou Tatsuta handles the art direction who is known for his work in other titles such as Ghost Hound,  Shiki, and Usagi Drop. The characters themselves also look mostly normal and to themselves (with a little peculiarity added to Frau). Chikashi Kubota (Anohana, Shinsekai Yori, Corpse Princess) is responsible for the characters' animation designs. He gives most of the series' characters a soft touch of lightheartedness rather than making them stand out too much. Most of them gives off that natural look with some technical attributes here and there such as Airi. Ah, that cute little thing..\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of the series stands slightly above mediocre. The OP song, Junjou Spectra by Zwei, for the first half is very catchy with its montage of characters as well as some of the technology dealing with robotics. The second OP song drops the ball a bit but still gives off that technical outlook. The overall OST of the series is lighthearted with some emotional melodies played during some of the more melancholic scenes. It's hard to take it serious at many variances because the series feels like a slice of life with everything moving slowly. The soundtrack has that slow feeling as well. It's boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, enjoying Robotics Notes for me was hard. The series starts off slow and has that slice of life feeling. That feeling follows throughout the series despite some of the intertwined arcs presented such as conspiracy, robot building, and the mysterious girl in the game tablet. The duo of Kaito and Aki are fun to watch at first but it might be hard to take it too well after so their ever-so-slow development. In fact, there is hardly much at all despite them being the main stars of the show. Their personality collides often and makes it seem strange to watch them interact at times. Luckily, robots exist in the show that gives the title its meaning. Technology plays roles too especially with the mind of a young genius girl. There is also minimal fan service that gives the series a more innocent outlook on the futuristic world as opposed to a dark dystopian setting five or ten years from our time. Ultimately though, R;N stands only barely at a '6' for me. If it wasn't for a certain cool 2D girl with her cool pixel hair style, I probably would of snoozed through this. Duhuhuhu...\\n\\n\r\nNow I do have to wonder though, what would you do if you had a giant robot?",

            "content": "A short warning: This is kind of long and I'm a bit of a potty-mouth (I tried to take the cursing out, but some might still be in there). Also, please leave some feedback, especially if you don't like the review. All criticism is appreciated.\r\nThe setting is basically this: The Robotics Club at Central Tanegashima High School want to build a huge mecha, and the series follows its members in their struggles with funding and other stuff. Pretty basic. Obviously there's more under the surface than the characters just going at it with spanners, including a mystery slowly being revealed about a conspiracy that wouldseverely endanger a sweeping majority of the people on Earth. It's pretty far-fetched and we're never given a proper explanation why the plan is in motion any way. The series is very episodic and each episode usually focuses on one of the side characters and how Kaito fits in and helps them.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with some negativity, my main gripe with the series, is that it feels so very standard. Generic is another word I could use, but it feels too negative. Robotics;Notes takes what you find in most series nowadays: A cast of rather quirky characters that compliment each-other's quirk/weirdness and go with it. It embraces the stereotypic tropes usually associated with anime and doesn't shy away from using them.\\n\\n\r\nA positive to be found is that the animation is of very good quality. It's not Makoto Shinkai level of quality, but not much out there is. I'm far from an artist myself, so that's about all I'll say about it. One of the few good things with the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting, it's  mostly solid. Fukuda Nobuaki stands out as \"Doc\" in an emotional episode at about the middle of the series. Most others are good, but not outstanding. Part of the soundtrack stand out, but others are pretty run-of-the-mill pieces. Sound department ends up being a little above average, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nTo the characters: \\n\r\nAkiho (the female protagonist) is super energetic and ambitious, while Kaito (male protagonist) is when the series begins depicted as a sloth and generally disinterested in doing anything but playing Kill-Ballad (an on-line fighting game with mechas) which he apparently is one of the top people in the world at. As the series goes forward, Kaito's character is all over the place. Junna is what I like to put in the category of \"moe-blob. Basically, she's a throwaway character that's in the series to be cute and once or twice pop into the main plot-line for an episode or two. Contrasting her is Subaru, ambitious and helpful dude, who was told by his father to stop building, and competing with, robots. Then there's Kona, the epitome of stereotypic nerds in Japanese culture; She's a shut-in; almost entirely communicates in memes; is incredibly perverted and is generally pictured as a bit of a nut-case. That said, she does have a back-story that ties into the main story which is intriguing for the peculiarly short time it's given to develop. There's also the obligatory crazy director guy who's completely obsessed with boobs, and has a parrot that's trained (or is just damaged for being around him too long) to chant along in his craving for beholding boobs, as well as the oddball teacher who seems to be the most stupid and unreliable person on earth, but ends up being a person you should count on. You know you've seen these character types before if you've watched more than a couple anime.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem the series has initially, is the fact that it takes a long time to get going. It starts with an in medias res scene, with the group starting up a big mecha and getting it started. After that we're showed the lives and struggles of Akiho and Kaito in their strife to get the robot working. They get some more members shortly, but the two are unquestionably the main characters. So, basically, the first episodes are for introducing the characters and the basic plot, which is usually fine. The problem is that the main characters aren't really that interesting, and neither is the main story to begin with. Viewers who stick around will have a passable series to watch, but there's not a whole lot keeping you in attached to the show or its characters. Let's see why:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, with focus on the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nKaito - the series main protagonist, mind you- is an extremely bland and terribly boring character. He rarely shows interest in doing anything at all and seems to be sticking around \"just because\". In the beginning, coming off as eternally sceptical and non-committal, though at times showing intense caring and emotion, Kaito is a character that's all over the place, everything at once. It's not that he breaks out of his usual behaviour once or twice, it's that he doesn't have a starting point. Which is something you can say about the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nAkiho - sharing main protagonist duties with Kaito - is a very energetic character who strongly believes in herself and her vision of building the robot her sister started building years previously. I can see her being a character that splits the audience, like a Haruhi. Infectious and happy-go-lucky personality that can alienate some viewers and enamour others.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring problem with the side-characters is that they're used mainly as plot devices. Characters pop in and out of relevance when it's convenient to the story, and few are consistent throughout the series. So, even when there are scenes that are supposed to evoke emotional responses, we as viewers haven't been given enough to care about the characters and their fates. Every scene should get some sort of reaction or give you something as a viewer. Tons of scenes and some episodes could and should have been cut out to give the viewer more information and background.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, which takes the back seat to introducing the characters. The mecha launching stuff in the opening moments of the show is a set-up for other things to happen in the second half of the series and the main story takes a few episodes to even enter the series. The story is told very episodically, in fragments between the episode-long character arcs, where you get more information about the characters and at times ending that characters arc entirely. Like seriously, what ever happened to Subaru's dad going at him for still being into robots? Did he just chill out after Subaru picked one apart in front of him? It was never very clear in the series, or at least not given enough time to appreciate what the arc ultimately did for the character (nothing at all).\\n\\n\r\nIt does pick up a considerable amount later, with some emotional episodes and big events and twists. The middle part of the series is easily its best. Though, with the characters being horribly, infuriatingly uneven, it's hard to fully enjoy the series. Also, some scenes are so ridiculously improbable and out of the blue that any seriousness it's trying to get across gets lost.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've been ragging on it a lot, but honestly, Robotics;Notes is an enjoyable show at times. It's passable as a watch, but if I were to decide on it being good or bad, I have to go with bad. With the story presented, the show has the potential to be a great show, but there are like six episodes dedicated to the story when the disappointing endgame rolls in, filled with deus ex machinas.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise: The series does a poor job at getting the attention and sympathies of it's viewers to begin with and the pacing is way off from where it should be to tell a story that you, as a viewer, should become invested in. Main characters aren't able to carry the show on their own, and as a result the show is pretty flat in the end. It's almost fun how much we're meant to take for granted without any explanation at all. As such, it fails in doing what any series striving to be considered a serious work should do: Make the viewer care. It certainly has some sweet feel-good moments, but they hardly weigh up the series' shortcomings. It's a good try, but in the end it fails more than it succeeds. It falls short of the line between good and bad, and as such, I won't recommend this series to anyone. Maybe I would recommend an aspiring storyteller to watch it, just to know what pits in writing and storytelling to avoid, and that's certainly not something you would want written on the back of the DVD-case.",

            "content": "I went into watching this having already watched Steins;Gate. An anime which I thought was excellent. So I was expecting to have an interesting story with strong and engaging characters at the very least. And despite a few people making their complaints about Robotics;Notes I found it to have all these factors. \r\nThe basic story whilst a little far fetched is indeed interesting. A School Club attempting to build a giant Mecha. Saying it like that it even sounds downright cheesy. But this plays to Robotics;Notes' strengths I felt. Whilst the story is a little out there, 5pb has done a wonderful job of makingit seem perfectly pheasable. I also went in expecting it to be a little more light in comparison to Steins;Gate. Whilst it was a little less heavy at the beginning as you continue after the first three or four episodes it starts to get a lot darker and downright creepy at points. Whenever \"Kagome Kagome\" started playing I got chills down my spine. From a story standpoint I'm willing to say it stands on par with Steins;Gate. Whilst not as compelling as Time Travel, the more you watch it the more you'll come to love it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also well defined and are strong. They also suffer a little from the whole \"clich\u00e8\" thingy a tad. But I found them to be completely compelling and diverse at the same time somehow. It's something that's hard to explain. Just watch. \\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes will not appeal to everybody. But I'll go out on a limb here and say that if you enjoyed Steins;Gate you're going to enjoy this. From what I've seen so far it hasn't yet reached the lofty heights of S;G but its a worthy successor and well worth a watch even if you haven't seen Steins;Gate or Chaos;Head. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth a look at the very least!\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After completing the series I must say that I was quite disappointed, and I would like to rescind some of my comments comparing it to S;G.",

            "content": "Robotics notes is surprisingly good anime, my expectations were pretty low but it actually end up being better than Steins;Gate, going beyond its epicness, especially in terms of characters. Also, the animation is pretty cool.\r\n- no one ever\r\nThe anime is about some guy and some girl who both have some weirdass diseases which are exactly opposite from each others. Elephants, mice and such, literally and apparently but no one honestly knows. There is also some dead sister who is alive, she is also the evilest thing ever except she is actually a good one, at this point I also assume that she is no one'ssister. Someone could say the series is constantly trolling viewers with such a witty writing. Someone could say cat pictures are epic. Who knows. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is some random amount of female characters who have nothing to do with anything but all good series need a harem and one of the girls is voiced by Rie Kugumiya so it's okay. The lads in this series aren't strapping, they are either princes of bishonen or otherwise pretty boys. It's similar to this ginga bishonen thingy from Star Driver, all that galactic prettiness. I assume not everyone knows about it so here is the sum up,\\n\\n\r\nListen, bishonen is never straight but this time it was pretty fucking gay. \\n\r\n- that one guy from the internet \\n\\n\r\nI would talk about their personalities, but wearing glasses randomly and awkwardly for a comedic purposes doesn't really... it's probably some Japanese thing, supposedly hilarious but it's funny only at 4 am when you haven't slept for a week.\\n\\n\r\nWe have fighting tournaments with robots, school club and other original things like mortal peril and such. It's okay, only all anime ever resolves around clubs but who cares, how can you even do a series without a fucking manly badass club? Exactly, totally fucking impossible. We need school and we need clubs. It's a message from Japan, go to school and study because you can't do shit without school, you can't even write a fucking robot fight without school. It's hard, anime and clubs are constantly criticized for cliches, it's hard, no one understand, it's hard, no one wants to understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe only genre tagged is sci fi and that's about all there is to tell because by far nothing much has happened. But lets not judge yet, I mean only 11 episodes are out!!11!! It's not like that amount epicness can bloom with just an 11 episodes, no no, we just have to wait and see. Was S;G so good from the start? No it was not, don't be stupid people, hold your wannabe elitism and stop being haters. You are not professional critics so do not criticize this. It's okay to praise the shit out of this at this point already, though.\\n\\n\r\nR;N is an anime where pacing is not even a word and depth is just another synonym for penetration.\\n\r\n- some pseudo-funny guy from an e-pen gathering\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this, it is just so very bland and not worth of caring about.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is the 2012 anime adaptation addition to the Science Adventure series, which so far consists of three different series which are all connected by alternative settings: Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate and lastly Robotics;Notes.\r\nMade originally by 5pb while the previous series C;H and S;G were a collaboration of both 5pb and Nitroplus, the anime showed much promise to be an engrossing Sci-fi tale about ipad-like devices named Poke-Coms, mecha and robots all in a near future school setting.\r\nTo tell you the truth, for some time after the Visual Novel was announced it was one of top highly anticipated visual novels, and when the anime announcement came beforethe visual novel was even out I was ecstatic. I thought just like the case of Steins;Gate, that we will need to wait a couple of years after the visual novel was out to get the anime adaptation, and in the case of Chaos;Head the anime adaptation came a few months after the visual novel was out. In the case of Robotics;Notes, it was the same, only that the anime was announced before the visual novel was released. \\n\\n\r\nSo, hearing the news about the Robotics;Notes adaptation made me really happy inside. I anticipated the series greatly and hyped in massively in my mind, mainly because of the highly successful and critical acclaimed previous series in the Science Adventure franchise, Steins;Gate. I was certain that after the mistake that was the Chaos;Head anime adaptation we'll get another great adaptation. Steins;Gate was made by White Fox, an unknown studio at the time that quickly gained popularity from the few anime it released. Robotics;Notes however, is made by Production I.G, A respectable studio who is responsible for many good anime adaptations. Chaos;Head was made by Madhouse Studios, another respectable studio, but, butchered the anime adaptation of C;H to bits for some reason. So unlike the case of Chaos;Head, and like the case of Steins;Gate, I was certain we'll get another great anime adaptation, Robotics;Notes.\\n\\n\r\nQ:Was I disappointed?\\n\\n\r\nA:Yes. greatly.\\n\\n\r\nQ:Was the studio responsible for my disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nA:No.\\n\\n\r\nQ:So... what is responsible for my disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nA:Clearly. The source material.\\n\\n\r\nIn the next paragraphs I'll explain exactly what disappointed me about Robotics;Notes. \\n\r\nRead on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe story of Robotics;Notes in the beginning was slow, yet showed much promise. Characters were introduced slowly one by one, and it seemed we have a winning adaptation again, just like Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut...\\n\\n\r\nThat is what was the problem.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes tries to be just like Steins;Gate, but fails in the process.\\n\\n\r\nSub paragraph-Gameplay of the science adventure series:\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel of Chaos;Head came before Steins;Gate, and had the delusional trigger system, which the main character in it, Takumi, triggered delusions in it that can affect the ending the reader can get.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel of Steins;Gate came out a few years prior to Robotics;Notes. This Science Adventure visual novel had the phone trigger system, which the story changed significantly according to some important text messages the reader chooses to send, something like a choice system like in most visual novels, only much cooler.\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes developers boasted: 'Those who enjoyed our previous visual novels in the franchise will not be disappointed'. The developers clearly tried making another Steins;Gate, so instead of cell phones, we got Poke-Coms, and with them the reader triggered everything with the Poke-com Trigger, which like Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head, affects the story significantly and decides what ending you'll get.\\n\\n\r\nSo making a system much more similar to Steins;Gate and less to Chaos;Head, is  what I call riding the success of their previous series, which was critically acclaimed.\\n\\n\r\nBut... it wasn't.. Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nStory-Continuation:\\n\r\nMuch like Steins;Gate, the story of Robotics;Notes revolves about conspiracies and in the end about saving the world, but instead of time travel and world line shifting, we get robots to aid out heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts when the MC, Yashio Kaito and main heroine, Senomiya Akiho try to reform a dead robotics club by recruiting more members. Each episode in the beginning introduces characters one by one, Hidaka Subaru, Furugoori Kona, The Karate girl I can't let myself bother remembering her name etc. The story starts so slow... that it feels like nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nLet me break in down for you guys:\\n\\n\r\nFirst episodes: Nothing happened.\\n\r\nMiddle episodes: Nothing happened while the writers tried miserably to write some happenings in the story but failed.\\n\r\nLast episodes: Still nothing happened, while the writers tried to write some happenings in the story, but again, failed.\\n\\n\r\nRobots, grandpas, monopoles, conspiracies, Mr. Pleiades, Robo-One, Death of a minor character, 'The isn't the gunvarrel I know', Furugoori scenes, conspiraces, AI's and much more etc etc, sounds like a story with major happenings?\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, they feel so minor like the story stayed stuck in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one character in the series like to say 'IMPACTO', that is exactly what the story of Robotics;Notes lacked.\\n\\n\r\n'IMPACTO'.\\n\\n\r\nNo Impact. Nothing. When I watched the series I asked myself, 'When will the story start'? Well... it simply didn't even feel like it started.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarities to Steins;Gate-Story:\\n\r\nConspiracies, the committee of 300, sudden romance in the end, sci fi, devices  with communication ability , saving the world, death of a character, circle of friends, tsunderes (Kurisu and Subaru, the male tsundere of the series), a female Daru Furugoori, few character makes minor appearances like a grown up nae and even a certain super hacker etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory-Conclusion:\\n\r\nRiding on the success of a successful series like Steins;Gate doesn't make Robotics;Notes successful too. On the other hand, it makes it much inferior.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give the story a 6, the lowest score I give to anything, because for me it was the weakest point of Robotics;Notes. The writing was mediocre, simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAnimation looked fine, but it had QUALITY FACES EVERYWHERE. While the art in the beginning of the series was solid, then the QUALITY kicked in. Many faces were drawn awkwardly, even cheaply. While it was also the case with the Steins;Gate anime adaptation, Steins;Gate had scenes with massive detail in them. Robotics;Notes had none.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe theme songs were extremely catchy. Some are rockish, some are poppish. Unlike previous Science Adventure series, the opening wasn't sung by Itou Kanako, But by Zwei and Haruki. However, the second ending was sung by her.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was on par of every other professional anime, but because of the faulty story, it didn't reach to its true potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nYashio Kaito -  the main character. No Okabe by anime means, not even Takumi. He's just a normalfag who likes fighting games, that's all. \\n\\n\r\nSenomiya Akiho - 2genki4me, though her blushing scenes made my nutbladder go wild.\\n\\n\r\nHidaka Subaru - The tsundere of the series. Yes, he's a male. A male tsundere. He also has his alternative persona, Mr. Pleiades.\\n\\n\r\nFurugoori Kona - Daru? Yes, only female. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nAiri  - A-I that is voiced by Kugyuu. She's in most of the series, just.. useless. Later she developed more, but in the end, she was still useless.\\n\\n\r\nKarate Girl - What was her name again? Ju-- I can't remember. I watched 22 episodes and I can't even remember.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters: useless most of time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5\\n\r\nWhile I found the story to be the weakest, at the beginning the anime was somewhat enjoyable, hence an addition of 0.5 to the final score.\\n\r\nMost of the time though, I didn't really enjoy myself. Polarizing to Steins;Gate, because the beginning of Steins;Gate was much less enjoyable from the latter episodes where shit got realer than fuck and the anime was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nMy rating scale goes like this - 10 the highest score, 6 the lowest. If I give an anime a 7, it means I was severely disappointed by it. By any means, this is no Steins;Gate, even if it tries hard to even reach its toes.

            "content": "Robotics;Notes, the latest work of  Naotaka Hayashi who is also the writer for Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. If you didn't know that just by seeing the colon in each of the titles then the four lines of pointless philosophy he puts under the titles is bound to tip you off. As someone who has read both his first two works and watched the animes, I can say I have a fairly good grasp of his writing style. Don't worry about any fanboyish interfering with this review. As you can tell, I don't have a high opinion of him. \r\nRobotics;Notes is about robots...or that what it'ssupposed to be about. Wouldn't be the first of this guys works to have false advertising. The first half of the show involves Aki gathering the members of the robotics club and slice of life antics. This is a common thing in this mans works. A section of the story which is held up mostly by the characters and slice of life. It's slow and sadly unlike Steins;Gate the characters are not interesting enough to carry the show. So our only incentive to watch on deals with the mystery of Kimijima Reports. Unfortunately his mystery is slow moving and the significance of these reports only becomes apparent in the second half of the series. \\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the second half could be considered the crash and burn point. If you pay attention you begin to notice that the story in it's efforts to become more dramatic has instead become sillier. Plot holes rear their heads and you come to the conclusion that despite the impression of the first episodes, this show isn't going for something remotely realistic. We enter into a series of  character arcs which are not related to the main plot and anything that takes place here is forgotten and discarded. However when the final episodes come and our main plot returns. This is the point were the writers main weakness comes up and exposes itself. You see the writer has a problem with jumping the shark. He can create a setting with the potential to be something great but he also has the talent of reducing it to garbage if left unchecked. With Chaos;Head he turned an intriguing murder mystery into a shounen battle anime. With Steins;Gate he polluted it with developments which created plot holes. The result wasn't garbage but he was getting close by the end. (You people better be thankful to White fox for adapting the visual novel cleverly into anime and removing the flaws in the original materiel. For example, in the visual novel black holes can not only compress matter, but also data.) But Robotics;Notes takes the cake. I am sure I am not alone in saying that the revelations in those episodes were stupid beyond belief. And my friends if your sense of disbelief isn't shot to shreds, placed in a trashcan and set on fire by this point then a mind numbingly bad deus ex machina involving a parrot is sure to finish the job. In the end we are left with a barrel of plot holes, story developments which make no sense, characters we have long since stopped caring about and a ending which in one of the characters terms, lacks IMPACT0!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is to the degrees I have come to expect from Production IG lately. While not visually stunning they still are above the standards of decent animation. Sound is fairly decent with two openings of J-pop. The second one I am actually fond of. The BGM manages to highlight scenes and do it's job. Not outstanding but I can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Robotic;Notes consist of a optimistic mecha anime fan main heroine called Aki, the gamer Kai who's currently only interested in playing a robot fighting game called Kill Ballad, an overly eccentric computer genius called Frau, a virtual weather girl program called Airi, galactic bishounen wannabe straight man glasses guy and some girl who's only traits are karate and being cute...apparently. I would like to give more info on those last two but that's all I got. Many of these grow tiresome after their one note gimmick loses amusement. The saving grace is Frau. Frau is a depiction of the girl genius which isn't common and her lack of social etiquette and quirkiness make her rather lovable. It's a pity that after her episode arc she is pushed into a support role and her screen time is drastically reduced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Robotics;Notes is not something I would recommend to others. Specifically if they are looking for something on the same level as Steins;Gate, avoid it like the plague. Really it's just a good example of how going too far for dramatic effect can come back to bite you in the ass. If you plan to watch it no matter what I say I give you this piece of advice. Keep your expectations rock bottom, no matter how promising something looks.",

            "content": "The relatively shallow plot disappointed fans of Steins;Gate, but the enlarged scope of events and more action scenes pump more adrenaline. \r\nSTORY\r\nWhen compared with Steins;Gate (the main reason for this sequel's initial popularity), the plot is much shallower but instead wider. In Steins;Gate most of the struggle of Okabe is within the laboratory members and the concept of time. In Robotics;Notes the struggle is not only between Akiho and her sister, but the entire club/school plus JAXA and everyone related with Kimijima's plan. \r\nART\r\nNothing much to say, the art is good and above average, other than the awkwardly drawn characters that can be seen ina few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI enjoyed the background musics and the opening/endings, and overall do contribute to the mood and the intensity of the events occurring. However they are not particularly memorable or exceptionally good. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nWe see many sides of each and every character, something which many anime works neglect upon as they try too hard on other aspects. Senomiya Akiho is especially developed well as we get to know the things she value and her reactions to some of the things that happen to her. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI am personally a fan of conspiracy theories and related stories, so Robotics;Notes was an extremely enjoyable series for me. Other people that I know have criticized Robotics;Notes for being too unrealistic, detached, chaotic, not paced well, etc. I see where they are coming from but the intense plot (which I can't really describe in detail because of spoilers) and the climax kept me excited and wanting to watch the next episode and hence I finished the show in a day.",

            "content": "What started off being a very light-hearted anime quickly turned in an anime that sent chills down my back. I kind of just wanted to write that one sentence as my review because it is what changed my view on this anime and what made me write this review\r\nThe title of this show \u201cRobotics;Notes was quite simple to understand. The first part \u201cRobotics\u201d refers to the club that Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio are trying to keep alive the Robotics Club. The second part of the title \u201cNotes\u201d refers to the Kimishima Report and the notes that Kou Kimishima left behind, and being able tofigure out what they mean. \\n\\n\r\nThe first two people you meet are Akiho Senomiya and Kaito Yashio. Akiho has a dream, and this dream is to complete the robot Gan-tsuke that her sister Misaki started years ago at the same school. Akiho is a character that is full of life and energy, but at the same time isn\u2019t the smartest of the bunch. Kaito, her childhood friend really has no interest in the club and was just dragged along by Akiho, but what he does like is robot fighting games. Not only does he love them, he is completely absorbed/addicted to them and the only way to ask him to do favors is to beat him at the game Kill-Ballad, whom is created by Kona Furugoori. Just to put in very simple words who Kona is\u2026 she is a NEET that is really all you need to know about her for now.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, aside from being about Robots and solving mysteries, also is about friendship and bonding. Now I know tons and tons of animes are about friendship and bonding, but what is particularly special about this anime is how far they are willing to go for each other and to be able to protect this friendship that they have made.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest though, once starting this anime I was not expecting much more than a show that would bring enjoyment, and be able to laugh and maybe watch some cool fights, but this idealistic idea of mine was quickly turned astray. Even though what is happening is very unexpected, this is what makes me super stoked about watching this anime every Thursday (or Friday). On an Enjoyment based level this anime is actually amazing, there is nothing really more you can ask for, when you start watching a show having low expectations and this show completely turning around and being one of my favorite shows from last season. To put a comparison in your head this show is like watching those animes that have robot fights, and when the robots die or loose an arm blood spurts out. If you don\u2019t understand what I am trying to say it is how unexpected this anime really is.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the last thing I can talk about is the op/ed songs. I am just going to say by far the best song used in this anime is the OP (Zwei \u2013 Junjo Spectra). It really just has a nice tempo and beat to it that almost seems very fitting and suitable for this anime. It almost seems as if something amazing is going to happen right after I hear that song, which on the most part is true.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is a wee bit shorter than I expected, but honestly I am not 100% sure what more to add or write about. This show is very underrated and there really wasn\u2019t much \u201chype\u201d for when it started and came out, but I recommend you give this anime a shot, I can almost promise you won\u2019t be disappointed with the outcome.

            "content": "Robotics;Notes: Take Note, It's Highly Underrated\r\nWhen going into the fall 2012 season, I was at a loss at how underwhelming I found the anime year 2012 to be. If there were two animes I felt could possibly save it, it would be Gen Urobuchi's Psycho-Pass and Production I.G.'s other hit show, Robotics;Notes, an indirect sequel in an alternative setting to Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. Unfortunately for Robotics;Notes sake, it seems to draw comparison to Steins;Gate, a tough standard to hold an anime to considering Steins;Gate is considered one of the best animes to come out in recent history. It's also hard to compare since Steins;Gate wasproduced by White Fox and Robotics;Notes was produced by Production I.G. Still, how was Robotics;Notes as a series?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found it to be a pretty solid series in its own right. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece or a great anime, but I did find it to be very good. It had an interesting, quirky cast of characters involved in a pretty interesting mystery plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a HS Robotics Club that is struggling to keep it's club status due to only having two members. Those members are Akiho, an ambitious, fiery girl with an obsession for giant robots, Gunvarrel in particular and Kai, her childhood friend who lazily just hangs around and does nothing but play robot fighting games on his PokeCom...and the only time he'll do anything is if you beat him in a game. Akiho's goal in the Robotics Club is to build a full-scale robot modeled after the famous Gunvarrel, trying to finish a project her older sister started when she was at the school. The series takes an interesting turn into the mystery genre though when Kai discovers he can see an electronic girl through his PokeCom, as well as discovers the mysterious files of a deceased scientist named Kimijima Kou that leads into a potential cover-up of the potential world destruction. Overall, I have to say the story really surprised me and I found the mystery element to be an interesting twist on what you can already consider a school club genre. Although, I did find some weaknesses to the story, as it seemed to lack some development of the character motivations toward the end, the antagonist in particular (which I will not spoil since it is part of the series twist). I found the twists to be very good, which should be no surprise considering it's coming from a 5pb. VN adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters as a whole I found to be extremely likable and interesting. Akiho and Kai's personalities were hilarious to watch clash, but still endearing at the same time. The other members that are recruited into the Robotics Club are excellent as well. You have Subaru, a peculiar boy that has a negative attitude toward the Robotics Club at first with it mostly having to do with his hilarious alter ego and side hobby as well as his parental situation, Junna a shy girl from the karate club that strangely joins the Robotics Club even though she has no interest in robots, and one of my personal favorites...Kona. Kona is a strange, hermit of a girl that spends most of her time in front of a computer and is a bit of a game developer, however she has a strange obsession with speaking in Internet lingo. She is quite possibly one of my favorite characters in any anime just because of her quirky personality and constant Internet references and hilarious laughter. I know I caught myself saying \"Duhuhu\" every now and again. Of course, the mysterious side characters involved made for an interesting watch. Misaki, Aki's older sister seems to have a strong detachment for Aki, which leaves Kai wondering what happened to Misa for her to have such a poor attitude toward Aki. You also have Airi, the electronic girl that assists Kai in discovering the Kimijima Reports, just to name a few of the characters. Overall, the supporting cast for this series was extremely strong as it seemed each character had at least some impact on the story. It's one of the rare times I watched an anime where it seemed like there wasn't a single worthless supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the production was concerned, I thought it was okay. It probably was one of the weakest elements behind this series. There wasn't anything \"breathtaking\" about the animation, especially from a Production I.G. work. Of course, that could have something to do with Kazuya Nomura's inexperience as an anime director. His only other direction work was with the Sengoku Basara series, which is a COMPLETELY different animal than Robotics;Notes. It wasn't that the animation was bad, it just wasn't particularly great. There's nothing about it's animation style that will make me remember it by. However, I will admit the series did redeem itself with its seiyuu work and music. The seiyuu work in this series was great, and I have to applaud Kaori Nazuka (Kona), Yoshino Nanjo (Akiho), and Yoshimasa Hosoya (Subaru) in particular for their passionate performances. Even Ryouhei Kimura did a commendable job voicing Kai as well. Yuki Hayashi, Takeshi Abo, and Chiyomaru Shikura collaborated on the music and I felt they did a commendable job of setting up great tracks for creating an excellent mood for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the series weaknesses are concerned, I'll be honest. I didn't find the final episode's conclusion to be very strong. If nothing else, the ending felt somewhat rushed. On top of that, I just didn't find it to be a satisfying conclusion for an overall great cast of characters, as it is very vague in regards to what happened after the conflict had been resolved. I also found one of the major weaknesses to be that the series antagonist had a weak, or rather unexplained character motivation as to why he was acting the way he was. I don't consider it the best writing when a character close to the antagonist even says why they can't explain why they are acting the way they are. I already mentioned the animation being somewhat weak for a Production I.G. work. For a company that brought us Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Psycho-Pass, which are visually stunning as well as xxxHolic and Usagi Drop, which are artistically stunning, Robotics;Notes just seems sort of cheap and generic with its animation. Like I said, there isn't anything \"bad\" about the animation per se...it just wasn't good or memorable. I also found the pacing to be a little slow at times. It didn't quite bring things to a stand still, but I will admit the first half of the series doesn't get the ball rolling too well on it's overall story. \\n\\n\r\nAs an overall series though, Robotics;Notes is pretty good if you're looking for a club oriented anime with a pretty solid mystery element. If you go into this series expecting the next Steins;Gate, you'll be extremely disappointed as the plot isn't nearly as interesting as Steins;Gate and the animation styling isn't nearly as daring. The \"tone\" of Robotics;Notes is a lot less heavy than Steins;Gate, as you can tell from the bright and vibrant colors of it's animation in comparison to the dark contrast of Steins;Gate. I know I'm drawing a lot of Steins;Gate references, but it's hard not to since it is the adaptation of 5pb.'s 3rd installment to the Science Adventure VN series. Still, on the whole, I do consider Robotics;Notes to be one of the better animes to come out lately and if you enjoy a good mystery, I think Robotics;Notes is at least worth a watch.",

            "content": "Robotics;notes can be summed up with one word: enjoyable.  This anime certainly showed a lot of promise.\r\nThe series follows a few narrative lines which culminate toward a grand finale where all the plot points are meant to converge.  The first and primary one being a young student who is trying to keep her robot club alive and finishing her sister's unfinished dream of making a super-large sized robot from a popular - but mysteriously unfinished - anime series called Gunvarrel.\r\nWhat struck me about the series, and what is perhaps the sole element that carries this anime, is the quirky, fun and humerous characters,namely the protagonist Akiho.  Her counterpart, Yashio, counterbalances Aki's exuberant over-enthusiasm with his blase, nonchalance, making for many enjoyable interactions.  Combined with a few ultra-odd lesser characters, Robotics;notes has all the elements to go anywhere it wants.  The foundation is solid.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the structural elements of this anime let it down.  The story is convoluted, attempting to pack in many narrative plots at various levels of intensity and scope, that it can't quite fit in to the 22 episodes.  The first narrative, keeping the club alive and building the robot, is fun, light hearted and highly enjoyable.  The larger narrative plot regarding the end of the world, just can't be pulled off, and you're left at the end feeling somewhat cheated.  So many things are hinted at, but not explained, until the very last few episodes.  But the explanations are inadequate.  Rewatching it a few times, or perhaps going back and reading the manga might shed some light on what the hell is happening - but otherwise you are mostly left wondering.  The plot holes are gaping.\\n\\n\r\nPart of why the plot doesn't quite make sense is the villain.  The villain is, well, simply put, villainous.  Even one of the characters asks the villain why they are doing what they are doing.  Their response?  Because I want to.  Because I can.\\n\\n\r\nHmmm...  Sounds like the author didn't quite think that one through.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the end tries to tie it all together, what you're left with is a mangled lump of threads mashed into a ball.  The ball sticks, but only barely.  In one of the later episodes, a mysterious shady character sits down with one of our protagonists and lays it all out, telling, essentially, the audience what the hell is happening.  That's not good storytelling.  Even the explanations don't quite add up, and you're either left feeling cheated, or simply are forced to suspend all the annoying, nagging questions you have at the back of your mind in order to move on to the next episode, which unfortunately doesn't seem to help.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, the gaping holes in the story does not mean that the plot is not enjoyable, or that the conclusion is not satisfying.  There are many satisfying elements to this anime, and I would recommend giving it a go.  It's perhaps a shame that they tried to squeeze it into 22 episodes rather than taking their time, spanning it out, and having it make sense.  This could have been really something.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well. Time for my first review I guess. There will be spoilers, but contained to a small section which is labelled appropriately.\r\nRobotics;Notes (R;N) was originally created as a Visual Novel. It was brought to you by the same guys that had previously released Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate. While both of them were very unique, I absolutely loved S;G while hating C;H...so going into this I had absolutely no idea what to expect. In the end, I got served a big fat dose of \"meh\".\r\nFirstly I think it;s important to state that if you're looking for a mecha anime, you're going to have a bad time. Thisis even less of a mecha anime than Guilty Crown was. Right, now that's out the way, moving on with some of the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary issue with the series is pacing. Saying the series starts off slow would be a massive understatement. While the plot is developing to an extent, the meatiest chunk of the plot is reserved for the last 4 episodes, with the previous 18 focusing on anything else but the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of plot *SPOILERS START* It really is not explained well. Concepts such as monopoles are never explained. They're just there suddenly and you have to accept that. If this was a 12 episode series, I could accept things being cut out due to time constraints, but this wasn't a 12 episode series and they certainly were not overloaded with content. However, the most damning thing of all is that I cannot even remember Kimijima's reason for wanting to kill the majority of the population. Maybe this says more about my memory than the anime itself, but I've never experienced this in anything else that I've previously watched. Throw in examples of embarrassingly bad use of \"Deus ex machina\" for problem resolution (eg: A bird deflecting a gun) and you're left with a badly executed plot. *SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, they're decent for the most part. Yashio and Akiho are developed well and have a decently executed and interact in a seemingly natural way with each other. This seems to be quite rare in anime with everything being exaggerated, and it's something I really appreciate here. I personally found Frau entertaining and Mizuka is one of the strongest side characters I've come across in anime. However, two of the \"main\" characters could have been completely cut from the series without any real loss. They were just there because it was an adaptation from a VN and therefore the cast was already decided for them. The antagonist of the series was extremely weak with little development given.\\n\\n\r\nFor art and sound, I honestly don't notice unless a series is exceptionally good or bad in these aspects. It isn't either of the two extremes, so I'm not going to comment further on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a watchable series. It's poorly paced and badly explained in parts, however the characters overall are strong. I cannot really compare it to either s;g or c;h. I'm giving it a rating of 6/10 overall, although I do tend to rate harshly according to my score deviance on ratings. I wouldn't advise against watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped and that I didn't waffle on too much.\\n",

            "content": "For this review I will make references and comparisons to two other anime: Chaos;Head(2008) and Steins;Gate(2011). While all three of these anime adaptations were made by separate studios, they drawn upon the same series of visual novels for source material. \r\n     Now to begin the review. I'll start with the story. Like Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate Robotics;Notes has a story line that could only be described as thrilling. While the story started off at a slow pace it gradually built until I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation. They really pulled out all thestops for this show. Even with the slow start, the constant switch between success and failure in the attempt to build a giant robot as well as the mystery of the Kimijima reports was more than enough to keep my interest. In spite of the mystery, though, the plot was much easier to follow than either Chaos;Head or Steins;Gate. Personally I liked those complex stories that required an acute attention to detail, but that might not be a plus for everyone. As the story progresses it does take on a darker tone, but I found it nowhere near as grim as Chaos;Head or Steins;Gate. The story is overall logical and well thought out. My only qualm was that robots seemed far to advanced and integrated into society for the year 2019, but in spite of this the show does feel very realistic at times. The phone-tablets that everyone uses seemed like a very accurate prediction of the future. I can also understand why robotics needed to have become as advanced as it was for plot purposes. With so few negatives I felt that the story was perhaps the best part of Robotics;Notes.\\n\r\n     The art was quite impressive as well. The animation was beautiful and fluid. Several of the Character designs were a bit generic (Akiho and Subaru), but I really liked the uniqueness of some characters like Kona. Action scenes, which were few and far between, were underwhelming in terms of animation, but the focus of this show was not action. When all was said and done, though, I thought the art was very aesthetically pleasing. \\n\r\n     I'm not exactly a connoisseur of music, so I don't have to much to say about the sound. The soundtrack was enjoyable and had some excellent tracks within it, but it was not a masterpiece. It was definitely not a detriment to the show however. Like I said, certain tracks were absolutely fantastic. \\n\r\n     Character development was good but not great. I thought characters like Akiho and Kaito received excellent development. They were round characters, not bound by the basic traits they were introduced with. Others characters, however, received far less development. Of the shows cast I would have to say that Kona was my personal favorite. She received excellent character development and had the most interesting personality of all the main characters. Kaito, the protagonist, was not the greatest character I've ever seen, but he was far from generic and boring. I found him to be quite a likeable character with a realistic personality. In comparison to Chaos;Head, Robotics;Notes is far superior in terms of character development. However, its characters were not as impressive and those of Steins;Gate. That about sums it up for characters. \\n\r\n     Since enjoyment is a very subjective factor, I don't include it in reviews. Overall is just the combination of the previous factors, so there's not a ton to say for it. Robotics;Notes was superior to Chaos;Head in just about every way, however, it does not reach the same heights as Steins;Gate which I consider as masterpiece. At the end of the day though, I think most anyone would really like this show.",

            "content": "Whenever I watch an anime I get an initial impression or a promise. The anime will usually promise me that it's going to be one way or the other. Just from looking at the cover and watching the first few episodes and the main gist if the anime told me I was getting into an anime full of inspiration about a group of kids trying to make their dreams come true through the building of a robot. It could have been that or an Angelic Layer style robot tournament. I wouldn't have even minded a slice of life with a little robot building hobbies onthe side. However this anime so far has introduces so many concepts that for the sake of not spoiling anything I will not mention. Lets just say some of those concepts were pretty... earth shattering. Anyway, I really don't know what this anime is suppose to be, I don't think it knows what it wants to be. The reason why I brought up impressions and promises earlier is because I need to commit my feelings to something, at times it's ok to willfully betray the viewers initial impressions like in Madoka Magika, to get a certain effect, but this anime didn't seem to have a goal in mind as it popped question after question in my mind. Even at this point in the anime I feel like there were so many odd ball occurrences that were completely out of context that they could very well end up being plot holes by the end of the series unless they do some serious tying of the strings. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to touch on is the Characters. I felt like in the context of this ever vacillating story, the characters could not plant their roots firmly enough to make significant development. The characters all have very strong personalities and they are all very likable. I just wish that I could come to draw even closer to them especially by now. \\n\\n\r\nSo far my mid series review is this:\\n\\n\r\nStory: There really isn't much of one at this point, I am having a hard time even pegging it as a slice of life anime. There are too many themes that are picked up and dropped to be able to understand what the anime is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's quite good. It;s very befitting of the overall mood of the story and it is quite pleasing to look at for long periods of time. Very smooth animations and pleasant backgrounds. Very Slice O' Lifey.\\n\\n\r\nSound: My hands are together for Asami Tachibana, Takeshi Abo, and Yuuki Hayashi for putting together such a wonderful soundtrack. If anything, the sound kept the mood relevant throughout the anime. I especially liked some of the more ongoing pervasive melodies as they were very nostalgic and just put me into a very good mood. I would definitely purchase an album if made available to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The storyline aside, the characters were very lovable. They all stood out in their own way and if anything is the reason to watch this show as these character would probably make a better episode by episode anime rather than a show with an intricate plot that divides and ties together at the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Frankly, I found my attention drifting. It really hasn't riveted me as much as I'd like. Nitroplus has been known to make other animes that have been more or less slower at the beginning like Steins;Gate which is probably one of my favorite anime ever alongside Bokurano which also has a slow beginning. The thing is, even those anime had enough promise to keep me watching the show until the kicker, when i was fully submersed. I can't say that even up to this point I am fully submersed in the show. I'd even go as far as to say that it's because of Steins;Gate that didn't get truly interesting until ep 11 that I am even giving this as much of a chance as I have (Along with the fact that once I have gotten this far into something it has to be really bad for me to not commit till the end. The only anime that bad was Star Driver but that's another review).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Once again this is a mid way review and my thoughts may change but usually the first half of the anime marks the point at which it will not get any worse and the first half of this has set the bar pretty low, so I am just eagerly awaiting. Until then, I will continue to enjoy the gorgeous soundtrack and lighthearted humor that this anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is the kind of anime that I have to force myself to review. The truth is, I like it. I really like it. That's why it has a 6 and not a lower score: because for all its flaws, it is remarkably enjoyable.\r\nBut this is a review, isn't it? I can't just harp on about how fun it is without pointing out how horrifically flawed it is. The primary issues that Robotics;Notes experiences is this:\r\na) It isn't as intelligent as it thinks it is.\r\nb) It tries to do too much.\r\nI'll begin by clarifying that second point. Picture an anime akin to The Melancholy ofHaruhi Suzumiya: a sci-fi re-imagining of a typical romantic comedy, some decent characters, good comedy and the potential for some seriousness mixed in there. Then take a show like Steins;Gate (which I have yet to watch): a hyper-intelligent sci-fi thriller with a serious tone. Robotics;Notes wants to be both of these. But the result is rather like mixing vodka and lager together: they can be pretty enjoyable on their own, but the mixing of the two just doesn't seem to work. I can't escape the thought that had the creators decided to make either a sci-fi rom-com OR a sci-fi thriller, then the result would've been fantastic. But Rob;Not tends to flicker schizophrenically between light-hearted comedy/drama and serious psychological mystery while keeping the two largely disconnected. Characters like Subaru and Junna are completely irrelevant to the thriller elements of the series, and they shouldn't have been. There's a tendency to develop a likeable character (Kona is the most notable victim of this) and then render them completely unimportant to the plot after their arc is finished. And it's a shame, 'cos Kona in particular was a very good character. If the show had chosen to be a rom-com, then Rob;Not would've been able to provide a tighter character focus without making seemingly important characters seem arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nNow to clarify point (a). The issue that Rob;Not has (which can also be seen in its sister-anime Chaos;Head) is that it just isn't as intelligent as it thinks it is. Convenience writing is not a sign of an intelligent series. But Rob;Not has a tendency of coming up with convenient plot devices (the monopoles, Kai's slow-motion ability, the links between the bad guys and an anime production company) and then establishing a weak explanation in order to make these points seem important. I'm going to have to venture into spoiler territory here, so I apologise. Why, if the villain is planning to destroy the world, does he bring attention to his plan by creating hidden files? And why can the main character conveniently locate these files? Why are the monopoles falling from the sky? What did they hope to achieve on the SS Anemone? What role does Airi play in any of it?  Rob;Not seems to be under the impression that in order to be an intelligent thriller, it has to include as much non-existent sci-fi stuff as possible, but that isn't the case. A decent twist without such obvious and poorly-justified convenience writing would've been much more intelligent, even if they'd had to ditch many of the sci-fi plot devices. There's an assortment of blatant plot holes on show with almost no justification beyond lazy writing. Everything the villain does seems to give the main character more and more power that he can use to bring an end to the evil plan. There's no realistic psychology on display.\\n\\n\r\nThinking about it, Rob:Not may have been better off as a rom-com, 'cos that seems to be what it does best. The characters are actually quite likeable at times (Kona and Airi being my personal favourites) and the show is at its best when it focuses on the relationships between them all. Despite being the primary element of the series, the thriller aspect just seems to get in the way of an enjoyable twist on school-life drama. That said, there are effective thriller moments, with the highlight being an almost disturbingly graphic death scene in episode 16 that still seemed completely unnecessary. It can be dramatic and fun, but not effectively serious, and so a lot of potential is lost.",

I would classify this anime as underrated and the reason is people who watch this anime have the same expectations as they would if watching Stein's;gate, that's the problem. Robotics;Notes is not Stein's;gate. I highly suggest watching this anime and lowering your standards just a bit and you will definitely come out pleased with the ending.\r\nNow, onward to the actualreview. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story of Robotic;Notes is very well thought while at times it may be easy to predict whats going to happen, it's very easy to enjoy watching as things slowly unfold.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 The artwork is absolutely beautiful as expected.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 The music is well placed and fits each and every scenario also the OP songs are pretty darn good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 This is where this show loses a little face. The two main characters are relatively bland. There is really no sort of character development. The main male character doesn't do anything and when he does it's not much of a surprise, he's predictable and boring. I will say this though, the side characters are interesting and are very good at getting laughs out of the viewer!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 It's a good anime if you want to take things slow the journey there is nice!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd rate this anime a solid 7.5 with a standard deviation of .5 meaning, at times it's an 8 while others a 7. I highly recommend this anime because I put it off, and I don't want another person to make the same mistake. this anime deserves to be watched.",

            "content": "Robotic;Notes the 3rd visual novel made by 5pb collaborated with Nitroplus as most people mention. Overall the anime was pretty good giving consideration to the number of episode length and amount of story line needed to be incorperated.\r\nSci-fi genre stories are almost always interesting with having a grandiose scale conflict that is built up or connected to smaller events that occur among the characters. Didn't like how each individual character conflict was so simply considered resolved especially with Subaru, practically no resolution for him. Deux ex machina was used a bit too extensively for the story, most likely due to cutting out parts of thevisual novel storyline (like in the opening you see them having fireworks at the bench but there wasn't any episode). Also the story skipped quite often from one point in the story to the next with connection to each episode, as well as some plot holes made from them. However the story was overall good, it was unique and represented 5pb & Nitroplus' theme of 1% fantasy 99% science story style. \\n\\n\r\nArt was decent, expressions, reactions etc were well made most of the time. The design of the robots were realistic in terms of the amateur physic knowledge needed to see if such robots could be made. Gunvarrel is pretty awesome looking in my opinion, its nice to have a robotic represent a hero of justice for those childhood dreams.\\n\\n\r\nSound was decent, the background music was suitable though could have been better. The opening song first and second were enjoyable, especially first one in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were nicely made, each personality was unique in some sense. Though, character development could have been done further (if more episodes were given), especially for Subaru and Daitoku. Since it feels as though you only know their problems and how they are typically, no sense of how they wanna purse the future and grow as an individual character. Furugori was well done, background story and character develop was well shown and portrayed. Akiho and Kaito were decently done, not too well done but decently enough I got no complaints except on how Kaito about Airi. Antagonists could have been better, Kou's character was little iffy because of what Airi said yet the flashback scene didn't show it well enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed the story a lot though, Furugori was interesting. The game within the story was interesting wish app store had something like that. Sci-fi was great with those phone droids the character had, concept of elephant-mouse syndrome. Though that syndrome could have been incorporated into the story better. Akiho's version only seemed problematic, Kaito's version was like a special move. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyable to watch! Though the story didn't end in the way I hoped. Wish the story had a better twist, almost thought (spoiler here) that when Misaki got out of the black/purple Sumeragi or the images people saw of the city destroyed through their phone screen that it was an alterate world, or the world acted like a mirror having 2 different possible perspective depending on which side of the world you were in? Anyway, give it a try, its worth watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is an anime from Production I.G, you may know them from their work with Ghost in the Shell and the Blood franchise. It's based on a visual novel game by 5pb, the same group that was responsible for Steins;Gate and a list of other games you've probably never heard of. Since their stuff doesn't usually leave Japan. That all sounds pretty promising to me. Let's take a look at the anime and see how long that lasts. \r\nThe story follows a young man named Kai and his friend Akiho, who comprise the robotics club of Tanegashima High School. But all isn't going well. Theyhave no funding with which to finish their giant robot and the principal wants to shut them down. To further complicate matters, Kai stumbles upon a mysterious program called the Kimijima report. To its credit, Robotics;Notes does have some interesting ideas, its technology is futuristic but most of it does come across as plausible, and its main plot thread does have some good moments. However, the ending is weak and it's very slowly paced. It isn't until the 16th episode that the major plot threads start paying off. Up until that point it's all build up and the concepts they're working with really aren't interesting enough to merit that much build up. Consequently, a lot of the early episodes just drag. The major romance sub-plot also falls rather flat. They give you some idea that the characters might possibly care for each other beyond friendship throughout the anime, but they never give you a reason to care. Which resulted in me not being able to find a damn to give when they had their obligatory pairing up scene towards the end. In fact, the anime would have been stronger without that sub-plot. What there is of it is just cliched and they could've done everything exactly the same with the characters in question just being good friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely an issue in this. They're all very typical with little development and no surprises. You've got the kind of lazy shounen protagonist. The perky heroine who wants to catch up to the person she admires. The \u201ctragic\u201d figure who wants to chase his dream but can't as a result of familial disapproval. The weak but kind-hearted girl trying to overcome past trauma and, worst of all, at least in this series, the nerd with no social graces who spends too much time online and uses chat lingo in daily circumstances. You've probably seen all of these characters used multiple times with varying degrees of development. This is one of those series that uses them at their most basic. It tries to give them some development by giving each of them a basic character arc. The issue is that those arcs are predictable, to the point that you can probably guess some of the outcomes just based on this paragraph, and most of them are resolved with very little difficulty only to have the characters remain basically the same afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is okay. Some of the technology looks impressive, but the character designs are just kind of standard. The same can be said for most of the backgrounds and miscellanea. The robot fight scenes, what little there is of them, are okay, but they end before you can really get any kind of investment and yet they still manage to have too many pauses. Apparently the 5pb writers think that going slowly is tantamount to good pacing. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good. Particularly Tokui Sora, Hosoya Yoshimasa and Nazuka Kaori. Sure, Nazuka's character annoyed me, but her performance was still good. The music is just really unmemorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 3/10. They hint at it at some points, usually involving Kona, but they never do anything with it aside from bringing it up. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Robotics;Notes. It's not nearly on the level of Steins;Gate. There were some good ideas behind it, but the execution is overly slow and quickly gets dull and the characters are just bland. Final rating 5.6/10. It's slightly better than average. If you love robots, you may garner some enjoyment from it. Otherwise you'll probably just find it boring. Next week, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.",

            "content": "This is the first of hopefully many reviews from me, so here goes:\r\nRobotics;Notes. When one sees the \";\" in the name, their mind jumps straight to Steins;Gate and their hopes for it skyrocket, without any regard to the fact that the same company made Chaos;Head. Playing off this weakness, it seems Nitroplus tried to make Robotics;Notes into another Steins;Gate. Just one problem:\r\nRobotics;Notes is not Steins;Gate.\r\nThe story is slow to start and would immediately turn off anyone who isn't familiar with Nitroplus' works. Even when the story starts to pick up, it is incredibly slow. Nitroplus continuously tried to liven things up with countless cliffhangers atthe end of episodes, but were only successful in doing so when they decided to kill off one of the characters. This was successful until the end of the next episode when I stopped giving a shit since it was only a minor character. After that point it was just more boring plot development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are introduced and developed almost a slowly as the story and in some cases were even less memorable. While I thought the characters were slightly better than the story, it wouldn't take much to beat this story. I found myself able to connect with characters every so often, but there was only one character that I could say I really liked (try to guess who).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, well, sound in general was probably the best part of the series. Music matched the moments though I didn't care for the OP's nor the ED's. Art wasn't all that great, but since that's never been much of a concern to me and I'm no art critic so I'm just gonna bypass that and finish this review up. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I felt like only a few people in the anime were really taking the events of the end serious, thus causing me to feel the same. In fact, I could almost imagine one of the background characters saying \"Oh no, the lives of 5 million people are at stake, hey wanna get some ice cream?\" All in all a crappy, anticlimactic end to a subpar anime that even pales in comparison to Chaos;Head.",

            "content": "*EDIT THIS IS A REREVIEW\r\nAfter watching the series over again my opinions have definitely changed, so I would like to rewrite this review.\r\nThere are few anime out there that can express passion, as well as this one. A story about a girl who enjoys stem and wants to follow her dream is definitely something you don't see in many animes. Its an original fresh of air that you might want to watch casually. Its slice of life for the most part and scifi for the rest. As a hobbyist of electronic engineering this anime gets my internels tingling, the passion of someday achieving the impossible,is goal I also strive for. I feel that the feelings are so well conveyed by the characters. *I highly recommend watching the dub for this anime. I personally hate most funimation dubs as they are the worst low quality shit, but this is one of my exceptions as it (in my opinion) is far superior to the sub. \\n\\n\r\nOkay now let's start with the story, the story is something that's very confusing and ends very abruptly. That's all have to really say, since it doesn't feel very well put together, when there's like jumble of 4 events that take place during the same time period. The ending also leaves you with alot of questions that'll probably never be answered unless you play the game. The most notable one being the disappearance of Kona's mother.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the art for this anime is very good. It uses cgi well enough to the point where its not very noticeable, especially when they animated the tanagashi machine. The character designs are also well made and don't feel like the modern generic anime style. I didn't expect much less from a well known studio as production IG.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is probably one of the best things about it. It has very motivating, and calm pieces that fit into the scifi and slice of life parts all to well.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this show and probably my reason for giving this anime an 8 would be the characters. The characters are so alive, quirky and lovable. Ranging from the perverted and lonely Kona to the Energetic and always optimistic Akiho Synomia. With the exceptions of the main character, which most people aren't very fond of as he is bland and \"isn't very enjoyable to watch\". I feel that it makes up for it as he is very close with Ahki and cares for her as a child hood friend. You always see him stepping out of his way to help her, which just helps you have some feeling towards him as a character. \\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth if it wasn't for the very good voicing acting I would have given this a 6 or 7 and my enjoyment would be a 7, but that isn't the case so I would give this show an 8 for having excellent voice acting and very good characters that have some of the most realistic feeling character interactions(akhi and kai).\\n\\n\r\nHere's the trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO4lbqhP8og\\n\r\nIt's one of my favorite anime trailers, always a motivation when I'm feeling down... \"I have to because ... Gunvarrel is waiting!\" XD \\n\\n",

            "content": "This one's quite the mixed bag. Robotics;Notes appears to juggle several lingering plot developments with the main focus being on a struggling robotics club, both members experiencing disorders that affect their perception of time and a conspiracy development connected to a collection of reports that Kaito is trying to track the whereabouts of. The first half starts off kind of like a slice-of-life comedy as Akiho and Kaito try recruiting more members and making their robotics club a success as they build a large mecha and get sponsorship. The characters are a bit on the cliched side as they follow certain archetypes, yet are alikeable bunch who all have their varying personal dilemmas that the anime focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is where the plot picks up as things with the mentioned conspiracy pick up steam and shady developments with a secret organization make their presence felt in the later episodes of the series. These events are meant to connect the developments involving the plot and characters of the series. But their integration isn't too smooth and what the events lead up to are quite a bit on the cliched side with who is responsible and why they are doing it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is quite nice on the eyes with vivid and detailed scenery shots and bright colors, with character designs getting similar treatment. Animation for the series is mostly fluid and there aren't many instances of shortcuts being implemented, with high points involving movement of mecha and some later combat scenes involving the mentioned secret organization.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm kind of indifferent on this series. It works well as a slice-of-life title in its focus on the struggles of the robotics club, despite the rather cliched characters. But its attempt to try integrating its plot and character developments into a conspiracy plot is awkward and not so smooth with connecting. Definitely the weaker of the Science Adventure series that 5pb and Nitroplus have whipped up for anime adaptations thus far.",

            "content": "Right... so this is not a mecha anime. I was honestly expecting a Gundam-style battle right up till the end, but no. Despite being all high-tech and stuff, the \"robots\" are the same chunky, dumb and awkwardly moving pieces of metal you see every now and then on the 9 o'clock news. This is a show meant for robotics enthusiasts.\r\nSo, Production I.G. on a noitaminA slot, it ought to be good right? Not even remotely. In fact, it smells like the shit they cooked up exactly one year ago. Well, it wasn't that bad, but aside from the excellent production quality we expected from thestudio, there's nothing positive I can say about Robotic;Notes. Except for Furugoori Kona, which may be one of the most interesting characters I've seen yet.\\n\\n\r\nYou won't have guessed it, but Robotic;Notes turns out to belong to the mystery genre. It started out like a ambitious high-school club anime or a romance drama, but the core of Robotic;Notes is actually mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the tiny bits of clues give us almost NO IDEA what the actual \"mystery\" is all about. The mystery that was supposed to be the core of the story. And if it affected the character in no way right until the very end, why are we supposed to give a fuck about it? Midway through the series, I honestly believed that the writer gave up and tried to do the ambitious high-school club/romance drama instead. It was the point where I thought that they really didn't have a clue or care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nBut no matter what, an anime will always pull through with good characters. Not Robotic;Notes. I've never seen a lead character that's quite as passive as Kaito. Aki has near non-existant sex appeal. Furugoori's potential is under-utilized outside of her episode. The other two club members didn't even need to exist. Misaki has the answers too all the questions in the anime, but is completely useless other than being a cheap villain.\\n\\n\r\nI have a lot more things I could complain about, but I've already showed you a recipe for failure. I waited 5 months for an idea of what's going on, but the answer is a shockingly simple, mind-numbing and disappointing twist. The last couple of episodes were good and it ended well, but it certainly isn't worth pushing through 20 episodes. Hell, it isn't even worth 10. Take everything good about this title and boil it down, I'd give you 5 episodes tops. This is such a waste of time.",

I can't speak highly of this show because it really is not worth watching, but I will continue to watch it until the end because i'm a fan of steins;gate, and you may also like to give this a chance if you'd seen steins;gate , there will be some great surprises.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime, I can say it's below mediocre and is not worth watching, there were a few good moments, but total disappointing \\n",

One thing that I really love about a character is enthusiasm. If they really care and really put their heart into what they do, it is very endearing to me, as one might glean from my favorite character list. That is the impression that I get from Robotics;Notes as a whole. The passion in this show is tangible. It just makes me smile.\r\nWhile the three Science Adventure shows have next to no connection to each other, one commonthread is great dub acting. Clifford Chapin and Lindsay Seidel really brought something extra. I really liked this show, as well as the whole trilogy.",

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nI'll keep the review short and simple just to get my grievances out.\r\nAfter reading so many reviews that compared this anime to Stein's;Gate (my personal favorite, I was pretty excited to start it. I kinda regret it now.\r\nAt first glance Robotics;Notes comes off as a simple story about a couple students scrambling together what support they can gain to keep their robotics club open, build their dream robot and enter a competition. That's really all it should've been. But sadly, a secondary story line is shoehorned in to, in my opinion, make the show seem more complex than it needed to be and inthe end it just comes off as boring, hastily written and a bit pretentious. \\n\\n\r\nThe second story line deals with some vague event that occurred in the past (which is mentioned once or twice) that gave both of our protagonists strange \"abilities\". Then it gets increasingly strange when the story delves into some faceless organization that wants to severely minimize the Earth's population to invoke a tyrannical dictatorship (how original). While it was an interesting concept, it just didn't work, especially considering the other storyline. The entire time it just felt like the show was taking a break to tell another for a couple of minutes and then get back to the story that was interesting (in this case it being revival of the robotics club).\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest the only reason why I gave this anime a 6 rather than anything lower is simply because of the main characters. Our two protagonists are starkly different from one another, but you get the sense that there is in fact a deep history between the both of them and their friendship feels powerful. In addition to that, the secondary characters we're introduced to all have their respective quirks and they all mesh very well together. The writers attempt to give them their own dark backstory, but just like the main plot, it's completely half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end what we get with this anime is a story that tries to be more ambitious than it needed to be.",

            "content": "To say the least, when I first heard about Robotics;Notes, I was excited. Made by the same people who made Steins;Gate (one of my favorite anime) I expected it to be amazing, however, what I got in the beginning was nothing short of boring with a dick of a main character, an uninteresting supporting cast, and a lack of any substantial story. To be completely honest, for a while, I considered dropping it but, I ultimately decided to stick with it to the end and I was rewarded for my perseverance.\r\nThe story of Robotics;Notes starts off with a somewhat typical plot device: a small groupof students trying to save their dying club- in this case, a robotics club. From this simple beginning, it slowly transitions into uncovering the truth behind a conspiracy and that's where the real meat of the story resides. There are some serious twists and turns in the story and let's just say that when s**t goes down, it basically starts a storm. From such a typical (and somewhat boring) beginning, it really kicks up towards the 2/3rds mark and the last episode was particularly awesome and very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Robotics;Notes is neither spectacular nor horrible, it lays somewhere more along of the lines of \"good\". The animation within the game in the anime, Kill Ballad, is pretty good and, for the most part, that is where it really tends to shine because everything else moves at a much more slower pace, though this changes in the last episode. For the most part, the art just serves its purpose but I have to admit certain scenes looked really good. In short, I really had no gripes with the art and animation in this anime. The sound design is basically the same deal, it generally serves its purpose but, it definitely has moments where it shines as well. Regarding the theme songs, both openings are blood-pumping rock songs and while the first ending seems to be more of a pop song, the second ending is more or less a ballad so there's some variety there. I found that the songs grew on me as I listened to them even though I didn't particularly like the opening songs very much in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Robotics;Notes are more or less like pieces on a chess board for me: certain ones are more important than others and while I momentarily care if something happens to one of them, I get over it quickly. However, that is not to say that they are bad characters. There just seems to be some lack of connection, as if they are far too distanced from myself- almost like how I would empathize with a person I heard had heard of but, I wouldn't truly care because don't really know that person too well. While the character development was sufficient enough to give the characters some depth, I never felt anything other than general empathy for what the characters went through.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Robotics;Notes is an anime with a slow start but a glorious finish. The characters have depth and the art, animation, and sound design all serve their purpose well and all have moments where they definitely shine. While I really enjoyed the anime in end, I find it somewhat difficult to recommend to everybody due to the slow start in the beginning. So, I would say pick it up if you're patient enough to watch until you get to the real juicy parts.\\n\\n\r\n8 out of 10",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is much like a younger sibling trying desperately to out-do its older, more successful sibling Steins;Gate. Although it started out with the basis of a decent anime, it was almost as if the producers tried too hard to make it into a masterpiece and the latter part of the anime simply got too complex for its own good. So although it had some good moments, overall, I found it to be rather disappointing and lacklustre in certain departments.\r\n~SETTING & PLOT~\r\nThe plot essentially revolves around a high school robotics club and their quest to build a giant robot to be displayed eventually at an expo.However, as the story progresses, a massive conspiracy is uncovered and they must work to save the world from evil. I was a bit skeptical about the high school setting and have always found the concept of high-schoolers having the power to save the world to be slightly unbelievable, despite this being used often and sometimes with great success. In this case, I didn't think the high school setting was conducive to such a complex plot with conspiracies/propaganda/brainwashing.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the pacing of the anime wasn't great either, the buildup in the first half was too slow and drawn out, there didn't seem to be enough plot progression, and the final few episodes seemed to have a bit of a frantic ending. As a result, many complex aspects of the anime were left unexplained creating confusing plot-holes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, one of the most dissatisfying aspects of the story for me was the resolution to the evil/conspiracy/threat to humanity. After all the buildup and following the protagonist do research into this conspiracy, I expected puzzle pieces gathered throughout the previous episodes to fit together and neatly form the resolution. However, unfortunately, the resolution was rather cliche and seemingly pulled out of nowhere, as if the writers tried to create a puzzle so complex and difficult that they couldn't even solve in the end.\\n\\n\r\n~ART & ANIMATION~\\n\r\nThis is one of the more impressive aspects of Robotics;Notes as Production I.G have done a fine job in making this show aesthetically pleasing. The characters are well drawn and the animation is smooth with no noticeable flaws. The most impressive facet is the 3D animation in the fight scenes involving robots. It was quite fun to watch and I would've liked to see more of these scenes.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very good and the voice acting was competent. The orchestral main theme especially in the fit the series well as a BGM and the majority of the OST worked effectively in accompanying the series. Both OP themes were enjoyable and had plenty of energy. The voice of Kanako Itou was beautiful in the ED theme 'Topology.' \\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTER~\\n\r\nIn terms of characters and their development, Robotics;Notes sadly falls short. The main characters in the series consist of 5 members of the Robot Research Club:\\n\r\n> Kai - nonchalant protagonist who likes to play and is very good at video games\\n\r\n> Aki - robot enthusiast obsessed with Gunvarell, childhood friends with Kai\\n\r\n> Subaru - champion robot fighter with great expertise and knowledge in robotics\\n\r\n> Junna - karate kid, who is afraid of robots\\n\r\n> Kona - shut-in geek with a dark past\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem lies with the lack of character development. We only get one episode to show the backstory of Junna and get to know her, and Subaru doesn't even get that! Kona was one character who was intriguing and had a bit of mystery about her. We get teased with one flashback scene mid-series and she pretty much get next to no airtime thereafter.\\n\\n\r\nSo the majority of the airtime goes to Kai and Aki both of whom in my opinion had some flaws. Firstly, I thought Kai was a really plain, bland character for a protagonist. He just seems so nonchalant in everything he does and just doesn't get you interested in what he's doing. Aki is a bit too one-dimensional for my liking as nearly every scene she appears in is in somewhat related to building the giant robot; whether it be building it, talking about building it, or gathering support so she can build the robot.\\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nDespite being well produced with its art and sound being obvious highlights, Robotics;Notes had many flaws which compromised my enjoyment of the series. The messiness and confusion of the story's plot-holes is a major one of these flaws. The poor pacing never allowed the series to gather momentum and it was at times a struggle maintaining interest, and despite characters initially showing potential, most don't get much development making it hard to connect with them and care about them. I wouldn't say Robotics;Notes is a terrible anime because it does have some nice moments, but it's just not very good and has way too many negatives in the story and character departments. Ultimately, it wouldn't be the sort of anime I would recommend.",

I feel that whoever wrote and directed this knew the major notes they had to hit to make this type of show work, but didn't know what to do in between those and fumbled a bit on the ending.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe broad strokes for the story were done right, but overall i have to say it was a bit of a mess. The basic layout is a more grounded slice of life story for the 1st half in order to put together the cast andcatheterize them. This part is honestly done pretty well and the lead into the 2nd half is done well and grabbed my interest. The 2nd half is this larger worldwide greater evil conspiracy story with a decent little twist. This is sadly where the story falls apart. Many things are left rather unexplained and what is explained is felt very rushed. You are also given absolutely no motive for the villain of the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\r\nThe art and animation are great\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5\\n\r\nThe characters in this series felt very flat and uninteresting to me. You get the feel of how they are after 1 or 2 episodes after they appear. While they are thrown in new situations and you get to see their reactions to those situations they never feel like they grow or change much. They react much how you would have expected them to and their reactions to situations after that are the same as they have always been.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5 \\n\r\nThe setup of this show set my exceptions high. I love Sci-fi and i love mysteries and thrillers, but this show was just a letdown. The science in the sci-fi just doesn't hold water even at a basic level. With the motives of the villain being so ambiguous it leaves a big hole in the mystery part to. Not to mention the number of loose threads left at the end that i won't get into cause of spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI have to give the series a 6/10 Fair rating. Maybe I'm being hard on it cause I feel it could have easily been a 8/10 anime. Maybe i'm being easy on it cause it is a complete story with a proper ending the those are so rare anymore. In the end unless you are a hard core fan of shows like Steins;gate and want something with a similar feel even it is inferior i can't recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Before you read this:\r\n1) Excuse my Englisj\r\n2) in this review (BTW my first review) i'll try to highlight what I enjoyed the most while watching this show. To spell my opinion in one sentence \"An unsatisfying Ending for a great build-up\".\r\nProblems: For starters, the first episodes makes you fell a there is a slow pace and caps feel longer than 25 minutes. I don't mind that slow pace but the show just went from really slow to dam fast (leaving things unexplained). That is a problem most series have, they've got 5 or 6 episodes left to finish the story and just rush it. Idon't know if this was the case but the last 5 or 6 episodes could've been streched in another 10 and explained some loose ends, give the impact needed to some MAYOR EVENTS and give screantime to side characters that were pulled aside. None the less this were my only real problems with the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Pace: The beginin and development of the show where the greatest parts of it, except for one event that happend in the closing of the series that was great too. It had a mixture of mistery and evrey day highschool life, I really liked it beacause it felt different from all those other generic series. Until episode 16 I give this show an 8 (you better be pacient to go past espisode 6) and I liked that part of the show so much I'll leave it as my overall \"grade\". Why did I enjoyed so much this 2/3 of the show? Theres some serious build-up and not only on the 2 main stories, but on the side characters backstory (some more than others). I read a review that sais something like \"It had such a great build up it collapsed on its weight\" I think his on point (Dunno which User that said that, sorry), but that just proves the great build-up they've done. If you could just ignore some plot holes and don't think to much about them you can avoid raging with the close-up of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I like the 2 main leads even though they get a little repetitive in their interactions. There were 3 side characters that at some point of the series got in the spotlight, and in those moments when you get to se this characters backstories and develpment the show was at it greatest. There are some extra characters, that were plain gimmick others just were needed for the story no one was outstanding. Although the show dosn't develops them as much as I'd like, the things the show us and the ones they gives us hints to figure out by ourselves (because they don't spell you what the character is thinking, you've gotta figure it out) was enough to get to understand the important ones. Akiho, Yashio, Furugoori, Airi and Subaru were the real reasons I got throw the whole series. I wanted to see what will happen to them, how will they face the obstacles that life gave them. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch this, don't expect a Steins;Gate, an Evangelion or a Fullmetal Alchemist. It's a good show in its own right but its not the grestest show ever, just have that in mind. Lastly try to enjoy what you got and not complain for what you didn't get.",

This did not feel like 506 minutes, instead it felt as though I had witnessed someones memories. Truly amazing - through start and finish. Steins;Gate is a classic for me but all these alternate settings; Chaos;Head, Chaos;Child and Robotics;Notes - they are all just amazing.\r\nIwould recommend to sit down and watch this and it's something that sets the standard for anime.",

            "content": "It is the first time I give a such high score whilst reviewing, yaaaaay! And, once again, I'm rocking the unpopular opinion. Double yay! At this rate, I believe, I will soon turn into a hipster.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nLet's start with a confession of mine - out of the trio, Robotics;Notes is my favorite, and it brought me much, much more joy that the over praised Steins;Gate (those of you who read my other reviews, must know I did not find it as astonishing). I was extremely sceptical about this one as, well, it has something related to robots in the title, as I hate mechas. Plus,the major disappointment in Steins;Gate. The first episode made me grind my teeth as I was certain there is no way I can keep up with this anime for solid 22 episodes. However, the second episode offered a different theme, which, although still distant from my preferences, appeared to be much better than mecha. AND THEN THE THINGS STARTED. Oh my god. I'm a big, big fan of conspiracy theories and stuff of the kind, so as soon as I've started recognizing the existing themes in the anime, my curiosity grew very, very large. While the conspiracy by the government is pretty much the main theme in all three animes, Robotics;Notes, in my opinion, was the most tied to the real world. While first two episodes made me facepalm about my anime-related OCDs, I soon got so into it I forgot about everything in the world. Oh yes. The part with a grandfather. I was literally crying, as in having to stop my work out as I was starting to sob uncontrollably. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Robotics;Notes does not use my beloved blanked colours palette, I still found it to be very, very pleasing for my eyes. The colours are bright, but not the eye-cancer bright. They are used in nice schemes, therefore they don't irritate the viewer. Anatomically correct characters was a plus, too. As I've stated multiple times before, I can't stand mecha, but the robot design deserves my praises, too. My main problem with mecha is all the drawing clutter when it comes to robots - Robotics;Notes managed to avoid that, hence why mecha haters such as me were capable to appreciate the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBeing a rock chick to the bone, I've appreciated hints of heavier music in the series. The opening was lovely, although it gave a promising start, it still appeared to be some cheesy Jpop. I liked the fact the main theme in Tetsuharu's shop was heavy metal. Growing up with a plenty of metalheads in my surroundings, including my dad, I know very well how related heavy metal and all those obsessed with screwdrivers and micro-schemes are. But here my praises end, as, well. The rest of the themes, including the ending, were nothing special, really. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nKONA IS MY SPIRITUAL ANIMAL. Just like probably everyone familiar with the series, I fell in love with this little freak and omg, I recognize myself in her. The main difference is that I can't program of the life of me and, well, ain't so smart. Oh, and my life story isn't as interesting. Other than that - spot on. The rest of the characters...Hmpf. It's one of the cases when the mains are quite...Blank, not to over praise them. The supporting characters, on the other hand, were great and given much more personality. After skimming through the reviews, I noted many bashing the villain, but that's where I highly disagree. I LOVED the concept, and how the discovery of the true bad boy evolved. It was a great plot twist and hey, it'd be very,very stupid to expect any physical actions performed by him. It would ruin the anime. They kept it quite subtle, exposing him as a puppeteer and a master mind he was rather than the bad guy who'd openly cause offence. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY I got the darker themes and violence I wanted! Unlike Steins;Gate that would give me false hope, this anime in fact got some tough sh*t going on. Although I already enjoyed the anime, one moment it got very, very sinister, instantly earning my undying love. That episode I watched with my eyes widened, as I honestly did not expect it to actually happen. My prayers had been heard! Eventually. As I've stated in the beginning, I had low expectations for Robotics;Notes and was mentally prepared it will be a difficult one to watch, but boy! It's one of the best animes I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nA ten from me! A very, very few animes had ever been given this score from the spiteful and demanding little arse known as Shira-Yumi. Which can only suggest Robotics;Notes is truly something, or at least it is to me. I've gladly rewatched it again with my boyfriend. It definitely beats Steins;Gate for me, and I believe it is highly underestimated and underrated. I mean, look at me - I honestly hate mecha and always have. This anime has mecha. I love this anime. Essentially, it got a mecha hater to be squealing over a mecha-ish anime. Yes, it is fairly special.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad it was the last anime of the triad I watched, as otherwise the other two would disappoint me only more than they originally had. Robotics;Notes, the only one of the three I was not eager to watch, proved to be the best one and restored my faith. The conclusion is the following: robots can be cool.",

Then it turned into a mecha fight tournament show, then it got all creepy and turned into a thriller kind of show. But near the end it really surprised me (Mild spoiler)  when the the main girl Aki-chan was like \"After you get back from you mission I have somethingimportant to tell you\". And I was like \"Oh god shes gonna confess her love to him and its the MC is gonna be all dense and not know whats going on cuz all MC's r fckin morons who don't know whats going on\". But in reality Hes pretty smart and confessed to her instead and they actually kiss and stuff. Which surprised the poop out of me. Cause this is the first anime I've  ever seen where the MC actually hooks up with the childhood friend EVER. Anyways. That right there makes this anime unique and worth watching imo.",

            "content": "I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOOOOVE IT, are the words I would begin to describe this show. There is something compelling about a self-aware Gundam show that takes its self seriously with its characters, plot, action, and comedy. Before I get into the explanation part I\u2019ll have to recommend the dub if you plan to watch this. This has by far one of the best dubs I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s got great localization for North America and the actors fit perfectly. It\u2019s a see to believe it kind of deal. It really helped improve the show for me and if given a chance mightbe a great experience for you as well. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers as usual \\n\\n\r\nStory: Initially I had some doubts about the story, it starts out by talking about saving the world and then jumps into a comedy style club group? This may already seem to be the perfect setup for a generic \u201chigh school kids get superpowers and save the world\u201d kinda scenario but in reality its far from it. The story doesn\u2019t have either of those but rather both at the same time. At first it does stick with the main focus of the club and the comedy routine until some events aspire and adds a whole new parallel plot alongside the current one. Of course, the one moving back and forth between these two is the main character Yoshino, but I\u2019ll get into the effect of this on him later. These dual concurrent plots are something that\u2019s really rare in media of any form, the only other media I can think of with this is assassins creed. Having two main characters developing(Desmond and eizo) was not an easy thing to pull off and it worked wonderfully for the game. Robotic notes takes this with stride as the show has two casts one being Subaru, Koujiro, Daitoku, and Akiho, while Airi, Ko Kimijima, and Matija being there own cast. Dual plots if done right can be extremely strong, in this case, was a big pay off. If it was just about a club building a big robot then it would be boring, if it was about discovering the mysteries of some scientist it would be boring. But when working in tangent with each other, it goes from humor to mystery, thriller to romance, drama, and action. Juxtaposing constantly with each other to make some interesting elements of developments and character growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The beauty of subtlety and how it fits into these characters so well. Yashio was by far the most well written and changes so quiet it was astounding when you finally notice it. When the show first started you see a shallow and rather unexciting main character. By the end of it you see an entirely different person, one with conviction, purpose, and maturity. The biggest reason for this change was his involvement in both concurrent plots and trying to piece together who exactly Ko Kimijima really is. I really enjoy this sort of tone shift that happens periodically. The lighting, shots and music change dramatically here and completely gave the show a new perspective. It made Yoshio\u2019s character experience all kinds of dramatic events and scenes which made his character at the end of the show truly fell like it had changed rather than written that way. I also found the changes to be very effective in keeping me engaged and sensitive to these shifts since they were not used a lot in the show. The first main supporting cast Subaru, Koujiro, Daitoku, were all nice characters with each having their own individual character episodes. Akiho as a character was much better in the latter half than first. This makes sense from the story standpoint since her major conflicts don\u2019t show up until then. But for someone as important as her, she lacked screentime for a big chunk. I found the romance to be sweet but lacked proper development. The other half of the cast was a mixed bag, Airi I had major problems with. The virtual character part of her was fine but since she forgot everything that happened to her when she woke up it made the character progression nullified. This effectively destroyed her character and ruins so much time that was spent on her throughout the story. She was also pretty damn cute. Ko Kimijima was an alright villain, he lacked a creative character but the twist from good to evil was the only benefit of his character. Him becoming digital and losing his emotion was a step in the wrong direction and they should have made him keep his emotions instead for a better villain and character. Mashija was cool I don\u2019t have much to say about her. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: l wasn\u2019t impressed, to say the least. It\u2019s a bit aged now but still has a fluid movement which was rare for back then. Production IG has always been a silent studio in popularity compared to its counterparts like madhouse, bones and A1. There were some really interesting uses of cinematography and lighting, which I would love to see more of in anime cause these subtle difference can have a huge impact. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Lots of hype and slice of life music. The OP and ED were decent and didn\u2019t stand out that much. The first OP Junjou Spectra by Zwei was kickass and made me hyped for the show but the second didn\u2019t deliver that well compared to the first. All and all a basic tracklist for comedy, action, and mystery. Nothing bad but nothing fantastic either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDub: ok now for the dub. The saving grace for this show, and what I believe made me like this show so much. Ironically after researching, I was scratching my head confused about why it was so good. None of the voice actors (with exception Leah Clark and Clifford Chapin) were that popular or important. They still did a banged up job with the acting though, and I\u2019m probably going to contribute this to those who did the auditions. Funimation doesn\u2019t just have good actors but also great actor selecting as well. For me, I found the actors perfectly aligned with their character's personality and it made the experience so much more enjoyable with how authentic they felt. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I can\u2019t contest for the VN source material and what it\u2019s like but I enjoyed this anime a lot. I still feel like I\u2019m overreacting as what I\u2019ve seen and read online, it isn\u2019t as good as I make it out to be. None the less I hope you give it a try and find the same level of enjoyment I that felt with this show.",

            "content": "I wasn't expecting much out of this, honestly. I blame my affection for the Steins;Gate duology on that, along with my not having read the source VN beforehand. While its story is all-over-the-place, and the sound- + art-work aren't superb, the characterization is pretty solid! Read on if you want to see someone's thoughts on R;N without the VN. \r\n[Story - 6]\r\nThere are really /several/ stories going on - one is the Robotics Club trying to achieve their goal of making a life-sized mecha, another is the conspiracy behind the 'Kimijima Reports', AND another is about two teens trying to reconnect with a sibling thathas abandoned them. While the Club + Teen stories are (usually) woven together well, the existence of the 'Kimijima Reports' plot caused a lot of focus division. In turn, this made the story really hard to follow at times, and you can tell that the ending act isn't quite up to snuff. I have no idea if the VN was at all like this, but I hope not.\\n\\n\r\nSame type of thing goes on with the themes - while there is occasional deconstruction of the mecha genre, it often clashes against the relentless optimism + the occasional bleakness stemming from the other plots. \\n\\n\r\nI REALLY wish the writers had been more competent, as there was a lot of potential here. These 3 plots + themes by themselves are interesting enough alone, so it would have been awesome to see how they could have been written with more synergy. But alas, we got left with.........this.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork isn't really anything to talk much about. It isn't outright horrendous, but neither was it stellar. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were fairly well-done, both providing detail and atmosphere, but nothing to rave about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was good though! Everyone had such a 'distinctive' look that conveyed their personality with ease (i.e. Furugoori). There were certainly lackluster designs, but that's getting into nitpicking IMO.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 7]\\n\\n\r\nSame for sound LOL. The music isn't memorable, but it works (The OP's and ED's are awesome though). The voice acting is done pretty well too, but nothing to /really/ rave about. Of course, the SFX are solid (and they have to be).\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 8]\\n\\n\r\nTHIS is where the anime really shines. Honestly, I probably could have dropped this and not missed much, but........GOD, these characters are great.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just start with the two teens, Aki and Kai. Aki may just come off as a stereotypical Blindly Optimistic Shonen Protag, but she holds a lot of depth surprisingly. It comes in the form of a massive inferiority complex towards her painfully-stoic sister, and a true passion for her hobby of robotics. Her friend/significant other? Kai is, at first, an apathetic gamer who just tags along to make sure she's safe. Over the course of the show, he grows into a young man who isn't afraid to show dedication to both his friends and his hobbies.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters also receive pretty solid arcs - Furugoori starts off as a hardcore NEET, yet she slowly comes out of her shell to fully embrace the positive benefits of socializing. Jun is rather meek at first too, but also steps into her own spotlight of fighting for what she believes in. Hikada, the 'Smart One' of the club, even proves to his father that what he wants to do isn't 'completely pointless' and is worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some characters that don't receive enough characterization. The antagonists are unfortunately rather shallow, with very little revealed about their motives despite getting a decent amount of backstory. Aki's sister, Misa, is too stoic for me to ever 'feel' for her, and the ending didn't change that one bit. There are other characters, like Airi and Mitchie, but they don't even warrant such discussion.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 7]\\n\\n\r\nRobotics;Notes isn't perfect by any means, but it isn't horrible. I'm now more interested in the VN, mostly to see if it could have done better. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants characterization like Steins;Gate; However, be warned that the storytelling is messy at best.",

It started off good, giving a mystery vibe to an otherwise boring and lackluster start, after which it turns into something quite different.. although i won't go into too much detail regarding that. All i can say about it that it starts good and then spirals down into the toilet.\r\nArt: It's Production I.G., you know that they are stellar when itcomes to animation. The animation throughout the show felt consistent and great, and it was quite a joy to watch when it came to that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is yet another downfall that this anime has. I couldn't really stand the 2 openings of the show so i just skipped them, and the soundtrack wasn't that special, although it wasn't anything bad either. Voice acting was also pretty good, no voice actor that sounded annoying or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Daitoku Junna: Cute girl who also happens to know karate.\\n\\n\r\nFurugoori Kona: Weird and outright creepy girl who happens to be the creater of the game \"Killer Ballad\", a game that is loved by our main MAIN character.\\n\\n\r\nHidaka Subaru: I don't really know what to say about this guy.\\n\\n\r\nSenomiya Akiho: The leader of the Robotics Club, and her mission in life is to build the gigantic robot known only as Gan-Tsuku, which was started by her sister Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to our main MAIN character, Yashio Kaito: I'm going to start by the fact that i hate his eyebrows, and now with that out of the way, let us continue. As mentioned before, Kaito loves playing the video game Kill Ballad, not to mention he belongs to the Robotics;Club aswell. After the incident known as Anemone-gou Incident, he gets these spasms quite often that makes time seem to move extremely slower for him. Kaito isn't interested in helping the Robotics Club at all, and prefers to play his game whenever he can.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely liked the first couple episodes that gave off the mystery vibe to the show, but as the show progressed i enjoyed it less and less.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the numerical scores:\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nSince this is my first review, do tell on what i can improve in the future, in the case i feel like writing more reviews.",

            "content": "When I heard that the writer of Steins;Gate, my favorite anime series was coming out with a new anime I became giddy. I waited with baited breath for this show, and when it finally came and gone, I was left feeling...... empty and not for the right reasons either. This anime was a huge disappointment, especially when you inevitably compare Robotics; Notes to it's predecessor. \r\nUltimately its downfall was that the mental patients were left to run the sanatorium. There were too many big ideas, and themes that were going on at the same time. The creators had a grandiose idea, and were not ableto properly execute all of their ideas. This anime is a classic case of \"less is more\". \\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame too, because Robotics;Notes was a promising anime. The characters were not bad by any means, and the setting was done well,  and the animation and soundtrack were top notch. Where this anime REALLY shines is the set up. Robotics;Notes creates this incredibly eerie set up to the events which take place. It send is an intense atmosphere that almost sends shivers up your spine. Unfortunately what comes after is either not so good, or makes no sense from a logical standpoint. \\n\\n\r\nMy last thought on this anime is I felt as if they were trying to create another Steins;Gate. The premise is different, but many of the events, conspiracies, and such all seem like they were a cheap rip off of Steins;Gate. They were trying to replicate the formula which brought them success, but failed. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a good anime to watch if you have nothing else to do, and are looking for nothing but a time waster. This anime was mildly entertaining, yet disappointing. If you can accept the fact that it is not Steins;Gate you may find yourself enjoying it.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes is probably the most \"realistic\" mecha out there, not really an expert in the genre, but hell, this is barely mecha, and  it was great.\r\nThe first half was really good too, the characters were well done and Aki's relationship with Kaito was pretty cool, barely enough hints for you to understand that they are in love with each other but haven't confessed.\r\nKona is by far the best character, she is hilarious and she makes so many references, it's fantastic, also seeing her develop her crush on Kaito was pretty enjoyable.\r\nBUT, the last episodes just went downhill, to the point where Kaito's confession becamethe best part of the last 4 episodes. Aki tries to confess but doesn't do it because it commonly sets a tragic death flag in mecha animes, an original response to a confession without a doubt, but they kiss nonetheless which confirms their feelings. UNFORTUNATELY, it feels as if the series had too many things going on at the same time, that the only way to put it together was with a deus ex. The ending episodes are pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty cool, sometimes it wasn't the greatest but it was great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was great until the end, where there were so many plot holes and questions unanswered it was almost rage inducing.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment for the first 15 episodes (more or less) was just excellent, 9/10. The last few... were a 7/10 because of the amount of \"coincidences\"/cliches.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was really great because of the \"realistic\" side of a mecha anime, but there are so many  bad points to the story that it really outweighs the good points",

Don't watch this thinking of it as a sequel to Steins;gate, instead think of it as it's own anime even though it is a sequel.

Okay, fair. That in itself could be a very interesting anime. Did you really need to include the part where they save the world too? Like if you wanted to do a mech, do a mech anime from the get go. If you wanted to do a slice of life, do a slice of life. I really enjoyed the beginning half of the anime where it was actuallya slice of life mixed in with a little mystery. Then it just started to tumble downhill...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. This anime takes place in the same universe as Steins;Gate, so you don't need to worry about the animation and art being bad. I thought the color scheme was pretty and the designs for the robots are sweet.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are flat all except the main character. The rest of the cast has close to no character development save for the fact that one of the characters gets over her fear of robots. The protagonist, however, has loads of character development. What can you expect? He pilots a giant robot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the didn't need all the build up to a big mech anime fight scene. I would've liked the show more if there wasn't hocus pocus robot fighting stuff. (Might be biased on this since I hate the generic mech genre). Building robots is cool. Fighting by controlling them even better. I'm a bit against the piloting stuff though. Such a shame. I really liked the first half.",

            "content": "Robotics;Notes : A sci fi anime but not try to make it close to reality\r\nOkay, I have watched Steins;Gate before, and I will compare this anime according to my experienced with Steins;Gate.\r\nRobotics;Notes, the story is kind of normal and mainstream on the first few episodes. It's about a group of high school friends doing their club activities. The story got interesting when the main male character encounter an event and he got his own adventure. Soon after the story become complicated with a lot of mystery. In that universe that was a legendary mecha anime which the main female character really like. At first Ithought that this show will somehow related to the main storyline, but it's actually not in a way that I hoped. After various events and encounter they solve the problem and it's ended in a good way. Like Steins;Gate who bring the SERN, LHC, and Time Traveling theory, Robotics;Noes also has something similar to that. They are JAXA, EXOSKELETON, NASA, and The Solar Flare. The story is interesting, but some part just didn't connected. The story will just score 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe other part of the story was great. The character also great. Both the main male and female character are not randomly change. They keep that character personality just like that till the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is VERY GOOD. You will enjoy it, try to watch it. If you like Steins;Gate, you probably would like this show. Both are scientific but somehow they try to keep it as close as reality. \\n\\n\r\nI write this review based on my personal opinion. Of course anybody can agree or disagree. But, if you're disagree, just post comment on my profile or message me. I will gladly discuss it with you.\\n\\n\r\nPlease enjoy the show and thanks for reading my review.\\n\r\nHope it helps.\\n\\n\r\nWineZ...",

            "content": "I'm not sure what I expected, but it actually is an anime about robots. It just tries to present the (mecha) genre in a new way, by attempting to shift it from fantasy to reality. So at times it deconstructs the mecha genre, but it doesn't commit to it the way I'd expect. It just goes halfway with the real life approach mentality. It wants best of both words but it ends up missing both of them in the process. That said, it would be inaccurate to call this mecha anime, but it would also be inaccurate to not call it that. I guess thatin itself is a plus.\\n\\n\r\nSome of its style and themes are similar to Steins;Gate, mainly the scientific conspiracy plot coupled with otaku culture, in near future SF setting. Same as S;G, it's praiseworthy that even though it's aimed a lot at otaku culture, it stays clear from fanservice. It has a decent amount of great scenes and characters, and two outstanding voice roles. Fast paced plot is also a plus, along with great production quality. One of its major problems is the blatant disregard for physics when plot feels like it, which I could overlook if earlier on series didn't insist on accurate physics to deconstruct the genre and advance the plot. \\n\\n\r\nOne other major problem are loose threads. Not everything gets explained by the end, some things are just blatantly overlooked. Best example is the stuff with monopoles. Don't expect that to make sense or be explained... at all. Writers just needed an excuse to violate physics, so they figured they'd make excuses randomly fall from the sky. It's almost poetic now that I think about it. On top of this, series worst offense is probably it's convoluted nature. It's almost as if J.J.Abrams himself wrote it. Just one mystery after another, overlapping with additional mysteries everywhere, and for every one that gets answered two more pop up. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, it results in characters doing things because the plot demands it, which often comes across feeling forced and artificial. A lot of scenes don't seem to have actual purpose (space elevator what?) and appear to be there just to be cool or mysterious or something. It defocuses the plot and makes the hard-to-follow mystery even harder to follow. Story takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's actually fun to watch for the most part, with middle section being the best part, even seeming like 9/10 at times. Too bad the ending arc pretty much destroys it and betrays any faith you put into it. There's a little bit of romance mixed in and that at least works out well enough.",

The fact that the events are linked only very slowly is boring, we did not even want to know what will happen in the next episode, unfortunately. 4/10\r\nThe graphic style, however, like most anime I see are very good, and he is also part, I have notmuch to say about it, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same sound, not much to say about it, it is more than okay. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, however, are meanwhile ... meaningless, the main character makes me want to smack him so I find it boring, heroin is as boring as him, but even a little less.

No. You'll see that it becomes promising and then the plot just fall below average. The characters are shallow and there was a lot that could be cut out to make way for the real conspiracy. \r\nSome episodes were good but this anime has a continuing plotlineand I think they did not space the episodes out well. If they chose well to flesh out the story and reduce the backstory for the characters, this will work better. \\n\\n\r\nUnless you have plenty of time, I won't recommend this as you will get disappointed.

            "content": "Hi, just for info, i have watched Chaos;Head , Steins;Gate , and Robotics;Notes. The way i will review just Robotics;Notes will be the way of comparing these 3 per parts. For those who haven't watched the anime itself, i recommend not reading my review due to possible spoilers. We off to the plot.\r\n8/10. R;N 's way of plot is like S;G, dividing the plot into two halves. However, R;N even divides the first half into two stories. The first one being the Robotics Club creates a giant robot, a light, comedic, plot. The second one is Kaito solving the reports with a help of anAI, rather normal, mystery plot. Entering the second half, it doesn't really creates a big twist, unlike in S;G where in ep 12 and 13, the big twist start. In R;N, the twist comes around ep 16 or 17, which is more than half of the anime. Now let's start comparing.\\n\\n\r\nR;N first half is a light plot with a touch of mystery, compared to S;G, i will say, the comedic parts are kind of the same. The mystery part is actually developed better than S;G because the mystery, why Kurisu lives, is kind of forgotten and being replaced with the comedy. I can't really compare this to C;H because they don't divide themself. We'll talk about this later. The second half however, seems kind of rushed. While it's true, they manage to combine the light plot and the mystery into one action anime in the end, it kinda gives the latter part somewhat sour compared to the first part. If you compare this to S;G 's, this is actually second rate. To look the anime itself as a whole, this anime is not bad because it manages to combine two miniplot, which looked like there is no connection at the beginning into a one great plot. Compared to C;H, this actually is better because the action sci-fi makes much more sense but compared to S;G, this left much more unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto art, i have to say, 10/10. The art is the best compared to C;H and S;G. R;N was created by Production I.G and this is a mecha anime, we expect a lot of course. C;H art is just normal with no special art effect to me. S;G art is actually kind of a downer compared to the plot but not comparing, the art itself is actually normal, but better than C;H. R;N on the other hand is actually executed pretty well and the mecha animation is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound is 8/10. The sound, to me, is not really emphasizing on the anime itself. Since sound actually really emphasize on thriller animes while the thrills in R;N is not really that strong, the sounds helps, but not as much as S;G 's. And, to be fair, the sound actually is defeated as well by C;H, because in C;H, they use the sound good enough to emphasize the delusions. The first OP is actually great, it creates kind of a strong buildup, while the second one support them as well. The same goes for the ED as well. In comparation, C;H OP is kinda neck to neck with R;N and compared to S;G, S;G's OP is neck to neck as well i guess. Even subjectively, these 3 in OP is good. The ED however, i will say R;N is better compared to those three.\\n\\n\r\nOK, characters then. 8/10.  MCs are up first. R;N's MC is Kaito, a lazy high-schooler who just wants to play game, becomes a hero that saves the world in the end. I have to say, Kaito's character does not really match the story itself. He doesn't show his optimism even until the very end. He just changed when the world is about to be ruined. Somewhat weird to me and kinda not really lived to the MC part. Comparing time. C;H's Takumi is a delusional, hikkikomori character at the beginning. In the end, he finds out about himself and he changes to a shounen hero and just change himself nearing the end of the anime. S;G's Okarin is a chuunibyou character which changes in the second half of the anime into a serious, problem solver character, a somewhat rare MC in nowadays even the past. I personally say, Kaito is the lowest among these MCs. Basically it's just his attitude though. Next are other characters. In C;H and R;N, the other characters are developed well enough to fill the anime. In S;G, they are developed as well but knowing that there are actually multiple characters that are important as well, this kinda backfires with S;G with eventually developing most only to 3 characters. Female MCs now. R;N MC is Akiho. Her story actually plays a plot in here and her story is developed well. C;H has 7 female MCs, in which all of them are important and developed well, judging the number of episodes and the number of female MCs. S;G has 5 (count to 6 including traps, lol) but only 2 is really developed as a MC while the other 3/4 can actually be an important character as well. But the development of the 2 MCs are awesome. In ranks, i have to say that R;N is the lowest among the other female MCs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment part. 7/10. R;N is a good anime, there is no doubt about that. At least, it will make you to keep watching, unless you got bored by the first half of the anime. Compared to C;H, the enjoyment is better and yet, because the enjoyment is kinda killed in ep 16 or 17, this might make you not to watch it anymore. But considering the twist, it will make you to finish the anime. However, R;N does not keep me at the edge of my seat unlike S;G. S;G's episode is a must watch because it gives the thrill and enjoyment in every episode, especially the second half. I didn't really feel it when watching R;N.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i give R;N 8/10. The reason for this is because, the art was the best compared to C;H and S;G. What gives a downfall to me is the enjoyment, and the sound. While C;H is a much more disappointment to me, R;N does not give me the thrills i once had in S;G and it kinda breaks my heart. The sound, while not talking about OP and ED, is not used really well to support the anime.\\n\\n",

For the rest the style is pretty much like steins;gate.\\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is a GREAT serie that you shouldt miss, is not just at the category of it epic secuel but in some moments even better. Be patient just enjoy what ur watching, when you less spect will start to love and cannot stop watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust the humble opinion of a fan that saw way to much anime x)\\n\\n",
