            "content": "Please read my review before pressing that nothelpful button\r\nCool is what rules in this anime. Everything in the artwork, characters, attitude, and even the story just emanates cool and they even do it with an attitude. As you already know it's about a girl named Yukari thats not to sure about her future. Just by a chance encounter on the street gets discovered by the most unsuitable of characters.\r\nStory - (Outstanding)\r\nThe story is a typical love drama, but the setting, characters, and personalities are what make this completely different from the rest of group. It takes a more realistic approach toward drama. Something you'd seeout of a prime time drama show on TV would be more comparable than any other anime. They take life and their hardships and don't really &quot;anime coat&quot; it. Things like arguing, love, and brainstorming are done with a minimum of two people, its never one sided. When i mean 'anime-coating,' i mean like areguments are hardly ever one sided, both persons actually prove a good point. Love is also a good point, it actually gets some resolve and doesn't stay in &quot;should i confess to him&quot; anime-limbo. But already, I'm saying a bit much but since the anime is a short and fast 12 episodes, it makes sense for it not to drag such emotions like love and friendship. It defintely has the feel of a western drama instead of an anime drama. \\n\\n\r\nArt - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe art work is also something that surprised me. Like any average viewer, they'd get wierded out if they start seeing their anime characters with proportionate body parts (i.e. normal sized eyes, mouth, and even a nose). Once the shock of adjusting to the art style, this is easily one of the best looking show's i have ever layed eyes on. It's also centered around pop-culture and style, so everything they wear is completely trendy and detailed. From safety pins as piercings, hair stylings, makeup, and even clothing are displayed with insane detail. At any one time, you can count all the earrings on one characters ear, or how many necklaces one is wearing, and even the type of fabric is on their scarf. Every character actually dresses different every episode and thats quite a refreshing take as opposed to the same-school-clothes-everyday-look of other dramas. My favorite part of the show (and what you should notice) is how they manage to make Yukari even more beautiful than before every episode. You'll notice the subtle changes in not her clothing but her attitude and demeanor as well.\\n\r\nOn occasion, some anime are only able to survive with great artwork and have a horrible storyline but this manages to have both an outstanding artwork and story. On top of that having to put real world product placement (Jaguar, Benz, Sony, Zipper, etc) just increases the detail tenfold. \\n\\n\r\nSound - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe sound effects are nothing spectacular but you will notice one thing. There is a rather large lack of it. And that is how it should be in a drama. Nothing should interfere with the drama unfolding on the screen. So all that you're left with is the top notch, tear jerking, believable voice acting and environmental sound effects. The music is placed very skillfully as well. For the most part, they'll be played on jukeboxes, radios, and the like. And they're actual j-pop songs playing instead of just instrumentals. And speaking of j-pop, the OP was just perfect for for the show, as it had the feel of a Madonna-ish song which gave it a 'glamorous' feeling to set you in the mood of watching it. And the ED song by Franz Ferdinad is just pure fun. Especially how they manage to blend it with the end of the episode to the credits and don't just do a quick cut to the credits like normal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe characters are something to believe as well. Once all the characters are through with the introductions you will notice one thing right away. They are all so carefree and believable. I even had a nostalgic feeling seeing how the characters would talk amongst each other and just enjoyed the moment. Of course it doesn't the story doesn't stray too far away from Yukari since she is the star of this show. They all play their role so believably I can't help but have this feeling of amazement that there ARE anime that can pull off such intriguing drama. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThis show is unlike any other drama anime I have seen to date (top right). Rather, its more comparable to things like the likes of Greys Anatomy, the O.C., or even Party of Five. If you like or enjoy shows such as that I highly recommend giving this eye candy of an anime a try. I even found this A LOT better than Lovely Complex. Don't be fooled by the artwork if you find it a turnoff, its one of the best anime drama's I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nXinil said it best: &quot;it's for a mature audience. It doesn't cater to narutards&quot; \\n\r\n...thats the truth",

            "content": "So there are very few anime in this world that can satisfy you completely. They give you everything you want and then some delivered in a neatly wrapped box with a bow. This anime does nothing but deliver from the very first episode up until the last few seconds of the series. But let me be frank; If you're looking for a cutesy series that sugar coats all of its drama in anime cliches then get out and don't let the door hit you on your way out. This anime is not for you! With that said let's move on.\r\nParadise Kiss accomplishes so many thingsin just 12 episodes that it can almost leave you thirsting for more but deep down you know that there can be no more. The story itself is the centerpiece of everything and drives itself forward with meaningful interactions and tense drama that thickens the plot as it unfolds. What is most notable about the series is it's realistic approach to drama and how it refuses to sugar coat things and drag out emotions across all 12 episodes. If I recall the main characters quickly start their relationship by about the 2nd or 3rd episode. This anime may seem impatient, but in reality it's just not going to wait around for the fun to start. The show steps into deep waters and treads where most others would not. It goes much farther than I had anticipated and shows how much its characters develop over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character goes from being this tense study bug to being a care-free fashion model. Her transformation isn't this instantaneous change that happens at 15 minutes into episode 6 or something; but rather it takes place over time. The first thing that happens is a hair cut. I actually commented out loud as I was watching and said \"she actually doesn't look all THAT pretty here...\" But I stuck it out and to my surprise she seemed to get prettier every episode. Her style changed, her hair changed, her personality blossomed into something new and exciting, and she becomes someone who is definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles a handful of sub plots but doesn't loose control of them or allow them to impede on the main story's progress. the majority of the side characters have stories of their own and are all expertly told in a very short amount of time. In some cases characters stories aren't discussed in the show but rather in the manga and there's even a scene where a character tells you that you can \"read more about him\" in a particular manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound weave together to create this tapestry of pop-art that seamlessly mixes with the characters. The opening and closing theme were chosen so expertly and serve only to set the mood for the show. The ending theme is even mixed in with the last 10-15 seconds of the show so that it seamlessly transitions into the credits.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is quite possibly the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen with an ending that didn't disappoint. Instead of having this storybook happily ever after ending you are quickly faced with reality. Sure the characters kind of succeeded in what they were trying to do, but reality has to set in at some point and the show reminds us that we live in the real world. The ending however does tie up any and all loose ends and leaves almost nothing to the imagination. It also doesn't leave room for a second season so there's no chance of a spin-off brought on by money grubbing producers. Never have I been faced with an anime that literally left me in a daze after its credits rolled on episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a masterpiece in its own genre. It masterfully and skillfully tells a straight forward, but complex story complete with sub plots, exciting drama, and cool music to boot. I also liked that characters didn't spend 10 minutes arguing in tense situations. Example: man is holding a gun pointing it at another character(lets call him teppei kun). Teppei kun gives this long monologue about his life and how he's always been alone and blah blah blah. In reality the guy would've just shot him for talking way too much.\\n\\n\r\nok. I've talked for far too long now. This anime is a masterpiece. Watch it!\\n",

            "content": "Title: Paradise Kiss\r\nManga/Anime: Paradise Kiss was originally a manga created by Ai Yazawa (famous for Nana), and ran in the Japanese fashion magazine Zipper from the April 2000 issue to the March 2004 issue.  Five volumes have been compiled, and all have been released, both in Japan, and Stateside from Tokyopop.\r\nThe anime was produced by Studio Madhouse (famous for Death Note, Paranoia Agent, and Devil May Cry, among others), directed by Osamu Kobayashi (who also directed Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad and Kimagure Orange Road), and ran on Japanese TV from October 13th, 2005 to December 29th, 2005.  It has been licensed Stateside byGeneon, and the third and final volume was released this April.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story centers around Yukari, a high school student who's basically been living for nothing but her mom's expectations, figuring out what she wants to do (professional modeling), by virtue of being recruited for a school fashion show by a group of designers who call themselves Paradise Kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is WIN.  Like Victorian Romance Emma, this show had me grinning like an idiot at least once every episode.  This is one of the few shows where I've liked every main character straight off the bat.  It's fun to watch all the relationships in this story play out, and to see Yukari deciding what she wants to do with her life and going after it.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, there's a really convoluted love polygon going on, but then it splits into two triangles that kind of connect.  But the relationships serve as nice counterpoints to each other, and they're filled with plenty of drama.  In fact, there's a mirror to almost every major relationship between characters in this show, and it's really nice.  It shows you how things could turn out, or what they could've been like.  It's a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how close this is to the manga, but I do know that Ai Yazawa worked pretty closely with Kobayashi on the adaptation, so I don't think people have too much to get worked up over.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There is sex, there is nudity, there is a guy who dresses up and acts like a girl.  If this makes you go 'EW!', don't watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series can be summed up in two words: absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nReally, though.  Madhouse has a bit more realistic style than you see from other studios, and it really fits this series to a tee.  The random SD that pops up is fun, too.  And the colors they use for clothes and backgrounds tend to reflect atmospheres.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving the outfits a whole separate paragraph, because they deserve it.  You can tell that Madhouse gave this series a big budget, because characters change outfits at least once an episode, usually even more.  And the outfits were all designed by a professional, and you can tell.  Every outfit that they use for this series is absolutely beautiful, and there are quite a few designs that I would buy, if they existed in real life.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The OP and ED are &acirc;?&yen;.  Tommy February 6's OP 'Lonely in Gorgeous' captures the mood of the show perfectly, and the ED... well, Franz Ferdinand's 'Do You Want To' is for the win, so I don't really care how it relates to the show. :D\\n\\n\r\nBackground music for the show is actually done more as ambient music (i.e. songs being played on a CD/ radio station), and it's a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Absolutely no complaints here.  The show ambles along at its own pace, and it works very well.  The actual climax of the series is the second to last episode, and the last episode is a wrap-up of sorts, similar to what happens in Gankutsuou.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: I recognize some of the seiyuu ' from where, I have no clue whatsoever.  I can't access the site that I can cross-check the seiyuu with their other roles at the moment, so this section will be edited later on.  However, like normal, no problems here.\\n\\n\r\nDub: N/A, haven't seen it just yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Excellently written, beautifully animated series, with plenty of drama and counterpoint, with a killer OST, too.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 39/50; 78% (C)",

            "content": "This is one of the few series I finished in a hurry. The story was going so well until the ending &ndash; it left me under whelmed. Sure it made me a bit teary &ndash; eyed, but it was so disappointing compared to the rest of the series. \r\nI really love the story though &ndash; I am a fashion freak. I love anything that has something to do with fashion, and I love anime. Combining two of my loves is a plus. I just thought it was relatable. Doesn&rsquo;t everyone feel like Caroline sometimes? Like you want to break free and actually do what youwant? I also like how the anime chronicles how Caroline deals with all the changes that she had to face and how she makes her decisions.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters. They&rsquo;re all so good looking! There&rsquo;s Caroline, of course. Wild child trying to break free out of her serious shell. She&rsquo;s so pretty. Then there&rsquo;s the eccentric George, the bad boy of the story. The adorable Miwako and the rest of her family that&rsquo;s just as adorable. Arashi, my favorite, who despite his looks is actually a man with morals. Finally, Isabella, the resident cross dresser &ndash; who I think is actually cool. What I like about these characters is they change throughout the series, especially Caroline. They actually all have depth &ndash; which is hard to accomplish especially in an anime that is only 12 episodes long. I would like to note that I like George and Caroline&rsquo;s relationship, even though it was kinda weird sometimes. It&rsquo;s like they would constantly fight and make up, and this is mostly due to George&rsquo;s lack of ability to love. \\n\\n\r\nThe drawing style was interesting. One minute it&rsquo;s normal (drawing style actually reminds me of BECK a bit) then it&rsquo;s chibi form, but it&rsquo;s not the usual chibi form. I think the chibi style they made use of was similar to the drawing style in the original anime series, where Paradise Kiss was spun off from. &ldquo;Real&rdquo; visuals were also used, but mostly during the scenes before the opening theme. I applaud the details on inanimate objects &ndash; from the sewing machine in the atelier to George&rsquo;s car. They almost look lifelike. Colors are ok, and are nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay. I was a bit uncertain when it came to Caroline&rsquo;s voice, since I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it fit her. I did like Arashi&rsquo;s voice &ndash; it fit his personality well. In fact, I do think that everyone&rsquo;s seiyus matched their personalities except for Caroline. I just found it to be a bit low and rough. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great too &ndash; The opening theme was cute. I heard Tommy February was actually a famous pop star in Japan, and I can tell. I really love &ldquo;Lonely in Gorgeous&rdquo;. The ending song surprised me &ndash; since it&rsquo;s from Franz Ferdinand, and I&rsquo;m actually a fan of their music. The first time I watched it I was like &ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this Franz Ferdinand?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad their music matched the theme of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I liked the series &ndash; but somehow I don&rsquo;t see it as my favorite yet. It&rsquo;s definitely somewhere there, maybe if I watched it again I&rsquo;ll like it more. I think the problem is the love love scenes made me a bit awkward &ndash; specially I watched most of the episodes in broad daylight. The scenes were just explicit. Anyway, I can&rsquo;t argue with the fact that I do like it. I watched it in three days, and 8 episodes on one day, after all.",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss is an anime aimed at the shoujo audience, but what sets this anime apart from all other shoujo anime is it's unique characterisation and atypical storyline.  \r\nStory - 9\r\nParadise Kiss is a short anime about how a young 18 year old girl's life is changed completely when a group of fashion design students kidnap her off the street to model their dress for a school fashion show.  The main female protagonist falls in love with the main male protagonist and a love story is revealed.  What sets this anime aside from the rest of the 'typical shoujo/romance' anime is thatthe relationship between the two are not as simple as it seems.  The story itself has a realistic element to it making it more suitable for a mature audience rather than what the word shoujo literally implies.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nPersonally, i love Ai Yazawa's artwork, the setting was drawn realistically to compliment the whole aspect of a realistic life and story.  I was surprised to see how everything was drawn perfectly, the anime itself felt like one from 2007/08 rather than 2005.  The characters were perfect, nothing was really out of place, the males did not look over glamourous nor did the females look over pitiful.  The whole urbanised setting gave the anime and overal fashionable and trendy feel to it.  The only flaw i could notice was the characters looked odd when they were far away but when they were close up, every detail could be shown. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were catchy songs and suited the anime well, it created a funky feel to the anime and the way the opening was brought in for each episode really made the song a part of the anime rather than your general opening you have for every anime.  The anime lacked BGM at times, but for this anime, having less of it was much more suitable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters were definately one of this anime's strong points, almost the whole story revolves around the basis of clashing characters working together and becoming friends (or more than friends even).  It also shows how one person can change another's outlook on life and their personality.  Ai Yazawa is successful in showing how Yukari's whole life changes in a very short amount of time purely by making friends with the \"bad crowd\" and realising her ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIf you've watched NANA, then Paradise Kiss doesn't stray too far from the basic concepts in NANA.  The whole mature, real life drama is what makes Paradise Kiss enjoyable.  If you're looking for a short, sweet, drama-filled, not-your-typical-shoujo anime then i'd highly recommend you give Paradise Kiss a try.",

            "content": "Some encounters in life can be so unpredictable, short yet oftentimes worthwhile that they shake the very fundamentals of our ideals and principles. That is when we start to change, either for better or for worse. Paradise Kiss (henceforth abbreviated as ParaKiss) starts with one such encounter of Yukari Hayasaka and George Koizumi. \r\nNote: Paradise Kiss is also the name of the clothing line formed by George and three other members.\r\nThe story follows your everyday school girl Yukari who happens to pass by one of the members of ParaKiss and subsequently meets the other two members of ParaKiss. Out of nowhere, she is asked tomodel for them in the upcoming school festival, which results in a flat out \u2018No\u2019. Not until later in the first episode do we witness her fateful encounter with the charismatic George. George once again asks her to model for them and gives her three days time. After an unanticipated turn of events she starts to think more and more about the eccentric group and finally decides to model for them. This decision transforms her hitherto simple life into turmoil of romance, dreams, ambitions, and angst, and her life starts to flow in a direction that she could have never imagined.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and proceeds smoothly, but what keeps the viewer glued to the screen is that it is presented with elegance, style and attitude. With the story being simple there is room for character to interact freely and develop as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe realistic and strong characters further endear the story to the viewers. The protagonist, Yukari is a simple girl, and despite possessing good looks, a well toned figure and above average height, she doesn\u2019t indulge herself in fashion. She has been living a life marked with academic diligence that is until she meets the people from ParaKiss. She is encouraged to forge a new path by watching the passion that drives the others in ParaKiss to lead their lifestyles. The main credit for Yukari\u2019s development goes to George. It is his straight-forward and ambitious nature that brings forth her desires. It is with his help that she is able to challenge her future instead of succumbing to a secure but unexciting life. Marked with elegance, charisma and pomp, the male lead George at times presents an inscrutable front that leaves the viewers puzzled towards his motives while at other times he is like an open book. His beguiling nature is well received by his teammates and he often gets what he wants, yet on the other hand he has the etiquettes of a perfect gentleman. George is depicted with so many different traits that it makes him unpredictable at times and is considered to be one of his charm points.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions between Yukari and George are handled thoughtfully; sometimes resulting in disagreements between the two akin to those in real life relationships. The viewer is easily entrapped every time an argument breaks out between them and unsure of what developments that may lead to. The relationship of Yukari and George is relatable to real life relationships; and one we may all benefit from learning a thing or two from. The deuteragonists are given a decent role and past. While personally they don\u2019t have much character development, they are instrumental in shaping Yukari and George\u2019s burgeoning romance and personal growth. All the characters are thoroughly worked out and moreover, they are defined with respective individuality.\\n\\n\r\nCorrespondingly, the characters are designed stylishly and distinctively. Madhouse, known for its eccentric and ingenious animation, has managed to live up to its reputation. ParaKiss\u2019s story revolves around fashion, hence the character designs need to be innovative and elegant. Madhouse did its job perfectly and all the characters are designed in an attractive light. However, the male characters have a more effeminate look than the female characters. Arashi, one of the deuteragonists, might have a masculine outlook because of his piercings and funky hair style, but the same cannot be said in George\u2019s case, all he needs is long hair and he\u2019ll be the embodiment of the word \u201cBeautiful\u201d. Isabella, also one of the deuteragonists, is always in a woman\u2019s attire, and they both look prettier than Yukari. Majority of the shoujo mangaka draw their male leads to aesthetically entrance the female audience.  Now, this is not a complaint but merely an observation. If shounen manga/anime can have women with perfectly toned body and unbelievably huge racks then why can\u2019t men have a more androgynous presence. Well, I guess that\u2019s why people call them \u2018Bishounen\u2019. That being said, all the characters are presented charmingly. Furthermore, the facial expressions are animated really well and one can easily tell what the character is going through given their emotive eyes and gestures.\\n\\n\r\nParaKiss definitely belongs to the upper echelons in character designs. Background animations are not as impressive as the character designs. Madhouse didn\u2019t invest much time in animating the backgrounds with detail. While that doesn\u2019t enhance the overall quality of animation, it didn\u2019t undermine it either. \\n\\n\r\nSound is another aspect where ParaKiss doesn\u2019t fail to surprise. The engine sound of a vintage Jaguar and the variation of sounds in dialogues adjusted according to the distance of the screen from where the conversation is being held, really points to some meticulous work. The seiyuu did a wonderful job in adapting to their roles. And all the seiyuu seemingly fit to their characters. Some may find Marika Matsumoto, Miwako\u2019s seiyuu, a bit annoying at first because of her cracking yet sometimes cutesy voice but it does suit Miwako\u2019s personality. And in the end of the series Marika is one of the seiyuu that leaves a notable impression. The sound department truly shines in OP and ED songs. The OP, \u2018Lonely in Gorgeous\u2019 is probably viewed as one of the best and the most addictive songs in the year 2005. The ending song, \u2018Do You Want To\u2019 is pretty good as well, and both OP and ED songs provide a unique atmosphere to ParaKiss. \\n\\n\r\nThe unique and glamorous characters, great character designs and unparalleled opening song make Paradise Kiss a memorable anime. This anime is recommended to anyone who is looking for a good and authentic romance show. As for enjoyment, it is purely subjective, but I\u2019ll share some personal pearls of wisdom: don\u2019t have expectations before even starting the series. Eventually you\u2019ll be entertained in some way or the other.\\n",

            "content": "The storyline is relatively good. The themes covered are quite basic, but it is very effective in the sense that it touches on the bringing of life of a girl. \r\nThe story is about Yukari, a studious student who fails to live up to her parent's expectations. One day, while walking to cram school, she meets a group of designers, under the name of Paradise Kiss. Only when she is scolded by Arashi, a male designer, does she open and realise that the world does not revolve around studying. \r\nIn itself, the mangaka Ai Yazawa is able to elevate the story, while able to relateto the girl's frustrations, and progressively develop Yukari's character (nicknamed Caroline) from an antisocial, bitchy character to a friendly, warm, firm woman. \\n\\n\r\nThe art resembles that of Yazawa's art. Only the animation of the settings really annoyed me. The contrasts between the realness of the setting and the edgedness of the characters really disturbed me, as it becomes in a sense, like the characters are misplaced into reality. Part of the reason that people watch anime is to escape reality and have a bit of fun, and the effect of putting anime characters into real life scenes, I think was rather inappropriate. Furthermore, I thought that the beginning of each episode, with the different scenes, and random animals was quite bizarre, especially when they didn't really relate to the content of the anime. If I recall right, I remember the manga had none of these things. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was okay, with tommyfebruary6's \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" emphasised the poshness of the fashion industry, both behind the scene designing as well as modelling. What really bothered me was the end song, Franz Ferdinand's \"Do you want to\" made it sound like a rock anime, despite the poshness of it. Although it can be argued that Arashi is indeed in a rock band, it just doesn't seem right. However, the voice actors for all of the characters was well done. Especially Miwako, as her character and voice resembled each other-very cute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I RATHER enjoyed this anime. Although, I had hoped to see more designs of clothes (since I'm approaching university stage).",

            "content": "Paradise kiss is\u2026 not bad. Sorry that I just gave away 70% of my judgment right away, but from my perspective (the one I trust) there\u2019s little I can say to make it sound amazing. Ok, being fair, when you analyze its points with a more detached look (shut up, it\u2019s possible!) the series can be classified as good.\r\nStory and Characters\r\nThe story centers around Hayasaka Yukari and her involvement with the Paradise Kiss (ParaKiss for short), a studio composed of students of fashion design.\r\nThe other ones are Arashi, Miwako, Isabella and Koizume George, the main agent in convincing Yukari to join in and her futurelover through the series.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first impression of Yukari as a slightly vapid balloon of salty water thrown over sandpaper, the series gives her a little more dimension. It\u2019s a good attempt, but you might get the impression that it tried to make her \u201dtoo normal\u201d. At least I got. What I mean by that is: while her issues are relatable and realistic, there is no effort in making her more distinct inside the archetype, which might be also an effect of \u201cyou\u2019ve seen this done before\u201d. You know, the Platoon effect.\\n\\n\r\nArashi is the brash member that does little to hold his thoughts to himself, automatically making my favorite character. Outside from working with Yukari, his interactions with her are minimal, and most of what is seen of him is in relation to his girlfriend, Miwako, the emotional, upbeat, possibly moe smurfette of pre-Yukari ParaKiss.\\n\\n\r\nIsabella is a man, but don\u2019t worry about being attacked over not using the correct pronouns, she is above that. As a lesbian in the body of a man, I find her quite intriguing. She is subdued, reserved, classy, well dressed (is it a trend in Japanese TV to always have transgender/crossdressers in the most elegant attire?) and soft-spoken, close to the archetype you would see cast as a mentor-character\\n\\n\r\nGeorge is the main designer of ParaKiss. A Casanova (not a bad trait) and former infant design prodigy (raise alarms), he created he first dress for Isabella-kun when both were in third-grade. Bye-bye suspension of disbelief, see you in Black Lagoon. His character borders on being uneven: he is sometimes caring, but most often suddenly detached, has mood swings that are not discernable neither by the characters, nor the audience and will unadvertedly act harsh towards Yukari because of that. The most consistent trait he has is possibly the irresponsible genius clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode 3 begins the romance between Yukari and George. It starts with no proper explanation of how they got so close so suddenly and bares no chemistry whatsoever. Their romance is not so much a driving force for the plot as it\u2019s a source of tension. With no proper set up, though, it rings quite hollow. Arashi and Miwako for once are a pre-existing couple and most of the tension between them, mainly involving Tokumori, one of Yukari\u2019s classmates and former love interest for Miwako, is effectively established quickly, using often non-verbal language and implied feelings, and holds more impact.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nOk, first the positive: there is good care taken for the art, which looks distinct, fairly realistic and detailed. On side-note, though, this clashes with one of the short-comings of the animation, mainly the one that implies some corners had to be cut. Characters are given a wider lip-movement, but it\u2019s quite cluncky and in many cases the show focuses on characters who are not talking or just hinds the mouths, Eva-style.\\n\\n\r\nThis issue might not bother you if you prioritize art over movement since the art in Paradise Kiss is definitely stunning, but if you like that smooth flow going along with the figures, this is going to be a eyesore. Weirdly enough, there are points where character morph to a cartoonish chibi model. That\u2019s inconsistent and detracts from the rest of the art, thank you very much. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting department (Japanese, off course), it\u2019s overall serviceable, with the exception of Yukari\u2019s seyiuu Matsumoto Marika, who apparently didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the verb \u201cemote\u201d during recording. I\u2019m not familiar with other works in her name, so I\u2019ll pass on making any statement about her skills.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is my first review here I\u2019d like to point out that I mostly avoid talking about soundtrack, because it\u2019s a very personal matter and I\u2019m not even a musician. That said, I was never able to pass on watching the opening, simply because the music was gorgeous. The ending, by Franz Ferdinand, evokes a far more upbeat and quircky mood, but unfortunately was accompanied by the off-putting cartoonish look mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal ramblings\\n\\n\r\nBeing fair (because I am), outside of the main couple there is stuff in the series that is easy to get invested into, mainly Arashi and Miwako, who form a rocky but charming relationship, or Isabella, who does more with her collected and observing demeanor than with words. These side-characters are what prevent Paradise Kiss from falling into Average territory. \\n\\n\r\nBy itself the series could have done much more if it dared taking its protagonist to more than her archetype encapsulates and gave the romance a better set up, but it relied too much in concept alone. \\n\r\nCrap, that came out less personal than I had intended!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enjoyment aside, I\u2019d give the series the verdict of Good, but not \u201cIndex\u201d-good.\\n",

            "content": "I have not read the manga, so this review relies on the anime alone.\r\nSTORY: not too original but not too typical either. Parakiss has an interesting plot, rather simple and realistic with a fairytale twist, I merely took upon in because I like fashion and it really is an appealing show for ones who like fashion and the whole industry. It shows some interesting facts about certain things, a small peek into clothe designing and the whole clothes/model industry in general. It also deals a great matter with the issue of school and the pressure a lot of parents tend to put on their kidsto get good grades,it talks about friendship, family, love, romance, business and dreams. It also is a continuation of another series/ manga called Gokinjo Monogatari which I have not seen.\\n\r\nIn general story is good, simple and down to earth. 8\\n\\n\r\nART: while very beautiful with all the characters have a unique design for themselves I thought that parts looked a bit off. For example the background looked as if it is simple cut off a magazine and then placed behind the animated characters, the characters themselves moved a bit oddly giving the impression that they were out of place. It must have been low production but even though sometimes the art looks odd it still manages to look pretty. The characters are all designed beautifully with great dressing style( they are designers after all :P) and the clothes are beyond beautiful which is expected since Yazawa Ai did go to design school if my memory serves me right.8\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the op and ed are both great, TommyFebruary with her \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" as the OP rocks pretty bad ass since even though poppy and catchy the song is one of my favs and fits the whole series perfectly. The ed quite surprisingly is Franz Ferdinants \"Do you want to\" which I love. Overall good music. The background...I don't even think the background had any music and even if it did it's not memorable.8\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: now, the characters are interesting but this is were for me the show lacks. While each and every one of them is interesting (with my fav being Miwako and her crazy pink hair) I lack to feel sympathy for them or in general have any \"deep\" connection if that's possible with them.\\n\r\nHayasaka Yukari is our lead and she's is actually a person I know. I know someone just like her and we used to be friends so I guess it kind of got a bit personal for me since I never got along very well with that friend. People like Yukari exist, you can see them everyday and that's what makes her real.Yet I can't really stand her character and since she has problems with her mother you can blame it on that and whatnot which is true, but I still dislike her. Always wanting to be #1, nagging and complaining and being jealous and I dunno she just bugged me ( as I say it's probably on a personal level). Most of the characters though I didn't like much, in my eyes they're a bunch of rich kids who off course struggle to make their dreams come true but in the end of the day they are noting but that: rich kids who can afford to spend their money. With Yukari being the only one without a huge mansion I just felt the most of them were just hypocritical and shallow. \\n\r\nGeorge: the main love interested is your typical hot guy who's perfect in everything but with flaws. He's a playboy, very typical in soujo and there is really nothing too special about him besides the fact that he makes nice clothes. I didn't care.\\n\r\nArashi: Miwakos bf and the other member of Parakiss. Jealous of his girlfriend keeping in touch with an old friend. I didn't care.\\n\r\nMiwako: though I liked her as an image, her clothes, her hair, her character was bubbly and happy go lucky but she also seemed shallow. NO matter the drama they tried to give her I simply felt apathetic. Didn't care.\\n\r\nIsabella: now this one is the most interesting one I must say, but she didn't get much screen time and we really know very very little about her, so I couldn't really say much. She is interesting on her own though.\\n\r\nEverybody else....pff I just forgot about them.6\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: well While I didn't like the characters much I liked the show quite a bit, the clothes were nice, it had a few good messages here and there and a nice atmosphere. If you like clothes and the model industry you'll probably like it. Other than the clothes though I found nothing too special about it. I give this series a 7 just for the beautiful clothes and art, the characters...pff I rather live without.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime seems like your typical romantic/slice of life anime and in most ways, it is. Take for example, the totally coincidental manner in which the protagonist, Hayasaka Yukari, is singled out by the eccentric group of fashion design students, or the fairly cliched cast of characters. the thing that sets it apart though, is the development of the protagonist. She makes a gradual and plausible transition from an unmotivated high school student  to a professional model. While this is very satisfying to watch, it is ironic that the overall experience is somewhat dampened by the LACK of character development. \r\nMost of thecharacters other than the protagonist and her boyfriend have shallow personlities and are nothing more than mediocre supports. Sure, you find out a little bit about their pasts by the end of the show, but nothing that's revealed gives them any extra personality. This is one series which could've used at least 4-5 episodes more to develop all of the members of thee cast properly.  however, if you can overlook the lack of character development, the story is very well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs are very well done. The same goes for the soundtrack, especially the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would i recommend it?Well, its a tough call, the cast felt like a random assortment of characters with no real personalities to be honest. But at the same time, the development of the protagonist is very realistic. The same goes for the plot as well. If you like slice of life anime with very realistic plots and are interested in fashion, this series should be on your watch list. Even if that is not the case, you should consider watching this at some point. It isn't extraordinary by any stretch of imagination, but it is greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\\n",

Both have different personalities, priorities and interests. But both still clung to each other and try to make things work, at least up to the end of the series.\r\nI love the story (probably the best romantic story for me). Yukari is a character any simple girl can relate to. While George, is the image of a guy, any simple girl would simply dream of and stay away from. George and Yukari were definitely struggling throughout the serieswith their relationship. But they managed to work things out with a lot of understanding and by learning from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was usually set in Yukari's point of view and halfway you'd be wondering if the feeling's mutual. However, George gives us hints on how much he loves Yukari in the sweetest ways (although he likes teasing her as well). The best scenes were probably the ones when they're not together, as the care for one another is more evident.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ended perfectly and yet I felt sad about it. This is one brilliant series that is a must watch for everyone who wants to have a different romantic story.",

            "content": "This anime is very good in it its own way and very different from what i've seen myself. It has a very realistic outcome and besides True Tears I cannot find any other anime that ends up being as realistic as this one.\r\nStory (8)\r\nThough the story is rather simple, the development is it is very interesting. A girl who enters a different environment that she is used to be in and gets excited about the surroundings + gets involved with a boy. What else do you need? \r\nArt (8)\r\nI gave the art an 8 because I found it really challenging and different from what I'veseen before. For some it may be negative, but to me it was really good, and especially a sight worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly there isn't much unnecessary sound in the anime so I don't know what to say about it. All there really is to it is fine voice acting and no major sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly all characters are very believeable to being realistic. Some are a bit over the edge to make it interesting, but there isn't a single character who is overdone. It's really good to see they can keep it up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment 7 for a couple of reasons. It's very easy to watch, marathonable even which is very positive to me. Furthermore it has an easy storyline and you don't have to think too hard while watching it, just enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this anime a 7 even though I really like it, I have to admit it is very girly. I'm not gonna say 7 is low or high, but to me 7 is a really good score and then an anime is as girly as this and gets 7 it is really big. I believe this should be watched especially by girls, as it seems it would be received very postively.\\n\\n\r\n- Kukker",

            "content": "The Sensations of Paradise Kiss\r\nThat kick that comes in the pre-ED when you hear the vocals of Franz Ferdinand blaring over whatever dramatic punctuation that they\u2019ve set up for you. Of all the pre-ED kicks I know these are just about the toppest of the tops. When I think of Franz Ferdinand I think Take Me Out and the post-punk chorus that stiffens into crazy machinery that you just have to pump your feet to.\r\nThe little dance that cartoon Yukari does in the ED. While usually I skip EDs and OPs, I always watch to that part somehow, and usually beyond that. That this EDalways punctuates the dramatic motions is probably the complete opposite of that feeling you get when the chiptune-esque electric chime kicks in at the end of Shinsekai Yori. That song represents a downward flowing melancholy, but this is always an upwards flowing motion.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike some other anime I know, the upwards flowing motion always hits the ending section correctly. We don\u2019t get any Clannad dissonantic schisms.\\n\\n\r\nThe sketchy drawings of the characters as magazine fronts, each representing different fashion subcultures. Elle, Doll 10, Time and Zipper.\\n\\n\r\nWatching that OP that makes it look completely like a NANA thing, but then realizing that it\u2019s completely the opposite of a NANA thing.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the weird cut-into-life opening portion that always mixes strange animals and things with real life shots of the city. While Yukari will ruminate poetic over some aspect of the strange void of her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe one word I could always feel when watching Paradise Kiss was Naturalism. It doesn\u2019t fail to kick you right in the face, when you expect a gripping plot involving pretty boys and stylish moaning damsels, and suddenly your main character devolves from a shoujo girl into this slapstick deformed thing running jokily for her life.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting that is completely off to any notion of stylish dramatic gesture. Long stretches without any background music except diegetic noise. Everything strikes as cool, composed, organic.\\n\\n\r\nIt does a screen wipe with a weird sound effect whenever changing scenes. Do you know how off-putting this is? In a good way of course. Akira Kurosawa did the same thing in his films. But when you see a bunch of weird animals swimming past the screen you know this anime definitely wasn\u2019t made for any astounding dramatic flourish. Every cut feels like a cut of life, in its truest sense.\\n\\n\r\nFashion is the main. Everyone\u2019s Fashion is so absurdly gaudy, like a Vivienne Westwood showcase.\\n\\n\r\nHow Kobayashi works: The scene where Yukari gets slapped by her mother is told in monologue over a shot of a house. It isn\u2019t shown until later, and it has no impact, and she herself doesn\u2019t feel anything in particular from it except mild resentment. \\n\\n\r\nThings happen at a crazy fast pace, but so perfectly positioned that you feel 12 episodes is just exactly enough. How it does this is that it never lingers on dramatic moments, although everything in here screams NANA melodramatic. It figures that the most important thing is to show the process of a character\u2019s interior growth, and that is does, with her sensations towards the things happening around her, with her rumination over the possibilities of her growth, and with nothing else in mind.\\n\\n\r\nSilent cravings, of love, or passion, or meaning, are shown with a dignity, that at best will only be reflected as silent moans, or cries, or longings, but never the type that strikes purposely to pull at heartstrings. Just about the most devastating thing that happens in the last episode is so undercut that it\u2019s completely chilling. It\u2019s amazing too that the issue is solved by the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it earns the dramatic moments, these are actually hard earned. The most obvious being the well projected in advance Fashion Exhibition.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to love the focus on the small things, such as the slow dyeing of blue flowers, or stringing together a butterfly ring. The small essentially small acts which everything grand is based on. \\n\\n\r\nYou could say that Kobayashi works in a style that is essentially similar to the stringing together of a butterfly ring. Small pearls, in moments, actions, shots, and atmospheric ellipsis, are strung together into something so gaudy and powerful that the whole package feels vaster than anything else out there. Even the throbbing life and d\u00e9cor built through the slow culmination of streetside noise patterns, silent wafting through baroque cafes, and strolling through elaborate fashion sets, all feel immaculately made to sharpen your senses to the loving guiding hand that goes into such creation.\\n\\n\r\nAfter realizing all of the miniscule stuff that goes into pattern design, go Google search an Alexander McQueen dress. Really just capital-L Look at every single detail that exists on that ephemeral piece of cloth.\\n\\n\r\nLangsam Blut. Shoegaze. Spectaculariffic. Which director knows perfectly what songs to use at where-ever?\\n\\n\r\nYou know you can always say that certain works will leave a never-loosening pit in your gut, because these works have specially tailored an escape for you such that when you get out of the world you feel nothing but a yawning gulf inside that forces you to hunger for more. How many things can do what Paradise Kiss can do and reverse engineer that process, so that you come out feeling even more full?\\n",

            "content": "Story and character:\r\nI saw this anime a while back, and caught myself thinking about it long after I finished it years ago. This is a generally good sign and I'm glad I can say that George is one of the most memorable characters in anime. The story itself is about Yukari, and while I like how the plot brings out her insecurities and develop her confidence, I was captivated by George. He's a brilliant creation: bold, straight-forward, unyielding, decisive, and cool. These are traits many anime writers want to imbue into their male leads, but while some succeed, many do fail - yet what makesGeorge such a great success it that not only is he masculine in having these traits, he is a bisexual clothing designer. His character holds both feminine and masculine details that blur the lines between gender identity. And even better, he is not some gay caricature. This is a person you want leading your team.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also nothing to scoff at. Since this story focuses on individuality with an emphasis on Japanese counter-culture, the supporting cast are self sustained and believable people. Yukari, being the center of the story, undergoes a coming of age. It is to be expected that she will be annoying at times because she is so insecure about her life and decisions, but overall, her vulnerability contrasts well with George's strength. It also does well to show George's role as the fairy-god mother figure. He is cruel and curt at times, but for a spineless girl like Yukari, George is coldness proved to be the necessary push in the right direction. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nLoved the art and loved the music. The Intro is some upbeat Japanese pop song that really sets the mood. The ED is a Franz Ferdinand song so I appreciated that. The art is above and beyond. Wonderful bright colors that are used to define the character's personalities. Artistic freedom with some some of the street scenes. It's not an action anime so I didn't expect amazing fluidity, but I liked that the characters weren't too stiff and had dynamic positioning. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nIt's a very good anime. Good for those turbulent teenage years and I'm hesitant to say it, but George had a bit of an impact on me. The plot isn't too out-of-this-world complex. It's about young people finding the determination to take the first big, bold step towards their dreams. Yet, it is sensitive while maintaining a no-nonsense perspective into dealing with all those nice feelings teenagers develop. It excites a little bit of rebellion into the hearts of its viewers. In the end, what I found most memorable was George tinge of cruelty. He has a light bitter taste to him that makes him more enigmatic than his amazing style and carefree sex life.",

            "content": "It has been a true honour to have been able to experience this anime.\r\nThe story is about a young girl, Yukari, who is questioning who she wants to be. She feels as though the career ahead of her isn't what she wants. Yukari then gets a taste of the world of fashion through the new 'paradise kiss' clothing brand and takes a liking to it. She also experiences her first love through a seemingly cold man named George.\r\nStory 9/10 - The story was beautiful. It was definitely different from what I was expecting. It felt so mature which many animes lack these days. It lackeda sense of adventure but it ruled over the slice of life genre.  The ending wasn't perfect, as much as I wished it. Yet, I feel as though there couldn't have been a better ending. It was truly amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10 - The art of this anime is what stood out to me. It was really a job well done. The style shocked me at first because the bodies and faces were actually proportional *gasp*. The characters were beautiful and so detailed. The piercings and the gorgeous clothing was what stood out to me. If I didn't give this a 10 just for the clothing itself, it will haunt me until I change it.\\n\r\nOne thing I thought didn't fit into the theme was when the characters turned into ballon heads, it was strange and I thought it didn't suit the mood at times.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10 - Somehow I thought the music wasn't as up to standards. Even though the OP and ED were exceptional,  catchy and suited the anime (thus the 8), there was a complete lack of background music. I think it was because they wanted to keep it more realistic. Though, in my opinion it didn't work because I felt as though a mood was lacking. I didn't know how to react during certain scenes. I felt like I was reading a LN. I also noticed that at certain points when a faint background song can be heard, it was misplaced. Nonetheless,  the ending theme was so good so I cannot say anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - The characters were fairly good. I admit that I loved George's personality, he was different to many other characters. He was uncaring and thoughtless without being a tsundere. Yukari was a decent heroine. I have to say I would have never stayed with George for the time she lasted. She seemed like a pushover at times but redeemed herself with her will and beauty during other scenes. The supporting characters were all likable and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - I truly enjoyed this anime. I had an amazing experience. The only reason it has lost a point is because of the lack of emotion Paradise Kiss pulled out of me. I completely recommed it to anyone over 16, it has a few sexual references and scenes. Definitely will revisit this anime in the future, it has pulled me into the fashion genre.",

I've since re-watched it and really found it to be considerably better the second time around--so this review may get re-written at some point!)\r\nNot really my cup of tea. It does have a lot of redeeming values--the background art is frequently lovely, and the clothing designs for the characters (and how often they are changed) is to be admired--oftentimes anime characters are only given an outfit or two and just cycle through them, much to the relief of the animators, no doubt. That said, some ofthe more extravagant outfits here are barely animated at all--annoyingly enough, this includes the ornate dress the characters have spent the entire series hand-crafting. When we finally see it it's mostly only in still frames, or with the model wearing it being shown simply bobbing up and down as she walks. Granted, I know essentially nothing about runway fashion, but it seems to me that part of the appeal about an outfit like this would be the way it behaves as it's actually being worn and moved in, so it's disappointing to lose that dimension of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the characters are fine for the most part, though they largely remain pretty firmly rooted in anime stereotypes. There are some exceptions, which are especially noticeable in the minor characters--all of whom are more interesting than the primary protagonist, whom I actively disliked. By and large she's a typical anime heroine--klutzy, lovesick, unsure of herself, etc.--this is made up for eventually when she manages to grow a bit of a spine, but the fact that she occasionally goes into complete bitch mode doesn't really make me any more invested in her ultimate fate. Unfortunately, the side characters aren't explored to the same level of detail that she is, and the writers cheat a bit by making at least two of them very wealthy--which explains how they can get away with everything that they do without suffering much in the way of personal or social consequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also doesn't quite know when to end--the denouement stretches on for at least a full episode longer than it should, though at least it works hard to wrap up pretty much any questions fans should have about the fates of the characters they've spent so much time with up to this point. All in all, it's a fine coming-of-age story, and its frank (well, PG-13 frank) explorations of teenage lust are worthy of praise. I was ultimately underwhelmed by it on the whole, but I could see it having a stronger effect on others, particularly young women. This is a series I would not hesitate to recommend to a 13-year old girl, which is something I rarely find myself unable to say about many anime series I watch.",

After you watch the first episodes, you'll find it sounds more interesting than the title, which is the name of fashion houses.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is centered around a student, Caroline (Yukari Hayasaka), who is noticed by a group of designers, andis proposed to be a model and present their creations. She rejects the idea initially, especially after she sees Arashi, a punkhead with piercings, who runs after her. After passing out at the sight of Isabelle, who was dressed as a widow, Caroline reach designers shop, which will become their place of entertainment for the next period of her life. She befriends rather quickly with Miwako, younger sister of a famous clothing designer, and is impresed by George, who is the manager of the whole team and the one dealing with all Parakiss creations, their own brand of clothing. Together with them, Caroline will spend the period before exams, and eventually will have to choose what path to follow in life.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics\\n\r\nThe graphic style of this anime is a little different of the  \"clasic\" style, especially on the characters level. These have features much closer to reality, girls characters have more lines than we are accustomed from other animes  and, as you will see, this increases their expressiveness. The animators did a great job with graphics. The characters are drawn almost perfectly consistent, regardless of angle, position or even hair and clothes. These last two elements are specifically mentioned.\\n\r\nWhen a character changes the arrangement of hair, it remains perfectly recognizable, but at the same time is deeply different, much like in reality.\\n\r\nIn terms of character clothes, and considering the subject, Paradise Kiss is impressive: most of the characters change their clothes very often (as would be\\n\r\nexpected from them) and clothes (and accessories) they are very great designed.\\n\r\nIn another chapter defining graphics, backgrounds, Paradise Kiss is somewhere in the middle level. Backgrounds are generally well worked and occasionally beautifully detailed, but rarely impresses.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe soundtrack was one of the impressive things in this anime, because I've rarely met songs so well rhythmic and exciting.\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED fit perfectly with the atmosphere and characters in this series, and this time, I liked both. The OP is called \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" and is composed and performed by Tommy february6 and the ED is called \"Do you Want to \", and is played by Franz Ferdinand. \\n\r\nMarika Matsumoto plays Miwako. Her voice is most remarkable because it seems much younger than she is (22 years). Hiroaki Sano was Music Producer for the series Jyu Oh Sei (another great OP), and the music was made by The Babys group, and with Narasaki voice from Coaltar of the Deepers.\\n\r\nAlmost always you will hear the noise of the city in crowded places, the people who speak or cars passing on the street.\\n\r\nOtherwise, you will hear most often the heavy metal that Arashi is listening in the workshop, and you will also hear the \"Ballad of Arashi\".\\n",

It's not a fairy tale type anime, but yet it still tugs at your heart. \r\nQuriky and original, you could see this anime being someone's actual life. It's fun, funky and a pleasure to watch. \r\nWith tons of fashion, drama, and interesting characters, this show doesn't have a boring episode. \r\nI wasn't a fan of the art in the beginning, but it grew on me as the anime progressed. I think it perfectly suits the tone of the anime, and the characters themselves. Brightand quirky! Two words that perfectly describe everything about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending wasn't at all what I expected, but it was very fitting, it is realistic and makes sense, considering what had happened throughout the show. It left me satisfied with the conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nIt's short, but I think for the story line, a longer series would have dragged and lost the wonderful upbeat momentum. I don't think it would have really been able to go anywhere had it been longer. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is fairly good, most of the voices match their personalities very well. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want something light and easy, but enjoyable to watch then I would recommend this!",

            "content": "At this point in time, Studio Madhouse was starting to feel the weight of the industry pressing down on them. Pumping out the amount of anime that they were just meant they could not keep up both quality and production. For this reason, it was around this time in late 2005 where Madhouse started to slow down a bit, and begin to look for alternative ways for anime production. Paradise Kiss is actually a sequel set within the same universe as the show Neighborhood Stories from the mid-90\u2019s and is a standalone story from it as well. Returning Madhouse Director and person who likes tobe part of everything involved with the anime he works on is Osamu Kabayashi (Beck). \\n\\n\r\nYukari Hayasaka is in her final year of high school and is pretty much bored with life. She does not care much about which university she ends up. All she wants is to get out of town and do something different with her life. This is where by happenstance she runs into a group of college fashion design students that want her to be a model for their final project. After some convincing, Yukari agrees to the task and slowly learns and gets engrossed into the world of the fashion industry.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost immediately the audience can see the similarities between Paradise Kiss and Beck (2004): same director/studio, still frames, heavily detailed in the theme of the show, silent settings for characters, and it is more of a teen drama. Basically, Paradise Kiss is an unconventional unique anime. However, it suffers from similar faults as well: bland backgrounds, awkward moments without a reason, a strangely rushed conclusion, and weak romance elements.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the strengths to Paradise Kiss? That starts and ends with how clothing, body language, and the fashion is presented. The characters are presented extremely detailed from something as simple as a few strands of hair falling over an eye to the outstanding detail of clothing texture with authentic designs. This show also shows a pretty good portrayal of a teenager struggling to find their reason and purpose in the world. Yukari learning what it means to takes risks towards a passion, learning the difference between a fling and love, and what it means to grow up are all great examples of a protagonist\u2019s struggle. Even the other characters in the main cast have unique portrayals. In particular, the character George whom has bi-sexual and sadomasochistic tendencies, the anime tends to focus more on his passion for the fashion industry than his alternative life choices.\\n\\n\r\nParadise Kiss is one of the most unique examples of an anime breaking away from the norm. It truly represents a slice of life focusing on something other than a hard-romance. Everything in this show seems to be new and refreshing at the same time. There just isn\u2019t enough of these kinds of anime and Paradise Kiss is one of those that a typical anime fan will need an open mind to dive into.",

            "content": "Please read my review before pressing that nothelpful button\r\nCool is what rules in this anime. Everything in the artwork, characters, attitude, and even the story just emanates cool and they even do it with an attitude. As you already know it's about a girl named Yukari thats not to sure about her future. Just by a chance encounter on the street gets discovered by the most unsuitable of characters.\r\nStory - (Outstanding)\r\nThe story is a typical love drama, but the setting, characters, and personalities are what make this completely different from the rest of group. It takes a more realistic approach toward drama. Something you'd seeout of a prime time drama show on TV would be more comparable than any other anime. They take life and their hardships and don't really &quot;anime coat&quot; it. Things like arguing, love, and brainstorming are done with a minimum of two people, its never one sided. When i mean 'anime-coating,' i mean like areguments are hardly ever one sided, both persons actually prove a good point. Love is also a good point, it actually gets some resolve and doesn't stay in &quot;should i confess to him&quot; anime-limbo. But already, I'm saying a bit much but since the anime is a short and fast 12 episodes, it makes sense for it not to drag such emotions like love and friendship. It defintely has the feel of a western drama instead of an anime drama. \\n\\n\r\nArt - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe art work is also something that surprised me. Like any average viewer, they'd get wierded out if they start seeing their anime characters with proportionate body parts (i.e. normal sized eyes, mouth, and even a nose). Once the shock of adjusting to the art style, this is easily one of the best looking show's i have ever layed eyes on. It's also centered around pop-culture and style, so everything they wear is completely trendy and detailed. From safety pins as piercings, hair stylings, makeup, and even clothing are displayed with insane detail. At any one time, you can count all the earrings on one characters ear, or how many necklaces one is wearing, and even the type of fabric is on their scarf. Every character actually dresses different every episode and thats quite a refreshing take as opposed to the same-school-clothes-everyday-look of other dramas. My favorite part of the show (and what you should notice) is how they manage to make Yukari even more beautiful than before every episode. You'll notice the subtle changes in not her clothing but her attitude and demeanor as well.\\n\r\nOn occasion, some anime are only able to survive with great artwork and have a horrible storyline but this manages to have both an outstanding artwork and story. On top of that having to put real world product placement (Jaguar, Benz, Sony, Zipper, etc) just increases the detail tenfold. \\n\\n\r\nSound - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe sound effects are nothing spectacular but you will notice one thing. There is a rather large lack of it. And that is how it should be in a drama. Nothing should interfere with the drama unfolding on the screen. So all that you're left with is the top notch, tear jerking, believable voice acting and environmental sound effects. The music is placed very skillfully as well. For the most part, they'll be played on jukeboxes, radios, and the like. And they're actual j-pop songs playing instead of just instrumentals. And speaking of j-pop, the OP was just perfect for for the show, as it had the feel of a Madonna-ish song which gave it a 'glamorous' feeling to set you in the mood of watching it. And the ED song by Franz Ferdinad is just pure fun. Especially how they manage to blend it with the end of the episode to the credits and don't just do a quick cut to the credits like normal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe characters are something to believe as well. Once all the characters are through with the introductions you will notice one thing right away. They are all so carefree and believable. I even had a nostalgic feeling seeing how the characters would talk amongst each other and just enjoyed the moment. Of course it doesn't the story doesn't stray too far away from Yukari since she is the star of this show. They all play their role so believably I can't help but have this feeling of amazement that there ARE anime that can pull off such intriguing drama. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThis show is unlike any other drama anime I have seen to date (top right). Rather, its more comparable to things like the likes of Greys Anatomy, the O.C., or even Party of Five. If you like or enjoy shows such as that I highly recommend giving this eye candy of an anime a try. I even found this A LOT better than Lovely Complex. Don't be fooled by the artwork if you find it a turnoff, its one of the best anime drama's I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nXinil said it best: &quot;it's for a mature audience. It doesn't cater to narutards&quot; \\n\r\n...thats the truth",

            "content": "So there are very few anime in this world that can satisfy you completely. They give you everything you want and then some delivered in a neatly wrapped box with a bow. This anime does nothing but deliver from the very first episode up until the last few seconds of the series. But let me be frank; If you're looking for a cutesy series that sugar coats all of its drama in anime cliches then get out and don't let the door hit you on your way out. This anime is not for you! With that said let's move on.\r\nParadise Kiss accomplishes so many thingsin just 12 episodes that it can almost leave you thirsting for more but deep down you know that there can be no more. The story itself is the centerpiece of everything and drives itself forward with meaningful interactions and tense drama that thickens the plot as it unfolds. What is most notable about the series is it's realistic approach to drama and how it refuses to sugar coat things and drag out emotions across all 12 episodes. If I recall the main characters quickly start their relationship by about the 2nd or 3rd episode. This anime may seem impatient, but in reality it's just not going to wait around for the fun to start. The show steps into deep waters and treads where most others would not. It goes much farther than I had anticipated and shows how much its characters develop over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character goes from being this tense study bug to being a care-free fashion model. Her transformation isn't this instantaneous change that happens at 15 minutes into episode 6 or something; but rather it takes place over time. The first thing that happens is a hair cut. I actually commented out loud as I was watching and said \"she actually doesn't look all THAT pretty here...\" But I stuck it out and to my surprise she seemed to get prettier every episode. Her style changed, her hair changed, her personality blossomed into something new and exciting, and she becomes someone who is definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles a handful of sub plots but doesn't loose control of them or allow them to impede on the main story's progress. the majority of the side characters have stories of their own and are all expertly told in a very short amount of time. In some cases characters stories aren't discussed in the show but rather in the manga and there's even a scene where a character tells you that you can \"read more about him\" in a particular manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound weave together to create this tapestry of pop-art that seamlessly mixes with the characters. The opening and closing theme were chosen so expertly and serve only to set the mood for the show. The ending theme is even mixed in with the last 10-15 seconds of the show so that it seamlessly transitions into the credits.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is quite possibly the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen with an ending that didn't disappoint. Instead of having this storybook happily ever after ending you are quickly faced with reality. Sure the characters kind of succeeded in what they were trying to do, but reality has to set in at some point and the show reminds us that we live in the real world. The ending however does tie up any and all loose ends and leaves almost nothing to the imagination. It also doesn't leave room for a second season so there's no chance of a spin-off brought on by money grubbing producers. Never have I been faced with an anime that literally left me in a daze after its credits rolled on episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a masterpiece in its own genre. It masterfully and skillfully tells a straight forward, but complex story complete with sub plots, exciting drama, and cool music to boot. I also liked that characters didn't spend 10 minutes arguing in tense situations. Example: man is holding a gun pointing it at another character(lets call him teppei kun). Teppei kun gives this long monologue about his life and how he's always been alone and blah blah blah. In reality the guy would've just shot him for talking way too much.\\n\\n\r\nok. I've talked for far too long now. This anime is a masterpiece. Watch it!\\n",

            "content": "Title: Paradise Kiss\r\nManga/Anime: Paradise Kiss was originally a manga created by Ai Yazawa (famous for Nana), and ran in the Japanese fashion magazine Zipper from the April 2000 issue to the March 2004 issue.  Five volumes have been compiled, and all have been released, both in Japan, and Stateside from Tokyopop.\r\nThe anime was produced by Studio Madhouse (famous for Death Note, Paranoia Agent, and Devil May Cry, among others), directed by Osamu Kobayashi (who also directed Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad and Kimagure Orange Road), and ran on Japanese TV from October 13th, 2005 to December 29th, 2005.  It has been licensed Stateside byGeneon, and the third and final volume was released this April.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story centers around Yukari, a high school student who's basically been living for nothing but her mom's expectations, figuring out what she wants to do (professional modeling), by virtue of being recruited for a school fashion show by a group of designers who call themselves Paradise Kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is WIN.  Like Victorian Romance Emma, this show had me grinning like an idiot at least once every episode.  This is one of the few shows where I've liked every main character straight off the bat.  It's fun to watch all the relationships in this story play out, and to see Yukari deciding what she wants to do with her life and going after it.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point, there's a really convoluted love polygon going on, but then it splits into two triangles that kind of connect.  But the relationships serve as nice counterpoints to each other, and they're filled with plenty of drama.  In fact, there's a mirror to almost every major relationship between characters in this show, and it's really nice.  It shows you how things could turn out, or what they could've been like.  It's a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how close this is to the manga, but I do know that Ai Yazawa worked pretty closely with Kobayashi on the adaptation, so I don't think people have too much to get worked up over.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: There is sex, there is nudity, there is a guy who dresses up and acts like a girl.  If this makes you go 'EW!', don't watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series can be summed up in two words: absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nReally, though.  Madhouse has a bit more realistic style than you see from other studios, and it really fits this series to a tee.  The random SD that pops up is fun, too.  And the colors they use for clothes and backgrounds tend to reflect atmospheres.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving the outfits a whole separate paragraph, because they deserve it.  You can tell that Madhouse gave this series a big budget, because characters change outfits at least once an episode, usually even more.  And the outfits were all designed by a professional, and you can tell.  Every outfit that they use for this series is absolutely beautiful, and there are quite a few designs that I would buy, if they existed in real life.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The OP and ED are &acirc;?&yen;.  Tommy February 6's OP 'Lonely in Gorgeous' captures the mood of the show perfectly, and the ED... well, Franz Ferdinand's 'Do You Want To' is for the win, so I don't really care how it relates to the show. :D\\n\\n\r\nBackground music for the show is actually done more as ambient music (i.e. songs being played on a CD/ radio station), and it's a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Absolutely no complaints here.  The show ambles along at its own pace, and it works very well.  The actual climax of the series is the second to last episode, and the last episode is a wrap-up of sorts, similar to what happens in Gankutsuou.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: I recognize some of the seiyuu ' from where, I have no clue whatsoever.  I can't access the site that I can cross-check the seiyuu with their other roles at the moment, so this section will be edited later on.  However, like normal, no problems here.\\n\\n\r\nDub: N/A, haven't seen it just yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Excellently written, beautifully animated series, with plenty of drama and counterpoint, with a killer OST, too.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 7/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 39/50; 78% (C)",

            "content": "This is one of the few series I finished in a hurry. The story was going so well until the ending &ndash; it left me under whelmed. Sure it made me a bit teary &ndash; eyed, but it was so disappointing compared to the rest of the series. \r\nI really love the story though &ndash; I am a fashion freak. I love anything that has something to do with fashion, and I love anime. Combining two of my loves is a plus. I just thought it was relatable. Doesn&rsquo;t everyone feel like Caroline sometimes? Like you want to break free and actually do what youwant? I also like how the anime chronicles how Caroline deals with all the changes that she had to face and how she makes her decisions.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters. They&rsquo;re all so good looking! There&rsquo;s Caroline, of course. Wild child trying to break free out of her serious shell. She&rsquo;s so pretty. Then there&rsquo;s the eccentric George, the bad boy of the story. The adorable Miwako and the rest of her family that&rsquo;s just as adorable. Arashi, my favorite, who despite his looks is actually a man with morals. Finally, Isabella, the resident cross dresser &ndash; who I think is actually cool. What I like about these characters is they change throughout the series, especially Caroline. They actually all have depth &ndash; which is hard to accomplish especially in an anime that is only 12 episodes long. I would like to note that I like George and Caroline&rsquo;s relationship, even though it was kinda weird sometimes. It&rsquo;s like they would constantly fight and make up, and this is mostly due to George&rsquo;s lack of ability to love. \\n\\n\r\nThe drawing style was interesting. One minute it&rsquo;s normal (drawing style actually reminds me of BECK a bit) then it&rsquo;s chibi form, but it&rsquo;s not the usual chibi form. I think the chibi style they made use of was similar to the drawing style in the original anime series, where Paradise Kiss was spun off from. &ldquo;Real&rdquo; visuals were also used, but mostly during the scenes before the opening theme. I applaud the details on inanimate objects &ndash; from the sewing machine in the atelier to George&rsquo;s car. They almost look lifelike. Colors are ok, and are nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay. I was a bit uncertain when it came to Caroline&rsquo;s voice, since I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it fit her. I did like Arashi&rsquo;s voice &ndash; it fit his personality well. In fact, I do think that everyone&rsquo;s seiyus matched their personalities except for Caroline. I just found it to be a bit low and rough. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great too &ndash; The opening theme was cute. I heard Tommy February was actually a famous pop star in Japan, and I can tell. I really love &ldquo;Lonely in Gorgeous&rdquo;. The ending song surprised me &ndash; since it&rsquo;s from Franz Ferdinand, and I&rsquo;m actually a fan of their music. The first time I watched it I was like &ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t this Franz Ferdinand?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad their music matched the theme of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I liked the series &ndash; but somehow I don&rsquo;t see it as my favorite yet. It&rsquo;s definitely somewhere there, maybe if I watched it again I&rsquo;ll like it more. I think the problem is the love love scenes made me a bit awkward &ndash; specially I watched most of the episodes in broad daylight. The scenes were just explicit. Anyway, I can&rsquo;t argue with the fact that I do like it. I watched it in three days, and 8 episodes on one day, after all.",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss is an anime aimed at the shoujo audience, but what sets this anime apart from all other shoujo anime is it's unique characterisation and atypical storyline.  \r\nStory - 9\r\nParadise Kiss is a short anime about how a young 18 year old girl's life is changed completely when a group of fashion design students kidnap her off the street to model their dress for a school fashion show.  The main female protagonist falls in love with the main male protagonist and a love story is revealed.  What sets this anime aside from the rest of the 'typical shoujo/romance' anime is thatthe relationship between the two are not as simple as it seems.  The story itself has a realistic element to it making it more suitable for a mature audience rather than what the word shoujo literally implies.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nPersonally, i love Ai Yazawa's artwork, the setting was drawn realistically to compliment the whole aspect of a realistic life and story.  I was surprised to see how everything was drawn perfectly, the anime itself felt like one from 2007/08 rather than 2005.  The characters were perfect, nothing was really out of place, the males did not look over glamourous nor did the females look over pitiful.  The whole urbanised setting gave the anime and overal fashionable and trendy feel to it.  The only flaw i could notice was the characters looked odd when they were far away but when they were close up, every detail could be shown. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were catchy songs and suited the anime well, it created a funky feel to the anime and the way the opening was brought in for each episode really made the song a part of the anime rather than your general opening you have for every anime.  The anime lacked BGM at times, but for this anime, having less of it was much more suitable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters were definately one of this anime's strong points, almost the whole story revolves around the basis of clashing characters working together and becoming friends (or more than friends even).  It also shows how one person can change another's outlook on life and their personality.  Ai Yazawa is successful in showing how Yukari's whole life changes in a very short amount of time purely by making friends with the \"bad crowd\" and realising her ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIf you've watched NANA, then Paradise Kiss doesn't stray too far from the basic concepts in NANA.  The whole mature, real life drama is what makes Paradise Kiss enjoyable.  If you're looking for a short, sweet, drama-filled, not-your-typical-shoujo anime then i'd highly recommend you give Paradise Kiss a try.",

            "content": "Some encounters in life can be so unpredictable, short yet oftentimes worthwhile that they shake the very fundamentals of our ideals and principles. That is when we start to change, either for better or for worse. Paradise Kiss (henceforth abbreviated as ParaKiss) starts with one such encounter of Yukari Hayasaka and George Koizumi. \r\nNote: Paradise Kiss is also the name of the clothing line formed by George and three other members.\r\nThe story follows your everyday school girl Yukari who happens to pass by one of the members of ParaKiss and subsequently meets the other two members of ParaKiss. Out of nowhere, she is asked tomodel for them in the upcoming school festival, which results in a flat out \u2018No\u2019. Not until later in the first episode do we witness her fateful encounter with the charismatic George. George once again asks her to model for them and gives her three days time. After an unanticipated turn of events she starts to think more and more about the eccentric group and finally decides to model for them. This decision transforms her hitherto simple life into turmoil of romance, dreams, ambitions, and angst, and her life starts to flow in a direction that she could have never imagined.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and proceeds smoothly, but what keeps the viewer glued to the screen is that it is presented with elegance, style and attitude. With the story being simple there is room for character to interact freely and develop as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe realistic and strong characters further endear the story to the viewers. The protagonist, Yukari is a simple girl, and despite possessing good looks, a well toned figure and above average height, she doesn\u2019t indulge herself in fashion. She has been living a life marked with academic diligence that is until she meets the people from ParaKiss. She is encouraged to forge a new path by watching the passion that drives the others in ParaKiss to lead their lifestyles. The main credit for Yukari\u2019s development goes to George. It is his straight-forward and ambitious nature that brings forth her desires. It is with his help that she is able to challenge her future instead of succumbing to a secure but unexciting life. Marked with elegance, charisma and pomp, the male lead George at times presents an inscrutable front that leaves the viewers puzzled towards his motives while at other times he is like an open book. His beguiling nature is well received by his teammates and he often gets what he wants, yet on the other hand he has the etiquettes of a perfect gentleman. George is depicted with so many different traits that it makes him unpredictable at times and is considered to be one of his charm points.\\n\\n\r\nInteractions between Yukari and George are handled thoughtfully; sometimes resulting in disagreements between the two akin to those in real life relationships. The viewer is easily entrapped every time an argument breaks out between them and unsure of what developments that may lead to. The relationship of Yukari and George is relatable to real life relationships; and one we may all benefit from learning a thing or two from. The deuteragonists are given a decent role and past. While personally they don\u2019t have much character development, they are instrumental in shaping Yukari and George\u2019s burgeoning romance and personal growth. All the characters are thoroughly worked out and moreover, they are defined with respective individuality.\\n\\n\r\nCorrespondingly, the characters are designed stylishly and distinctively. Madhouse, known for its eccentric and ingenious animation, has managed to live up to its reputation. ParaKiss\u2019s story revolves around fashion, hence the character designs need to be innovative and elegant. Madhouse did its job perfectly and all the characters are designed in an attractive light. However, the male characters have a more effeminate look than the female characters. Arashi, one of the deuteragonists, might have a masculine outlook because of his piercings and funky hair style, but the same cannot be said in George\u2019s case, all he needs is long hair and he\u2019ll be the embodiment of the word \u201cBeautiful\u201d. Isabella, also one of the deuteragonists, is always in a woman\u2019s attire, and they both look prettier than Yukari. Majority of the shoujo mangaka draw their male leads to aesthetically entrance the female audience.  Now, this is not a complaint but merely an observation. If shounen manga/anime can have women with perfectly toned body and unbelievably huge racks then why can\u2019t men have a more androgynous presence. Well, I guess that\u2019s why people call them \u2018Bishounen\u2019. That being said, all the characters are presented charmingly. Furthermore, the facial expressions are animated really well and one can easily tell what the character is going through given their emotive eyes and gestures.\\n\\n\r\nParaKiss definitely belongs to the upper echelons in character designs. Background animations are not as impressive as the character designs. Madhouse didn\u2019t invest much time in animating the backgrounds with detail. While that doesn\u2019t enhance the overall quality of animation, it didn\u2019t undermine it either. \\n\\n\r\nSound is another aspect where ParaKiss doesn\u2019t fail to surprise. The engine sound of a vintage Jaguar and the variation of sounds in dialogues adjusted according to the distance of the screen from where the conversation is being held, really points to some meticulous work. The seiyuu did a wonderful job in adapting to their roles. And all the seiyuu seemingly fit to their characters. Some may find Marika Matsumoto, Miwako\u2019s seiyuu, a bit annoying at first because of her cracking yet sometimes cutesy voice but it does suit Miwako\u2019s personality. And in the end of the series Marika is one of the seiyuu that leaves a notable impression. The sound department truly shines in OP and ED songs. The OP, \u2018Lonely in Gorgeous\u2019 is probably viewed as one of the best and the most addictive songs in the year 2005. The ending song, \u2018Do You Want To\u2019 is pretty good as well, and both OP and ED songs provide a unique atmosphere to ParaKiss. \\n\\n\r\nThe unique and glamorous characters, great character designs and unparalleled opening song make Paradise Kiss a memorable anime. This anime is recommended to anyone who is looking for a good and authentic romance show. As for enjoyment, it is purely subjective, but I\u2019ll share some personal pearls of wisdom: don\u2019t have expectations before even starting the series. Eventually you\u2019ll be entertained in some way or the other.\\n",

            "content": "The storyline is relatively good. The themes covered are quite basic, but it is very effective in the sense that it touches on the bringing of life of a girl. \r\nThe story is about Yukari, a studious student who fails to live up to her parent's expectations. One day, while walking to cram school, she meets a group of designers, under the name of Paradise Kiss. Only when she is scolded by Arashi, a male designer, does she open and realise that the world does not revolve around studying. \r\nIn itself, the mangaka Ai Yazawa is able to elevate the story, while able to relateto the girl's frustrations, and progressively develop Yukari's character (nicknamed Caroline) from an antisocial, bitchy character to a friendly, warm, firm woman. \\n\\n\r\nThe art resembles that of Yazawa's art. Only the animation of the settings really annoyed me. The contrasts between the realness of the setting and the edgedness of the characters really disturbed me, as it becomes in a sense, like the characters are misplaced into reality. Part of the reason that people watch anime is to escape reality and have a bit of fun, and the effect of putting anime characters into real life scenes, I think was rather inappropriate. Furthermore, I thought that the beginning of each episode, with the different scenes, and random animals was quite bizarre, especially when they didn't really relate to the content of the anime. If I recall right, I remember the manga had none of these things. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was okay, with tommyfebruary6's \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" emphasised the poshness of the fashion industry, both behind the scene designing as well as modelling. What really bothered me was the end song, Franz Ferdinand's \"Do you want to\" made it sound like a rock anime, despite the poshness of it. Although it can be argued that Arashi is indeed in a rock band, it just doesn't seem right. However, the voice actors for all of the characters was well done. Especially Miwako, as her character and voice resembled each other-very cute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I RATHER enjoyed this anime. Although, I had hoped to see more designs of clothes (since I'm approaching university stage).",

            "content": "Paradise kiss is\u2026 not bad. Sorry that I just gave away 70% of my judgment right away, but from my perspective (the one I trust) there\u2019s little I can say to make it sound amazing. Ok, being fair, when you analyze its points with a more detached look (shut up, it\u2019s possible!) the series can be classified as good.\r\nStory and Characters\r\nThe story centers around Hayasaka Yukari and her involvement with the Paradise Kiss (ParaKiss for short), a studio composed of students of fashion design.\r\nThe other ones are Arashi, Miwako, Isabella and Koizume George, the main agent in convincing Yukari to join in and her futurelover through the series.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first impression of Yukari as a slightly vapid balloon of salty water thrown over sandpaper, the series gives her a little more dimension. It\u2019s a good attempt, but you might get the impression that it tried to make her \u201dtoo normal\u201d. At least I got. What I mean by that is: while her issues are relatable and realistic, there is no effort in making her more distinct inside the archetype, which might be also an effect of \u201cyou\u2019ve seen this done before\u201d. You know, the Platoon effect.\\n\\n\r\nArashi is the brash member that does little to hold his thoughts to himself, automatically making my favorite character. Outside from working with Yukari, his interactions with her are minimal, and most of what is seen of him is in relation to his girlfriend, Miwako, the emotional, upbeat, possibly moe smurfette of pre-Yukari ParaKiss.\\n\\n\r\nIsabella is a man, but don\u2019t worry about being attacked over not using the correct pronouns, she is above that. As a lesbian in the body of a man, I find her quite intriguing. She is subdued, reserved, classy, well dressed (is it a trend in Japanese TV to always have transgender/crossdressers in the most elegant attire?) and soft-spoken, close to the archetype you would see cast as a mentor-character\\n\\n\r\nGeorge is the main designer of ParaKiss. A Casanova (not a bad trait) and former infant design prodigy (raise alarms), he created he first dress for Isabella-kun when both were in third-grade. Bye-bye suspension of disbelief, see you in Black Lagoon. His character borders on being uneven: he is sometimes caring, but most often suddenly detached, has mood swings that are not discernable neither by the characters, nor the audience and will unadvertedly act harsh towards Yukari because of that. The most consistent trait he has is possibly the irresponsible genius clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode 3 begins the romance between Yukari and George. It starts with no proper explanation of how they got so close so suddenly and bares no chemistry whatsoever. Their romance is not so much a driving force for the plot as it\u2019s a source of tension. With no proper set up, though, it rings quite hollow. Arashi and Miwako for once are a pre-existing couple and most of the tension between them, mainly involving Tokumori, one of Yukari\u2019s classmates and former love interest for Miwako, is effectively established quickly, using often non-verbal language and implied feelings, and holds more impact.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nOk, first the positive: there is good care taken for the art, which looks distinct, fairly realistic and detailed. On side-note, though, this clashes with one of the short-comings of the animation, mainly the one that implies some corners had to be cut. Characters are given a wider lip-movement, but it\u2019s quite cluncky and in many cases the show focuses on characters who are not talking or just hinds the mouths, Eva-style.\\n\\n\r\nThis issue might not bother you if you prioritize art over movement since the art in Paradise Kiss is definitely stunning, but if you like that smooth flow going along with the figures, this is going to be a eyesore. Weirdly enough, there are points where character morph to a cartoonish chibi model. That\u2019s inconsistent and detracts from the rest of the art, thank you very much. \\n\\n\r\nOn the voice-acting department (Japanese, off course), it\u2019s overall serviceable, with the exception of Yukari\u2019s seyiuu Matsumoto Marika, who apparently didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the verb \u201cemote\u201d during recording. I\u2019m not familiar with other works in her name, so I\u2019ll pass on making any statement about her skills.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is my first review here I\u2019d like to point out that I mostly avoid talking about soundtrack, because it\u2019s a very personal matter and I\u2019m not even a musician. That said, I was never able to pass on watching the opening, simply because the music was gorgeous. The ending, by Franz Ferdinand, evokes a far more upbeat and quircky mood, but unfortunately was accompanied by the off-putting cartoonish look mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal ramblings\\n\\n\r\nBeing fair (because I am), outside of the main couple there is stuff in the series that is easy to get invested into, mainly Arashi and Miwako, who form a rocky but charming relationship, or Isabella, who does more with her collected and observing demeanor than with words. These side-characters are what prevent Paradise Kiss from falling into Average territory. \\n\\n\r\nBy itself the series could have done much more if it dared taking its protagonist to more than her archetype encapsulates and gave the romance a better set up, but it relied too much in concept alone. \\n\r\nCrap, that came out less personal than I had intended!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enjoyment aside, I\u2019d give the series the verdict of Good, but not \u201cIndex\u201d-good.\\n",

It shows some interesting facts about certain things, a small peek into clothe designing and the whole clothes/model industry in general. It also deals a great matter with the issue of school and the pressure a lot of parents tend to put on their kidsto get good grades,it talks about friendship, family, love, romance, business and dreams. It also is a continuation of another series/ manga called Gokinjo Monogatari which I have not seen.\\n\r\nIn general story is good, simple and down to earth. 8\\n\\n\r\nART: while very beautiful with all the characters have a unique design for themselves I thought that parts looked a bit off. For example the background looked as if it is simple cut off a magazine and then placed behind the animated characters, the characters themselves moved a bit oddly giving the impression that they were out of place. It must have been low production but even though sometimes the art looks odd it still manages to look pretty. The characters are all designed beautifully with great dressing style( they are designers after all :P) and the clothes are beyond beautiful which is expected since Yazawa Ai did go to design school if my memory serves me right.8\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the op and ed are both great, TommyFebruary with her \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" as the OP rocks pretty bad ass since even though poppy and catchy the song is one of my favs and fits the whole series perfectly. The ed quite surprisingly is Franz Ferdinants \"Do you want to\" which I love. Overall good music. The background...I don't even think the background had any music and even if it did it's not memorable.8\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: now, the characters are interesting but this is were for me the show lacks. While each and every one of them is interesting (with my fav being Miwako and her crazy pink hair) I lack to feel sympathy for them or in general have any \"deep\" connection if that's possible with them.\\n\r\nHayasaka Yukari is our lead and she's is actually a person I know. I know someone just like her and we used to be friends so I guess it kind of got a bit personal for me since I never got along very well with that friend. People like Yukari exist, you can see them everyday and that's what makes her real.Yet I can't really stand her character and since she has problems with her mother you can blame it on that and whatnot which is true, but I still dislike her. Always wanting to be #1, nagging and complaining and being jealous and I dunno she just bugged me ( as I say it's probably on a personal level). Most of the characters though I didn't like much, in my eyes they're a bunch of rich kids who off course struggle to make their dreams come true but in the end of the day they are noting but that: rich kids who can afford to spend their money. With Yukari being the only one without a huge mansion I just felt the most of them were just hypocritical and shallow. \\n\r\nGeorge: the main love interested is your typical hot guy who's perfect in everything but with flaws. He's a playboy, very typical in soujo and there is really nothing too special about him besides the fact that he makes nice clothes. I didn't care.\\n\r\nArashi: Miwakos bf and the other member of Parakiss. Jealous of his girlfriend keeping in touch with an old friend. I didn't care.\\n\r\nMiwako: though I liked her as an image, her clothes, her hair, her character was bubbly and happy go lucky but she also seemed shallow. NO matter the drama they tried to give her I simply felt apathetic. Didn't care.\\n\r\nIsabella: now this one is the most interesting one I must say, but she didn't get much screen time and we really know very very little about her, so I couldn't really say much. She is interesting on her own though.\\n\r\nEverybody else....pff I just forgot about them.6\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: well While I didn't like the characters much I liked the show quite a bit, the clothes were nice, it had a few good messages here and there and a nice atmosphere. If you like clothes and the model industry you'll probably like it. Other than the clothes though I found nothing too special about it. I give this series a 7 just for the beautiful clothes and art, the characters...pff I rather live without.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime seems like your typical romantic/slice of life anime and in most ways, it is. Take for example, the totally coincidental manner in which the protagonist, Hayasaka Yukari, is singled out by the eccentric group of fashion design students, or the fairly cliched cast of characters. the thing that sets it apart though, is the development of the protagonist. She makes a gradual and plausible transition from an unmotivated high school student  to a professional model. While this is very satisfying to watch, it is ironic that the overall experience is somewhat dampened by the LACK of character development. \r\nMost of thecharacters other than the protagonist and her boyfriend have shallow personlities and are nothing more than mediocre supports. Sure, you find out a little bit about their pasts by the end of the show, but nothing that's revealed gives them any extra personality. This is one series which could've used at least 4-5 episodes more to develop all of the members of thee cast properly.  however, if you can overlook the lack of character development, the story is very well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs are very well done. The same goes for the soundtrack, especially the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would i recommend it?Well, its a tough call, the cast felt like a random assortment of characters with no real personalities to be honest. But at the same time, the development of the protagonist is very realistic. The same goes for the plot as well. If you like slice of life anime with very realistic plots and are interested in fashion, this series should be on your watch list. Even if that is not the case, you should consider watching this at some point. It isn't extraordinary by any stretch of imagination, but it is greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss is a short romantic story about two people with clashing personalities. This is not your typical love story as the two barely even made it together. Both have different personalities, priorities and interests. But both still clung to each other and try to make things work, at least up to the end of the series.\r\nI love the story (probably the best romantic story for me). Yukari is a character any simple girl can relate to. While George, is the image of a guy, any simple girl would simply dream of and stay away from. George and Yukari were definitely struggling throughout the serieswith their relationship. But they managed to work things out with a lot of understanding and by learning from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was usually set in Yukari's point of view and halfway you'd be wondering if the feeling's mutual. However, George gives us hints on how much he loves Yukari in the sweetest ways (although he likes teasing her as well). The best scenes were probably the ones when they're not together, as the care for one another is more evident.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ended perfectly and yet I felt sad about it. This is one brilliant series that is a must watch for everyone who wants to have a different romantic story.",

It has a very realistic outcome and besides True Tears I cannot find any other anime that ends up being as realistic as this one.\r\nStory (8)\r\nThough the story is rather simple, the development is it is very interesting. A girl who enters a different environment that she is used to be in and gets excited about the surroundings + gets involved with a boy. What else do you need? \r\nArt (8)\r\nI gave the art an 8 because I found it really challenging and different from what I'veseen before. For some it may be negative, but to me it was really good, and especially a sight worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly there isn't much unnecessary sound in the anime so I don't know what to say about it. All there really is to it is fine voice acting and no major sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly all characters are very believeable to being realistic. Some are a bit over the edge to make it interesting, but there isn't a single character who is overdone. It's really good to see they can keep it up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment 7 for a couple of reasons. It's very easy to watch, marathonable even which is very positive to me. Furthermore it has an easy storyline and you don't have to think too hard while watching it, just enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this anime a 7 even though I really like it, I have to admit it is very girly. I'm not gonna say 7 is low or high, but to me 7 is a really good score and then an anime is as girly as this and gets 7 it is really big. I believe this should be watched especially by girls, as it seems it would be received very postively.\\n\\n\r\n- Kukker",

            "content": "The Sensations of Paradise Kiss\r\nThat kick that comes in the pre-ED when you hear the vocals of Franz Ferdinand blaring over whatever dramatic punctuation that they\u2019ve set up for you. Of all the pre-ED kicks I know these are just about the toppest of the tops. When I think of Franz Ferdinand I think Take Me Out and the post-punk chorus that stiffens into crazy machinery that you just have to pump your feet to.\r\nThe little dance that cartoon Yukari does in the ED. While usually I skip EDs and OPs, I always watch to that part somehow, and usually beyond that. That this EDalways punctuates the dramatic motions is probably the complete opposite of that feeling you get when the chiptune-esque electric chime kicks in at the end of Shinsekai Yori. That song represents a downward flowing melancholy, but this is always an upwards flowing motion.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike some other anime I know, the upwards flowing motion always hits the ending section correctly. We don\u2019t get any Clannad dissonantic schisms.\\n\\n\r\nThe sketchy drawings of the characters as magazine fronts, each representing different fashion subcultures. Elle, Doll 10, Time and Zipper.\\n\\n\r\nWatching that OP that makes it look completely like a NANA thing, but then realizing that it\u2019s completely the opposite of a NANA thing.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the weird cut-into-life opening portion that always mixes strange animals and things with real life shots of the city. While Yukari will ruminate poetic over some aspect of the strange void of her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe one word I could always feel when watching Paradise Kiss was Naturalism. It doesn\u2019t fail to kick you right in the face, when you expect a gripping plot involving pretty boys and stylish moaning damsels, and suddenly your main character devolves from a shoujo girl into this slapstick deformed thing running jokily for her life.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting that is completely off to any notion of stylish dramatic gesture. Long stretches without any background music except diegetic noise. Everything strikes as cool, composed, organic.\\n\\n\r\nIt does a screen wipe with a weird sound effect whenever changing scenes. Do you know how off-putting this is? In a good way of course. Akira Kurosawa did the same thing in his films. But when you see a bunch of weird animals swimming past the screen you know this anime definitely wasn\u2019t made for any astounding dramatic flourish. Every cut feels like a cut of life, in its truest sense.\\n\\n\r\nFashion is the main. Everyone\u2019s Fashion is so absurdly gaudy, like a Vivienne Westwood showcase.\\n\\n\r\nHow Kobayashi works: The scene where Yukari gets slapped by her mother is told in monologue over a shot of a house. It isn\u2019t shown until later, and it has no impact, and she herself doesn\u2019t feel anything in particular from it except mild resentment. \\n\\n\r\nThings happen at a crazy fast pace, but so perfectly positioned that you feel 12 episodes is just exactly enough. How it does this is that it never lingers on dramatic moments, although everything in here screams NANA melodramatic. It figures that the most important thing is to show the process of a character\u2019s interior growth, and that is does, with her sensations towards the things happening around her, with her rumination over the possibilities of her growth, and with nothing else in mind.\\n\\n\r\nSilent cravings, of love, or passion, or meaning, are shown with a dignity, that at best will only be reflected as silent moans, or cries, or longings, but never the type that strikes purposely to pull at heartstrings. Just about the most devastating thing that happens in the last episode is so undercut that it\u2019s completely chilling. It\u2019s amazing too that the issue is solved by the same episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it earns the dramatic moments, these are actually hard earned. The most obvious being the well projected in advance Fashion Exhibition.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to love the focus on the small things, such as the slow dyeing of blue flowers, or stringing together a butterfly ring. The small essentially small acts which everything grand is based on. \\n\\n\r\nYou could say that Kobayashi works in a style that is essentially similar to the stringing together of a butterfly ring. Small pearls, in moments, actions, shots, and atmospheric ellipsis, are strung together into something so gaudy and powerful that the whole package feels vaster than anything else out there. Even the throbbing life and d\u00e9cor built through the slow culmination of streetside noise patterns, silent wafting through baroque cafes, and strolling through elaborate fashion sets, all feel immaculately made to sharpen your senses to the loving guiding hand that goes into such creation.\\n\\n\r\nAfter realizing all of the miniscule stuff that goes into pattern design, go Google search an Alexander McQueen dress. Really just capital-L Look at every single detail that exists on that ephemeral piece of cloth.\\n\\n\r\nLangsam Blut. Shoegaze. Spectaculariffic. Which director knows perfectly what songs to use at where-ever?\\n\\n\r\nYou know you can always say that certain works will leave a never-loosening pit in your gut, because these works have specially tailored an escape for you such that when you get out of the world you feel nothing but a yawning gulf inside that forces you to hunger for more. How many things can do what Paradise Kiss can do and reverse engineer that process, so that you come out feeling even more full?\\n",

            "content": "Story and character:\r\nI saw this anime a while back, and caught myself thinking about it long after I finished it years ago. This is a generally good sign and I'm glad I can say that George is one of the most memorable characters in anime. The story itself is about Yukari, and while I like how the plot brings out her insecurities and develop her confidence, I was captivated by George. He's a brilliant creation: bold, straight-forward, unyielding, decisive, and cool. These are traits many anime writers want to imbue into their male leads, but while some succeed, many do fail - yet what makesGeorge such a great success it that not only is he masculine in having these traits, he is a bisexual clothing designer. His character holds both feminine and masculine details that blur the lines between gender identity. And even better, he is not some gay caricature. This is a person you want leading your team.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is also nothing to scoff at. Since this story focuses on individuality with an emphasis on Japanese counter-culture, the supporting cast are self sustained and believable people. Yukari, being the center of the story, undergoes a coming of age. It is to be expected that she will be annoying at times because she is so insecure about her life and decisions, but overall, her vulnerability contrasts well with George's strength. It also does well to show George's role as the fairy-god mother figure. He is cruel and curt at times, but for a spineless girl like Yukari, George is coldness proved to be the necessary push in the right direction. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nLoved the art and loved the music. The Intro is some upbeat Japanese pop song that really sets the mood. The ED is a Franz Ferdinand song so I appreciated that. The art is above and beyond. Wonderful bright colors that are used to define the character's personalities. Artistic freedom with some some of the street scenes. It's not an action anime so I didn't expect amazing fluidity, but I liked that the characters weren't too stiff and had dynamic positioning. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nIt's a very good anime. Good for those turbulent teenage years and I'm hesitant to say it, but George had a bit of an impact on me. The plot isn't too out-of-this-world complex. It's about young people finding the determination to take the first big, bold step towards their dreams. Yet, it is sensitive while maintaining a no-nonsense perspective into dealing with all those nice feelings teenagers develop. It excites a little bit of rebellion into the hearts of its viewers. In the end, what I found most memorable was George tinge of cruelty. He has a light bitter taste to him that makes him more enigmatic than his amazing style and carefree sex life.",

            "content": "It has been a true honour to have been able to experience this anime.\r\nThe story is about a young girl, Yukari, who is questioning who she wants to be. She feels as though the career ahead of her isn't what she wants. Yukari then gets a taste of the world of fashion through the new 'paradise kiss' clothing brand and takes a liking to it. She also experiences her first love through a seemingly cold man named George.\r\nStory 9/10 - The story was beautiful. It was definitely different from what I was expecting. It felt so mature which many animes lack these days. It lackeda sense of adventure but it ruled over the slice of life genre.  The ending wasn't perfect, as much as I wished it. Yet, I feel as though there couldn't have been a better ending. It was truly amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10 - The art of this anime is what stood out to me. It was really a job well done. The style shocked me at first because the bodies and faces were actually proportional *gasp*. The characters were beautiful and so detailed. The piercings and the gorgeous clothing was what stood out to me. If I didn't give this a 10 just for the clothing itself, it will haunt me until I change it.\\n\r\nOne thing I thought didn't fit into the theme was when the characters turned into ballon heads, it was strange and I thought it didn't suit the mood at times.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10 - Somehow I thought the music wasn't as up to standards. Even though the OP and ED were exceptional,  catchy and suited the anime (thus the 8), there was a complete lack of background music. I think it was because they wanted to keep it more realistic. Though, in my opinion it didn't work because I felt as though a mood was lacking. I didn't know how to react during certain scenes. I felt like I was reading a LN. I also noticed that at certain points when a faint background song can be heard, it was misplaced. Nonetheless,  the ending theme was so good so I cannot say anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 - The characters were fairly good. I admit that I loved George's personality, he was different to many other characters. He was uncaring and thoughtless without being a tsundere. Yukari was a decent heroine. I have to say I would have never stayed with George for the time she lasted. She seemed like a pushover at times but redeemed herself with her will and beauty during other scenes. The supporting characters were all likable and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - I truly enjoyed this anime. I had an amazing experience. The only reason it has lost a point is because of the lack of emotion Paradise Kiss pulled out of me. I completely recommed it to anyone over 16, it has a few sexual references and scenes. Definitely will revisit this anime in the future, it has pulled me into the fashion genre.",

            "content": "*Don't expect plot summary from this review!*\r\n(Note: I was way too harsh on this when I first reviewed it. I've since re-watched it and really found it to be considerably better the second time around--so this review may get re-written at some point!)\r\nNot really my cup of tea. It does have a lot of redeeming values--the background art is frequently lovely, and the clothing designs for the characters (and how often they are changed) is to be admired--oftentimes anime characters are only given an outfit or two and just cycle through them, much to the relief of the animators, no doubt. That said, some ofthe more extravagant outfits here are barely animated at all--annoyingly enough, this includes the ornate dress the characters have spent the entire series hand-crafting. When we finally see it it's mostly only in still frames, or with the model wearing it being shown simply bobbing up and down as she walks. Granted, I know essentially nothing about runway fashion, but it seems to me that part of the appeal about an outfit like this would be the way it behaves as it's actually being worn and moved in, so it's disappointing to lose that dimension of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the characters are fine for the most part, though they largely remain pretty firmly rooted in anime stereotypes. There are some exceptions, which are especially noticeable in the minor characters--all of whom are more interesting than the primary protagonist, whom I actively disliked. By and large she's a typical anime heroine--klutzy, lovesick, unsure of herself, etc.--this is made up for eventually when she manages to grow a bit of a spine, but the fact that she occasionally goes into complete bitch mode doesn't really make me any more invested in her ultimate fate. Unfortunately, the side characters aren't explored to the same level of detail that she is, and the writers cheat a bit by making at least two of them very wealthy--which explains how they can get away with everything that they do without suffering much in the way of personal or social consequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also doesn't quite know when to end--the denouement stretches on for at least a full episode longer than it should, though at least it works hard to wrap up pretty much any questions fans should have about the fates of the characters they've spent so much time with up to this point. All in all, it's a fine coming-of-age story, and its frank (well, PG-13 frank) explorations of teenage lust are worthy of praise. I was ultimately underwhelmed by it on the whole, but I could see it having a stronger effect on others, particularly young women. This is a series I would not hesitate to recommend to a 13-year old girl, which is something I rarely find myself unable to say about many anime series I watch.",

            "content": "This is my first rewiev since I joined here and I don`t know when I will write another.\r\nA friend of mine recomended it for me and when I saw the title I was expecting anything: between hentai and madness and still, the show took me by surprise.\r\nThe series has 12 episodes, and is part of the Romance genre, but I think it's more than that. After you watch the first episodes, you'll find it sounds more interesting than the title, which is the name of fashion houses.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is centered around a student, Caroline (Yukari Hayasaka), who is noticed by a group of designers, andis proposed to be a model and present their creations. She rejects the idea initially, especially after she sees Arashi, a punkhead with piercings, who runs after her. After passing out at the sight of Isabelle, who was dressed as a widow, Caroline reach designers shop, which will become their place of entertainment for the next period of her life. She befriends rather quickly with Miwako, younger sister of a famous clothing designer, and is impresed by George, who is the manager of the whole team and the one dealing with all Parakiss creations, their own brand of clothing. Together with them, Caroline will spend the period before exams, and eventually will have to choose what path to follow in life.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics\\n\r\nThe graphic style of this anime is a little different of the  \"clasic\" style, especially on the characters level. These have features much closer to reality, girls characters have more lines than we are accustomed from other animes  and, as you will see, this increases their expressiveness. The animators did a great job with graphics. The characters are drawn almost perfectly consistent, regardless of angle, position or even hair and clothes. These last two elements are specifically mentioned.\\n\r\nWhen a character changes the arrangement of hair, it remains perfectly recognizable, but at the same time is deeply different, much like in reality.\\n\r\nIn terms of character clothes, and considering the subject, Paradise Kiss is impressive: most of the characters change their clothes very often (as would be\\n\r\nexpected from them) and clothes (and accessories) they are very great designed.\\n\r\nIn another chapter defining graphics, backgrounds, Paradise Kiss is somewhere in the middle level. Backgrounds are generally well worked and occasionally beautifully detailed, but rarely impresses.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe soundtrack was one of the impressive things in this anime, because I've rarely met songs so well rhythmic and exciting.\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED fit perfectly with the atmosphere and characters in this series, and this time, I liked both. The OP is called \"Lonely in Gorgeous\" and is composed and performed by Tommy february6 and the ED is called \"Do you Want to \", and is played by Franz Ferdinand. \\n\r\nMarika Matsumoto plays Miwako. Her voice is most remarkable because it seems much younger than she is (22 years). Hiroaki Sano was Music Producer for the series Jyu Oh Sei (another great OP), and the music was made by The Babys group, and with Narasaki voice from Coaltar of the Deepers.\\n\r\nAlmost always you will hear the noise of the city in crowded places, the people who speak or cars passing on the street.\\n\r\nOtherwise, you will hear most often the heavy metal that Arashi is listening in the workshop, and you will also hear the \"Ballad of Arashi\".\\n",

It's not a fairy tale type anime, but yet it still tugs at your heart. \r\nQuriky and original, you could see this anime being someone's actual life. It's fun, funky and a pleasure to watch. \r\nWith tons of fashion, drama, and interesting characters, this show doesn't have a boring episode. \r\nI wasn't a fan of the art in the beginning, but it grew on me as the anime progressed. I think it perfectly suits the tone of the anime, and the characters themselves. Brightand quirky! Two words that perfectly describe everything about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending wasn't at all what I expected, but it was very fitting, it is realistic and makes sense, considering what had happened throughout the show. It left me satisfied with the conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nIt's short, but I think for the story line, a longer series would have dragged and lost the wonderful upbeat momentum. I don't think it would have really been able to go anywhere had it been longer. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is fairly good, most of the voices match their personalities very well. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want something light and easy, but enjoyable to watch then I would recommend this!",

            "content": "At this point in time, Studio Madhouse was starting to feel the weight of the industry pressing down on them. Pumping out the amount of anime that they were just meant they could not keep up both quality and production. For this reason, it was around this time in late 2005 where Madhouse started to slow down a bit, and begin to look for alternative ways for anime production. Paradise Kiss is actually a sequel set within the same universe as the show Neighborhood Stories from the mid-90\u2019s and is a standalone story from it as well. Returning Madhouse Director and person who likes tobe part of everything involved with the anime he works on is Osamu Kabayashi (Beck). \\n\\n\r\nYukari Hayasaka is in her final year of high school and is pretty much bored with life. She does not care much about which university she ends up. All she wants is to get out of town and do something different with her life. This is where by happenstance she runs into a group of college fashion design students that want her to be a model for their final project. After some convincing, Yukari agrees to the task and slowly learns and gets engrossed into the world of the fashion industry.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost immediately the audience can see the similarities between Paradise Kiss and Beck (2004): same director/studio, still frames, heavily detailed in the theme of the show, silent settings for characters, and it is more of a teen drama. Basically, Paradise Kiss is an unconventional unique anime. However, it suffers from similar faults as well: bland backgrounds, awkward moments without a reason, a strangely rushed conclusion, and weak romance elements.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are the strengths to Paradise Kiss? That starts and ends with how clothing, body language, and the fashion is presented. The characters are presented extremely detailed from something as simple as a few strands of hair falling over an eye to the outstanding detail of clothing texture with authentic designs. This show also shows a pretty good portrayal of a teenager struggling to find their reason and purpose in the world. Yukari learning what it means to takes risks towards a passion, learning the difference between a fling and love, and what it means to grow up are all great examples of a protagonist\u2019s struggle. Even the other characters in the main cast have unique portrayals. In particular, the character George whom has bi-sexual and sadomasochistic tendencies, the anime tends to focus more on his passion for the fashion industry than his alternative life choices.\\n\\n\r\nParadise Kiss is one of the most unique examples of an anime breaking away from the norm. It truly represents a slice of life focusing on something other than a hard-romance. Everything in this show seems to be new and refreshing at the same time. There just isn\u2019t enough of these kinds of anime and Paradise Kiss is one of those that a typical anime fan will need an open mind to dive into.",

            "content": "This review is mainly intended to convince people to watch this anime (don't read the ending section) but also for finished watchers. I mainly talk about characters here. \r\nI'm writing this review right after I finished the 12th episode, and I've got a lot to say about this beautiful, beautiful piece of work. Its just so realistic, touching, and inspiring. I loved how they portrayed the physical aspect of relationships, because it just made the show so much more believable, and REAL. I will cut the chase and keep my review as succinct as possible, even though I can probably talk about for ages.\r\nGeorge-- So a lot of people call him an asshole, but to be honest, I think George is one of the best male characters/boyfriend ever. Now his crude and sometimes emotionally ruthless personality really does characterize him as a dick(player and all, apparently he also had a boyfriend??), there is no doubt in the fact that he inspired Yukari to be who she is by the end of the show. He was someone who encouraged her to be independent, tell all the haters to f*** off, and believe in herself. His incredibly liberal attitude got me shook, because its rare to see such a mature character who has very 'western' ideals. He only does what he wants to do, and pursues his own dreams, regardless of what the society or people around him say. To me, George was an incredibly inspiring character, in addition to being a total gaudy, hot, billionaire (His family is LOADED its insane). \\n\\n\r\nMiwako - At first, she just seemed to be a typical pink haired loli with a really high pitched voice, but in the end, I really liked Miwako. I consider her kind of like that cute, happy friend that just cheers everybody else up. \\n\\n\r\nArashi - piercings and band and fashion! Yes! At first, Arashi seems like that boorish, angsty teen you don't want to talk to. However, he is surprisingly pure and loyal. He is loyal to his friends, his love music, his love for Miwako, and his beliefs. I love his relationship with Miwako, especially the moment when he says that sex isn't what makes him happy. His like a gigantic teddy bear on the inside and definitely BFF material. The song he sang for Miwako was so heart touching I legit hugged the computer screen.\\n\\n\r\nIsabella - An unique, transgender character. Unique, yes, but still realistic as hell. Though short, the flashback to her childhood as a boy with George was enough to give depth and meaning to this character. His struggle with her gender was on point, and how George gave him the dress was a genius way of establishing their friendship.(Again, why George is AWESOME) Isabella was like the mature mom of the group. She always gives consort to people around her. You can't hate Isabella. And of course she just also happens to be loaded and GORGEOUS. \\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki -- A sensible, likeable character. Honestly if everybody were to be like Hiroyuki, the world would be a better place. I'm not gonna talk about manga spoilers, but from what I read this guy had a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, Yukari -- I love her character. The development in Yukari was astonishing. From her lack of motivation in life and family pressure to her current model self, the process was well written and again, so realistic. Personality wise, I couldn't find anything annoying about her *surprise surprise. She is usually calm and levelheaded, not over dramatic, have great work ethic and an amazing attitude towards life. I love her interactions with George too. She's a female MC that can stand her ground, and I respect her for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what made this anime so enjoyable. So I won't waste my time talking about the story, because the plot is for you to discover and all I've got to say is that its well written and developed. and have an inspirational message. \\n\r\nMusic was good. Arashi's song was amazing. But otherwise, it did its job. The opening had a super catchy intro. \\n\r\nArt: it was such a turn off sometimes. So Madhouse was experimenting with some weird photographic inserts as backgrounds, which was more evident in the first few episodes (THANK GOD), like I know you're trying to be unique and hyperrealistic, sometimes it just looked downright awkward. The black, faded out transition cuts were sometimes super awkward too. \\n\r\nOtherwise, the characters were animated with care. I loved how expressive the eyes and eyebrows were. \\n\\n\r\nENDING:\\n\r\nThe first thing I thought of was the movie LaLa land. Yukari and George doesn't end up together. Now people might be mad about it, honestly I was happy about it. Because it was exactly what George(notably) and other characters stood for. This idea that they are all walking their separate paths. If Yukari went to Paris with George, this would mean to contradict her own beliefs. Thank GOD she stays to pursue her modeling career. Life isn't perfect. Life is full of sacrifices. \\n\r\nI mean, why should watchers even complain when even George said to Yukari: \"That's the right choice/answer!\" when he asked her if she wanted to come with him to Paris. \\n\r\n**This didn't mean I wasn't balling at the end though. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a masterpiece. The only reason why it wasn't a 10 was because of the issues regarding art I had mentioned above. Otherwise, it takes the crown of being the best romance/drama anime I've ever watched.",

I started out just looking for a decent anime to tide me over for the night, I hadn'tput much effort into my anime search, I just went for the first thing that popped up on josei romance search. But one episode came after another and then another and before I knew it it was over and part of my soul was missing.\\n\\n\r\nI just binged watched this whole series in the last few hours and didn't even realize it until that devastating ending. (spoiler alert) SERIOUSLY WHO ENDS A SHOW THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED THROUGH TOGETHER WITH OUR EMOTIONS RUNNING DEEP WITH AN ENDING THAT IS SUCH A SLAP IN THE FACE. I really really appreciate the realness and maturity of this story, it is so relate-able on a very deep level but GOD can we not get an ending that rewards us so this emotional roller coaster we have just been through? I get it, emphasis on the realness but this is a story, an escape from our real shitty lifes. If we can't get our own happy endings at least we can watch our beloved characters get theirs.!!!..I'm just ranting because I didn't get my way but this really was an amazing anime that I didn't expect to leave such an impression on me.",

It was inspiring, sure, and the art was great, but from the beginning to the end I felt an underlying bitterness that I couldn't get out of. \r\nNO SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nTHE CHARACTERS \r\nSo, even though some of the interaction in paradise kiss was more realistic than in other shoujo anime, I never got to liking the characters. The main girl didn't really have anything going for her and her love interest was extremely selfish. The fact that they fellin love felt unrealistic to me, the love itself felt more like lust and infatuation, too insecure and I personally just didn't see the point. Even though the other characters were reasonably interesting, I found that the little backstory they got was rushed, and I never got to liking them either. No-one made me smile and I wasn't particularly rooting for anyone. I think the makers were going for a realistic vibe, but part of life is the fun and I didn't have it, and I never really saw the characters have it. So why did I keep watching?\\n\\n\r\nFASCINATION \\n\r\nMost stories I love are the ones that have great characters, reasonably realistic and lovable. And though I think these were meant to be lovable or at least have some appeal they all seemed desperate to me. It missed one of the essential parts that I look for: Comfort. I need a bit of hope and comfort, a great friendship or deep trust or a love story that isn't just driven by passion. When none of that is there it just sort of drags on for me. I did keep watching, not really because I wanted to know about the characters but because I got fascinated by the feeling that it gave me. Somehow I just got an incredible feeling of growing bitterness and despair from every episode. I didn't really care about the story but it did teach me things about what I absolutely don't want from life. I'm a songwriter and I paused several times to write songs because it gave me that feeling of at least knowing my own priorities and goals. They were all pretty dark songs. I certainly found it interesting to watch but I'm never going to watch it again. It's just something I wanted finished, but the fact that I didn't stop proved that I was fascinated, which is why the score isn't dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nBE WARNED\\n\r\nDon't go in expecting a happy go lucky anime, I know, I probably already made that pretty clear. I don't think everyone finds it depressing, but I do, and it kept eating away at me. I get that some people love this anime, and some who crave realism might find what they are looking for. But personally I didn't find the story all that realistic and it just mostly made me feel kind of empty. To me the world doesn't look anything like it was portrayed (figuratively, not literally of course) I hadn't meant to give it a five but I writing this I just couldn't feel good about these aspects of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSO ENOUGH DEPRESSING STUFF\\n\r\nThe art was, well, ART, it was beautiful, a bit more realistic than most anime and really artistically done. The colors were great, I never once skipped the theme-song-video and it was overall pretty awesome. Some of the same shots were used a few times randomly, which bothered me a bit but I liked it a lot overall. It really fit the story and the vibe too. The music didn't stand out for me but never really bothered me either. \\n\\n\r\nYOU MIGHT LOVE IT\\n\r\nI do think that some people will love it, it might really just be personal perspective or priorities, it was interesting, beautiful and flamboyant, and I do think the dialogue was well done and more like the actual confused human beings we all are than a lot of other shoujo anime. I just couldn't see the point in the choices the characters made and I didn't believe them to be real, so the dialogue sort of drowned in that frustration. The anime left me feeling a little hollow which could be either a good sign or a bad sign, I'm not sure yet. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped in making your choice, I can't really recommend it but I can't say you won't love it either so good luck!",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss\r\n Growing up is probably the hardest part of our lifes. Because when you get older you do not see the world as you used to see. You want to try everything to know what is wrong or what is right. The life always teaches you the best but the hardest way. You don\u2019t have to be 50 to understand the world. Because age is just a number only mistakes get you older. Since I watched Nana, I am a fan of Ai Yazawa. Because until now, she is the only person who made me see a girl\u2019s perspective in a realistic way.\r\n ParadiseKiss is an anime which aimed for the girl audience but unlike the most of shoujos it is a bit deep for me. You will understand what I want to say while you read:\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is about a girl named Yukari who only focus on her education and she does not have any intention to be a model until she come across with a group of the fashion design students who want Yukari to be a model for their fashion show. At first, even she does not want to do this, then she becomes friends with the student and her heart is stolen by our main character named George then she decides doing this. But the rest won\u2019t be pink as you think. She will want to discover the real world and it will cause a problem because of the pressure of her family. Then she has to decide which one she will choose: Education or Stepping Into The Life?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: To me, the most important thing about the characters is seeing the development of them. And you will definetly see it and fall in love with the characters. Because every character has own their stories. You will try to empathy to the character especially with Yukari. It was really enjoyable to see Yukari\u2019s growin up.You will ask yourself if you were her what would you do. We will witness Yukari\u2019 choices, George\u2019s stability on his job, the other characters\u2019 facing with the past\u2026Also I think the girl audience will fall in love with George who was created by inspiring Brian Slade from Velvet Goldmine. And this makes George a very charismatic and flirt character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ai Yazawa\u2019s art is simply amazing to me. Her design and different drawing style make her an unique artist to me. But for the people who has not seen any work of Ai Yazawa, this type of art might disturb them. Because everything in Ai Yazawa\u2019s works are proportionated \\n\r\nand glamorous. You can see the characters do not wear the same clothes everyday. And seeing gothic lolitas and rock chicks will make happy the boy audience too. Well at least I became :) Also you can see lots of detail in it: the boys with the  piercings, glamorous and exaggerated clothes, even a crossdresser too. And some of you may  find it weird because of not seeing it in every anime, but the buildings and some places are live action\u2026\\n\\n\r\nMusic:  To be honest I was surprised when I first listened the opening and ending song. I was not expecting something like Nana\u2019s but it was better than I expected. Nothing could fit in this anime except indie-rock / post punk type songs and luckily the opening is very suitable to this anime. And after hearing the ending I screamed because the ending song was from Franz Ferdinand which is one of my favouite bands. So if you are into indie music you should check that songs. They are really good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: It does not have any stereotype in a shoujo anime like the school festival, valentines day etc. Also there can be people who say we could not even see a kiss. Well I can tell you that you will see more than a kiss. And our main character is not a loser. I mean she is rebel and a strong girl to survive to the real world. \\n\\n\r\nSatisfying Ending: Well, I always talked about the good parts in it. But ending was not satisfying for me. Maybe it is just because I don\u2019t love the unhappy endings. But it made the serie more realistic to me. \\n\\n\r\nBad Sides:\\n\r\n-Some events have no connections to each other.\\n\r\n- It was too short and the final episode was not satisfying enough. I mean everything just happened suddenly and I could not keep up. It should have more episodes \\n\r\n-Some of the scenes were unrealistic to me. Like the relation with Yukari and her mother\u2026\\n\\n\r\n All in all, Paradise Kiss is an amazing anime for me. And it is one of the best shoujo\u2019s I\u2019ve ever seen. To know what to do in the future and gambling with the fate is really hard. The anime does not say what to do. It gives us options then we decide what to do. As a boy I really enjoyed this, I hope you all enjoy this I did.\\n",

            "content": "I decided to watch Paradise Kiss due to its similarity with Nana- one of my personal favorites for a long time. The story follows the main lead Yukari Hayasaka who\u2019s your typical: type A, devout, hardworking high school student. She\u2019s approached by group of students to model for their high school fashion competition. The story follows her internal, family, and friendship struggle in choosing her own future rather than following what her parents laid out for her. Ai Yazawa, as always, outstands with her beautiful artwork and exceptionally wonderful characters. Each character\u2019s life struggle is reflected in our own, which allows us to deeply bondwith the characters. What I love even more about Ai Yazawa is the fact she shed light on the lgbtq community through her beautiful characters. I was really disappointed with the animation\u2014there were many parts where the animation seemed out of focus or too slow, which is a shame since the artwork was extremely well done. Overall, it was a lovely anime with realistic view on life decisions and relationships.",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss is basically about a girl name Yukari who is tired of her boring old life and want some excitement. Well, she gets it when she gets across one of the designers from a group who designs what is known as \"Paradise Kiss\". They need a model to represent their dress for the upcoming fashion show so they decide to pick her. Along the way, she meets other characters, falls in love, struggles a relationship with her mother, and finding who and what she can do in her life. \r\nStory: \r\nI think Paradise Kiss definitely has a unique storyline to it. Other than theusual love story and friendships, the story about a group of students who dreams of being a fashion designer. One other reason I liked about Paradise Kiss is that the story has more realistic stories into it and not have girls with gigantic boobs or have dragons and talking animals (I'm kind of exaggerating).\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nFor me, I thought the producers did an amazing job with the animation. Even though it's not the best quality, not to mention it was aired in 2005, but the details were significant and not to mention the pretty designs they came up with in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nEven though I liked the OP song, the BGM didn't stick out too much for me while I watched the series. And even when I finished the series, I wasn't looking forward to getting the OST or even looking for it. (hm.. now that i think about it, I don't have ANY of the songs from its OST..) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nFor an 12 episode series, I think they did an amazing job at giving personality to each characters. There's the tough guy, the cool guy, the confused girl, the cute innocent girl, and bunch of different character. And I admit, I couldn't help but like every single character in the series. It's one of those series where you just have to understand and accept their personality and not complain about it, espcially at the end since alot of people didn't agree to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this series and it's kinda disappointing that I watched it not so long ago, and not when it first came out. If you're into romance and just a everyday life story, then this one's definitely for you. Finally, Paradise Kiss gave me a good life lesson personally. Hopefully, it will do the same for whoever watches it \\n\\n\r\nc:",

The art is inspiring, and the story it self leads to think about your own life choices, why we do what we do, and, in my opinion, it's the definitions of great anime, if in the end, you not only enjoy watching it, but also it stirs questions about yourself. \r\nThe love story is not themain object of all anime, which is great. And, like i said in the begging, it's painfully realistic, it shows how relationships aren't just about romance, it's also how they help grow and how they change person inside. \\n\r\nThe ending killed me little bit, but hey, that's life, and any how you look at it, it's beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nI'm still heartbroken, but I'm also in love with this anime. \\n",

            "content": "I figured I knew what I was getting into when I read what Paradise Kiss was about. I like shojo manga and this one looked like a classic one. While what I did get was entertaining and typically shojo in many aspects, it was also a little disappointing and fell flat at times.\r\nStory- The story wasn't bad, and i think overall it was a very interesting take on a typical school story. The modeling aspect gave the story a distinction from all the other similar high school love stories. My biggest issue with the story was how it ended. I won't spoil anything, but Ifelt like there were many many loose ends that weren't elaborated on. And while I have watched anime with a mysterious cliffhanger type of ending that did work, this one didn't. I was just left asking too many questions and wondering why the final episode didn't feel like a last episode at all until the last 5 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is pretty, and a nice adaptation of the manga style. I thought it fit the high fashion style the story was about and the over dramatic clothes and hairstyles really fit in to the scenes well. While the art was pretty, there were visible hiccups in the animation and it didn't always flow as well as it could have.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The music was good, and the opening and ending songs fit the type of show this is. But one of the things that drove me crazy was the English dub voice acting. Yukari and George, the two main characters, both had voices that were overdone and silly. While there were a few actors I recognized and enjoyed their performance, they were often minor characters who didn't get much screen time. The main cast was a little annoying to listen to, and all seemed very forced. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I did NOT like George. Still don't. But that doesn't really affect my score for character. Yukari's personality was very similar to a good natured teenager who goes on a rebellious streak and something good comes out of it (her modeling). But George just seemed like an ass to me. He never really changed enough throughout the course of the show to grow on me. Most of the other characters were typical or boring in my opinion, but I can see some of them (like Miwako) being a likable character to many people. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I felt a little bored through a lot of the show, and I didn't care much for the level of progression that was set. But it wasn't a bad show, and I did like it. In the end it was worth watching, even though I would likely never watch it again.",

            "content": "I give this story a 10. I watched it because it was recommended if you enjoyed the anime Nana created by Ai Yawaza. Her stories are always powerful and have a lot of different and unique characters to relate to. The plot was wonderful. For other being only 12 episodes, I was worried that the story would be sped up with alot of confusion but no, perfect pace and it ended nicely. Some people didn't agree with the ending but I say it was satisfying once you realize the meaning of everything that happens on this anime.\r\nFor the art, very realistic. And also, alot ofpeople hate seeing an anime with a bunch of characters that look the same and hard to follow. Everyone here are unique and have their own distinctive look. Different voices, they all don't sound the same. Also, this anime is about fashion, so the different styles of clothing they create here is pretty nice too. Some people thought it's ugly or old fashion but people need to remember that this is an older done anime. Fashion sense were different then. I seen what was being portrayed with the art given here. The main character, Caroline is changing and learning new things about her and how to control her life, so in each episode her fashion sense grows as well as her maturity and independence.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, the opening song isn't too bad. I know it's called Lonely in Gorgeous. Also, since I watched the anime Nana English dubbed, I did the same for this anime to see if the voices were sorta similar or the same. They were similar. I watched it English sub and their voices fit well with the characters too.. the little music that is played in the background fits well with the scenes. Nothing that jumps out, most noticeable songs played are the intro and outro.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, I am only going to do the main character because I am trying not to spoil it.. Yukari aka Caroline, she's basically the main character. Her mom is very strict on her and for her 18 years all she's done is study to become the best in school, for her mother. Once her new friends discovered her inner talent before she could, she then elopes for several days. Confident in her choices. Trying to find what exactly she wants for herself, and no one else. How to be your own person and not make excuses or blame others for the decisions you make. The relationship she goes through with her boyfriend George and her other fashion friends helps her grow up and become an adult. Not knowing she actually had someone in her corner to give her advice, she gets herself together and do things the right way. She's also given an ultimatum but does not regret her decisions. Everything is a learning experience and viewers can relate to her because it's something that everyone faces in their life. But she actually had the courage to not follow in anyone's footsteps except her own. It was either a beginning of a new love or beginning of a new career. The message was very powerful on the last episode and it's not a sad one, it's a realistic ending with no sugar coating.\\n\\n\r\nGeorge, Yukari boyfriend and also head of fashion line Paradise Kiss, I felt that the creator made viewers wishy washy with him. The whole time you think he's being a fake controlling person but overall he was very kind, thoughtful and sweet to Yukari. There are a lot of things left unsaid about him that makes you not like him so much but can see how much love the both of them had for each other. These two are the ones you will remember the most. The other characters are great as well. I love all of them and all of them have their own story which I love. You get to know where they all come from from , flashbacks occur as well and the passion they all have and strive for.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, I love a anime that is realistic and that I can relate to. I don't really like short animes but the message is powerful and universal. I recommend this anime and it's one of those you would watch again. I hope my review helped out and I hope whomever that reads would watch it and get a taste of how well put together it is.",

            "content": "Short and to the point review:\r\nThe year is 2018 and I randomly decide to watch \"Paradise Kiss\" which was aired +10 years ago. How does it compare with today's anime standards?  Pretty well I must say.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe main story themes are Romance, Slice of life, adult themes and Drama. We follow final year high school student Yukari who wanders through life not knowing what she wants. Blessed with good looks, Yukari one day is asked to model for a group of fashion students for their final project.  \r\nAnimation: 7/10 \r\nCompared to today's anime standards, Paradise Kiss' animation is quite good. For sure youcan tell the animation is \"out dated\" but it was good enough to not bother me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nSound wasn't impactful but nor was it an issue. In other words, it had little influence on how I feel about Paradise Kiss. The opening and ending themes are quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nWe have an interesting mix of unique characters each with their own background stories and life struggles. I'm sure most people watching can relate in some way to each character's experiences.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nIt was a fun and interesting series. Going through each episode was not an problem and I was keen every time for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\r\nI recommend Paradise Kiss for mature audiences. Perhaps those aged +17 can better appreciate Paradise Kiss because of the many life lessons the show displays. I give the show a 8/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss could've been as great as Nana was.\r\nRight of the heels of my favorite Josei-Drama and listening to that Opening, I knew I had to watch Paradise Kiss as well, a well-cared-for child of noitaminA with an ending by Franz Ferdinand.\r\nAnd for the most part, the heart and personality of these characters really pull the show.\r\nSure, some of them aren't nearly as realistic as the others, like the sisters Mikako and Miwako, one of which looks 14 despite being in her mid 30s and the other that still has me debating whether or not she was supposed to be a cute ditz girl oractually mentally challenged.\\n\\n\r\nBut on the other hand, George, Yukari and especially Isabella are especially well-written and realistic characters in contrast and all of them have interesting lives who just happened to intermingle. \\n\r\nA beautiful young man with sometimes very ambiguos motives interested in fashion with a very estrangered relationship to his family, a girl who feels the need to break out of her normalcy, but mostly ends up asking others what to do and struggling to find her own way, and a beautiful woman set on her path by a certain impactful connection in her past and present.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is tailored to fit these characters especially well, too - they carry it in its entirety. It's just what happens when these characters come together, kind of like Baccano is carried by being as wild and badass a show as most of its characters are. It's all very natural and these people bounce off of each other very nicely.\\n\r\nThis show also has a lot of style very reminiscent of the early 2000s and you can tell its author really loves and cares deeply about fashion.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite all these elements covered - in my book some of the most important aspects when watching an Anime - the show still ended up pretty underwhelming.\\n\r\nThe main problem is the noticeably rushed pacing and its many time skips as well as the production and lackluster presentation in general.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really would have greatly profited from a 20-episode run to balance these elements better and show more out of the life of these characters, give them room to breathe. Isabella especially suffered from this, as one of the most interesting characters next to George, but once her \"secret\" if you want to call it that is revealed, she kind of falls by the wayside. Same goes for the relationship between Miwako and Arashi - whom I haven't mentioned before because he is, while still likable, probably the least interesting character of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at this show however... while the character designs and outfits are beautiful and the general setting feels authetic, especially the bar these characters spend most of the time in, you can really tell that the author was still working on her style that had not fully come into its own. There are quite a few super-deformed moments for comedic purposes, but almost all of them fall flat. Aesthetic aside, some of the timing with these really doesn't go together with the more naturalistic voicework in most of these.\\n\r\nThey're also not that well integrated. What was probably just a small panel on the edge of the page in the Manga now goes full center and the contrast feels a bit jarring at times.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of awkward transitions between scenes that drag on for long enough to distract.\\n\r\nThere's no snap to the change between scenes most of the time and it makes the whole show feel kinda sloppy and slow.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those shows I feel conflicted about because I can see its heart and intentions that are my kind of thing, but it's all so washed down with the poor production and other small problems that I can't enjoy it as much as I think I should.\\n\\n\r\nIt was worth watching, and I'm happy this helped the author to show so much of her understanding and interest in Nana, but as it stands, it's an unpolished diamond not allowed to shine as brightly as it could have.",

            "content": "It is obviously not the idea to compare animes with each other but ParaKiss was a little bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong I still loved it and thought about it a lot when I was not watching. It even kept me from other work that I needed to do. \r\nHowever with a series like Nana I expected a little more. They could have done so much if they only changed the amount of episodes there were available. Twelve is not enough for a series like Paradise Kiss. They needed at least 24 and even if they covered the same amount of thisstory it would have still be enough. A little more flashbacks was something that would make me love the characters a little more and understand them a little bit better. For example I loved Isabella/Izabella, and it was a bit weird to get the flashback or the background of her story so late and at one point that it didn't make sense. Why was it necessary there and couldn't you get a glimpse of a flashback earlier on when Miwako said that you couldn't change in front of the boys, which should have brought a big question mark. Anything else but the end. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the theme and that also reminded me a little of NaNa, which is also the reason why I started to watch Paradise Kiss. Because I love the art from the Nana series and obviously love the art from ParaKiss. The details for music, clothing in both series is absolutely terrific! Which brings me to the next subject: in Nana it is clear why they put so much attention to both clothing and music. Which they don't do with Paradise Kiss, yes the clothing is explained but the idea of Arashi in a band, that could use some extra background again. Same between about the fights between Hiro, Arashi and Miwako. Arashi said he stole Miwako, flashblack please. \\n\\n\r\nIt had so much potential to only miss out because of the fact that it could only have twelve options. So I would say that skipping the anime is a way better job to do and read the manga, than the other way around. What I have done at this point. \\n\r\nI will read the manga, might be in a year because I don't want to keep repeating for myself. But I'm almost 100% assured that the manga will be so much better.",

But soon after seeing the art style I became very skeptical and slowly turnt more negative each episode. But that only lasted until about episode 3 or 4, which for an anime that only consists of 12 episodes, is pretty long. But still I kept watching, for reasons unknown to me something was pulling me in, making me want to keep watching. Which I did and then bam in the blink of an episode I liked it all of a sudden, I started being able to appreciate all ofthe characters and I loved how you could see them grow throughout the series. After a while it turned out that one of the characters thinks in a pretty similar way to me, which was awesome :) \\n\r\nAll in all it was a pretty good show, with an heartbreaking ending and I suggest you check it out.

            "content": "You know...I don't even know where I picked this one up in the first place, and I certainly never expected it to be this good. This truly was a breath of fresh air, and something decidedly different from any other seinen anime I've ever seen. \r\nThere's something about the story which just kept me hooked until the very end - and yet, it's just about a girl taking matters in her own hands and choosing the job that would truly make her happy. With the persuasion of a few people, of course. The setting is all about fashion, and while you may not be interestedin clothes, this anime puts a very nice twist on it. It all flows very naturally, plus THE DRAMA IS REAL. \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself might turn some people off - and I can understand that, as it's rather unique. But in my opinion, it's beautiful, and as stylish as one of the characters' hand sown dresses. It's very expressive and pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they were what kept me hooked the most. All of them had their clear faults and realistic personalities, and didn't really have that 'anime' feel to it. I loved every single one of them, got mad at them, cried with them, and I cannot express how satisfying it is to watch some well developed characters who grow and mature beautifully. Their relationships are also both believable and interesting. The romance is wonderfully written, and you can't help but squeal when Yukari and George share their first kiss. There may be times where the characters [the protagonist especially] will make you sigh, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was rather pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. The opening and ending songs were, however, both catchy and fun. Extra points because the ending made me stay.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to conclude everything, let me tell you this. If you need a break from all the constant fluff and tsunderes, and would rather have something down to earth and realistic, then you should give this one a shot for sure. I don't usually rewatch anime, but this one enraptured me, and I recommend it 100%.",

Miwako Sakurada is the pink-haired student who works with George and is exceptionally cute and sweet and tends to act child-like manner, either by the dress of the Lolita style and engaging personality. Arashi Nagase is the student with a taste for punk style, piercings (especially around the oral area) and alternative music. He is Miwako\u2019s boyfriend and despite that they seem really unmatched for each other, they have known each other since childhood. Although one of the subplot in the series is that Miwako had feelings for Hiroyuki Tokumori, an prodigy who goes to Yukari\u2019s school and was the object of her affections, and Arashi is known of that, which is why he\u2019s insecure of that. Isabelle Yamamoto is the mother figure of Paradise Kiss and is the epitome of high class and femininity and also inspired George\u2019s first dress during their childhood and often encourages Yukari when she needs it the most, whether it\u2019s George or her studies. I don\u2019t know if this is spoiler territory or not, but she happens to be a transgender woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you already know, this is based off the manga series by AI Yazawa and it\u2019s a stand-alone sequel to her previous work, Gokinjo Monogatari, although that manga or the anime isn\u2019t in English. There is also the point that a 5-volume manga is only squashed into 12 episodes. I\u2019m not complaining about that but it seemed like some parts of the anime may have either been rushed or forgotten.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show isn\u2019t what most people call \u2018original\u2019 but it\u2019s not the same rehash of any other story you ever heard. The themes of the story are very realistic, along with the characters, and you feel like you actually know some characteristics of people in real life pursuing their dreams of doing (insert whatever you can think of, I wasn\u2019t really interested in just the fashion part of the series).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is done by Madhouse (9th times the charm, isn\u2019t it?) and it does show a lot of quality brand of animation around the time of 2005 and even if it\u2019s been over 7 years since the release, the animation still holds up today and the one thing that does weird me out is the deformed looks of the characters once it\u2019s shown and it is me, or does Yukari in her deformed mode looks like if Olive Oyl was an anime character? I\u2019m serious about that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music really holds up well during the show, especially the opening and ending music. The opening theme, \u201cLonely in Gorgeous\u201d by Tommy february6 has this funky vibe of J-Pop mixed in with \u201880s Madonna vogue music. \u201cDo You Want to\u201d by well-known British pop-band Franz Ferdinand, originally from their album You Could Have It So Much Better, and I like it how it always played off during the end of an episode that isn\u2019t a clean cut to the end credits, plus, it\u2019s an fairly awesome song to listen to. The background music is not really that noticeable throughout the show but it doesn\u2019t stick out awkwardly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Despite that I really don\u2019t know much in the fashion world, I did enjoy this series in it\u2019s entirely. The story is very compelling and doesn\u2019t stray away for only one character as it covers basically all of them. This is the type of anime that focuses on realistic characters in realistic situations and do you know how people always say \u2018we need a break of the norm\u2019? Well, Paradise Kiss is the break of the anime norm.",

From the beautiful animation, to the heart-warming story, this series executes its purpose with effortless perfection.\r\nStraddling between elements of realism and dream-like extravagance, Paradise Kiss pulls its viewer's into the life of a high school girl turned model. Although the premise may at first seem contrived, the storytelling transforms every girl's dream into a story of escaping routine and finding happiness.\r\nFor anyone and everyone who has ever felt trapped the routine boredom of everyday life, Yukari's feelings echo the secret wish to run away. Coupled with oddball characters, this normalhigh school student finds her own definition of living her life.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard for me to rate any aspect of this show below a 10--from the fantastic animation and great voice acting to the masterful storytelling, Paradise Kiss is perfect. If you liked Nana, you'll love this short from Ai Yazawa.",

The Comedy genre is definitely out. Don't go and put the genre as Comedy if it only has several laughable scenes. As a comedy fan, it pissed me off.\r\nSome other animelike Usagi Drop also has some comedy in it, but you don't put it as a comedy because it's not. So does Paradise Kiss..!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I hate the main character's voice. What with her voice? She sounded so lame. She is supposed to be someone beautiful and repulsive, so the voice should be more lively and confident. Just hearing her voice makes me annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the anime, there were like some unnecessary stuffs. I don't even know what are those for. Just skipped to the part where the title is on.\\n\\n\r\nFor the male character, I don't have any feeling for him.

The only reason I went back and tried again was that I wanted to watch something similar to Nana. And I actually believed I could find an anime with a balance of story with actual intimacy without it being boring.\r\nSadly to say I didn't find what I was looking for.\r\nI watched this dubbed but I'm sure watching it subbed wouldn't have mattered too much anyway. But for the dubbed version, the voice acting was so terrible that it took out any emotion they were trying toconvey.\\n\\n\r\nYukari was such a bitch I didn't see any growth in her. She was a teen with no identity and acted as a robot for her mom. But even when she rebelled she acted stupidly. The stupidest line in this entire anime from her was \"There's no point in fishing high school if you're not going to go to college.\"\\n\\n\r\nGeorge didn't seem like a teen. He seemed much older. Not to say he was mature though. He was a jerk who tried to come off as cool but was just as boring to watching. I didn't see or feel any kind of chemistry between him and Yukari.\\n\\n\r\nMiwako, like some characters, reminded me of characters from Nana, not surprise there, She reminded me of Misato. But Misato did not have an annoying, fake voice in the dubbed version and she came off as much more mature for a kid. Her relationship with Arashi was a little interesting but they didn't show as many scenes with them for me to care enough.\\n\\n\r\nArashi reminds me of Nobu, but of course, Nobu, like most of the Nana characters, are much more mature. This guy who ironically had safety pins for piercings was a typical, cliche jerk who happened to be the \"voice of reason\".\\n\\n\r\nThat Hiro guy was the most annoying busybody.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the anime had potential if it had gone a different route and had more episodes. But in the end, it just didn't work for me.",

Another thing i like about this anime is it shows \"Caroline\" the main character in the story just wanting to make something of herself which is so cool. I also like how in each episode a little is revealed about a character so each episodeleaves you wanting more (or me lol) I also love the soundtrack of this anime its so jpopish and technoish and rockish that it just makes me wanna dance lol. But the only thing that i can say about this anime that i dont like is that i think that Caroline and George's relationship are moving way to fast  in the beginning in my opinion.

            "content": "Don't expect me to go into artwork and sound reviews cause I'm no artist but all I can say is that it looked good and I could hear everything without that weird off screen sound change thing some animes like to do.\r\nAnyway on to the real review.\r\nI decided to watch Paradise Kiss after putting it off for a while....actually I put it off once then forgot about it for months. Now if you've read my other reviews then you know that I love slice of life animes. Not slice of life in space or supernatural, or fantasy. But true slice of life animes that showreal people in real situations. I haven't read the manga nor watched the live action version(I never watch the live action of any anime). So I went into Paradise Kiss knowing nothing of the characters and the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved about Paradise Kiss was the fact that this was a true slice of life that could happen to anyone, the story tackled mature relationships, sex, love, falling in love with the wrong people, jealously, fighting with parents, and all of the things I'm sure any teenager nowadays can relate to. I know I have fallen for the wrong guy, argued with my mother, struggled to live up to her expectations and failing, and thought of running away from it all. So I can relate totally and I will always remember this anime as one of the VERY VERY VERY few that tackled real life in its purest form. I don't know about anyone else but we need more slice of life anime types out there as I'm sick to death of yet another \"boy gets mysterious powers that enable him to fly a mech but he's a regular high school boy\" animes. The horse has been beaten to a bloody mangled mess with that plot. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure by now that you are wondering why I did not give this anime a perfect 10. Well it is simple. It's too short and the character develop is shotty as all h*ll. \\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Yukari aka Caroline: She's the heroine of the story. When we meet her she is an arrogant, snotty, haughty little b*tch. But things change when she meets \"George\" and she sees that unlike her they are all actually working toward their dreams. It softens her up a bit and she even apologizes for talking crap before. It seems that from here on out Yukari was going to be an okay character, flawed still yes, but a girl who starts to make some real changes and turn out a better person for it. However, we get no such luck and in some cases her development is all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nFor example; She was \"in love\" with a boy named Hiroyuki from school. She never confessed her feelings, thought he would never like her, and was taking secret pictures of him from some bushes. yet almost to the middle of the 12 episode series she's all but telling George she wants to bang him. Now wanting to have sex with George isn't the problem here. It's how she went from shyly taking pictures of one guy to out right telling another guy she wants to \"get closer\" without showing the audience how she reached that point. Sure we start to know that she is becoming attracted to George but it seems so out of the blue. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it's hard for me to take Yukari seriously. All she does is say she will do something then sit around all day thinking about George. Then I had about enough of her character after having the gall to lecture George's mother about her life. Okay miss runaway, high school dropout, living at your rich boyfriend's house, and getting modelling jobs handed to you on a silver platter by your friends. I guess you know all about struggling in life to talk to someone's mother that way. Seriously, I don't like this girl, sure she has her moments but that is all she has, moments. and typically those good moments are followed by her being a crybaby, suffer able b*tch.\\n\\n\r\n Like for example; finally walking down the runway and making everyone proud at the school fashion show was great! Then after she doesn't get what SHE wanted out of doing it she pouts, cries, wonders why everyone else is happy, and is generally a pain in the a$$.\\n\\n\r\nGeorge is the typical playboy bisexual. A rich kid living off daddy's money and I'm sure some see him as the antagonist of the show, if there was to be one. He is the bad boy your mother told you not to fall for. he won't treat you like a princess, but he will whisper sweet nothings in your ear until you can't stand it. He'll have multiple partners but tell you that you are number one, deep down inside you know its a lie, but he's an awesome kisser, looks like an Adonis, and can screw like an Incubus so you allow yourself to wallow in the dream he seems to magically weave for you. I have to say. I love George. I really do. I tried to hate him cause in some ways I'm supposed to but I liked him. Why? cause he never told Yukari a lie and seems to stay true to himself and demands that others stop BSing and do the same. For example, he flat out tells Yukari that he can get over her if she wants to end it, he got angry with her clingy behavior after she started to put being with him over her own modelling career, he straight up call her out for blaming everyone else for her own d*mn life decisions. I loved him for it. Sadly we don't get to see more of what makes George tick as a person. We just know that his mother is weak, his father is rich, he's the illegitimate son  (his mother was the mistress), he loves designing clothes that are beautiful and whimsical, and he was very accepting of Isabella when he came out as transgendered. I wish I could have known more about the bisexual aspects of him. It's hinted that his boyfriend was the makeup guy (don't know his name) but the story doesn't show us more about his feelings in that area. We do know that he was seeing the guy while he was also seeing Yukari though.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are Miwako, Arashi, Isabella, and Hiroyuki. They are all very interesting characters but sadly we get no true development from them. I would have liked to know more about the triangle between Arashi, Miwako, and Hiroyuki but alas we get a  bunch of small snippets of info and contrived moments thrown together to explain it all. They never go into what Hiroyuki saw in Yukari when honestly he has more chemistry and history with Miwako.\\n\\n\r\nI will try not to spoil here!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is another factor that dropped the ratings for me. I loved George's and Isabella's part in the end as I feel that they are better suited to do what they want to do and I love their friendship even though it wasn't developed much. Yukari's end just shows why I just don't really like her and probably never will, I feel bad for Hiroyuki(and I'm saying this from reading their character bios that give away what happens int he manga). \\n\\n\r\nPersonally let me just say that the ending was so freaking vague and such a non ending to the point where I had to read the character bios in hopes of finding out what the heck they were talking about at the end with Yukari and her brother. if you read the manga then I'm sure you would know but to people who haven't it was such a WTF moment. Sure I got the jest of what was happening....\\n\\n\r\nOkay screw it, spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nYukari is engaged to Hiroyuki yet still wears George's clothes that he left for her when he left for Paris with Isabella. and they are going to see a play that George was the costume designer for.  *whew!*\\n\\n\r\nNow they never mention that it was Hiroyuki she was engaged to. I had to read the bio to get that. They just say fiancee. So basically she is marrying/settling for a man who loves her while she is still in love with George. So glad George opted for Paris.",

            "content": "There may be some spoilers here. Sorry. \r\nI\u2019ve watched this the first time it aired on Animax. I dropped it though, since I did not like the way the characters looked. Just this year, when I searched for something to watch, this came up. \r\nParadise Kiss is a story about Yukari\u2019s struggle with her studies, her family, her relationship with George, and the most significant: her new ambition of becoming a model.\r\nStory: (10/10)\r\nThe story was very inviting since only a few produce this type of anime. What\u2019s good about it is not only did they attempt to provide enough \u2018fashion\u2019, it also showed us thatnot all the models we know became famous just by being \u2018pretty\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a sad ending. Really. I almost wanted to throw my laptop in mixed frustration and sadness after watching that last episode. Also, I don\u2019t think 12 episodes are enough. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (3/10)\\n\r\nThis is exactly the reason why I didn\u2019t watch it on Animax before. Seriously. Even I \u2665 Dragonball and Crayon Shin-Chan has an even higher quality of animation than this. Cartoons would seem much more appealing to the eyes. Even if you merge all its aspects, it would still not stand a chance against the quality of animation of a fat Pikachu. It\u2019s a 2005 anime for goodness gracious. Why is THAT like THAT?!\\n\\n\r\nAs much as the still shots of Tokyo that were transformed with anime-ic features looked wonderful, all the others dragged it a long way down. Here are some of the reasons why: \\n\\n\r\n1) People didn\u2019t look like they were walking. They looked like manipulated paper dolls being put to their next position slowly. \\n\\n\r\n2) They had a lot pointless creatures that are pointlessly being pointless during prologues. Note that I typed that on purpose.\\n\\n\r\n3) Concerning their eyes, theirs seem slightly better than those of Persona 4: The Animation\u2019s eyes. But I\u2019m not saying that I liked it even one bit.\\n\\n\r\n4) It\u2019s a fashion anime. Why aren\u2019t there enough colours? Why is it that everything was so dull?\\n\\n\r\n5) And lastly, this anime probably isn\u2019t an anime. It\u2019s just a slideshow of pictures. From the studio, to George\u2019s driving, to Yukari\u2019s runway appearance. Almost everything was motionless. It was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIn due course, and I don\u2019t mean to offend Madhouse Studios, its animation is a dump. It\u2019s a failure. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\r\nTommy February had a catchy opening theme. Just its title, Lonely In Gorgeous, certainly suited the show. I didn\u2019t like the ending theme though. But I\u2019m not hating on THE Mr. Franz Ferdinand. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects like traffic, doors opening and closing, etc., were amazing. It was really realistic. It\u2019s like you\u2019re hearing it in person. And the soundtrack was good, too. Even though it had a few tracks, it was okay. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nSome supporting characters that played big parts in the series were not developed well. That was really a problem. But since some of them were from the prequel (which I have not watched and don\u2019t plan to), they must have been introduced properly there. That aside, the characters were very likeable. Like Miwako, who I think is a sl*t. Her character actually has a heart. And all the others as well. I also love how they perfectly presented Yukari\u2019s growing relationship with all the people around her.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I couldn\u2019t say that he was my favourite, but I think Daisuke/Isabella was really the most remarkable character in the series. He was confused, came out, and was proud of himself. Or should I say \u201cherself.\u201d And the fact that George had accepted his sexuality way before he even came out was truly moving. Now that's true friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nIf you love fashion (or even think about it sometimes), you will definitely enjoy this. Especially the parts where Yukari got her first magazine debut, and the showcase. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\r\nFashion. It\u2019s rare to find an anime with this genre. Although sad, its ending was very beautiful. Regardless of its horrible animation, Paradise Kiss is one anime that will satisfy your craving for romance, comedy, and fashion.\\n",

            "content": "There will be SPOILERS in this review.  \r\nTo start out, the artwork is amazing. I really enjoyed the complexities of color, the texture, and the oddness of the artwork. The music is fitting and enjoyable.  \r\nI thought the characters were great and well thought out. Although, for a main character, I did not find myself liking Yukari very much. I found her very childish throughout the series and even when she realizes this, she does not seem to change much.  \r\nMiwako was a very enjoyable character and I love her to pieces, but I did not enjoy her relationship with Arashi.I thought he was petty and cruel to her.  She states in one part of the anime that Arashi seems scary, but he is actually super cute...and then he breaks her cell phone for emailing a friend who happens to be a male.  Huh.  I was really hoping she would end up with Tokumori, but...\\n\\n\r\n...Yukari seems to be getting married to him at the end. x.x \\n\\n\r\nI really didn't think her and George would be together forever, but I didn't like this ending at all. I did like that George left her all his dresses, but it seems as though that symbolizes that he had moved on and she clung to the past by wearing them. Kind of depressing. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do the women always seem to be the ones who get left behind? \\n\r\nWhy did she have to marry anyone at the end?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a nice trip but I am not sure I enjoyed the conclusion.  Seems to me that Tokumori will always love Miwako and Yukari will always love George, even though they might not be the best fit for each other.  So heartbreaking, but maybe that was the point?  \\n\\n\r\nShows like these make me feel like the author wants the audience to view the characters as \"mature\" and \"adult\" for not indulging themselves and letting go of petty romances, but it seems cliche to me.",

Dub to sub transition is very well and the voices stay true to the original Japanese persona.\r\nIt's a quirky, fun, original take on a love story surrounded by fame and sex.  Definitely a series worth getting in to and the animation isimpeccable, but most anime that are put into motion by MadHouse do not disappoint.",

            "content": "Paradise Kiss, an anime where fashion and romance meet. Yazawa Ai is indeed a genius and I really love the way how she design the clothes in this anime. The details on the cloths are incredible. Yes, it's a fashion anime.\r\nThis anime not only includes fashion but romance, ecchi, comedy and friendship. Even though it is a short anime series of 12 episodes but it really caught my eye, the plot and art. There were some parts of the anime were I was cursing because there's a male character who has good looks, that really pissed me off because he was such a playboy andan insensitive bastard. (sorry, I can't help but tell you there is such man in this anime =w=\")\\n\r\nThere was also a part where I shed tears... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I say this is a fantastic anime. The manga is brilliant too. \\n",

            "content": "I'll start by saying that Paradise Kiss is a pretty straightforward anime, no crazy plot twists or tricks. It's about some random girl who is asked to be a model for a bunch of fashion students. But since that moment, the change in her mentality and her attitude is inspiring, and I loved how she really rethought her relationships and focus in life, just from this one event.\r\nWhat drew me in at the beginning was definitely the art: the characters are gorgeous without being too girly or cute. Yes their haircuts are a bit funky, but the way they are drawn really brings them tolife and adds colour to their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the second thing that drew me towards this anime: the fact that the characters are so outlandish but believable. Most other anime have almost archetypical characters, but Paradise Kiss tries to steer away from the typical anime characters by adding a bit more story and and depth, especially with Yukari and George (and their complicated relationship).\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, and most importantly, I felt like this anime was almost like a real story. You can't just expect everyone to understand how everyone else is feeling in real life, emotions and thoughts are sometimes unpredictable. Sometimes I would honestly be wondering if George is using Yukari or if he really likes her. Also, the character development you see in Yukari is incredible, from a girl who conforms to the typical expectations of a high school student, to a girl who wants to discover more about what she wants to do for herself in the future. Maybe it's a little bit of a reflection of my own life story, but Yukari's development really made the difference in the story, which is what made me want to watch it right to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like watching characters develop on an emotional and spiritual level, if you like fashion and if you like the idea of being independent and following your dreams, then you will definitely love Paradise Kiss!",

            "content": "This is a good short and sweet watch. I enjoyed this ver much so and the fashion or the artsy side of the spectrum didn't draw me into this at all amazingly. The STORY is your run of the mill, average story of a normal girl who gets a once in a lifetime opportnity. It's really nothing to complicated to get into. This is a double edged sword, making the story safe, but still follows the blue print of this kind of outline, keeping the pacing to be almost perfect. I found that the story did not linger on, making me want more. The ARTis \"different,\" stylish and reminds me a lot of Nana. It uses bright colors and subdues them into more of a matte appearance, in comparision to the shiny luster of most other anime. This show was produced by Madhouse, which speaks volumes on the quality. For those who are unfamiliar with bones, they're work is OUTSTANDING. There are no complaints from the peanut gallery. The art style itself is unique, like I said. This could take some getting used to, but it's all based on preference. The SOUND also follows suit to the trend. The opening is graced by Tommy Feburary 6 and the show exits with Franz Ferdinand. They fit the mood of the show keeping that stylish, fresh and nouveau feeling. The CHARACTER department is something I have a bit of a tiff with. Each part of the cast has their own highs and lows. However character developement seems a bit inconsistant, it was not a gradual change. This is especially a problem for the character of Yukari. All in all I enjoyed this show, the chemistry between the cast was a great redeeming quality. This is not a typical show for everyone, but definately give this smooth ride and test drive. Have fun.",

Not good at all, they simply cut A LOT of stuff, and shorten a lot of emotional scenes.\r\nThe ending was much less melancholic and deep than the original because of this cut.\r\nIt would be 10 otherwise.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThere are some akward lines that they drew arround people's eyes. It looked fine in the P/B manga, but ir really weird in colour.\r\nSound: 10\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing, and notonly the awesome OP (Lonely in Gorgeous - Tommy February6) and ED (Do ya wanna - Franz Ferdinand [YES!!]).\\n\r\nThe background songs from the atellier are natural and pleasurable. It's an OST worth downloading because of the CD that would be kinda 'show' of Arashi's band, being pretty good J-Rock songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharachter: 8\\n\r\nAgain, the time spent in useless somehow made the carachter much less deep than in the manga. And Arashi's personality is quite different also.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10\\n\r\nI guess I explained that already.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, VERY worth it.\\n\r\nDespite being really recommended to read the end of the manga later for better understanding.\\n",

In fact I think that sentence is the short version of my whole review ^_^\r\nThe story is really simple but I don't think that is something bad at all. Because the simple way to tell the story gives more space to concentrate on the characters and the problems in life.\r\nYes, life. How will you find your own dreams? how will you achieve them? Can you find true love? And how about family? Everyone will face those questions and ParaKiss really show how the characters stand in just that place in life. I made the story realisticand true.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, but in the same time it gave me things to think about and recognize myself in. It is not a fairy-tale where everyone will achieve ultimate happiness, it is more realistic but that will also give so much more.\\n\\n\r\nI really recommend Paradise Kiss!\\n",
