            "content": "This is one of the shows where you can just relax and anticipate. This is not one of your romantic comedy, but a great parody comedy. The anime provides light romantic scenes for those who are interested in the romantic genre. There will be many references for those who are experienced anime watchers and there are common references from previous anime throughout this year and last year. There are many fun filled adventures that kept me watching this anime. \r\nThere is nearly no plot in this anime. It is just a parody anime that just focuses on making the audience laugh and have a goodtime. There are many gags in this anime that it makes up for the lack of plot. I can say that the scale of fun to episode ratio is going up at a steady rate. What I love the most is the gag with Mahiro and forks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is drawn quite good. I love the fact that the director uses Nyarko's hair strand to indicate her feelings. Other than that, who can't love the trap (Hasta)? Hasta is voiced by Kugimiya, Rie !! There is also another great character, Kuuko. The scenes Kuuko brings offers a tremendous amount of comedic events. Last but not least, we have Shantak! If you're into moe, this would be a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is just great. I've enjoyed season 1 and season 2 was a good sequel. The characters are likeable and the fun factor is quite high. The music is amazing (OP/ED). The company put alot of money and made different endings. Each endings refers to an arc and it's quite good in my opinion. Even though this anime lacks a plot, the element of surprise from this anime will cover it up.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Understanding the jokes of a comedy/Parody is the key to fully appreciate a comedy. It would be impossible for me to go on without showing you the following example:\r\nHK Student A: wow, the new student leader was elected for just 700 votes! That's soo low. \r\nHK Student B: At least it is better than Mr.689*\r\nThis is what the show's all about. \r\nThe biggest problem for any non-Japanese to understand the show is the parodies of the show, which is what it's all about. The show included a lot of Japanese culture Neta(s)/Parodies that paid tribute to Classic anime/shows (That includes Posture, Lines, Character names, Scenes),Call of Cthulhu (and any other related works), Songs, Pop Cultures, Japanese law, News, Fiction or TV personalities, with the help of word plays, a considerable silly plot (that you could almost said as nonsensical at times.) and a bunch of characters that think of nothing besides having sex with Mahiro. \\n\\n\r\nIt is perfectly normal for a non-Japanese Citizen to misunderstand or even get none of the show. Nyaruko is a show created for the Japanese audience and it would do very well for the locals, and it does not intent to go further than that. From an execution POV, You've got to say that they actually manage to squeeze a lot of things into an episode: From Rider show Parodies to Galgame Scene Tributes, It only gets wilder and crazier on their second season. To achieve such a scale of squeezing so many things into one single 23 minute episode is an admirable effort and probably hard for an audience to understand most of the jokes, But the sub-Groups are always there to help. \\n\\n\r\nWhat? You\u2019ve just say that the sub-groups can't even figure them out either? God bless you then.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, this would be and should be an enjoyable show. But it is not. \\n\\n\r\nA comedy show is all about laughing. A comedy show that can't make you laugh is NOT a good show and Nyaruko Fail at times. While Nyaruko and her friends are doing their absolute best of being silly and dumb on every episode, the parodies that you've missed would eventually get into you and you will be feeling strange. You will feel like that you missed out something that the show's trying to offer - since this wacky show is only completed with some more crazy tributes, and you are only watching half of the show, missing the another half. \\n\\n\r\nI am not trying to complain if there is anything wrong with their decision. This is nothing wrong at all: just like an American writer would writer for the Americans, Chinese would write for the one's living in China, so as the show intending to be watched by local Otaku that had an extensive knowledge on Japanese Culture. It is WE that are wrong if we attempts to think \"why am I not understanding any sh*t of this thing this is so difficult I am just going to cut this crap off\"\\n\\n\r\nDespite I don't really get the show at times, I am still giving the show a 6 because of the following reasons: \\n\\n\r\n1. The show does nothing wrong. It is a fun show and there is nothing wrong with the plot - despite being whimsical and eccentric at times. Nor does it do anything really right, or even good. \\n\r\n2. In a technical POV, They manage to squeeze so many things into an episode, which is something hard (despite it is difficult, almost too difficult.) to do. Imagine you have to use lyrics from 30 different songs to create a script that is meaningful and fun to watch. You will scratch your head and eventually wave the white flag. And that\u2019s only the beginning for this show. \\n\r\n3. I do watch a subbed version that gets most of the Parodies explained. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, it is a good show. I would not suggest you to watch if you didn't have a good sub group to help you understand. It might be strange, but a good sub could definitely help you understand better, especially for this one. \\n\\n\r\n6.\\n\\n\r\nPs:\\n\r\n1. 689 means the Chief Executive......whatever, I would rather not explain.\\n\r\n2. If you are asking \"Where the F*ck is the character review\". I would say NO. I am not your daily reviewer that talks about every aspect of the anime. Instead I only discuss the parts that were most controversial or I found something special among the others. I mean, what's the use of me writing \"Mahiro is a Japanese boy that is kind and generous at times\" and \"Nyarlathotep is a white hair loli that would like to make love with Mahiro\" and I would then say \"well I love the characters.\" WHY SHOULD I WASTE TIME TO WRITE SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GOOGLE THEM.\\n\r\n3. Except some very very special cases, if I am the reader of a certain anime review, I would think: WHO CARES IF YOU LOVE THE CHARACTER OR NOT. This is a review and I should be critizing the show, not spending times circling around. I need to know how REALISTIC they are.\\n\r\n4. Do you think gods from Call of Cthulhu in reality are really \"REALISTIC\"? At least you've got an unbeliever here\\n\r\n5. I guess anything comes AFTER the jokes in a comedy show, right? How could you possibly called a show a \"comedy\" if it is not amusing at all?",

            "content": "2014 couldnt start better!! I have watch alot of different anime, and I have a taste for lots of different things on anime, I like smart, well thought, with character and story plots anime... and I like anime that doesnt care about those 4 points I just stated but that still entertains you! IF BY ANY MEANS you are looking for any one of those 4 points in this series, I suggest you just skip it! This is crazy japonese harem madness (generally harems arent much my thing, but this anime is a few of those exceptions)!! Almost nothing, if something at all, that happensin Nyaruko-san series is on check with reality!! Truly a japonese anime, they dont hold anything back on this (dont expect this to be a ecchi show like To LOVE-Ru thought, Xebec another production), I have watch all of To LOVE-Ru anime, and if you had like that, probably you will like this. \\n\\n\r\nObviously if you are on pair with what the show is about you know you cannot expect a great story, the story here is just supporting all the comedy, light romance, jokes and gags that Haiyore! throws at you. You got the male guy (Mahiro), this time a tsun tsun one... and his adventures with 3 different deitys, based of \"The Cthulhu Mythos\" based on H. P. Lovecraft universe, so these deitys are supposed to be very ugly and disfigured... but you get 3 cute girls... wait one of them, it is a guy... \\n\r\nItself the story isnt that bad, it is full of cliches, but still it goes well with the flow of what this anime is about. Story=6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the Art, I m gonna admit it, I LOVE MOE characters!! One of the things I like in anime is to see cute things, it is a charm of japonese culture, this anime breaths of kawoiii madness! The models of the characters are very well done, for being focused on the characters emotions and expressions, they done a very good job at it, I truly love Nyarko cuteness!! If you like moe characters, you will enjoy this alot. For me, it goes as far as to be wanted to be transported to the anime for a couple of minutes, and just pat Nyarko head, and hug her and yell kawoii KAWOII thousands of times (something I would see as a crazy desire normally...), they just nailed it for me!! Art=10/10\\n\\n\r\nOP's, op's... I dont like most of them! Garbage, sorry I just dont care for most pop romance japonese weirdo songs outhere!! BUT for some reason, both of the Op's of the first and second anime of Nyarko I fully watched, FOR ALL of the time, they are that catchy, I dont understand how composers do this, but the songs just feel right when they are played, for how light and generic the plot is, sometimes you may think the sound would just as bad... wrong!! Quality, everything fits right on, for the sad, despair, anxiety, colourful and more happy scenes brought in together, the sound department done a great job with the atmosphere, again specially the OP's!! I see myself going back and play these again and again without feeling bored. Sound=9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, this is what the anime is about, and what will be decisive if either you like this anime or not!! The characters are what defines this anime, they arent that special, you cannot expect amazing character development or gripping plot of them!! \\n\r\nMost of the times they only do crazy and stupid things a human being wouldnt possibly do (a feature of most japonese animes), but this is what makes me love this anime so much, I wanted funny and light-hearted moments, I didnt searched for a reality check, life is hard, and we need to endure it, but for me I sometimes like to have a break of that world!!\\n\r\nBeyond Mahiro with Nyarko at main characters, for supportive roles worth to mention you get Hasuta, \"Hastar deity of the wind\", that wants to make babies with the main male character, but he is a guy (this annoys me alot at first, but then you just dont give a thing bout him no more)... \\n\r\nKuuko \"Cthuko deity\" is quiet and calm, except when she is close to Nyarko, the one she loves despite being mutual enemy species, and both \"girls\"!! And then Ta-Damm, Nyarko \"Nyaruko, a Nyarlotephian deity\", one of a bright personality, that can pack a punch and kill enemies in very gore ways, she is in love with Mahiro and has to \"protect\" him of any harm other than herself!! She defines what I like about the series.\\n\r\nMahiro as some very annoying moments (tsundere male... I love tsundere females, being a male one feels weird at first), but Kuuko and Nyarko... they \"fights\", and dialogue between them and other characters, all the jokes and references, and the romance between this harem, THIS SHINES!! Like I said soo crazy, stupid and not logical, that I just laughed and laughed throught the whole show, most of the people might not agree, and for them this might not be a good mix, but for me, it was just what I was looking for, enjoyment!! Truly stupid and illogical at that, but it made me almost maratoon this whole series (something impossible being myself in college exams \"happy-fun-mode-time\", YEAH ME!!...).  Characters&Enjoyment=10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to give it a 9, I gave the first season a 8, this one was more enjoyable, I already knew almost all of the cast, I enjoyed  season 1, and I wanted more of that crazyness comedy satire stuff, so when I started watching Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W, I got large doses of that!! And in the end, I have felt realized from what I wanted to get from Nyaruko-san W anime. \\n\r\nMost people wont agree with my review about this, I agree it isnt a anime for everybody, but for what it is about, its premise, for me, it was a dazzling gleam!! I wont forget these characters, they made laugh alot and have a good time, and Nyarko, one of the most illogical, delusional characters I ever saw on a harem... I m her fan, VERY proudly!! \\n\r\nEverything has a place to be, a moment to belong to, either amazing, gripping, complex, perfectly logical stories, or crazy stupid madness fun comedies!! Both, and has of now, \"Miss\" Nyaruko \"Nyarlotephian deity\", have a place to belong in my heart and soul!! With great expectations I wait and hope for a third season to come!! xD",

After all, who doesn't want, no NEED, more video game and Cthulhu mythos in their life?\r\nDon't expect any big reveals, revelations, or character progression--everyone's pretty much the same and the stupid adventures are justas stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIf I can find any criticism, is that Mahiro (the protagonist/love interest) has given up the straight man act this season, which was one of the funniest parts of S1, but also understandable if you hang out with abominations all day. There are also too many callbacks to S1 so it feels like a rehash of the same premise and story lines.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Kuko is less rapey--not sure if that's a bad thing, tho.\\n\\n\r\nI will finish by adding:\\n\\n\r\nJoker!\\n\\n\r\nCyclone!\\n\\n\r\nJoker?\\n\\n\r\nCy-clone!\\n\\n\r\nJoooohker!\\n\\n\r\nCyclone cylone!\\n\\n\r\nJokeeeeer!\\n",

            "content": "With my review of the first season of this my main complaints were the Harem,Annoying MC, The Trap and that i think Nyaruko should have been the MC.\r\nWhile the fact that this is a Harem still slightly annoy's me it's not that bad when compared to other shows with them. Harems are always annoying cause there will always be one character you like more over the others and want them to be with the MC. While i don't want Cthuko to be with the MC ( Witch has started to happen and is annoying) I do want her to be with Nyaruko. They in myopinion make the best couple of them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC while not as annoying as the 1st season doesn't mean he isn't as annoying. There just isn't much likable about him. He tends to be overly rude to the girls of the show and you start to question his sexuality. Especially sense the trap is the only person in this harem he doesn't assault when the trap is try to sexually advance on him.\\n\\n\r\nThe trap seems to have gotten a smaller role in the first couple episodes of the 2nd season. It's nice but still the fact remains the trap is in this. \\n\\n\r\nNyaruko i still feel is just the best character all around. She has more of a personality than the MC. The MC's personality comprises of Being an Asshole,Annoying and always assaulting people that have any affection towards him ( Except the trap) I honestly imagine the show with Nyaruko as the MC being about her just going around doing random crap and not caring about any humans seeing her. While also having the MC in the group of friends. I also see a harem with her being the main star a lot more attracting than this. Nyaruko and Cthuko would be the main love interest cause they both have the best chemistry. \\n\\n\r\nSomething new that bugs me is the constant use of how all the people in the universe are weak against forks. The joke gets old after the first couple times in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nCthuko herself actually got more backstory and is probably the 2nd best character design there is right behind Nyaruko.\\n\\n\r\nI still think that the first season should've ended with the MC and Nyaruko bodies being swapped. I still think this would have lead to more comedic stuff down the road even if it only lasted a couple more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that has bugged me is how week the two eldritch deities can be especially Nyaruko that is a pretty famous one. Hell, I wish they would just talk more about her being a deity known for making people going mad and other shit.\\n\\n\r\nThis also has a really touching confession in it by Nyaruko. Probably one of the best i'v seen sense Rem from Re:Zero\\n\\n\r\nOverall story is still fun to watch and enjoy .",

Characters have been established, and there is little development to be had.  This isn't that kind of anime.  \r\nThe really key point to this review, though is Nyaruko-san herself.  Never have I been more irritated by a character, yet wanted that character to succeed in winning the hapless/gutless/herbivore MC's heart.  I had to pause episodes I was so bothered by Nyrauko, yet I still foundmyself rooting for her. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely worth watching if you liked the first season, and if you haven't seen the first season then I would recommend that too.",

This isn't the actual title of the show, but it might just as well be.\r\nIt's a borderline hentai, harem comedy show centered around a group of the most horny anthropomorphised lovecraftian deities of various species and genders stalking a possibly asexual teenage boy to have themselves, or, in some cases, the boy, impregnated.\r\nIt sounds cruel and horrific, and it is. What it also is, is stunningly captivating and hilarious in its lack of dignity. The show is highly self-aware and takes advantage of not taking itself seriously in everyway possible.\\n\r\nThis is the most \"anime\" show you could possibly find. Example:\\n\r\n[MC enters room, main love interest kneeling on bed in maid costume, trying to be seductive just like literally every fucking evening]\\n\r\nMC: \"It's kind of stupid to ask this at this point, but why are you here?\"\\n\r\nNY: \"My nightly service to you, Mahiro-san!\"\\n\r\nIf this kind of humour makes you gauge your eyes out, you can delete all your cringe comps and watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nA) What I expected when going into this show: (backstory, expectations, predisposition) \\n\r\n\t...Sigh. So they turned the second season into an actual clich\u00e9 harem show?\\n\r\n\tThe first season was already enough to make it to my trash top tier, so I expect a more coherent plot this time.\\n\r\n\tAt this point I am convinced that Mahiro is actually a lovecraftian deity with the power of being irresistable, and this show is just a Mahiro dating sim.\\n\r\n\tAlso, I expect this show to be at least 50% more about gaming than Gamers!.\\n\\n\r\nB) What the viewing experience is like:\\n\r\n\tWHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON\\n\r\n\tWHY IS KUUKO INTO MAHIRO NOW?! WHY IS [Redacted] INTO HASUTA?!?!?!?! WHY THE FUCK IS THERE AN EPISODE FOR SHANTA AND ITS THE WORST FUCKING THING\\n\r\n\tJokes aside, this is a continuation of the first season, spot on. It's more of the same, but a bit more balanced, and with more focus on the characters.\\n\r\n\tBut hey, it's at least 50% more about gaming than Gamers!.\\n\\n\r\nC) What I think this show excels at:\\n\r\n\tProviding enough mental food to keep you scarred for all eternity. God, where is the bleach. *cough* episode eight *cough*\\n\r\n\tEnough fanservice to make everyone uncomfortable, but enough decency to stop when it starts getting unbearable.\\n\r\n\tAlso, there's foreshadowing of the worst kind everywhere. Cyclone is a keyword. Trust me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nD) What I think it fails at:\\n\r\n\tActually exploring the romances it poses as possible - understandable, given that there are approximately 10 possible ships in this show, all involving the MC.\\n\\n\r\nE) What the show surprised me with: (in a positive or neutral way)\\n\r\n\tThe second season was way more proficient at giving the interactions some more nuance, if that makes any sense in the clusterfuck that is this show's lineup.\\n\r\n\tMany of the issues I had before, like Mahiro never getting a reason for Nyarlko's affection, and some more, at least were lampshaded or even addressed in some form.\\n\r\n\tCompared to season 1:\t\\n\r\n\tMaking Mahiro more likeable, apart from him still being a dick to Nyarko MORE than to others, which is unacceptable.\\n\r\n\tMaking Nyarlko waaaaay more understandable and even -gulp- more human?\\n\r\n\tMaking Hasuta fucking irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nF) What I wish the anime had done, but didn't: \\n\r\n\tSadly, there was little opportunity for the characters to explore the setting, yet again.\\n\r\n\tIf they had a longer runtime for this show, which I frankly actually wish it did, they might have wanted to make more out of this whole lovecraft-satire thing.\\n\r\n\tAs it stands, this is more of a harem show that's a bit on the creative side.\\n\r\n\tAlso, as much as they invested time in all the characters, I can't help but feel that it still wasn't enough. (Yes, I want a third season. I know, I am crazy.)\\n\r\n\tAlso, actually finishing the relationship story after two seasons. This was the ONE thing I expected it to do, but alas, as most harem shows to this day go, it ends with the most mediocre achievement for Nyarko, so we can only dream about Mahiro finally making up his mind.\\n\r\n\t[Dreaming about Nyarko-san is not recommended.]\\n\\n\r\nG) Should you watch it? (whom is it for)\\n\r\n\tOnly watch if you saw season 1, survived, and can't stop watching. Don't take a break before watching season 2, you can go right ahead as it continues the same way.\\n\r\n\tIt's definitely entertaining, if you are at least mildly masochistic or have a sick, dirty mind. Or both. Does the latter imply the former? What? Sometimes? Huh.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nSCORING: \\n\r\n1) Proficiency in execution\\n\r\n9/10 - This show knows what it's doing, and is great at pulling the audience's triggers for cringe, laughs or both through its confidence to meet the expectations of clich\u00e9 and go even lower.\\n\\n\r\n2) Depth of concepts and characterisation\\n\r\n5/10 - It felt like the characterisation went deep enough to make the show at least okay by the end. Considering its short runtime, it used its buildup well, which is applaudable.\\n\\n\r\n3) Entertainment value \\n\r\n9/10 - Ridiculous bullshit never fails to deliver. Not quite as juicy as actual hentai, but there's a reason it's PG-16 in the US.\\n\\n\r\n4) Memorability (expected, needed for long-term investment)\\n\r\n6/10 - Much more memorable for some reason. I guess it's the stockholm syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nQuality Score: (average of PROF and DPT )\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFun score: (Product of ENT and MEM divided by 10, long-term)\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: (decided on a whim or vodka)\\n\r\n6/10 - Good.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the OVA-\\n\r\n[cereal spitting guy]\\n\r\nWHY IS THAT A PURE FANSERVICE HOT SPRINGS EPISODE\\n\r\nAs if this show didn't have enough fanservice already, golly gosh. I'm not watching it. This time for real. Never.\\n\r\nI'm serious. There's another OVA that's actually good, so why waste time on pseudo-hentai?\\n\r\nI've heard it actually has character development.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so it may not be well written or helpful, but please bear with me.\r\nFirst off, I want to say that if you're looking for a very serious romantic anime like Clannad, keep on looking, because this anime would not be for you.  But if you're looking for a good laugh and something to pass the time, then look no further.\r\nStory - 6\r\nJust your usual \"Alien comes to Earth\" anime.  Nothing that stands out, nothing really unique.  But this anime isn't really centered on the story.  At least to me.  The one majorflaw of this anime was the absence of an actual conflict/goal.  *Minor Spoiler Alert!* Every time that some alien was trying to kidnap Mahiro or destroy the Earth, it was always for some really stupid reason, which was funny in the beginning.  I expected the crisis at the end to have a little more depth because they had a pretty decent plot.  They could have done so much more with it.  But instead it followed the usual pattern, which was a big disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nBeautiful art work.  I loved how all of the characters looked, and everything was visual appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe opening and ending.  Although they fit the anime well, I didn't really enjoy them that much either.  I thought that the background music fit each of the situations fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nNot that much to say here.  Nobody really stood out for me except Kurei, Tamao.  I think that they could have done a lot more with her, since she liked Mahiro, but also gave advice on how to make Mahiro fall for Nyaruko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot.  It always kept me entertained with their constant flow of gags, but sometimes they can get a little old and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nThis is a pretty enjoyable anime overall.   This is not a series that you really need to watch, but I think it is worth looking over.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nNever in my life did I think that Haiyore! Nyaruko-san would get a sequel but here we are. I won't sugarcoat this; it's garbage.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHaiyore! Nyaruko-san W is by far one of the most generic shows I have seen in some time. Its first season was barely passable as an anime and by god this season remains the same. The story picks off directly after the first with Mahiro housing crime fighting Nyaruko, Cthuko, and Hasuta. A bunch of stuff happens where the gang has to defeat bad guys bla bla bla. While I wish I could tell you whatthey did this season\u2026I cannot recollect what the hell went on. I was just so mind numbingly bored that nothing really stuck through. The whole Nyaruko crushing on Mahiro continues this season with Cthuko even edging towards \u201cthe boy\u201d early on in certain moments. These passes towards Mahiro though are a sad excuse for character development.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPassable for maybe a 2010 anime. Some shots look good but they are far and few between.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an ok job but since they mutter the same lines over and over again it gets quite boring and annoying. \u201cMahiro-san! Mahiro-san! Mahiro-san! Mahiro-san!\u201d SHUT THE F$%K UP ALREADY! Also the generic soundtrack didn\u2019t help the show out very much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this anime is just an empty shell of some sort of character type used in most anime. You have the shy (and over used) annoying male lead, the asserting female lead, and oh and a boy who wants Mahiro\u2019s \u201cD\u201d and a girl who will swing for both teams. The characters did a piss poor job of providing any fun scenes. Literally every episode boils down to Nyaruko trying to get Mahiro to do something romantic while Cthuko and Hasuta try to cock block Nyaruko. Every episode just feels like the same events over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe funny thing is this review is probably way too generous. The only reason I bothered finishing this season is because a friend overseas somehow likes the show and it provides funny things to rant on. I have no idea how people support this sorry excuse for an anime when all it can muster is average at best quality. The characters are annoying, the sound is average, the animation is garbage by today\u2019s standards, and the plot is so unattractive; do yourself a favor and stay far away from this mess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0.1/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Somehow despite having two subpar experiences with this franchise prior to this series, I found myself yet again giving the devoted Nyaruko one more shot.\r\nNyaruko is a series that you need to watch with a certain frame of mind. Forget intricate stories and forget meaningful character development, this series is all about fun and making fun of stuff. The second season of Nyaruko is essentially more of what you found in the first season, which is a lot of nonsense, a lot of girl-girl and guy-guy relationships, and a lot of parodies of other series. If you like Nyaruko's over-the-top personality, she will most likelybe enough to carry you through the season. While an interesting ride overall, the second season doesn't contribute much plot-wise on top of the first season. In short, this is a fun watch if you liked the original and have nothing better to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt's been a year since the prequel aired and you can definitely notice a few animation touch ups. The uplift in quality includes an overall cleaner drawing style, increased sharpness, and improved color shading as we've seen from other shows. The characters from the original all return and are just as distinguishable as in the original. You even get a bonus as Shanta, the hippo-bat-bird chimera, gets a special episode dedicated to herself.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the previous season, you get a few action sequences though nothing is really standout in general (a lot of the fights even resolve while the camera conveniently shifts to something else). The action is totally overshadowed by the fan service as expected in a Xebec work. Expect Nyaruko to make plenty of advances on Mahiro; well to be honest you should expect everyone to make advances on Mahiro for he is apparently the center of the universe. Accidental fondling, suggestive positions, love potions, you name it and they've probably got it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis one was actually an interesting surprise. The new OP for Nyaruko is actually quite a catchy piece with a fair melody while still sounding distinctively like the first season's OP. The show has an abundance of EDs, unlike last time. A lot of these EDs are also quite good and range from calming and melodic to chaotic and techno-based. I personally like the calmer EDs (Yotte SOS and Sister, Friend, Lover). All the OPs and EDs are performed by the VAs. The BGM is identical to that of the first season and indeed includes the weird chant song.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs do a very good job overall with Kana Asumi as the standout by far for giving Nyaruko such an outrageously outgoing personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNyaruko W takes place after the first season and pretty much has the gang face off against completely random foes. Much of the series is episodic each with its own rising action and climax. The show doesn't really have a central story until the last two episodes where just a tiny eye drop's worth of plot progression takes place. The point of this season doesn't seem to be to further the main story line but rather to present isolated, ridiculous cases for our protagonists to face. From giant gorillas to squid-like creatures from Pluto, all of the bizarre antagonists and stories are resolved in fairly idiotic ways. The challenge here is to figure out the resolution before the show gives it away (as there are foreshadows hidden throughout each episode).\\n\\n\r\nAs with the original show, there are plenty of shows that are parodied. My \"obvious to find\" list to look for includes DeathNote, Dragonball, Chuunibyou, Code Geass, Toaru Majutsu, and Da Capo. The intelligence level of the overall story isn't very high, so I recommend sitting back and just enjoying some laughs rather than trying to critique the virtually nonexistent plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSo we already know that Nyaruko is 1000% dedicated to Mahiro, and we already know that Mahiro is an indecisive prick who chooses to make everyone's life miserable by not ending the harem route. As with the previous season, all the relationships are pretty much static and you'll hear characters repeat lines over and over throughout the show. At one or two specific points in the show, I got a tiny whiff of character development, but in general don't expect too much here other than Nyaruko's eccentric personality and body movements.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't give this any prizes for its story line or character development, there are definitely some humorous and enjoyable moments in this show. If my pacing is a sign of anything, expect this to be more entertaining than other shows in the season such as Mondaiji-tachi and Photokano. If you liked the original Nyaruko, this has more of the better parts while sidelining the bare bones plot of the original.",

            "content": "May contain some slight spoilers.\r\nHaiyore! Nyaruko-san W being the sequel of Haiyore Nyaruko-san gains it's character names in chtulhu mythos. Being character based series there is basically no meaningful plot. Plot driven by series of short arcs lasting from one episode to maximum of three episodes. Haiyore! Nyaruko-san follows simple pattern in progression of the story. First the event is introduced, then we have some attempt at building up tension only to end up in absurd anticlimax. The ridiculousness of the anticlimax divides people maybe to two groups ones who laugh and to ones who stare dazed trying not to cry. Being the former groupI enjoyed this series. Nyaruko-san has it's \"deeper\" moments which take up 5 whole minutes out of twelve episodes. For the plot i would give: 2 but to enjoyment value: 8.\\n\\n\r\nTo art and sound I can just say art was well looking but didn't impact me meaning bit above average meaning: 6. For sound only two things I remember are opening and the \"dramatic\" music playing during important moments. Opening depicts quite well the series, neither making no sense, so I can give sound: 6.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before this series is character oriented but the problem comes at the point when you ignore your opinion on characters and start tot yhink about them. There are 4 character which appear constantly on the show,male  \\n\r\nand female protagonist and 2 irrelevant supporting characters. Mahiro is mild tsundere, Nyaruko is borderline yandere, Kuuko(Chtuko) is lesbian, an Hasta is shota. Somehow it seems to me that Kuuko and Hasta are in the series to increase sales of doujinshi. While characters are enjoyable highest grade I can give them is 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W is enjoyable series which I would recommend to watch if not taking things too seriously. Objectively Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W is at most mediocre and to give it more than 5 would be overestimate.",

            "content": "This is one of the shows where you can just relax and anticipate. This is not one of your romantic comedy, but a great parody comedy. The anime provides light romantic scenes for those who are interested in the romantic genre. There will be many references for those who are experienced anime watchers and there are common references from previous anime throughout this year and last year. There are many fun filled adventures that kept me watching this anime. \r\nThere is nearly no plot in this anime. It is just a parody anime that just focuses on making the audience laugh and have a goodtime. There are many gags in this anime that it makes up for the lack of plot. I can say that the scale of fun to episode ratio is going up at a steady rate. What I love the most is the gag with Mahiro and forks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is drawn quite good. I love the fact that the director uses Nyarko's hair strand to indicate her feelings. Other than that, who can't love the trap (Hasta)? Hasta is voiced by Kugimiya, Rie !! There is also another great character, Kuuko. The scenes Kuuko brings offers a tremendous amount of comedic events. Last but not least, we have Shantak! If you're into moe, this would be a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is just great. I've enjoyed season 1 and season 2 was a good sequel. The characters are likeable and the fun factor is quite high. The music is amazing (OP/ED). The company put alot of money and made different endings. Each endings refers to an arc and it's quite good in my opinion. Even though this anime lacks a plot, the element of surprise from this anime will cover it up.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Understanding the jokes of a comedy/Parody is the key to fully appreciate a comedy. It would be impossible for me to go on without showing you the following example:\r\nHK Student A: wow, the new student leader was elected for just 700 votes! That's soo low. \r\nHK Student B: At least it is better than Mr.689*\r\nThis is what the show's all about. \r\nThe biggest problem for any non-Japanese to understand the show is the parodies of the show, which is what it's all about. The show included a lot of Japanese culture Neta(s)/Parodies that paid tribute to Classic anime/shows (That includes Posture, Lines, Character names, Scenes),Call of Cthulhu (and any other related works), Songs, Pop Cultures, Japanese law, News, Fiction or TV personalities, with the help of word plays, a considerable silly plot (that you could almost said as nonsensical at times.) and a bunch of characters that think of nothing besides having sex with Mahiro. \\n\\n\r\nIt is perfectly normal for a non-Japanese Citizen to misunderstand or even get none of the show. Nyaruko is a show created for the Japanese audience and it would do very well for the locals, and it does not intent to go further than that. From an execution POV, You've got to say that they actually manage to squeeze a lot of things into an episode: From Rider show Parodies to Galgame Scene Tributes, It only gets wilder and crazier on their second season. To achieve such a scale of squeezing so many things into one single 23 minute episode is an admirable effort and probably hard for an audience to understand most of the jokes, But the sub-Groups are always there to help. \\n\\n\r\nWhat? You\u2019ve just say that the sub-groups can't even figure them out either? God bless you then.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, this would be and should be an enjoyable show. But it is not. \\n\\n\r\nA comedy show is all about laughing. A comedy show that can't make you laugh is NOT a good show and Nyaruko Fail at times. While Nyaruko and her friends are doing their absolute best of being silly and dumb on every episode, the parodies that you've missed would eventually get into you and you will be feeling strange. You will feel like that you missed out something that the show's trying to offer - since this wacky show is only completed with some more crazy tributes, and you are only watching half of the show, missing the another half. \\n\\n\r\nI am not trying to complain if there is anything wrong with their decision. This is nothing wrong at all: just like an American writer would writer for the Americans, Chinese would write for the one's living in China, so as the show intending to be watched by local Otaku that had an extensive knowledge on Japanese Culture. It is WE that are wrong if we attempts to think \"why am I not understanding any sh*t of this thing this is so difficult I am just going to cut this crap off\"\\n\\n\r\nDespite I don't really get the show at times, I am still giving the show a 6 because of the following reasons: \\n\\n\r\n1. The show does nothing wrong. It is a fun show and there is nothing wrong with the plot - despite being whimsical and eccentric at times. Nor does it do anything really right, or even good. \\n\r\n2. In a technical POV, They manage to squeeze so many things into an episode, which is something hard (despite it is difficult, almost too difficult.) to do. Imagine you have to use lyrics from 30 different songs to create a script that is meaningful and fun to watch. You will scratch your head and eventually wave the white flag. And that\u2019s only the beginning for this show. \\n\r\n3. I do watch a subbed version that gets most of the Parodies explained. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, it is a good show. I would not suggest you to watch if you didn't have a good sub group to help you understand. It might be strange, but a good sub could definitely help you understand better, especially for this one. \\n\\n\r\n6.\\n\\n\r\nPs:\\n\r\n1. 689 means the Chief Executive......whatever, I would rather not explain.\\n\r\n2. If you are asking \"Where the F*ck is the character review\". I would say NO. I am not your daily reviewer that talks about every aspect of the anime. Instead I only discuss the parts that were most controversial or I found something special among the others. I mean, what's the use of me writing \"Mahiro is a Japanese boy that is kind and generous at times\" and \"Nyarlathotep is a white hair loli that would like to make love with Mahiro\" and I would then say \"well I love the characters.\" WHY SHOULD I WASTE TIME TO WRITE SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GOOGLE THEM.\\n\r\n3. Except some very very special cases, if I am the reader of a certain anime review, I would think: WHO CARES IF YOU LOVE THE CHARACTER OR NOT. This is a review and I should be critizing the show, not spending times circling around. I need to know how REALISTIC they are.\\n\r\n4. Do you think gods from Call of Cthulhu in reality are really \"REALISTIC\"? At least you've got an unbeliever here\\n\r\n5. I guess anything comes AFTER the jokes in a comedy show, right? How could you possibly called a show a \"comedy\" if it is not amusing at all?",

            "content": "2014 couldnt start better!! I have watch alot of different anime, and I have a taste for lots of different things on anime, I like smart, well thought, with character and story plots anime... and I like anime that doesnt care about those 4 points I just stated but that still entertains you! IF BY ANY MEANS you are looking for any one of those 4 points in this series, I suggest you just skip it! This is crazy japonese harem madness (generally harems arent much my thing, but this anime is a few of those exceptions)!! Almost nothing, if something at all, that happensin Nyaruko-san series is on check with reality!! Truly a japonese anime, they dont hold anything back on this (dont expect this to be a ecchi show like To LOVE-Ru thought, Xebec another production), I have watch all of To LOVE-Ru anime, and if you had like that, probably you will like this. \\n\\n\r\nObviously if you are on pair with what the show is about you know you cannot expect a great story, the story here is just supporting all the comedy, light romance, jokes and gags that Haiyore! throws at you. You got the male guy (Mahiro), this time a tsun tsun one... and his adventures with 3 different deitys, based of \"The Cthulhu Mythos\" based on H. P. Lovecraft universe, so these deitys are supposed to be very ugly and disfigured... but you get 3 cute girls... wait one of them, it is a guy... \\n\r\nItself the story isnt that bad, it is full of cliches, but still it goes well with the flow of what this anime is about. Story=6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the Art, I m gonna admit it, I LOVE MOE characters!! One of the things I like in anime is to see cute things, it is a charm of japonese culture, this anime breaths of kawoiii madness! The models of the characters are very well done, for being focused on the characters emotions and expressions, they done a very good job at it, I truly love Nyarko cuteness!! If you like moe characters, you will enjoy this alot. For me, it goes as far as to be wanted to be transported to the anime for a couple of minutes, and just pat Nyarko head, and hug her and yell kawoii KAWOII thousands of times (something I would see as a crazy desire normally...), they just nailed it for me!! Art=10/10\\n\\n\r\nOP's, op's... I dont like most of them! Garbage, sorry I just dont care for most pop romance japonese weirdo songs outhere!! BUT for some reason, both of the Op's of the first and second anime of Nyarko I fully watched, FOR ALL of the time, they are that catchy, I dont understand how composers do this, but the songs just feel right when they are played, for how light and generic the plot is, sometimes you may think the sound would just as bad... wrong!! Quality, everything fits right on, for the sad, despair, anxiety, colourful and more happy scenes brought in together, the sound department done a great job with the atmosphere, again specially the OP's!! I see myself going back and play these again and again without feeling bored. Sound=9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, this is what the anime is about, and what will be decisive if either you like this anime or not!! The characters are what defines this anime, they arent that special, you cannot expect amazing character development or gripping plot of them!! \\n\r\nMost of the times they only do crazy and stupid things a human being wouldnt possibly do (a feature of most japonese animes), but this is what makes me love this anime so much, I wanted funny and light-hearted moments, I didnt searched for a reality check, life is hard, and we need to endure it, but for me I sometimes like to have a break of that world!!\\n\r\nBeyond Mahiro with Nyarko at main characters, for supportive roles worth to mention you get Hasuta, \"Hastar deity of the wind\", that wants to make babies with the main male character, but he is a guy (this annoys me alot at first, but then you just dont give a thing bout him no more)... \\n\r\nKuuko \"Cthuko deity\" is quiet and calm, except when she is close to Nyarko, the one she loves despite being mutual enemy species, and both \"girls\"!! And then Ta-Damm, Nyarko \"Nyaruko, a Nyarlotephian deity\", one of a bright personality, that can pack a punch and kill enemies in very gore ways, she is in love with Mahiro and has to \"protect\" him of any harm other than herself!! She defines what I like about the series.\\n\r\nMahiro as some very annoying moments (tsundere male... I love tsundere females, being a male one feels weird at first), but Kuuko and Nyarko... they \"fights\", and dialogue between them and other characters, all the jokes and references, and the romance between this harem, THIS SHINES!! Like I said soo crazy, stupid and not logical, that I just laughed and laughed throught the whole show, most of the people might not agree, and for them this might not be a good mix, but for me, it was just what I was looking for, enjoyment!! Truly stupid and illogical at that, but it made me almost maratoon this whole series (something impossible being myself in college exams \"happy-fun-mode-time\", YEAH ME!!...).  Characters&Enjoyment=10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to give it a 9, I gave the first season a 8, this one was more enjoyable, I already knew almost all of the cast, I enjoyed  season 1, and I wanted more of that crazyness comedy satire stuff, so when I started watching Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W, I got large doses of that!! And in the end, I have felt realized from what I wanted to get from Nyaruko-san W anime. \\n\r\nMost people wont agree with my review about this, I agree it isnt a anime for everybody, but for what it is about, its premise, for me, it was a dazzling gleam!! I wont forget these characters, they made laugh alot and have a good time, and Nyarko, one of the most illogical, delusional characters I ever saw on a harem... I m her fan, VERY proudly!! \\n\r\nEverything has a place to be, a moment to belong to, either amazing, gripping, complex, perfectly logical stories, or crazy stupid madness fun comedies!! Both, and has of now, \"Miss\" Nyaruko \"Nyarlotephian deity\", have a place to belong in my heart and soul!! With great expectations I wait and hope for a third season to come!! xD",

There are also too many callbacks to S1 so it feels like a rehash of the same premise and story lines.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Kuko is less rapey--not sure if that's a bad thing, tho.\\n\\n\r\nI will finish by adding:\\n\\n\r\nJoker!\\n\\n\r\nCyclone!\\n\\n\r\nJoker?\\n\\n\r\nCy-clone!\\n\\n\r\nJoooohker!\\n\\n\r\nCyclone cylone!\\n\\n\r\nJokeeeeer!\\n",

            "content": "With my review of the first season of this my main complaints were the Harem,Annoying MC, The Trap and that i think Nyaruko should have been the MC.\r\nWhile the fact that this is a Harem still slightly annoy's me it's not that bad when compared to other shows with them. Harems are always annoying cause there will always be one character you like more over the others and want them to be with the MC. While i don't want Cthuko to be with the MC ( Witch has started to happen and is annoying) I do want her to be with Nyaruko. They in myopinion make the best couple of them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC while not as annoying as the 1st season doesn't mean he isn't as annoying. There just isn't much likable about him. He tends to be overly rude to the girls of the show and you start to question his sexuality. Especially sense the trap is the only person in this harem he doesn't assault when the trap is try to sexually advance on him.\\n\\n\r\nThe trap seems to have gotten a smaller role in the first couple episodes of the 2nd season. It's nice but still the fact remains the trap is in this. \\n\\n\r\nNyaruko i still feel is just the best character all around. She has more of a personality than the MC. The MC's personality comprises of Being an Asshole,Annoying and always assaulting people that have any affection towards him ( Except the trap) I honestly imagine the show with Nyaruko as the MC being about her just going around doing random crap and not caring about any humans seeing her. While also having the MC in the group of friends. I also see a harem with her being the main star a lot more attracting than this. Nyaruko and Cthuko would be the main love interest cause they both have the best chemistry. \\n\\n\r\nSomething new that bugs me is the constant use of how all the people in the universe are weak against forks. The joke gets old after the first couple times in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nCthuko herself actually got more backstory and is probably the 2nd best character design there is right behind Nyaruko.\\n\\n\r\nI still think that the first season should've ended with the MC and Nyaruko bodies being swapped. I still think this would have lead to more comedic stuff down the road even if it only lasted a couple more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that has bugged me is how week the two eldritch deities can be especially Nyaruko that is a pretty famous one. Hell, I wish they would just talk more about her being a deity known for making people going mad and other shit.\\n\\n\r\nThis also has a really touching confession in it by Nyaruko. Probably one of the best i'v seen sense Rem from Re:Zero\\n\\n\r\nOverall story is still fun to watch and enjoy .",

Characters have been established, and there is little development to be had.  This isn't that kind of anime.  \r\nThe really key point to this review, though is Nyaruko-san herself.  Never have I been more irritated by a character, yet wanted that character to succeed in winning the hapless/gutless/herbivore MC's heart.  I had to pause episodes I was so bothered by Nyrauko, yet I still foundmyself rooting for her. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely worth watching if you liked the first season, and if you haven't seen the first season then I would recommend that too.",

            "content": "FORMAT\r\n---------\r\nThis is the obligatory second season of \"Nyarko-san: Her panties drop as fast as your sanity\". This isn't the actual title of the show, but it might just as well be.\r\nIt's a borderline hentai, harem comedy show centered around a group of the most horny anthropomorphised lovecraftian deities of various species and genders stalking a possibly asexual teenage boy to have themselves, or, in some cases, the boy, impregnated.\r\nIt sounds cruel and horrific, and it is. What it also is, is stunningly captivating and hilarious in its lack of dignity. The show is highly self-aware and takes advantage of not taking itself seriously in everyway possible.\\n\r\nThis is the most \"anime\" show you could possibly find. Example:\\n\r\n[MC enters room, main love interest kneeling on bed in maid costume, trying to be seductive just like literally every fucking evening]\\n\r\nMC: \"It's kind of stupid to ask this at this point, but why are you here?\"\\n\r\nNY: \"My nightly service to you, Mahiro-san!\"\\n\r\nIf this kind of humour makes you gauge your eyes out, you can delete all your cringe comps and watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nA) What I expected when going into this show: (backstory, expectations, predisposition) \\n\r\n\t...Sigh. So they turned the second season into an actual clich\u00e9 harem show?\\n\r\n\tThe first season was already enough to make it to my trash top tier, so I expect a more coherent plot this time.\\n\r\n\tAt this point I am convinced that Mahiro is actually a lovecraftian deity with the power of being irresistable, and this show is just a Mahiro dating sim.\\n\r\n\tAlso, I expect this show to be at least 50% more about gaming than Gamers!.\\n\\n\r\nB) What the viewing experience is like:\\n\r\n\tWHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON\\n\r\n\tWHY IS KUUKO INTO MAHIRO NOW?! WHY IS [Redacted] INTO HASUTA?!?!?!?! WHY THE FUCK IS THERE AN EPISODE FOR SHANTA AND ITS THE WORST FUCKING THING\\n\r\n\tJokes aside, this is a continuation of the first season, spot on. It's more of the same, but a bit more balanced, and with more focus on the characters.\\n\r\n\tBut hey, it's at least 50% more about gaming than Gamers!.\\n\\n\r\nC) What I think this show excels at:\\n\r\n\tProviding enough mental food to keep you scarred for all eternity. God, where is the bleach. *cough* episode eight *cough*\\n\r\n\tEnough fanservice to make everyone uncomfortable, but enough decency to stop when it starts getting unbearable.\\n\r\n\tAlso, there's foreshadowing of the worst kind everywhere. Cyclone is a keyword. Trust me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nD) What I think it fails at:\\n\r\n\tActually exploring the romances it poses as possible - understandable, given that there are approximately 10 possible ships in this show, all involving the MC.\\n\\n\r\nE) What the show surprised me with: (in a positive or neutral way)\\n\r\n\tThe second season was way more proficient at giving the interactions some more nuance, if that makes any sense in the clusterfuck that is this show's lineup.\\n\r\n\tMany of the issues I had before, like Mahiro never getting a reason for Nyarlko's affection, and some more, at least were lampshaded or even addressed in some form.\\n\r\n\tCompared to season 1:\t\\n\r\n\tMaking Mahiro more likeable, apart from him still being a dick to Nyarko MORE than to others, which is unacceptable.\\n\r\n\tMaking Nyarlko waaaaay more understandable and even -gulp- more human?\\n\r\n\tMaking Hasuta fucking irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nF) What I wish the anime had done, but didn't: \\n\r\n\tSadly, there was little opportunity for the characters to explore the setting, yet again.\\n\r\n\tIf they had a longer runtime for this show, which I frankly actually wish it did, they might have wanted to make more out of this whole lovecraft-satire thing.\\n\r\n\tAs it stands, this is more of a harem show that's a bit on the creative side.\\n\r\n\tAlso, as much as they invested time in all the characters, I can't help but feel that it still wasn't enough. (Yes, I want a third season. I know, I am crazy.)\\n\r\n\tAlso, actually finishing the relationship story after two seasons. This was the ONE thing I expected it to do, but alas, as most harem shows to this day go, it ends with the most mediocre achievement for Nyarko, so we can only dream about Mahiro finally making up his mind.\\n\r\n\t[Dreaming about Nyarko-san is not recommended.]\\n\\n\r\nG) Should you watch it? (whom is it for)\\n\r\n\tOnly watch if you saw season 1, survived, and can't stop watching. Don't take a break before watching season 2, you can go right ahead as it continues the same way.\\n\r\n\tIt's definitely entertaining, if you are at least mildly masochistic or have a sick, dirty mind. Or both. Does the latter imply the former? What? Sometimes? Huh.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nSCORING: \\n\r\n1) Proficiency in execution\\n\r\n9/10 - This show knows what it's doing, and is great at pulling the audience's triggers for cringe, laughs or both through its confidence to meet the expectations of clich\u00e9 and go even lower.\\n\\n\r\n2) Depth of concepts and characterisation\\n\r\n5/10 - It felt like the characterisation went deep enough to make the show at least okay by the end. Considering its short runtime, it used its buildup well, which is applaudable.\\n\\n\r\n3) Entertainment value \\n\r\n9/10 - Ridiculous bullshit never fails to deliver. Not quite as juicy as actual hentai, but there's a reason it's PG-16 in the US.\\n\\n\r\n4) Memorability (expected, needed for long-term investment)\\n\r\n6/10 - Much more memorable for some reason. I guess it's the stockholm syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nQuality Score: (average of PROF and DPT )\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFun score: (Product of ENT and MEM divided by 10, long-term)\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: (decided on a whim or vodka)\\n\r\n6/10 - Good.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the OVA-\\n\r\n[cereal spitting guy]\\n\r\nWHY IS THAT A PURE FANSERVICE HOT SPRINGS EPISODE\\n\r\nAs if this show didn't have enough fanservice already, golly gosh. I'm not watching it. This time for real. Never.\\n\r\nI'm serious. There's another OVA that's actually good, so why waste time on pseudo-hentai?\\n\r\nI've heard it actually has character development.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so it may not be well written or helpful, but please bear with me.\r\nFirst off, I want to say that if you're looking for a very serious romantic anime like Clannad, keep on looking, because this anime would not be for you.  But if you're looking for a good laugh and something to pass the time, then look no further.\r\nStory - 6\r\nJust your usual \"Alien comes to Earth\" anime.  Nothing that stands out, nothing really unique.  But this anime isn't really centered on the story.  At least to me.  The one majorflaw of this anime was the absence of an actual conflict/goal.  *Minor Spoiler Alert!* Every time that some alien was trying to kidnap Mahiro or destroy the Earth, it was always for some really stupid reason, which was funny in the beginning.  I expected the crisis at the end to have a little more depth because they had a pretty decent plot.  They could have done so much more with it.  But instead it followed the usual pattern, which was a big disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nBeautiful art work.  I loved how all of the characters looked, and everything was visual appealing to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe opening and ending.  Although they fit the anime well, I didn't really enjoy them that much either.  I thought that the background music fit each of the situations fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nNot that much to say here.  Nobody really stood out for me except Kurei, Tamao.  I think that they could have done a lot more with her, since she liked Mahiro, but also gave advice on how to make Mahiro fall for Nyaruko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot.  It always kept me entertained with their constant flow of gags, but sometimes they can get a little old and annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nThis is a pretty enjoyable anime overall.   This is not a series that you really need to watch, but I think it is worth looking over.",

I won't sugarcoat this; it's garbage.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHaiyore! Nyaruko-san W is by far one of the most generic shows I have seen in some time. Its first season was barely passable as an anime and by god this season remains the same. The story picks off directly after the first with Mahiro housing crime fighting Nyaruko, Cthuko, and Hasuta. A bunch of stuff happens where the gang has to defeat bad guys bla bla bla. While I wish I could tell you whatthey did this season\u2026I cannot recollect what the hell went on. I was just so mind numbingly bored that nothing really stuck through. The whole Nyaruko crushing on Mahiro continues this season with Cthuko even edging towards \u201cthe boy\u201d early on in certain moments. These passes towards Mahiro though are a sad excuse for character development.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPassable for maybe a 2010 anime. Some shots look good but they are far and few between.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an ok job but since they mutter the same lines over and over again it gets quite boring and annoying. \u201cMahiro-san! Mahiro-san! Mahiro-san! Mahiro-san!\u201d SHUT THE F$%K UP ALREADY! Also the generic soundtrack didn\u2019t help the show out very much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this anime is just an empty shell of some sort of character type used in most anime. You have the shy (and over used) annoying male lead, the asserting female lead, and oh and a boy who wants Mahiro\u2019s \u201cD\u201d and a girl who will swing for both teams. The characters did a piss poor job of providing any fun scenes. Literally every episode boils down to Nyaruko trying to get Mahiro to do something romantic while Cthuko and Hasuta try to cock block Nyaruko. Every episode just feels like the same events over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3.3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe funny thing is this review is probably way too generous. The only reason I bothered finishing this season is because a friend overseas somehow likes the show and it provides funny things to rant on. I have no idea how people support this sorry excuse for an anime when all it can muster is average at best quality. The characters are annoying, the sound is average, the animation is garbage by today\u2019s standards, and the plot is so unattractive; do yourself a favor and stay far away from this mess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0.1/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Somehow despite having two subpar experiences with this franchise prior to this series, I found myself yet again giving the devoted Nyaruko one more shot.\r\nNyaruko is a series that you need to watch with a certain frame of mind. Forget intricate stories and forget meaningful character development, this series is all about fun and making fun of stuff. The second season of Nyaruko is essentially more of what you found in the first season, which is a lot of nonsense, a lot of girl-girl and guy-guy relationships, and a lot of parodies of other series. If you like Nyaruko's over-the-top personality, she will most likelybe enough to carry you through the season. While an interesting ride overall, the second season doesn't contribute much plot-wise on top of the first season. In short, this is a fun watch if you liked the original and have nothing better to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt's been a year since the prequel aired and you can definitely notice a few animation touch ups. The uplift in quality includes an overall cleaner drawing style, increased sharpness, and improved color shading as we've seen from other shows. The characters from the original all return and are just as distinguishable as in the original. You even get a bonus as Shanta, the hippo-bat-bird chimera, gets a special episode dedicated to herself.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the previous season, you get a few action sequences though nothing is really standout in general (a lot of the fights even resolve while the camera conveniently shifts to something else). The action is totally overshadowed by the fan service as expected in a Xebec work. Expect Nyaruko to make plenty of advances on Mahiro; well to be honest you should expect everyone to make advances on Mahiro for he is apparently the center of the universe. Accidental fondling, suggestive positions, love potions, you name it and they've probably got it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis one was actually an interesting surprise. The new OP for Nyaruko is actually quite a catchy piece with a fair melody while still sounding distinctively like the first season's OP. The show has an abundance of EDs, unlike last time. A lot of these EDs are also quite good and range from calming and melodic to chaotic and techno-based. I personally like the calmer EDs (Yotte SOS and Sister, Friend, Lover). All the OPs and EDs are performed by the VAs. The BGM is identical to that of the first season and indeed includes the weird chant song.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs do a very good job overall with Kana Asumi as the standout by far for giving Nyaruko such an outrageously outgoing personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nNyaruko W takes place after the first season and pretty much has the gang face off against completely random foes. Much of the series is episodic each with its own rising action and climax. The show doesn't really have a central story until the last two episodes where just a tiny eye drop's worth of plot progression takes place. The point of this season doesn't seem to be to further the main story line but rather to present isolated, ridiculous cases for our protagonists to face. From giant gorillas to squid-like creatures from Pluto, all of the bizarre antagonists and stories are resolved in fairly idiotic ways. The challenge here is to figure out the resolution before the show gives it away (as there are foreshadows hidden throughout each episode).\\n\\n\r\nAs with the original show, there are plenty of shows that are parodied. My \"obvious to find\" list to look for includes DeathNote, Dragonball, Chuunibyou, Code Geass, Toaru Majutsu, and Da Capo. The intelligence level of the overall story isn't very high, so I recommend sitting back and just enjoying some laughs rather than trying to critique the virtually nonexistent plot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSo we already know that Nyaruko is 1000% dedicated to Mahiro, and we already know that Mahiro is an indecisive prick who chooses to make everyone's life miserable by not ending the harem route. As with the previous season, all the relationships are pretty much static and you'll hear characters repeat lines over and over throughout the show. At one or two specific points in the show, I got a tiny whiff of character development, but in general don't expect too much here other than Nyaruko's eccentric personality and body movements.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't give this any prizes for its story line or character development, there are definitely some humorous and enjoyable moments in this show. If my pacing is a sign of anything, expect this to be more entertaining than other shows in the season such as Mondaiji-tachi and Photokano. If you liked the original Nyaruko, this has more of the better parts while sidelining the bare bones plot of the original.",

            "content": "May contain some slight spoilers.\r\nHaiyore! Nyaruko-san W being the sequel of Haiyore Nyaruko-san gains it's character names in chtulhu mythos. Being character based series there is basically no meaningful plot. Plot driven by series of short arcs lasting from one episode to maximum of three episodes. Haiyore! Nyaruko-san follows simple pattern in progression of the story. First the event is introduced, then we have some attempt at building up tension only to end up in absurd anticlimax. The ridiculousness of the anticlimax divides people maybe to two groups ones who laugh and to ones who stare dazed trying not to cry. Being the former groupI enjoyed this series. Nyaruko-san has it's \"deeper\" moments which take up 5 whole minutes out of twelve episodes. For the plot i would give: 2 but to enjoyment value: 8.\\n\\n\r\nTo art and sound I can just say art was well looking but didn't impact me meaning bit above average meaning: 6. For sound only two things I remember are opening and the \"dramatic\" music playing during important moments. Opening depicts quite well the series, neither making no sense, so I can give sound: 6.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before this series is character oriented but the problem comes at the point when you ignore your opinion on characters and start tot yhink about them. There are 4 character which appear constantly on the show,male  \\n\r\nand female protagonist and 2 irrelevant supporting characters. Mahiro is mild tsundere, Nyaruko is borderline yandere, Kuuko(Chtuko) is lesbian, an Hasta is shota. Somehow it seems to me that Kuuko and Hasta are in the series to increase sales of doujinshi. While characters are enjoyable highest grade I can give them is 6.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W is enjoyable series which I would recommend to watch if not taking things too seriously. Objectively Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W is at most mediocre and to give it more than 5 would be overestimate.",
