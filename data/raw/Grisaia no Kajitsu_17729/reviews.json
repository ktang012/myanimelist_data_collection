            "content": "For nearly every minute I spent watching Grisaia, I kept asking myself the same question: \"Why the hell is this only 13 episodes long?\"\r\nThe natural response would be that the studio did not have enough budget to stretch the production any further. And while that does contain some truth, it does not excuse 50+ hours of story from the visual novel being jammed into a meagre four hours of animation. True, there's a lot of crap in the visual novel that could be cut out with little of value being lost. But when necessary story and characterisation is rushed through so quickly that you canbarely even tell what the hell is going on, there is a major problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe suits behind the adaptation failed to understand that they could simply lighten down on the pace and leave the rest of the story for later seasons. Cover half the content from the visual novel, and if it sells well enough (and it almost assuredly would given the popularity of the franchise), cover the rest of it in a second season. Great, everyone is happy. Instead of that, we get \"Grisaia: The Compilation Series\". I can't imagine anyone except the most devoted of fans is satisfied with the result. \\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to judge the Grisaia anime for what it is rather than for what it should be, considering nearly every issue is in some way related to the pacing. The characters frequently engage in acts of nonsense because the anime doesn't have any time to explain their actions. Sachi's episode is just laughable as it immediately transforms the naive, innocent maid into some dangerous psycho without any reasons as to WHY. A few minutes later and again without reason, she changes back into Stupid Lovable Sachi, and at that point it becomes a mystery who or what her character is even supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nMost egregious is the 'romance' between the protagonist, Yuuji, and one of the heroines. Within the first five minutes of her arc, Yuuji and said heroine become a couple after an impromptu make-out scene. It's all well and nice when an anime actually has the guts to show two characters kissing, but in Grisaia's case, the two are so unfamiliar with each other that they may as well be still be strangers. It does very little to make their relationship feel natural, and until it becomes clear what the girl's reason for hitting on Yuuji all the damn time are, it just feels like the two are incredibly desperate and don't actually care about each other. And that still doesn't change much by the end of her arc. Whereas in the visual novel it is obvious that Yuuji has genuine feelings for and a desire to protect her, in the anime's case it's just \"hey, whatever, man\". Yuuji is only wooing the girls because they offer themselves to him so easily. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the story is whiplashing from one heroine arc to another so quickly and without break -- often with only a single episode to separate them -- it is easy to get a headache from the overwhelming onslaught of drama. It's a ceaseless wave of story bombshells, 'shocking' revelations that in fact do not feel shocking whatsoever because of the needless fatigue it puts on the viewer. By the time you're done watching the first or second heroine arc, it becomes very clear how the rest of them are going to play out. Girl has crazy past, Yuuji comes in to save the day and help them overcome their trauma - again and again. \\n\\n\r\nYumiko's arc in particular feels very out-of-place and contrived, considering how she suddenly spills her entire past to Yuuji despite hating his guts and trying to stab him IN the guts only moments earlier. Hell, even the reason why she's afraid of men in the first place is skipped over and scarcely mentioned. And Sachi's arc, again, is laughable for the massive 'twist' it pulls at the end, contrasted with the complete indifference of the two people involved. I think only Michiru's and Makina's arcs are the ones that are done even moderately well, and even then I would struggle to label them anything more than merely OK. Makina's route has some issues as well, namely why the hell Yuuji -- especially when one considers his line of work -- is destroying his entire life to help some random loli he knows little about and has only been friends with for a few days. Michiru's route is largely forgettable; I actually had to rewatch parts of it to even remember what happened since the show was such a damn blur.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem, if largely irrelevant to anime-only viewers, is the lack of Yuuji's witty monologues. They are what made the visual novel so entertaining and are what turned Yuuji into an actual character and not merely a collection of 'cool' and 'badass' traits like he is in the anime. Sure, he's still likeable in the anime (especially with the addition of an appropriate voice actor), but there is little to make him interesting except in contrast to the billions of mentally retarded harem protagonists. Granted, it's difficult to carry his monologues over without the show feeling awkward -- anime and visual novels are two different mediums, after all -- but it would not hurt to have added a little bit more of Yuuji's thoughts, especially during the comedic scenes. The anime adaptation is inherently inferior for not having that.\\n\\n\r\nI think what frustrated me more than anything was the show's endless, pathetic need to have panty shots at the worst times possible. A character will actually be DYING and it will still have the nerve to stare at her panties. WHAT? Seriously, what the hell? Rather than drool over panties like some 12-year-old who just found out about porn, the staff should try maturing a bit by focusing on things that people actually do (and which are an actual part of the VN's story), like sex and kissing and everything in between. The show does at least have the courage to show Yuuji kissing several of the girls, so it's not entirely a lost cause, I suppose. And yes, 'several' was not a typo; Grisaia is undoubtedly a harem story, even when it decides to throw two characters into a romantic relationship. \\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the survival backstory within Amane's route is actually given a proper amount of screentime (surprising, I know!) and is a genuinely engaging story as a result, even if it isn't necessarily pleasant to watch. As in pretty much any story about a group of people surviving together, they all fall into madness at some point, and some of the things they do, like eating maggots on their wounds in order to escape starvation, will likely make you feel like vomiting. So do be prepared. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is... well, not great. The characters look out-of-place and even like blobs in a number of scenes, though the letterboxing effect is a nice touch and gives the show a more cinematic feel. Some praise can also be said for the audio. The OP - particularly its instrumentals - is a great piece of music. Godly, perhaps. It's a shame there wasn't more like that in the actual episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCan I recommend watching Grisaia? If you're an anime-only viewer who has not read the visual novel, I would say no and tell you to go read that instead, especially when it has arguably the best fan translation that has ever been released. The anime is not a worthwhile story on its own, and unless you're craving for a mediocre harem anime with a cool protagonist, you're only going to find yourself frustrated and alienated by the ridiculous pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've already read the visual novel, though, Grisaia is still a decent piece of fanservice despite my endless complaining. Seeing the story in animation and not just pictures certainly makes it more dynamic, and the addition of a voice actor for Yuuji makes him feel much more human. It's not an ideal adaptation by any stretch of the imagination, but it works, and for some fans that will be enough.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just hope they don't repeat the same mistakes in the other seasons.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu Review \r\nSo. Where to begin ? Grisaia no Kajitsu debuted as a visual novel, and it was quite highly praised. So, like several other visual novels, since it was starting to get very popular, Front Wing decided that it was time to adapt it into an anime, to further boost the popularity of the VN. However, most of us know that adapting a visual novel into an anime is a very \"hit or miss\" decision. Either it's a complete success, like Clannad or Fate/Stay Night UBW, or it's a complete disaster, the that will forever tarnish the reputation of the source material.It's understandable, because most adaptations don't get more than a one court anime, unless they're from some big studio like Key. And trying to adapt a VN of 50+ hours into a 12 episodes anime can be quite hard. So which one is it ? Will Grisaia no Kajitsu (I'll call it GnK from now on) be remembered as one of the few VN that got successfully adapted, or will it be simply another anime to add to the heap of horrible adaptations ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, GnK doesn't have too much of a story. Yuji Kazami, the main character, join a private school, where there's only 5 other students, all girls. We'll talk about each of them later on. Pretty much that entirety of the story after the intro consists of the girls backstory, and how Yuji interacts with each of them. Because of this, GnK's focus isn't on the story, but rather on the characters, which can be both good or bad, depending on how it's done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, there's not much to the story. So for me to give GnK such a high rating, the characters must be pretty good, right ? WRONGS !! You've got the typical mysterious transfer student, a maid, a generic tsundere, a loli, the Kuudere and a girl who REALLY wants a boyfriend. That said, those unoriginal characters become much, MUCH more memorable when you take their backstories into account. You quickly realize that nobody is normal at this school. It's like everyone is wearing a mask, desperately trying to forget their own history. Everyone has a f***** up past, and that's what make those characters so interesting. Each of the five girls have an arc. During those arcs, I ended up caring a lot for the same characters that I immediately dismissed as boring and uninteresting after the first episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\\n\r\nThe musics are pretty good and fits well the scenes in which they appear. The EDs were good, but I didn't find them as noticeable as the opening. The voice actors also do a good job, I don't have any complaints here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 8\\n\\n\r\nIt looks great for a 2014 anime. The dark colour palette fits the dark side of the story, and the character design is pretty good, none of the characters look the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching GnK, I wasn't really sure if I was gonna like it or not. But as I watched it weeks after weeks I eventually started to be really looking forward to the next episode without even noticing it. It was especially painful to wait for the next episode during Amane's arc, which is easily the best in my opinion. I've seen a lot of people who said that they didn't like it because it was too weird, but I'm a weird person myself, so I actually enjoyed it's weirdness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating :\\n\\n\r\nSo. Should you watch GnK ? YES ! But it's not for everyone, so it really depends on your personal tastes. One complaint that I often heard, was that it was rushed, and took out way too much scenes from the VN. But I didn't play the VN, so I didn't noticed that. To me, it wasn't rushed. The character arcs had a good pace, with the exception of Sachi's , which would have needed at least another episode. So is it a good adaptation ? Honestly, I don't know. Those who played the VN will probably be disappointed by how short it is, but as a standalone anime, it's successful. And with Season 2 & 3 confirmed, all remaining questions will hopefully be answered.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo ! This was one of my first review, and this definitively won't be my last ! I have a lot of improvement to do, and I know that. That's why I would really appreciate if you guys would leave me feedback and/or tips to improve my future reviews by commenting on my profile or sending me a PM ! Let me know if there's something you feel like I should improve, whether it be the length of the review, if I need to talk more or less about a certain subject, or anything else that you think needs improvement ^__^",

            "content": "\"No matter how much I keep lowering my expectations, I still end up disappointed\"\r\nThat one sentence sums up the ongoing experience of watching this anime from start to finish.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is undoubtedly one of the most successful and popular visual novels in recent years. It is a game praised for having a godlike character cast, excellent production value, great comedy, extreme lewdness and an abnormal amount of psychological depth and serious storylines for a harem series. Sounds like the perfect recipe for something to make an anime out of, right? Well three and a half years after the original visual novel was released, itfinally happened. However unlike its source material, this anime adaptation of Kajitsu fails in essentially every single department other than the animation, and instead serves as one of the biggest train wrecks I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is the story of a little group of teenagers with problems. Said problems are generally some kind of psychological trauma or other type of darker past that in the end results in the person being unable to fit into society anymore. Introducing Mihama Academy, a specially funded high-school dedicated solely in order to educate students that find themselves unable to go to any \"normal\" schools any longer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a result, they're all a bunch of crazy people. The characters of Grisaia are very unique and completely wacky. Because of their complicated backgrounds, not a single one of them is acting like a normal person, and consequently they give you an extremely unpredictable flow of events whenever they interact with each other. Together they make up one of the most unique setup of main characters you'll ever see, and that's exactly what makes them so likable. Unfortunately however, this anime doesn't give them much of a chance to showcase it.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point: this anime is rushed. Incredibly rushed. Actually the word rushed is not even enough to explain just how much of a complete and utter mess the pacing of this so-called \"adaptation\" truly is. The mere idea of trying to cover about 80 hours' worth of visual novel content in a 13-episode anime is nothing short of ridiculous to begin with but here it was actually attempted, and unsurprisingly it failed miserably. The first three episodes show some promise, when the anime is merely showing the hilarious everyday antics that the characters are pulling off during their school days. After that however, as soon as the story gets into its serious elements, things rapidly start derailing, and it *never ever stops derailing*.\\n\\n\r\nMichiru's and Makina's routes skip huge amounts of content, leaving out key plot elements and just leaves you feeling extremely confused and unsatisfied as a viewer. You also immediately lose all sense of time as sometimes the story pulls a sudden time skip out of nowhere and tries to proceed as if everything's all fine and dandy, despite having just left out several hours' worth of story. Sachi's and Yumiko's routes are even worse, they sincerely get *one* episode each to cover their *entire* story arcs. We're talking 10+ hours of content in *one* episode each. Since this feat is pretty much impossible, the production team's so-called \"solution\" to this is to simply flat-out cut away 90% of the story and pretend that the rest of the plot just doesn't exist, and unbelievably enough they on top of that even take the time to add totally nonsensical original content of their own into the mix. Especially Yumiko's route might just get the award as the worst adaptation of anything I've ever seen to be perfectly blunt. Finally Amane's route which is generally the most popular and praised one of the visual novel is fortunately also the only one that receives some sort of tolerable adaptation here, but sadly it's way too late to be enough to save this disaster of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ones responsible for this whole mess are none other than Studio 8bit; famous for \"illustrious\" works such as Walkure Romanze as well as both seasons of Infinite Stratos. It would not be an exaggeration to say that people did not have a whole lot of faith in them even before Grisaia began airing, and unfortunately as it turns out; that was not an incorrect mindset at all. If there's one thing I have to give them credit for though, it's that the animation quality of this anime is still very high despite everything else. The characters and the environments both look great. Fans of the Monogatari Series will also notice the awfully familiar-looking character designs, which is quite simply explained by the fact that they are done by the same artist. The anime also utilizes a pretty interesting extreme-widescreen resolution that probably makes the show look a lot better if you have a really wide monitor.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing 8bit apparently decided to randomly add to this show... was fanservice. Now don't get me wrong, Grisaia is incredibly lewd even in its original form but there's a very clear difference here. What the visual novel primarily contains is a myriad of hilarious sexual innuendos that were all clearly written by someone with taste and a good sense of humour. The anime however has virtually none of this. Instead, it goes with the age-old approach of throwing in random panty shots whenever possible, regardless of where or when. The problem is that this is not just a generic ecchi series, so when these spontaneous panty shots are shoved into the camera during life-or-death situations when the rest of the story is actually trying to be serious, it doesn't exactly feel very appropriate. Did the animators never stop to think that this might be *somewhat* out of place? Like really?\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is all-round very impressive. The same cast used in the original game makes a comeback for the anime and helps liven up their respective characters immensely. Especially Makina's and Michiru's respective voice actresses make a phenomenal performance in my opinion given how incredibly wacky those two roles in particular are. It's just a shame that the anime doesn't really give them a whole lot of time to showcase it since it's so incredibly rushed. The soundtrack there is very little to say about however: while the OST does its job at enhancing the atmosphere in more or less every scene, it is definitely nothing memorable either. The opening and various ending themes are the same story: decent, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the production value is solid but it's nowhere even close to making up for how incredibly butchered the story in this anime is. If you've played the original visual novel, then watching this anime is nothing but painful. It's like a guilt trip where you start every new episode holding a slight glimmer of hope that things might get better, but end up just as disappointed as the week before every single time. Seeing such a great source material dissected and ripped apart like this just hurts, and I wouldn't recommend anyone who liked the visual novel to watch this anime for their own sakes, at least not if they're expecting a legitimate adaptation. Though if you just think of it as some sort of fan fiction or similar, then it might be okay. If you have never played the visual novel however nor plan to, then this particular issue will not exist as you won't have anything to compare the anime to, so the show is not quite as bad in that case. However then you're still faced with the issue of the blitzkrieg pacing of this show which ends up eagerly skipping past its own plot points, and as a result you'll have some serious problems trying to figure out just what the hell is going on every so often. You might not be aware of what the holes are leaving out, but you'll still sure as hell notice that there are in fact holes more or less everywhere. It's just that blatantly obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been the source of a lot of pain and agony for many people over the last few months. In the end despite all that, I'd still say it's a good thing that it came into existence, if only for the reason of perhaps driving up more attention for the visual novel and hopefully getting some more people to try that out instead. At least that's the only thing I can think of as anything good the Grisaia anime might bring us in the end, because at least on its own it remains one of the absolute worst adaptations in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we can only pray that 8bit are going to do a slightly better job at adapting the remaining two parts of the Grisaia trilogy (Meikyuu and Rakuen) which have now been confirmed that they're *also* going to be adapted, starting spring 2015. In theory this should be a much easier job to pull off since they're significantly shorter in comparison, but I still think we should head into them with the lowest possible expectations this time around, just to be safe. It's the only way to make sure to avoid the never-ending spiral of disappointment that Kajitsu was.",

            "content": "When it comes to risk, Grisaia No Kajitsu (The Fruit of Grisaia) is no stranger to the word. Dare I say a show with based on a popular visual novel only gets a 13 episode adaptation. Take a look at some of the other popular visual novels like Little Busters and Clannad. Even with 2-cour adaptations, there are some problems with their effectiveness. So what happened with Grisaia No Kajitsu? The answer is a controversial adaptation. Or to say the least, this series is one that is a big oddball. I don\u2019t mean it necessarily in a negative fashion but one that may strike somebizarre chords.\\n\\n\r\nTo get familiarized with the adaptation, one should first realize that the anime is based on the visual novel of the same name. The VN is actually an adult game but the anime obviously obstructs more of the sexual tones of the series for more suitable viewers; although it still adapts the gimmicks of it. Nonetheless, the series makes its presence well known with the first episode. We have starring male protagonist Yuuji who wants to enroll in a normal school. He gets sent to a place called Mihama Academy by his boss JB so his wish is granted. Or is it? The thing about the school is that there are only 5 other students, or more specifically girls enrolled in it. The normalcy barrier can easily be broken down once we see some glimpses of the perhaps what\u2019s to come. Cryptic flashbacks such as a bus accident, bombing making materials, sniper rifle, and box cutter knife all offer a glimpse that the show meets more than the eye. And indeed, the show preys on a more dangerous side of academy life.\\n\\n\r\nLife at the academy isn\u2019t very simple. We have Yuuji, a male thrown into an environment where there are not many supervisors to look after them at school. To top it off, all the students are girls there from various backgrounds. Most of them also seems to be interested in Yuuji in some way although unlike a harem anime, they don\u2019t all just throw themselves at him. But what do you do when you\u2019re the new kid at school? For Yuuji, this gets tricky as he learns more about each girl. Some of them seems to have a connected past with him while others such as Yumiko wants him gone. The basis of the premise also suggests that there are specific reasons why they are enrolled there. If you put yourselves into Yuuji\u2019s shoes, it\u2019s easy to find yourself curious with the events going on throughout the series. That\u2019s because there are cryptic hints thrown there (either dialogue or actions) that suggests the school is hiding something; or perhaps the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nA main part of the show comes from the colorful cast of characters. There is one main guy (Yuuji) who is not the typical harem protagonist. He is very self-dependent and is able to maintain his cool in almost any situation. In fact, he treats almost every situation intuitively while also possessing a good judgment and control. In short, Yuuji is the type of guy that thinks before he acts. This trait of his seems to land him into situations with other girls as they also judge him. In particular, Yumiko is the most prominent of the group who declares that she \u2018will not accept him\u2019. The show chronicles each of the other girls who interacts with him in their specific story arcs. (in the visual novel known as routes) The problem though is how they are rushed and condensed in a format in which some cases are unacceptable. Yumiko is a strong example of this with her route being shortened to a single episode. In this case, her relationship dynamics with Yuuji is severely cut to a point of being non-existent. Luckily, this isn\u2019t always the case as other routes highlights more of their moments. They also seem to focus a similar path in ways of problem, plan, and solution. Every arc/route does resolve in some way with Yuuji playing a prominent role.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the stories of the girls, we find out that each of them have some sort of tragic past. Rather than telling their story, the series shows it with precision. And by that, I mean getting directly involved. Yuuji strives to help the other girls get through whatever problem they have regardless the consequences. This is clearly seen when Yuuji takes daring risks to help Michiru dealing with the loss of a friend or protecting Makina from assassination. The moral is that Yuuji is a guy who can be depended on and the girls seems to appreciate his deed in kind. For a special case of Amane\u2019s arc, Yuuji learns of a secret from years ago that has some connections to his family. While he isn\u2019t directly present in such the arc, it still provides the viewers with the fact that Yuuji can provide emotional support and later on get involved during the present timeline. The past isn\u2019t easy to deal with after all especially once you\u2019ve seen this show and realize how tragic some of the girls\u2019 pasts are.\\n\\n\r\nOn a scale of 1-10, this show\u2019s generic traits for the girls would rank pretty high. I don\u2019t say this as neither a backlash or complement though; at least not with the way the show is advertised. Each of the girls have different personalities. Amane could be labeled as the talkative and flirty type who also plays a guardianship role of the other girls. Then, we got the lone wolf Yumiko who is almost the exact opposite of Amane. Michiru would be a fake tsundere although some people could see her act far too die-hard to be like one. There\u2019s also the childish girl known as Makina who really needs someone to take care of her. And finally, we get the oblivious yet very polite maid Sachi. Get the general kind of picture now? Some may dare say that it would be like a dream come true to live at the academy like Yuuji is. But on the surface, this type of setup screams clich\u00e9 that can test the patience of some fans. It also doesn\u2019t take long to realize there\u2019s romance in the show; some more noticeable than others. Unfortunately, most of this isn\u2019t characterized too strongly by the length of the show. There are some noticeable parts that can be emphasized especially in regards to relationships. However, it just feels like important parts are cut out or should be there to raise the focus of such relationships. There is also less focus on some of the themes in the show. One other question raised is in regards to the symbolism found with the fruits. The tree that seems to symbolize the Garden of Eden while the fruits suggests that each of the girls relates to their personalities. Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be up to the viewers to decide how to interpret these symbolisms. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is surprisingly well done on most parts even for a studio like 8-bit. They had time to prepare the budget after the announcement of the anime adaptation after over a year prior. The series has a unique way with a movie feature like format to enhance the overall quality. For the characters, each of them are designed well to fit with their personalities. While being inferior to their VN counterparts, I would say it\u2019s mostly consistent. The setting is also highlighted well with the high class designs of some of the interior rooms and structures. Not only that but we also get action in the series as well thanks to Yuuji. His kickass attitude brings an action flick in particular with a route involving Makina. On another note, the show does have brutality and fan service. Sexual suggestive scenarios are also present with characters like Amane (*see pillow humping scene). This show might not be Makoto Shinkai level with its artwork but still remains strong in the department\\n\\n\r\nOn most parts, soundtrack is above average. The OP song offers foreshadowing and a catchy way of giving each character some spotlight. Similarly, there are various ED songs for each arc featuring each of the girls (from both past and present). With the tragic pasts of the girls, you\u2019d also have to expect a good voice acting team to play their roles. Luckily, the original voice actors and actresses does that from the game. They reprise the roles of the characters to bring them to life with adequacy. There are some problems occasionally with the way the tone of voice that are done though. In particular, Makina and Michiru can be annoying to watch while even Yuuji can seem dull at times. The good part relates to the humor done with the dialogues. Mix in that with emotions and you get a balanced tone backed with a soundtrack. It\u2019s a decent resonance of the two halves to balance out the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith just 13 episodes, don\u2019t come into expecting a strong story with clever characterization. What you get is a bold story that takes risks with the characters. It\u2019s weighty with the way Yuuji\u2019s role is carried out in each of the arcs in this adaptation. And although some relationships aren\u2019t as strong as the others, the show does emphasize on creative scenarios without rising a big question mark in the end. Still, do be aware that the series showcases some of the most generic tendencies from the get-go. Rushed is also another word that\u2019s no stranger in this series\u2019 vocabulary. In the end, it\u2019s an adaptation that could have been better but still can offer some moments to remember.\\n\\n\r\nNote: it has been confirmed that the series is getting sequels so expect expansions on this season later on.\\n",

            "content": "I attracted to watch Grisaia no Kajitsu since it has a unique theme (psychological+drama), a type of settings that rarely found in this era. Before I starting to watch this, I heard many great things about the Visual Novel. Many people say it's a masterpiece. So, I started to watch with great things imagined in my mind. But after finishing it, I think I drowned into the same swamp again...\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is a story about a group of 6 teenagers (5 girls and 1 boy) that have a problem in their life. They cannot go to the regular school because of the problem. Well,I really don't know what to say about the story besides \"unfocused storyline and full of flaw\". Although I didn't play the Visual Novel, but I know that many plot devices that not exist in the anime. It is really poorly executed and wrecked. Grisaia no Kajitsu is another Visual Novel that failure in story execution. And they still putting fan service while the story is almost faded\\n\\n\r\nI do not say many things about the animation, it's just great. Also, the background reminds me of Angel Beats. And the sound settings was decent\\n\\n\r\nAnd like they said, too much focusing in one point is a suicide bomb  Grisaia no Kajitsu main focus is in the character development, almost all of the main character have their development. But having the character development in all main character not guarantee the character became deep. People say is more concerned with process than results. Well, we have the results, but the process is abstract and full of a question mark in it. This makes the character development not perfectly done well, and such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the enjoyment we have is see-saw. The feelings are mixed up, the enjoyment shine in the Amane Suou route which is the best route. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is Grisaia all about, a highly anticipated anime but full of flaws here and there. In the end, it's just another Visual Novel that loses its storyline but did decent in character development. Is it recommended? Maybe...., but don't throw high hope for this...\\n",

            "content": "\"Being indebted to someone is nothing to be ashamed of, not repaying that debt is.\" - Kazami Yuuji. \r\n     Sometimes you've run out of Anime to watch or are just bored and come across something that sounds so dumb but you say \"oh what the heck\" and by the time you realize it, it's already several hours past the time you usually sleep. Saying you'll only watch one more episode but by the time you're done, you've watched them all! This is just the Anime that does exactly that! It is a gem among stones, and this is one review Ihad to write because I do not agree with how poorly people have been rating this Anime. \\n\\n\r\n     The synopsis or description does little justice for the actual story within the anime, the story is far more rich as you continue watching. This Anime touches upon serious topics which is why some people rate this anime so low; pain, death, rape, incest...you could possibly find it all in Grisaia no Kajitsu. Even though this anime has it's comedic moments and a dose of ecchi moments, it doesn't take away from the serious tone for which this anime should be focused on.\\n\\n\r\n     The story revolves around our protagonist Yuuji and his 5 female classmates whom he meets after transferring into the school. Throughout the anime, he helps each one with the problems that they've accrued in their early lives and becomes closer to each one. Each background differs and each one brings its own serious topic, including Yuuji's own background for which is truly sad.\\n\\n\r\n     This anime in a sense is a masterpiece hidden among popular titles. It takes on serious topics and does it right, it's not afraid to challenge the industry, and it's a breath of fresh air from all the typical anime out there. I can honestly say I love this anime now, and I am really looking forward to season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Be it for the dorky humour or the sporadic bouts of humanity in the individual routes, Grisaia no Kajitsu enstablished itself as a force in the otaku world strongly enough to pique my curiosity and get enough funds for anime projects.\r\nThe first adaptation covers the story of the first game and all five routes, but it is immediately evident that the series is cheaply made for a quick cash grab. Recycled backgrounds, vital parts of the story missing to fit screen time, rushed pacing and incomplete characterization aren't going to be noticed by VN readers exclusively, but casual watchers as well. \r\nFundamentally, it's the samething as the novel: Yuuji is still a one man army when he needs to be, and the cast is still a relatively standard set of girls (tsundere, loli, onee-san, kuudere and maid), but it doesn't really work because of the reduced screen time, and if the novel was nothing special itself, the adaptation is even less competent at being a harem with touches of drama and shares the fate of many incomplete VN adaptations. Watch only if you have at least a passing interest in girls with dark pasts or if you care about the latest popular franchise.",

            "content": "I have a more updated review on my website. You can go there by going to my MAL profile and clicking on the website link in the details section. I will not be directly linking the updated review here because of the MAL review guidelines.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu.\r\nRenowned as one of the best visual novels ever to be concieved, the first of the Grisaia trilogy finally received an anime adaption with the collaboration of animation studio 8bit, and Front Wing, the creator of the Grisaia trilogy. When I first heard of this adaption, I was beyond ecstatic. My favourite visual novel was getting a proper (atthe time) anime adaption. Why wouldn't I be thrilled? Well, I can safely say now that this anime adaption doesn't exist, at least in my eyes. If you would like to find out my reasoning for this claim, then continue reading.\\n\\n\r\n### WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME ADAPTION AND MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE VN BELOW ###\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, let's start with the first episode. The first episode of this anime adaption was fantastic, to put it simply. They introduced the characters very nicely, provided a mysterious aura for the protagonist (Yuuji), and expanded upon the fact that every student in Mihama Accademy has had some sort of psychological trauma in their past. After watching the first episode, I had very high hopes for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time, the episode count of the adaption was not known / confirmed yet. But, everyone who has played the VN prior to the anime adaption (including me) was pretty much certain that it would have been a 2-cour series (22-24 episodes). It made absolutely no sense for 8bit to adapt the whole of Grisaia no Kajitsu, a 50 hour+ visual novel, into a 1-cour series (11-13 episodes). If they did go along with a 1-cour series, then they would have to cut out tons of content, rewrite key events and plot points, and skip on a lot of the monologue that made Grisaia no Kajitsu so popular in the first place. Sounds crazy right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, what do you know, 8bit surprises us (or didn't surprise us) with a 1-cour series. At that point in time, the third episode had aired, and I started to feel a tinge of doubt for the series. The first 3 episodes that had aired were amazing. They adapted the common route with much of the original humour that was found in the VN to begin with, and they included many of the character-developing scenes that made you love the characters, and then have your heart crushed in their respective routes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing the news of the adaption being a 1-cour, or 13 episode series, I tried to be optimistic about the situation. 8bit could of course, instead of adapting the whole of Grisaia no Kajitsu, adapt just one route in full. That plan could have worked brilliantly. The first 7-8 episodes could have been common route to build up the characters, and then the remaining 5-6 episodes could have been a certain character's route. So, that's the mindset that I went with up until the 4th episode, where everything came crashing down.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth episode, to put into layman terms, took my hopes and dreams of the series, stomped on them a few times, ripped them to shreds, tied them back together improperly, threw them out a window, and then left to rot on the street. Okay, that may have been a bit of exaggeration, but you get the point. Never have I been so disappointed with any animation studio before that fourth episode. A comment on the subreddit /r/anime by the user /u/Tenoia explained my frustration pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the fourth episode relatively confirmed that the remaining 9 episodes of the anime adaption would consist of each of the 5 character's respective routes, but condensed into 1-4 episode arcs. That was the /worst case/ scenario 8bit could have gone with. I mean, they gave themselves 13 episodes to toy with, and they decide to adapt each route into a condensed, sub-par copy of their source? The absurdity came crashing down on top of me that I could have suffocated under its weight. Each route in the visual novel has /hours/ of dialogue, and they suggested that they would take those hours, strip it bare, cut out character-building scenes, redo key events, and hand it to you on a silver platter.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that point, I didn't have many high hopes for the remainder of the series. The 6th and 7th episodes consisted of Yumiko's route, /completely/ redone and condensed into a single episode, and Sachi's route also condensed into a single episode. Much of the emotional buildup in either adapted route was thoroughly missing, while the monologue and some key events were altogether non-existent. The 8th and 9th episodes consisted of a 2-part arc of Makina's route, and to be honest, 8bit actually did a relatively good job on its adaption. They combined the good and bad endings, and removed the dreadfully tragic nature of the either ending that was present in the visual novel, but overall, they explained into Yuuji's past nicely, and kept most of the key events.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes consisted of Amane's route, a.k.a Angelic Howl. Angelic Howl is very well known to be the best part of the entirety of the Grisaia no Kajitsu VN, and I can definitely agree with that consensus. It's hard to explain exactly why many feel this way if you haven't experienced the sequence yourself, but to put it simply, it explained Amane's backstory in a very thrilling, tragic, dark, and dreadful nature that forced you to sympathise with the characters' struggles. It also went into 2nd best girl's backstory a fair bit (Kazuki), but I'll skip that portion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the last episode, which so happened to air today, concluded the adaption. To be completely honest, they made me WTF hard after combining the good and bad ending in this final episode, and /then/ moving the ending bit with Sakashita in the forest, to Sakashita in the school. That bit upset me at first, because the forest chase in the end of Amane's route is one of the best parts, aside from Angelic Howl. But, in the adaption, they made it take place in the school instead of the forest, and instead of a chase scene, Sakashita is holding the classmates hostage while taunting Amane. The whole attempted rape scene also completely caught me off guard. But, after thinking about it, the ending that they route instead of the VN's ending wasn't /that/ bad. It just was out of the blue, as the forest chase scene would have made more sense.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10. Too many key scenes are missing, the emotional buildup of the routes was overall lacking, and the sub-par rewrite of Yumiko's route altogether made too much of an bad impact on the series as a whole for me to give it anything other than a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: 6/10. Many people don't like or find the adaption's art and animation appalling, but I actually thought it was slightly better than average. It kept the amazing feel and quality of the VN's artwork, while retaining a unique look that doesn't find itself in many anime series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10. When the first episode came along, I was extremely happy to hear that 8bit was using the original soundtrack from the VN. The visual novel's soundtrack is one of the best there is, so that definitely helped with the overall buildup of some scenes. But, to put it simply, they overused some tense tracks that were designed to only play in scenes of great distress or disorder. Two of these would be \u300c\u30ab\u30b5\u30d6\u30bf\u300d (Kasabuta), and \u300c\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u300d (Deadlock). They also remixed some tracks into pieces that made no sense, and the transitions between some tracks were atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10. I feel genuinely sorry for those of you who didn't read the VN beforehand. The anime adaption almost didn't build the characters /at all/, and they just threw the character's circumstances at you when their route was playing. 8bit didn't give you any time whatsoever to come to love a character in full, which is mainly the fault of the common route's overall length (3 episodes). If I hadn't have read the VN before watching this anime adaption, I would have thought Sachi was a terrorist with a very stoic personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10. The only time I can say I enjoyed this anime adaption to a sub-par degree was the first 3 episodes (common route), Makina's route (episodes 8 and 9), and Amane's route / Angelic Howl (episodes 10 - 13). Other than that, the whole of this anime adaption did not please me in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'm deeply sorry if you had to go through all of my ranting, but I personally believe I have a very good reason to be upset with this adaption as a whole. I'm sure many others feel the same as I do, but if you enjoyed this adaption regardless of it's many flaws, then continue to live that way, because I wish I could enjoyed this as much as you did.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my long rant of a review, and I hope you have a Happy New Year!",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying, Grisaia is NOT a harem. Well, you kinda get that harem-y feel on the first few episodes, but it is actually not. I was actually surprised that this anime received a lot of hate from the community. I actually loved this anime. I will now explain why I enjoyed it.\r\nSTORY -6\r\nTBH, this anime doesn't have that much story. It doesn't have a proper plot other than a guy moves in to a school for girls. But it's more than meets the eye. This anime's plot is about our MC trying to make the girls get over their past problems,to allow them to move forward, to be able to get past their problems. This anime is not for people who likes to have a REALLY deep story.\\n\\n\r\nArt -8\\n\r\nThis anime has an art style which reminds me of the theatre. But with HD features. The art style is normal, and the character design is pretty, bt all it does is just pushes the audience to think that these characters are just really your normal highschool students. These artstyles suits me best, and for some reason I grew attached to the animation in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound -8\\n\r\nThe sound doesn't have anything THAT special, but the reason I picked 8 is because the backing music is awesome. I didn't give this a 9 because the VA is nothing special, but a special shoutout goes to Yuuji's VA. It suits his character well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9\\n\r\nThis is the main selling point of Grisaia. The reason is that they have their own uniqe traits and pasts. Not only that but they deal with it. They try to move forward. Their personality is different from one another, making them uniqe and I've not found a character that I hated in this anime. It's a pretty nice and amazing ride just because of the interactions from one chara to another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10\\n\r\nWell, this is a bit weird since I'm not used to these types of anime. But for some reason I enjoyed it. I watched this anime and finished it in a day. I just plain out loved this anime, but I admit, it's not the best anime EVER, It's just an anime worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -9\\n\r\nThis anime is for those who seek character development in animes. For those who likes chara development, you will like it, love it, and eat it. Arigatou.\\n",

            "content": "May 2014, Grisaia no Kajitsu is officially announced to be receiving an anime adaptation. Fans of the Visual Novel are excited to see how Juicy this animated Yuuji can be. But fans are also apprehensive, as it is being adapted by Studio 8bit. The same 8bit that butchered the adaptation of another fairly popular Visual Novel title not so long ago (Walkure Romanze), however people were hopeful that maybe, this time round, they learnt their lesson. Well did they?\r\nShort answer: not so much. Long answer...\r\nWell I certainly was hopeful after the 1st episode, which did a fantastic job of introducing all the important characters theviewers will eventually follow. Characters that break the mould of the typical 1-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, you usually find in your average Highschool Harem. Where you cannot just label a character simply as a \"Tsundere\", \"Kuudere\" or \"Dandere\" and say that's all there is too them. Because even our generic male protagonist is opted for a more intriguing stoic individual, where you cannot help but wonder how he came to be the way he is (Unfortunately the series does little to explain this). And to top things off, the voice acting turned out to be quite superb, with the VAs able to portray their respective roles so well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet I could not wholeheartedly enjoy the series. Mind you the comedy is fantastic, both intentional with its character interactions and unintentional with the haphazard developments. However it is the latter which creates one of the numerous flaws with the story.\\n\\n\r\nLike in any VN adaptation, the first couple episodes are dedicated to the common route, where a lot of the \"intentional comedy\" takes place. Yet the story at this point tends to jump around, taking random events from the original source material and plopping them wherever it pleases the director. This causes the story to lack some much needed connecting tissue and unfortunately it only gets worse once it reaches the heroine's storyline. That is when the story shifts from 2nd gear straight into 5th, bringing with it breakneck speed pacing, but with it damaging the engine the drives any emotion you may feel towards the characters. Yumiko & Sachi's route suffering the most damage, where it sped through 7+ hours worth of story into single episodes. At least they did not completely ruin Amane's route but that's not much of a consolation when even her storyline is marred by pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noticeable issue is with the show's animation, which at first, looks quite alright with its vibrant backgrounds & character designs. But that makes it easy to notice where they cut corners. Just pay attention to any scene a character is animated walking/running and whenever a vehicle is involved.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I find it hard to review Grisaia no Kajitsu as a standalone anime series, as this so happens to be my favourite VN (so far) and it's the main reason why I'd rate the \"sound\" so highly. But I cannot help for agree with this particular comment I noticed in the forums: \"The people involved in this are obviously professional butchers and Grisaia was another piece of juicy meat for them to chop up.\" Because I saw how they were butchering the routes, by taking chunks of the VN \"they\" deem \"most important\" and cramming them into a 1-cour anime series. Thus creating a series that fans of the VN will not fully enjoy and non-fans will struggle to follow, due to its breakneck pacing. Nonetheless I can say that I enjoyed the series enough to give it this score. Does this mean I'll watch the sequels? Heck No! I'll just wait for those VNs to come out on Steam.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu is based on the adult visual novel that follows 5 female students at Mihama Academy. However, this is no ordinary school; only those 5 students are enrolled here, each with \"special reasons\" for being in an academy that seems more like a prison. Kazami Yuuji, a mysterious \"exchange student from Canada\", becomes the first male student enrolled in Mihama Academy. Although he claims to desire a normal school life, events of the students' past start to unfold, piece by piece. Just who really are these students? The girls must revisit their past and take hold of their lives for another time. \r\nIwas honestly very interested by Grisaia no Kajitsu, knowing that many of my friends recommended me to read the visual novel. Seeing that an anime of the series was to be released this season, I decided to go and see if the anime will entice me enough to spend time reading the VN. As I watched this series, such friends were able to let me know the differences between the anime and VN, so I can represent two parties in this review. However, does Grisaia please the VN readers as well as newcomers to the series? Sadly, this is NOT the case. Rather than showing off why this series is strong and emotional, it turned out to be incredibly disappointing, and the adaptation in short is a trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are a few positives about the series, the sound and art are consistent and actually pretty well-done. The seiyuus from the PSP version of the series come back to do their individual roles. Most of the roles are well-done and solidly depict their character. Maon Kurosaki's \"Rakuen no Tsubasa\" is a pretty nice opening theme, and it's a song I'd definitely listen to on a regular basis. There are a whole bunch of ending songs to this series, all of which are decent, especially \"Rainy Veil\" by Yanagi Nagi. Best part of the series? Probably, and that's somewhat unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing extraordinary, but gets the job done nonetheless. Nothing particularly enticing or awe-inspiring, but the art is at least consistent and there are hardly any moments where the quality noticeably drops. Give 8-bit credit that this is really the only part where they have put noticeable effort into the series, which particularly includes putting much of their animation budget into unnecessary flashy panty shots and a couple of long H-scene-like kiss scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually very interesting from the start, each having incredibly unique personalities. From the blond twintail tsundere (Michiru), the quiet and cold lady (Yumiko), the obedient pink-haired maid (Sachi), the loli with the dirty mouth (Makina), the red haired perverted \"onee-san\" figure (Amane), and the enigmatic male lead (Yuuji), it's very likely that you'll like one of these characters, and that's understandable. So what is the problem about the series? The problem starts not on the characters themselves, but how Grisaia decided to develop their individual characters. This is where most of the positives end. \\n\\n\r\nGrisaia attempts to mimic the visual novel by showing all the possible routes of the series, totalling to a whopping 80 hours of gameplay, and throwing it into a 13-episode anime adaptation. Now you don't have to be a mathematician to know that 5 girls = 5 possible routes, and by logic, cramming 80 hours into a 4 hour series simply cannot be done without sacrifices. However, the sacrifices Grisaia made were far too severe, and turned into a huge mess. After 3 episodes of introducing the female mains with fanservice and panty shots (at least that was pretty good, actually), classic school genre humour, and brief hints on each student's past, the series has 10 episodes to do 5 routes. Although the first 3 episodes were well-done, this is where pacing becomes a concerning issue that plagues the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEach route in the visual novel follows one of the female students and the male lead and her have various interactions. By these interactions, a traumatizing past rears its head back to a particular female lead after an event in the present. The anime attempts to show all the routes of the female leads in the order presented above. However, two episodes is just simply not enough time to fully develop a character without feeling incredibly rushed. Some of the main female characters even only get a single episode to represent their route, which is even more unreasonable. Grisaia made an attempt to make the viewer feel emotional about the female student in question during their particular route. But in the end, it almost felt like a race to see who can \"develop\" a character in the shortest time possible. Simply put, events that supposedly trigger emotions are thrown at the viewer in quick succession, and before you can swallow what just happened, the anime is already miles ahead of you, and completely different events start happening. Suddenly, the route ends off, almost like one of your coworkers that get off of work RIGHT on the dot at 5PM, and no later. The character in question finds her resolve, but you really can't feel anything for the character just because the character development was so rushed. Grisaia would be a horrible relay partner, because they would just go ways ahead of you doing its own thing, while you bite the dust and never even get a chance to catch your breath. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a huge shame because I really did like the characters in the series at first. Their base character before their route is very nice, and their character after their develop is good too, even if you have not a clue how they got there. However, the problem is when the character is being developed themselves. It's possible to feel incredibly sickened and shocked by the context and background information Grisaia gives you for a particular event (Episode 12), but it's strange that one can feel almost no pity for the spotlight character themselves. Worst of all, some of the main characters don't get much spotlight throughout the whole series, and feel more like a harem piece, if anything, just because they don't have substance to back up their character. Goes to show the lack of direction the character development has in the series. And it's not just the main characters that experience this problem. Motifs of the side characters are incredibly unclear and underdeveloped, and you question their position and why they are relevant in the first place. They don't exactly help build the story as they should do, which is another letdown of the series. The anime also skips a huge portion of each route just to cram it in the little time they give it, leaving viewers confused on how things jump from place to place. And a huge blow for VN readers, Grisaia decides to butcher up parts of the story in attempt to solve the time limit and end it \"how they wanted it to end\", a disappointment for those expecting the story to stay true to the original series.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also very patchy and confusing in many instances; questions are answered in awkward fashion, and it's very noticeable that it's due to the time constraint 8-bit put themselves in. Yuuji, for one, can somehow can lead thought A to thought E, while skipping potential thoughts that normally people would think of making it even more difficult to follow. Yuuji himself is a character that has little development, which is incredibly unfortunate. I know that compared to the rest of the main cast, he should not the main focus, but viewers just really know he's not your \"average student\" that does \"dirty work in the undergrounds\". Unfortunately, aside from some appearances from his boss and coworkers, not much was given about Yuuji's past at all. He really doesn't have much else other than being a classic OP character that can solve everyone's problems. Why he does this to ruin his \"normal school life\" is not something that's explained at all, and nothing in the series would change the fact that Yuuji is a relatively bland character right from the start. I guess Spring 2015's \"Le Eden de la Grisaia\" will focus on this, huh? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, what took the last bit of hope from this series for me was how some scenes were meant to be incredibly dark and serious to build an unimaginable tragic past and see a character's internal struggles and emotions. However, it almost as if 8-bit wants to make a fool of themselves, and make Grisaia more of a laughing stock, if anything. Just as they unveil dark imagery and psychological themes, they throw in a panty shot, or an intense and passionate kissing scene. This is supposed to be a psychological series, and based on the core that was established, there are definitely some potential to make this series interesting, dark and meaningful. Instead, it almost feels like it's a parody of the series rather than being a serious adaptation, while being incredibly unfortunate that such money is completely wasted in enhancing these unnecessary scenes instead of properly planning out the story and actually develop the lead characters. If the adaptation company themselves can't take the whole development and tragic past seriously, why should the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this series, I really tried to. And I'll admit, there were at least some few parts that I did enjoy, mostly from the first few episodes, and maybe the final episode too. But it doesn't save the gongshow that happened for the rest of the adaptation. It was an okay effort by 8-bit to condense 5 routes in less than 4 hours. Perhaps you'll feel something for a character, but it sure didn't last long for me. Maybe my expectations were too high going into the series, but in the end of the day, I was pretty disappointed by how this series was handled. It had the huge potential to be much better, but alas, it tried to do too much all at once, and failed to properly execute anything at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Grisaia is a half-baked summary of the VN series that fails to please the majority of the target audience. VN readers and fans will be incredibly disappointed by how little substance the adaptation kept from the original series, while newcomer fans like myself will feel confused while experiencing little emotions for most of the characters. The pacing and character development is absolutely atrocious, to be blunt, and doesn't allow time for the viewer to absorb any events that occur. Is it the worst anime ever? Of course not. But there's just too much missed potential that makes this series go to waste. Grisaia the adaptation can be summed in one word: disappointment. If you have read the visual novel, please save yourself and not watch this dreadful series. And if you are a newcomer to the series, you would do yourself a favour by not spoiling a more worthwhile experience of reading the superior visual novel. Will season 2 be a much more worthwhile sequel, or just another letdown? We shall see...",

            "content": "As far as genre goes Grisaia no Kajitsu is probably one of the best in its field, as long as the genre is action, school life, comedy, romance goes. \r\nThe story begins with Yuuji being a mysterious transfer student coming into a new school. Also mysterious as in I don't trust this dude he's probably some badass who can kick my ass, not a Persona protagonist. Fitting his persona the school also seems to be special in the sense only five female students attend. Each of these five girls seems to have some kind of tragic back story as implied in episode 1. (Is thisshow saying men can't have trauma's? I mean maybe Yuuji, but he doesn't seem like it.) \\n\\n\r\nNow as a reminder this is based off a visual novel, so it uses the same anime adaptation set up that consists of each of the girls being helped one by one. Along with that fact this is a visual novel which I have been told is quite popular and it only has 13 episodes isn't a reason to complain at all. I feel anime adaptation are mainly used as a means to draw in more people to the game. (I haven't played it by the way.) If they wanted to tell the whole story like with Clannad, they'd need a lot of money. Remember Clannad I believe still holds the record for best selling visual novel. (Clannad came out ten years ago by the way.) So it isn't surprising that they can't match it. Dangan Ronpa (my favorite game) was the best seller for its year and look at its anime. Same with Persona 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters begin as shallow and 2D (Its odd people complain about this since it is fiction? I mean yeah I fall in love with them, and I like realistic characters as well, but still its like getting mad at someone for being real.) however as each arc ends they go from annoying stereotypes to interesting, well developed characters. My only complaint is not everyone got a arc. Pink haired, maid didn't get any love from the company and remain 2D along with onii-chan girl. (Yeah onii-chan had a interesting back story, but still pretty generic development wise.)\\n\\n\r\nArt work was great. It was fun, and really did a good job at freaking me out. Its been awhile since I was freaked out. Probably hasn't been like this Mirai Nikki, or Corpse Party and those were more plot than art. The art along with the plot gave off a great feeling. Also since this is based off an Adult visual novel who doesn't love fan service and busty women rolling around on beds. I know I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nI always have trouble when it comes to the music section. Especially since I listen to the songs once, or twice then skip. (Sorry Froggy-kun. I know I'm supposed to sing along to watch anime correctly, but being a student it isn't easy managing time and work.) The bgm didn't stand out, but I guess its did its job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed tuning every week to see what happened next with each arc, and whose arc was to follow. This anime is for visual novel adaptation fans everywhere, along with any one who enjoys the sick and twisted, traumatic side of humanity.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have to admit, there were parts of this story where I laughed my butt of, and other parts where I almost threw up because it started addressing several of my biggest fears in a very effective manner. \r\nWhen it comes to the story, overall it has a typical visual novel type of pacing. The main character solves the problems of one girl, then moves on to the next girl. This is very typical in VN adaptations, though in Grisaia's case it's the content that makes the story interesting to watch. Yes, you may get tired of knowing that the main character can somehow solvethe problem of any girl and have most of them fall for him in the process, but if you can get used to that then there's a lot more to this anime. \\n\r\nSometimes this anime is pretty funny, but when episode 4 arrives, it tones the comedy down a bit in favor to staying serious when it should be. It doesn't try to lighten the mood with jokes, but rather lets the atmosphere stay dark until we step back into the light. This makes the drama all the more engaging because it's not trying too hard. \\n\r\nThe romance, though it is there, it is not really addressed too much. It also contains a certain amount of ecchi, but not so much that it becomes very distracting.. That is except the OVA.. \\n\r\nThey don't really gloss over the cruel things happening in this anime, but rather shows you as much as possible without having to censor everything. This anime is not afraid to tell you that what is already pretty bad, can, and will, get even worse. I'm not kidding when I say this: This anime triggered my claustrophobia twice and I had to stop the episode for a little while before being able to continue. And this may be what turned some people off in this anime. It shows some pretty sexual scenes and some really twisted images. It's hard to get into it if you came for a typical VN type of story. Many people don't like the VN type of pacing either, so it's not the best story, though far from the worst. \\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm comparing this anime with a VN a lot, but it's honestly what it felt like I was watching. This anime didn't truly manage to go from VN to anime, but it tried at least. \\n\\n\r\nIt's in the characters that most of this shows strengths lies. Though most of the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts of typical anime characters, like the tsundere, maid, rich girl, loli and big boobed tomboy, what makes these character so interesting is their twisted backstories. Each character has a severe trauma from the past that still haunts them to this day, and they are all pretty messed up. Heck, even our main protagonist Yuuji has a really dark past that we don't really get to see all that much of (see Grisaia no Meikyuu and Grisaia no Rakuen). Speaking of our main character, it's refreshing to finally see a male main character who is not a typical nice guy with no unique personality. He's cynical, funny and has no idea how normal life works. He can sometimes come off as robot-like, though he does show some emotion when needed. He's also incredibly smart, though very bad at taking a hint. \\n\r\nIn this anime all girls are wearing the mask of a cardboard cutout character, when they're actually very broken people. I won't go into specifics on each character, but each girl's problems is not just a common childhood trauma or attitude issues, some of them are seriously messed up. It brings up themes like double personalities, rape, incest, suicide, insanity and abuse, and it does so without mercy. It becomes the Yuuji's job to rip off that mask and glue their real self back together. When you see what's behind the mask, that's when it gets really interesting. The change they go through is often very realistic. Tough most of them go back to their cartboard cutout by the end of their storyline, the changes are still visible. You feel the characters pain and truly wish for them to get a happy ending. \\n\r\nThe \"villains\" are also very well thought out. They all have legitimate motivations for doing what they are doing, and they aren't just there to be evil. \\n\\n\r\nArtwise I enjoyed it to a certain extent. It, again, had a very VN type of design, and more than often it felt like I was playing a VN. I didn't mind it all too much, but I still wish it would have gone a bit more out of that VN comfort zone. The visuals and symbolism is pretty to look at, and the scenery is not that bad. The art is also very, how should I say this.. Shiny. Light can reflect from anything in this anime. It got a bit distracting at times, but there were also times when it was very beautiful. It likes to play with contrasts, which makes everything really pop out, and is quite pleasant to look at. The colors are vibrant and can be distracting at times, but I still liked it quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nIn the music department, the opening is catchy, but nothing very special. It feels like your everyday drama/harem opening and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. \\n\r\nThere are 4 endings overall, ranging from upbeat and happy to calm and sad. Sometimes it doesn't really fit the darker atmosphere this anime often has, but I grew surprisingly fond of them. Especially the fourth ending, which is a very calm and beautiful song. If you should check out any of the songs, I would say to check out that one. \\n\r\nI would also talk about the OST, but I had a hard time finding it online, so I'll just say that nothing really stood out too much, but it wasn't all that bad either. It fit the atmosphere, but it wasn't something all that special. \\n\\n\r\nI do have mixed feelings about this anime. After the two times my claustrophobia was triggered, and the fact that I honestly almost threw up during the last storyline, it's hard for me to decide how much I really liked it. I thought the images was pretty, the storylines were engaging and the drama was very well balanced, so I want to say I really liked it. And, actually, I will say it. I did really enjoy most of this anime. It's dark atmosphere mixed with drama, action, comedy and some ecchi was just interesting to watch. I liked that they showed everything and weren't afraid of showing us very messed up situations. It's unpredictable to a certain extent, though it does feel like a VN. It may just be that I'm a wimp, but still, beware if you have a weak stomach or claustrophobia. \\n\\n\r\nIs this anime a must watch? Not really. Its strength lies in its dark and twisted character backgrounds and it can be very engaging and emotional, though you have to get used to the VN type of pacing and some pretty messed up stuff. If you enjoy this kind of story and setting, kind of like a really dark and weird version of Clannad, then go watch it. \\n",

            "content": "I really thought they had potential when the anime began but alas, it wasn't meant to be. That being said, it still has a few strengths that included interesting characters, and acceptable art.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was rushed. They had short episodes for each girls. This wasn't enough to know the full story of each girls. We just know the major points of their story. That is it. There are very many things they could have expanded on. Watching this series was like reading a chapter summary at Sparksnotes ten minutes before your next class. \r\nWhile we know the general idea of what is going on, mostof the events seems very forced. It's as if it just happened because it happened. There was no reason for it to happen. There are many unnecessary fanservices that doesn't contribute to the story. These wasted time could have been used to flesh out each of the girl's story some more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion for each route are disappointing as well.  Because the story was rushed, there were no lead-up to the climax and to the conclusion. It's as if it just happened. It's like a hurricane that just got in the middle of your street with no weather forecast of it happening\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWe have the emotionless overpowered sniper boy. That is all there is to the main character. While we got inside of his mind a few times in the series, that really wasn't enough to relate to him, or to learn why he acts the way he do. It is as if he's just a device to help each girls through their routes, the ignition to all their solutions. I really wanted to know more about Yuuji. No, not about him having a big uber rectangular ass but more on why he has such a straight face. I want to know why he's a sniper, and why he can read each girls well. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girls in the series have their own interesting personalities. This is one strength of the anime. The problem is that more could have been done. I couldn't really get into one of the characters story because they were bland. It's like having a friend walk up to you and they tell you their life story. It's unpolished, it sounds unfinished, and most of all, the story seems to go all over the place with no build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't grow at all throughout the series. If they did grow, it's in a snap of a finger when they suddenly realize that they should grow up and think of another way. The only thing that we learned about the characters is their past and why they act that way. We don't know much about how they will become. We can just assume that they will grow because of the protagonist. In the end, we still have retarded Michiru, we still have not so friendly Yumiko, we still have child-like behaviour Makina, we still have quiet and takes everything literally Saki, and the big tittied slut Amane. Most importantly, Yuuji is still a one-faced character.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, even if the characters are interesting, there needs more work to be done in order for them to be dynamic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe good thing about this series is that we see the characters come to life. This is at least one thing we can be thankful for. While the art isn't next level artwork, it is still acceptable. It's pretty much the art that is in the Visual Novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe anime used the exact same OST used in the Visual Novel. The first few episodes had some glaring issues with sound timing. Overall it was okay but not the best.\\n\r\nThe VAs, like in the Visual Novel, did a very good job. The choice for Yuuji's voice was also superb.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were nothing memorable but they were okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you have time to waste, you will probably enjoy this. Just don't expect a fully fleshed story and characters. If you came here because of one of the tags, here are what I will say about them:\\n\r\nDrama - Expect forced dramas because of the limitation to expand on each character's decisions.\\n\r\nRomance - There are promises for romance but do not expect much. This isn't the main focus of the story.\\n\r\nHarem - Each girl got a set of episodes (1 to 4). They all developed some kind of attachment to Yuuji.\\n\r\nPsychological - This is probably in the lower tier of the psychological genre. Each of the girl's routes have a different psychological aspect to them. Even though that is the case, the story was too rushed to call this a good psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\nI found the anime below average in terms of enjoyment. Most parts of the anime just became boring. Its glaring issues outweighs its strengths.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThe anime is pisspoor, not only in comparison to the visual novel but also to other anime similar to this. Some anime fans can still try it to see if it's worth something. There is nothing bad with trying the first three episode. Just don't blame me if you do.",

IMAO, no, their characteristics where just made to make them look helpless like a damsel in distress and the guy is a porn star in a shining armor who come to save the day..........and afterwards he gets to bang them, or at least that's what part of the manga suggest {I have only been to some of the chapters and one of them involves Yuuji banging Amane}, so no more bull butter and here are my ratings for this anime with a Hentai atmosphere, but withnone banging  {cu'z the guy get's to do it in the manga}:\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this is the story of five bimbos of Mihama Academy, who were there to isolate themselves from the world that has given them pain and along come a guy who would help them to overcome the emotional pain that they've suffer for quite sometime. But, you know, regardless of the plot for each arc one thing was certain, and this anime's plot is the most purest of harem and quite frankly the situations and the plots were just too over seasoned with a lot of elements that makes this anime's story line too pathetic to comprehend, so it's a pathetic 1 for the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what do you see in this anime?\\n\\n\r\n-A big school that only has 6 students, which includes the guy.  \\n\\n\r\n-Very fashionable school uniforms for the girls and the guy.\\n\\n\r\n-A nice horizon and background illustration.\\n\\n\r\n-Fanservice that the dogs will howl for, oh , it also comes with Suou who is pleasuring herself in one epsiode {very indecent, and should just be limited to the manga}.\\n\\n\r\nSo with such nice illustration...hummmm, it's a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\\n\r\nI giving a 6 since I have nothing much to comment about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's go over to each of those Bimbos.\\n\\n\r\nMakina Irisu- Forget about her flashback scene, frankly, she is this just a lolicon element for the MC. Her arc with Yuuji can be describe an action element, it's just that the action element can be classified as like a 'B\" movie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKomine Sachi- Ok, so what we have is the quintessential maid girl that is usual in most harem genre, her arc is has that Psychological element, where it is best describe as 'STUPID.\" Geeez, her character alone for being this forever good girls really make her a certified SUCKER.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakaki Yumiko- If this anime has that thriller element it would be her, because of her who always carrys a box cutter and not afraid to slash anybody she hates , also her arc was more like an old body switching thing that was used to be done in some rated 'B\" movies, her acting wasn't much that can be nominated to the Oscars, but then again no harem genre would be complete without a tsundere. But you know, I got to hand it to that girl, she is one tsundere who got owned by the guy.\\n\\n\r\n Matsushima Michiru- the quintessential, crazy girl and in general, her arc is CRAZY andwas just too over-flattering, geez how can a girl like that have a heart transplant is basically ambiguous. \\n\\n\\n\r\n Suou Amane- She is the Hentai bomb in this anime, and it would be best if you guys out there just look her up in the manga, I'm pretty sure you'll wanna be playing with your joysticks. Btw, about her arc, if Bear Grylls of Man Vs Wild would be watching this, I'm sure he'll saying how stupid is original creator,Front Wing is, for making a stupid survival story out of Amane's arc.  \\n\\n\r\nYuuji Kazama- what can I say, he is this prefect symbol of a knight in shinning armor who has that porn star vibe\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all the crazies, over-flattering and stupid scenarios, I won't think twice of giving this a part pathetic 1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nPoor number 3 is what I give this category, I've watch it out of curiosity as to whom the MC would picked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nGenerally it's a pathetic anime all along, I would have been much better if original creator Front Wing just made it a hentai and not something that has a hentai vibe without the banging and if it were a hentai anime, then I wouldn't have to waste my time to watch it, so my advice to the boys , just go with the manga at least  seeing the MC bang the 5 bimbos would give you guys some joy to play your winky, not that I care anyways, since I've already dropped the manga.  My rating....a 1.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was extremely surprised by this show, I was trying to find a new anime to watch and just randomly picked this from a list. when I read the synopsis I figured it would just be another ecchi/harem show and almost brushed it off. however, i looked into the show some more and decided to try it anyway. I had almost no intention of actually watching the show, i just needed something to pass the time. the first episode was okay enough and I was about to put the show down, except that the end of the first episode left enough mystery that Ihad to see what happened next. anyway, enough with the background, and on with the review! \\n\\n\r\n-story-\\n\r\n             I think the story was one of the weaker points in the show, not that it was bad, it just didn't really make sense. my biggest problem with the story was it's spacing, of the 5 heroines, each of them gets an arc. the problem was that the arcs were not even, 2 of the girls got 3+ episodes to explain everything and really flesh out their background, while the other 3 got 1-2 episodes max. overall I thought the story was intriguing enough to keep it interesting and even though it was the shows weaker point (in my opinion) it didn't do anything to seriously cripple the show\\n\\n\r\n-art-\\n\r\n            I don't have anything specific to say about the art, it seemed pretty average but it worked so smoothly that it ended up being quiet beautiful. the opening art was also very good and went with the music quiet nicely.\\n\\n\r\n-sound-\\n\r\n            I loved it, or at least the music part. the opening theme was phenomenal and while I usually skip the ending of a show after listening once to test it, I found every end theme In this show to be captivating and pleasant to listen to. As for the voices, I didn't have any particularly issues, but some of the voices were a little moe for me. \\n\\n\r\n-character- \\n\r\n                   this is were the show really shows it's strength, each of the character's get's there own story arc. each arc does a great job of creating a setting and really showing the issues that these girls carry around with them and Yuugi managing to solve it somehow. my only concern is that the characters with the shorter story arcs didn't get as fleshed out as the others\\n\\n\r\n-enjoyment-\\n\r\n                   as far as my personal enjoyment, I stated at the beginning that i was surprised with this show, while it does have some ecchi elements, they are mostly inserted briefly for comedy and don't do anything to harm the story. I loved this show because it was captivating and fun to watch and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good show.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nA common phrase that is often said is, \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Obviously, the saying isn't meant for books alone. It's aimed at anything that may look one way, but has more to it than just a precursory glance can give. From food to movies, sometimes it requires one to fully understand what truly lies behind the object. This particular expression can also be applied to people. The way one acts, thinks, and wishes to be perceived are all byproducts of the past that has created him or her. In certain cases, one's outward appearancesdon't match the real person hiding within. In Grisaia no Kajitsu, such a statement contains almost too much truth.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn Grisaia, main lead Yuuji transfers to a new school filled with only five other students: Makina, Sachi, Michiru, Yumiko, and Amane. While the girls all seem quite normal, what lies beneath their visible demeanor is more than just cuteness and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Grisaia begins, it comes off as rather strange. Its dry humor and seemingly dark atmosphere blend together quite nicely. Yuuji talking nonchalantly with the girls while dealing with their troubled pasts creates a weird feeling that permeates much of the series. This is further reinforced by the setting provided. The barren school, the special task-force, and the grim subject matters provide world-building elements that make the anime seep in a less-than-cheery sauce, providing the flavor it has. At times, though, the show prioritizes misplaced fan-service that detracts from what the anime has to offer. Now, some of it is well done: Amane masturbating in Yuuji's room defines her character or Makina starting a make-out session demonstrates her social ineptitude. But when scenes are littered with random panty-shots or more focused on boobs, it doesn't add anything to the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Grisaia may have the ability to balance hilarity and drama nicely, that doesn't speak for the quality of both. More specifically, the show suffers from terrible pacing issues. The beginning of the series is rather pleasant. Characters are introduced, the world is staged, and the mood is set. Everything is primed and ready for the inevitable character exploration. However, the show fails to adequately give the cast the appropriate amount of time in which to lay their story bare. With the exception of Amane, the other girls' arcs are simply unfulfilling because not enough attention is paid to them. Attempting to cram an entire character's worth into a single episode not only does zero justice for the person in question, but also comes off as incredibly rushed. The idea, obviously, is to look at each member of the harem, regardless of screen time. While doing so addresses the entire cast, the aftereffect is a shoddy composition that is just barely held together.\\n\\n\r\nDeep down, the anime actually has a purposeful message. Each girl has a past mired in tragedy and despair that prevents them from being the person they want to be. Grisaia's tale, then, is one about moving on. Learning to accept the mistakes that were made, understanding what needs to be done now, and taking that first step forward is very mature. It's thoughtful, because it is more than just saying, \"What I did was wrong.\" The importance is in growing from the events that shaped one's life up until this point in time. And while such mistakes may be made again in the future, having the ability to become better because of them makes a world of a difference.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia actually does okay when it comes to the art and animation it holds.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent artistic decision is the use of wide-screen. It actually gives the show a more refined look, making the shots themselves hold a bit more importance or weight than they usually deserve. Plus, it oozes a certain movie-like quality that is just nicer to look at. The locations are also treated well enough, with areas being visited besides just the dorm and the school. Forests, city-scapes, and countrysides are shown, each with good lighting and apparent detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are hit or miss. Yuuji and the less relevant characters are somewhat boring or uninspired, trying too hard to be unique enough within the cast. The girls, though, fare slightly better. They look mature, given the topics at hand, are attractive, and contain a good amount of detail, from their hair to their eyes. Among everyone, Michiru stands out the most. With her blonde twin-tails and lion tooth, she just looks like a \"Chiru-Chiru.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation involved is unfortunately not always the best. It does have its moments during more intense situations, but the dialogue-heavy anime usually resorts to mouth movements instead of character expressions or fluid gestures.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs a character-driven anime, Grisaia relies on the cast to carry it the whole way through. Sadly, some are just not able to tough it out.\\n\\n\r\nYumiko is a woman who comes off as entirely unapproachable. Literally wielding a switchblade to keep others at a distance, she is quick to point out the obvious yet is easily embarrassed. Being born as an unwanted addition to the family, she often feels trapped, with no one around to accept her for who she really is. And keeping others out only perpetuates the isolation she constantly feels. Arguably the weakest character, Yumiko is often sidelined due to her usual reserved nature. Not being loud or sincere in her actions, the other girls drown her out, causing the audience to want more.\\n\\n\r\nAs the dorm's \"personal\" maid, Sachi is respectful of the people around her. Kind in mannerisms and a listener rather than a talker, she appears to be tame in personality. However, she harbors a rather obsessive side. This quirk of hers stems from a harsh reality where one decision she made changed the outcome of her life forever. As such, she always takes it upon herself to see through anything to the end, disregarding any sort of personal safety. A proponent for what it means to be selfish, she upholds a heavy burden that any sane person would have difficulty with. However, much like Yumiko, once she is \"developed,\" she is tossed aside, providing no further relevancy.\\n\\n\r\nMakina seems out of place within the academy, usually due to her stature and childlike behavior. But the more one spends time with her, the more there is to learn. Her potty-mouth, unfettered emotions, and literal daddy issues make her a handful to deal with at any given moment. Taking solace in the comfort that Yuuji provides, Makina's psychological issues are at least calmed due to his intervention. A friend to all and a fan of Tuna Man, she may act like a kid, but her willingness to experience what life has to offer makes her anything but.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Yuuji isn't normal by any definition of the word. Unemotional, unintentionally hilarious, and unable to follow the \"easy\" path, his background is shrouded in mystery. Oddly willing to help those in need, his line of work often left him wanting something more. And this was found in the girls of Mihama Academy; being considered a regular, everyday guy by those around him gave him a breath of fresh air from the usual pandering and doting he received everywhere else. As the catalyst for the girls' cures, he not only earns their trust, but is likewise deserving of having his harem.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the most memorable, Michiru is a big ball of joy. Overreacting to everything and just plain silly, she never seems to stop being funny. She has a passion for animals and is more caring than would at first be believed. Having both a literal and figurative identity crisis, she more often than not is unable to cope with being her regular self. Knowing the meaning of \"heartache,\" she refuses to believe she is worth anything more than the dirt on the ground. Undergoing the greatest amount of self-reflection gives her the needed boost in confidence that she's been seeking her entire life. And with such newfound confidence, her resolve to live is forever cemented.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Yumiko is the weakest, Amane is arguably the strongest. Beautiful, womanly, and overtly sexual, she acts without limitations when Yuuji is in the picture. Giving off huge vibes that her behavior is sensationalized, what she reveals about the trials and tribulations she experienced as a young girl provide the much needed confirmation. Her motif is regret: regret at being unable to help, regret at sacrificing those dear to her, and regret with not knowing what to do. She is a textbook example of a person wanting to punish oneself for what has already come to pass. What she discovers, though, is that it isn't so much punishment that she deserves. Instead, she deserves to be freed from the past that haunts her. And in order for that to happen, she must first forgive herself.\\n\\n\r\nMentioned slightly within these interpretations, it's important to understand why the girls are able to take the anime's overall theme to heart. At first look, Yuuji appears to be an anchor, being the answer to all of the girls' problems. And to an extent, this is true. However, it's better to see Yuuji not as an anchor but rather as a guide post. While he may sometimes get directly involved, he much prefers to have the women come to their own realizations. Whether he lends them advice or merely hears them out, it is up to the girls themselves to take the plunge towards resolution. Yuuji is just there to push them in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP actually has a strong opening sequence, followed by a slower, rather generic middle. The song picks back up after the halfway mark, ending on a literal high note.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is rather generic, with its simple singing and strumming of the guitar. It used hardly ever, which is for the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED appears to be quite slow and calming, contrasting with the more grim tales that the show contains. But then it picks up, falling in line with the comedy and fun that it also performs well with. The quick drums and high-pitched singing give it that non-serious feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ED is poppy and personal, reflecting Michiru's personality perfectly. It's also whimsical, giving it a hopeful vibe that fits her arc, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth ED is quite melancholic. It begins with soft singing and a slow arrangement that brings a certain amount of sadness alongside it. It gets a bit more fantastical and subsequently happier the further along it goes, but that inkling feeling it starts with always remains.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack consists mostly of mood pieces. The heavy-bass riff during dramatic build-ups and acoustic guitar and piano mixes during the more lighthearted romps. The pieces are fine for what they are, but are not worth listening to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting sees above average performances by most of the cast. A special shout-out goes to Kaori Mizuhashi as Michiru.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked Yuuji and the comedy a lot. Much of it is quite bland in delivery, but that's the point. Offhand comments are the norm, but it is intermixed with Makina's and Michiru's brand of hilarity that was fun to see. The show, as expected, got less funny the more it went on, attempting to put whatever focus it could spare on the drama instead. The laughs became more infrequent, and since the drama wasn't particularly engaging, the fun slowly withered as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Amane, simply because I like attractive women. I couldn't tell if she exactly \"won,\" but I'd like to think that that is the case here, which made me both happy and sad to see. She's hyper-sexualized, as that is her character to a degree, and part of my fun with the show came from seeing her in a sexual manner.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is a psychological anime that dabbles in comedy. While the pacing and cast are wobbly, it's a semi-enjoyable time that should at least keep one interested.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nice atmosphere, pacing issues reduce impact, meaningful message\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, wide-screen, nice art, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Yumiko, Sachi, and Makina are weak while Yuuji, Michiru, and Amane are strong\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay EDs, okay soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, starts out nice but withers slowly\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu is an anime that had plenty of potential to be something interesting, a chance to tell some compelling stories that contained their share of some emotional moments. Sadly these moments feel too far in between. Rushed narratives and developing characters but only to stop exploring them further has held back the show.\r\nI should first clarify that I had not played the visual novel before diving into the show. In fact, I only took a small glance at the synopsis and thought that I might stumble across something interesting. While the anime itself has certainly appealed enough to me to want to explorethese characters further in the VN, should I really consider that a success? A show needs to be able to stand on its own, and aside from a much more engaging final arc, I can't say I found myself drawn in many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is sadly where the show suffers the most. When people talk about shows that needed more episodes, this is going to be one that will feature very prominently. The show decides to take on many different routes and cram them into the space of 13 episodes. The result? Not great. By the end of the show I was left with plenty of questions and very few things answered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's annoying is that these tales revolving around the five girls are actually quite interesting. Yet by the time I was finding myself intrigued, the arc would usually be finished. The worst part is that at the conclusion of each arc - aside from some subtle differences in character behaviour and appearance - you wouldn't have even known the previous arc had taken place. None of what you have previously watched seems to have any bearing on future events. You could almost take the different stories, rearrange them in any order you would be none the wiser. If you really want to add some emotional weight behind your stories then we need to see their after effects. Naturally, with an anime being made from a visual novel with very distance branches in its routes, this flaw is bound to happen. It's just such a shame to see these stories being told only for them to seemingly have no noticeable impact or development on our characters. It's not a great way to write a show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show won me back a little bit with its final story. Without going into detail, the shift in tone was welcome. I found myself really curious as to what would happen next. Having extra episodes set aside for the arc certainly helped its cause.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters themselves are very distinctive but without being memorable.\\n\r\nKazami Yuuji is certainly an interesting main character. I never found myself completely drawn to his cool, collected personality. His interactions with the girls feel emotionless and at times can shift the mood of a scene for the worse. Yet at the same time it's refreshing to have a lead who doesn't lose his head when things go against him. He's calculating, clever and goes out of his way to help and protect those around him. It would definitely have been nice to have had some more development on his back story, to help explain how he developed the personality he has, especially considering everyone else around him gets their share of development - albeit a minuscule amount.\\n\\n\r\nOur five girls, Makina, Michiru, Sachi, Amane and Yumiko, all get their time in the spotlight but when they're outside of it you wouldn't even know they existed. They are all sadly victims of the writing choices of the show. When they do get they're chance to shine the results are mixed. Some stories were flat out bizarre (Yumiko) and uninteresting (Sachi) while some (Michiru and Amane) definitely felt more memorable. And of course all of them were rushed, never helping the cause.\\n\\n\r\nCheap fanservice moments involving them were also very unnecessary. I'm quite aware of what the source material is like, but when you try to pack that in during inappropriate moments then the result is, quite frankly, embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia is a show that could have been something much more had the writers chosen to remain focused on just one route. Instead of being delivered one delicious course, we've been handed five leftovers. I haven't quite lost my appetite for more but the next dish will need to be prepared with more care.",

            "content": "WARNING: As of writing this preview, there are only four episodes out. It may get better or worse than what it is currently. I noticed there were no reviews yet and decided it would be good to have a review of the first two episodes to give people a feel of how the show is shaping up, without spoiling it of course :P\r\nNow on to the review. \r\nStory - 9 \r\nAs this has so far been rather well adapted from the Visual Novel of the same name, the story is pretty well the same. It is really good in my opinion and the MAIN differencebetween the anime and visual novel is that the anime obviously has to move a little faster. That doesn't mean the story isn't as good though. The anime has done well with presenting us with a good story and it is keeping true to the VN rather well and has included the more important/fun plot points of the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 \\n\r\nNow I think the art style is part of the main reason I decided to watch this show and read the VN. It is pretty fantastic and I have yet to really see any issues with the animation or the quality of the art style. It has proven to have a really nice feel to it with some darker colors for some scenes and bright/vibrant colors for other parts. The art is where this show excels.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\r\nAs the sound seems to be the same as the VN with some other newer pieces mixed in, I am pleased with it. Some of the bgm from the VN that I didn't care for as much is still here in the anime because they used the same music but all-in-all, it has a good musical score that fits right in with the mood of each scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nProbably one of the weaker points since the main characters are all rather stereotypical tropes female anime characters BUT that said, they do like to put a nice spin on the archetypes and make the characters more interesting than in other situations or other shows. While you do have your tsundere character, she has a personality that is somewhat different (different enough to be good) than the standard tsundere and every other character is the same in this sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nI have enjoyed this show and definitely enjoyed the visual novel. I recommend this show to anyone and if you finish the show and you still want more, you can check out the visual novel for more, uncensored fun ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\r\nI have to give it a 9 overall because it has proven to be a rather good show with only a few small things to complain about. Though, most of those complaints come from the fact that this is an anime and it cannot include literally EVERYTHING from the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this show has treated me well and I can say it'll be a good show for anyone to check out.",

            "content": "For nearly every minute I spent watching Grisaia, I kept asking myself the same question: \"Why the hell is this only 13 episodes long?\"\r\nThe natural response would be that the studio did not have enough budget to stretch the production any further. And while that does contain some truth, it does not excuse 50+ hours of story from the visual novel being jammed into a meagre four hours of animation. True, there's a lot of crap in the visual novel that could be cut out with little of value being lost. But when necessary story and characterisation is rushed through so quickly that you canbarely even tell what the hell is going on, there is a major problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe suits behind the adaptation failed to understand that they could simply lighten down on the pace and leave the rest of the story for later seasons. Cover half the content from the visual novel, and if it sells well enough (and it almost assuredly would given the popularity of the franchise), cover the rest of it in a second season. Great, everyone is happy. Instead of that, we get \"Grisaia: The Compilation Series\". I can't imagine anyone except the most devoted of fans is satisfied with the result. \\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to judge the Grisaia anime for what it is rather than for what it should be, considering nearly every issue is in some way related to the pacing. The characters frequently engage in acts of nonsense because the anime doesn't have any time to explain their actions. Sachi's episode is just laughable as it immediately transforms the naive, innocent maid into some dangerous psycho without any reasons as to WHY. A few minutes later and again without reason, she changes back into Stupid Lovable Sachi, and at that point it becomes a mystery who or what her character is even supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nMost egregious is the 'romance' between the protagonist, Yuuji, and one of the heroines. Within the first five minutes of her arc, Yuuji and said heroine become a couple after an impromptu make-out scene. It's all well and nice when an anime actually has the guts to show two characters kissing, but in Grisaia's case, the two are so unfamiliar with each other that they may as well be still be strangers. It does very little to make their relationship feel natural, and until it becomes clear what the girl's reason for hitting on Yuuji all the damn time are, it just feels like the two are incredibly desperate and don't actually care about each other. And that still doesn't change much by the end of her arc. Whereas in the visual novel it is obvious that Yuuji has genuine feelings for and a desire to protect her, in the anime's case it's just \"hey, whatever, man\". Yuuji is only wooing the girls because they offer themselves to him so easily. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the story is whiplashing from one heroine arc to another so quickly and without break -- often with only a single episode to separate them -- it is easy to get a headache from the overwhelming onslaught of drama. It's a ceaseless wave of story bombshells, 'shocking' revelations that in fact do not feel shocking whatsoever because of the needless fatigue it puts on the viewer. By the time you're done watching the first or second heroine arc, it becomes very clear how the rest of them are going to play out. Girl has crazy past, Yuuji comes in to save the day and help them overcome their trauma - again and again. \\n\\n\r\nYumiko's arc in particular feels very out-of-place and contrived, considering how she suddenly spills her entire past to Yuuji despite hating his guts and trying to stab him IN the guts only moments earlier. Hell, even the reason why she's afraid of men in the first place is skipped over and scarcely mentioned. And Sachi's arc, again, is laughable for the massive 'twist' it pulls at the end, contrasted with the complete indifference of the two people involved. I think only Michiru's and Makina's arcs are the ones that are done even moderately well, and even then I would struggle to label them anything more than merely OK. Makina's route has some issues as well, namely why the hell Yuuji -- especially when one considers his line of work -- is destroying his entire life to help some random loli he knows little about and has only been friends with for a few days. Michiru's route is largely forgettable; I actually had to rewatch parts of it to even remember what happened since the show was such a damn blur.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem, if largely irrelevant to anime-only viewers, is the lack of Yuuji's witty monologues. They are what made the visual novel so entertaining and are what turned Yuuji into an actual character and not merely a collection of 'cool' and 'badass' traits like he is in the anime. Sure, he's still likeable in the anime (especially with the addition of an appropriate voice actor), but there is little to make him interesting except in contrast to the billions of mentally retarded harem protagonists. Granted, it's difficult to carry his monologues over without the show feeling awkward -- anime and visual novels are two different mediums, after all -- but it would not hurt to have added a little bit more of Yuuji's thoughts, especially during the comedic scenes. The anime adaptation is inherently inferior for not having that.\\n\\n\r\nI think what frustrated me more than anything was the show's endless, pathetic need to have panty shots at the worst times possible. A character will actually be DYING and it will still have the nerve to stare at her panties. WHAT? Seriously, what the hell? Rather than drool over panties like some 12-year-old who just found out about porn, the staff should try maturing a bit by focusing on things that people actually do (and which are an actual part of the VN's story), like sex and kissing and everything in between. The show does at least have the courage to show Yuuji kissing several of the girls, so it's not entirely a lost cause, I suppose. And yes, 'several' was not a typo; Grisaia is undoubtedly a harem story, even when it decides to throw two characters into a romantic relationship. \\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the survival backstory within Amane's route is actually given a proper amount of screentime (surprising, I know!) and is a genuinely engaging story as a result, even if it isn't necessarily pleasant to watch. As in pretty much any story about a group of people surviving together, they all fall into madness at some point, and some of the things they do, like eating maggots on their wounds in order to escape starvation, will likely make you feel like vomiting. So do be prepared. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is... well, not great. The characters look out-of-place and even like blobs in a number of scenes, though the letterboxing effect is a nice touch and gives the show a more cinematic feel. Some praise can also be said for the audio. The OP - particularly its instrumentals - is a great piece of music. Godly, perhaps. It's a shame there wasn't more like that in the actual episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCan I recommend watching Grisaia? If you're an anime-only viewer who has not read the visual novel, I would say no and tell you to go read that instead, especially when it has arguably the best fan translation that has ever been released. The anime is not a worthwhile story on its own, and unless you're craving for a mediocre harem anime with a cool protagonist, you're only going to find yourself frustrated and alienated by the ridiculous pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've already read the visual novel, though, Grisaia is still a decent piece of fanservice despite my endless complaining. Seeing the story in animation and not just pictures certainly makes it more dynamic, and the addition of a voice actor for Yuuji makes him feel much more human. It's not an ideal adaptation by any stretch of the imagination, but it works, and for some fans that will be enough.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just hope they don't repeat the same mistakes in the other seasons.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu Review \r\nSo. Where to begin ? Grisaia no Kajitsu debuted as a visual novel, and it was quite highly praised. So, like several other visual novels, since it was starting to get very popular, Front Wing decided that it was time to adapt it into an anime, to further boost the popularity of the VN. However, most of us know that adapting a visual novel into an anime is a very \"hit or miss\" decision. Either it's a complete success, like Clannad or Fate/Stay Night UBW, or it's a complete disaster, the that will forever tarnish the reputation of the source material.It's understandable, because most adaptations don't get more than a one court anime, unless they're from some big studio like Key. And trying to adapt a VN of 50+ hours into a 12 episodes anime can be quite hard. So which one is it ? Will Grisaia no Kajitsu (I'll call it GnK from now on) be remembered as one of the few VN that got successfully adapted, or will it be simply another anime to add to the heap of horrible adaptations ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5\\n\\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, GnK doesn't have too much of a story. Yuji Kazami, the main character, join a private school, where there's only 5 other students, all girls. We'll talk about each of them later on. Pretty much that entirety of the story after the intro consists of the girls backstory, and how Yuji interacts with each of them. Because of this, GnK's focus isn't on the story, but rather on the characters, which can be both good or bad, depending on how it's done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, there's not much to the story. So for me to give GnK such a high rating, the characters must be pretty good, right ? WRONGS !! You've got the typical mysterious transfer student, a maid, a generic tsundere, a loli, the Kuudere and a girl who REALLY wants a boyfriend. That said, those unoriginal characters become much, MUCH more memorable when you take their backstories into account. You quickly realize that nobody is normal at this school. It's like everyone is wearing a mask, desperately trying to forget their own history. Everyone has a f***** up past, and that's what make those characters so interesting. Each of the five girls have an arc. During those arcs, I ended up caring a lot for the same characters that I immediately dismissed as boring and uninteresting after the first episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\\n\r\nThe musics are pretty good and fits well the scenes in which they appear. The EDs were good, but I didn't find them as noticeable as the opening. The voice actors also do a good job, I don't have any complaints here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 8\\n\\n\r\nIt looks great for a 2014 anime. The dark colour palette fits the dark side of the story, and the character design is pretty good, none of the characters look the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching GnK, I wasn't really sure if I was gonna like it or not. But as I watched it weeks after weeks I eventually started to be really looking forward to the next episode without even noticing it. It was especially painful to wait for the next episode during Amane's arc, which is easily the best in my opinion. I've seen a lot of people who said that they didn't like it because it was too weird, but I'm a weird person myself, so I actually enjoyed it's weirdness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating :\\n\\n\r\nSo. Should you watch GnK ? YES ! But it's not for everyone, so it really depends on your personal tastes. One complaint that I often heard, was that it was rushed, and took out way too much scenes from the VN. But I didn't play the VN, so I didn't noticed that. To me, it wasn't rushed. The character arcs had a good pace, with the exception of Sachi's , which would have needed at least another episode. So is it a good adaptation ? Honestly, I don't know. Those who played the VN will probably be disappointed by how short it is, but as a standalone anime, it's successful. And with Season 2 & 3 confirmed, all remaining questions will hopefully be answered.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSo ! This was one of my first review, and this definitively won't be my last ! I have a lot of improvement to do, and I know that. That's why I would really appreciate if you guys would leave me feedback and/or tips to improve my future reviews by commenting on my profile or sending me a PM ! Let me know if there's something you feel like I should improve, whether it be the length of the review, if I need to talk more or less about a certain subject, or anything else that you think needs improvement ^__^",

            "content": "\"No matter how much I keep lowering my expectations, I still end up disappointed\"\r\nThat one sentence sums up the ongoing experience of watching this anime from start to finish.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is undoubtedly one of the most successful and popular visual novels in recent years. It is a game praised for having a godlike character cast, excellent production value, great comedy, extreme lewdness and an abnormal amount of psychological depth and serious storylines for a harem series. Sounds like the perfect recipe for something to make an anime out of, right? Well three and a half years after the original visual novel was released, itfinally happened. However unlike its source material, this anime adaptation of Kajitsu fails in essentially every single department other than the animation, and instead serves as one of the biggest train wrecks I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is the story of a little group of teenagers with problems. Said problems are generally some kind of psychological trauma or other type of darker past that in the end results in the person being unable to fit into society anymore. Introducing Mihama Academy, a specially funded high-school dedicated solely in order to educate students that find themselves unable to go to any \"normal\" schools any longer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a result, they're all a bunch of crazy people. The characters of Grisaia are very unique and completely wacky. Because of their complicated backgrounds, not a single one of them is acting like a normal person, and consequently they give you an extremely unpredictable flow of events whenever they interact with each other. Together they make up one of the most unique setup of main characters you'll ever see, and that's exactly what makes them so likable. Unfortunately however, this anime doesn't give them much of a chance to showcase it.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point: this anime is rushed. Incredibly rushed. Actually the word rushed is not even enough to explain just how much of a complete and utter mess the pacing of this so-called \"adaptation\" truly is. The mere idea of trying to cover about 80 hours' worth of visual novel content in a 13-episode anime is nothing short of ridiculous to begin with but here it was actually attempted, and unsurprisingly it failed miserably. The first three episodes show some promise, when the anime is merely showing the hilarious everyday antics that the characters are pulling off during their school days. After that however, as soon as the story gets into its serious elements, things rapidly start derailing, and it *never ever stops derailing*.\\n\\n\r\nMichiru's and Makina's routes skip huge amounts of content, leaving out key plot elements and just leaves you feeling extremely confused and unsatisfied as a viewer. You also immediately lose all sense of time as sometimes the story pulls a sudden time skip out of nowhere and tries to proceed as if everything's all fine and dandy, despite having just left out several hours' worth of story. Sachi's and Yumiko's routes are even worse, they sincerely get *one* episode each to cover their *entire* story arcs. We're talking 10+ hours of content in *one* episode each. Since this feat is pretty much impossible, the production team's so-called \"solution\" to this is to simply flat-out cut away 90% of the story and pretend that the rest of the plot just doesn't exist, and unbelievably enough they on top of that even take the time to add totally nonsensical original content of their own into the mix. Especially Yumiko's route might just get the award as the worst adaptation of anything I've ever seen to be perfectly blunt. Finally Amane's route which is generally the most popular and praised one of the visual novel is fortunately also the only one that receives some sort of tolerable adaptation here, but sadly it's way too late to be enough to save this disaster of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ones responsible for this whole mess are none other than Studio 8bit; famous for \"illustrious\" works such as Walkure Romanze as well as both seasons of Infinite Stratos. It would not be an exaggeration to say that people did not have a whole lot of faith in them even before Grisaia began airing, and unfortunately as it turns out; that was not an incorrect mindset at all. If there's one thing I have to give them credit for though, it's that the animation quality of this anime is still very high despite everything else. The characters and the environments both look great. Fans of the Monogatari Series will also notice the awfully familiar-looking character designs, which is quite simply explained by the fact that they are done by the same artist. The anime also utilizes a pretty interesting extreme-widescreen resolution that probably makes the show look a lot better if you have a really wide monitor.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing 8bit apparently decided to randomly add to this show... was fanservice. Now don't get me wrong, Grisaia is incredibly lewd even in its original form but there's a very clear difference here. What the visual novel primarily contains is a myriad of hilarious sexual innuendos that were all clearly written by someone with taste and a good sense of humour. The anime however has virtually none of this. Instead, it goes with the age-old approach of throwing in random panty shots whenever possible, regardless of where or when. The problem is that this is not just a generic ecchi series, so when these spontaneous panty shots are shoved into the camera during life-or-death situations when the rest of the story is actually trying to be serious, it doesn't exactly feel very appropriate. Did the animators never stop to think that this might be *somewhat* out of place? Like really?\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is all-round very impressive. The same cast used in the original game makes a comeback for the anime and helps liven up their respective characters immensely. Especially Makina's and Michiru's respective voice actresses make a phenomenal performance in my opinion given how incredibly wacky those two roles in particular are. It's just a shame that the anime doesn't really give them a whole lot of time to showcase it since it's so incredibly rushed. The soundtrack there is very little to say about however: while the OST does its job at enhancing the atmosphere in more or less every scene, it is definitely nothing memorable either. The opening and various ending themes are the same story: decent, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the production value is solid but it's nowhere even close to making up for how incredibly butchered the story in this anime is. If you've played the original visual novel, then watching this anime is nothing but painful. It's like a guilt trip where you start every new episode holding a slight glimmer of hope that things might get better, but end up just as disappointed as the week before every single time. Seeing such a great source material dissected and ripped apart like this just hurts, and I wouldn't recommend anyone who liked the visual novel to watch this anime for their own sakes, at least not if they're expecting a legitimate adaptation. Though if you just think of it as some sort of fan fiction or similar, then it might be okay. If you have never played the visual novel however nor plan to, then this particular issue will not exist as you won't have anything to compare the anime to, so the show is not quite as bad in that case. However then you're still faced with the issue of the blitzkrieg pacing of this show which ends up eagerly skipping past its own plot points, and as a result you'll have some serious problems trying to figure out just what the hell is going on every so often. You might not be aware of what the holes are leaving out, but you'll still sure as hell notice that there are in fact holes more or less everywhere. It's just that blatantly obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been the source of a lot of pain and agony for many people over the last few months. In the end despite all that, I'd still say it's a good thing that it came into existence, if only for the reason of perhaps driving up more attention for the visual novel and hopefully getting some more people to try that out instead. At least that's the only thing I can think of as anything good the Grisaia anime might bring us in the end, because at least on its own it remains one of the absolute worst adaptations in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we can only pray that 8bit are going to do a slightly better job at adapting the remaining two parts of the Grisaia trilogy (Meikyuu and Rakuen) which have now been confirmed that they're *also* going to be adapted, starting spring 2015. In theory this should be a much easier job to pull off since they're significantly shorter in comparison, but I still think we should head into them with the lowest possible expectations this time around, just to be safe. It's the only way to make sure to avoid the never-ending spiral of disappointment that Kajitsu was.",

            "content": "When it comes to risk, Grisaia No Kajitsu (The Fruit of Grisaia) is no stranger to the word. Dare I say a show with based on a popular visual novel only gets a 13 episode adaptation. Take a look at some of the other popular visual novels like Little Busters and Clannad. Even with 2-cour adaptations, there are some problems with their effectiveness. So what happened with Grisaia No Kajitsu? The answer is a controversial adaptation. Or to say the least, this series is one that is a big oddball. I don\u2019t mean it necessarily in a negative fashion but one that may strike somebizarre chords.\\n\\n\r\nTo get familiarized with the adaptation, one should first realize that the anime is based on the visual novel of the same name. The VN is actually an adult game but the anime obviously obstructs more of the sexual tones of the series for more suitable viewers; although it still adapts the gimmicks of it. Nonetheless, the series makes its presence well known with the first episode. We have starring male protagonist Yuuji who wants to enroll in a normal school. He gets sent to a place called Mihama Academy by his boss JB so his wish is granted. Or is it? The thing about the school is that there are only 5 other students, or more specifically girls enrolled in it. The normalcy barrier can easily be broken down once we see some glimpses of the perhaps what\u2019s to come. Cryptic flashbacks such as a bus accident, bombing making materials, sniper rifle, and box cutter knife all offer a glimpse that the show meets more than the eye. And indeed, the show preys on a more dangerous side of academy life.\\n\\n\r\nLife at the academy isn\u2019t very simple. We have Yuuji, a male thrown into an environment where there are not many supervisors to look after them at school. To top it off, all the students are girls there from various backgrounds. Most of them also seems to be interested in Yuuji in some way although unlike a harem anime, they don\u2019t all just throw themselves at him. But what do you do when you\u2019re the new kid at school? For Yuuji, this gets tricky as he learns more about each girl. Some of them seems to have a connected past with him while others such as Yumiko wants him gone. The basis of the premise also suggests that there are specific reasons why they are enrolled there. If you put yourselves into Yuuji\u2019s shoes, it\u2019s easy to find yourself curious with the events going on throughout the series. That\u2019s because there are cryptic hints thrown there (either dialogue or actions) that suggests the school is hiding something; or perhaps the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nA main part of the show comes from the colorful cast of characters. There is one main guy (Yuuji) who is not the typical harem protagonist. He is very self-dependent and is able to maintain his cool in almost any situation. In fact, he treats almost every situation intuitively while also possessing a good judgment and control. In short, Yuuji is the type of guy that thinks before he acts. This trait of his seems to land him into situations with other girls as they also judge him. In particular, Yumiko is the most prominent of the group who declares that she \u2018will not accept him\u2019. The show chronicles each of the other girls who interacts with him in their specific story arcs. (in the visual novel known as routes) The problem though is how they are rushed and condensed in a format in which some cases are unacceptable. Yumiko is a strong example of this with her route being shortened to a single episode. In this case, her relationship dynamics with Yuuji is severely cut to a point of being non-existent. Luckily, this isn\u2019t always the case as other routes highlights more of their moments. They also seem to focus a similar path in ways of problem, plan, and solution. Every arc/route does resolve in some way with Yuuji playing a prominent role.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the stories of the girls, we find out that each of them have some sort of tragic past. Rather than telling their story, the series shows it with precision. And by that, I mean getting directly involved. Yuuji strives to help the other girls get through whatever problem they have regardless the consequences. This is clearly seen when Yuuji takes daring risks to help Michiru dealing with the loss of a friend or protecting Makina from assassination. The moral is that Yuuji is a guy who can be depended on and the girls seems to appreciate his deed in kind. For a special case of Amane\u2019s arc, Yuuji learns of a secret from years ago that has some connections to his family. While he isn\u2019t directly present in such the arc, it still provides the viewers with the fact that Yuuji can provide emotional support and later on get involved during the present timeline. The past isn\u2019t easy to deal with after all especially once you\u2019ve seen this show and realize how tragic some of the girls\u2019 pasts are.\\n\\n\r\nOn a scale of 1-10, this show\u2019s generic traits for the girls would rank pretty high. I don\u2019t say this as neither a backlash or complement though; at least not with the way the show is advertised. Each of the girls have different personalities. Amane could be labeled as the talkative and flirty type who also plays a guardianship role of the other girls. Then, we got the lone wolf Yumiko who is almost the exact opposite of Amane. Michiru would be a fake tsundere although some people could see her act far too die-hard to be like one. There\u2019s also the childish girl known as Makina who really needs someone to take care of her. And finally, we get the oblivious yet very polite maid Sachi. Get the general kind of picture now? Some may dare say that it would be like a dream come true to live at the academy like Yuuji is. But on the surface, this type of setup screams clich\u00e9 that can test the patience of some fans. It also doesn\u2019t take long to realize there\u2019s romance in the show; some more noticeable than others. Unfortunately, most of this isn\u2019t characterized too strongly by the length of the show. There are some noticeable parts that can be emphasized especially in regards to relationships. However, it just feels like important parts are cut out or should be there to raise the focus of such relationships. There is also less focus on some of the themes in the show. One other question raised is in regards to the symbolism found with the fruits. The tree that seems to symbolize the Garden of Eden while the fruits suggests that each of the girls relates to their personalities. Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be up to the viewers to decide how to interpret these symbolisms. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is surprisingly well done on most parts even for a studio like 8-bit. They had time to prepare the budget after the announcement of the anime adaptation after over a year prior. The series has a unique way with a movie feature like format to enhance the overall quality. For the characters, each of them are designed well to fit with their personalities. While being inferior to their VN counterparts, I would say it\u2019s mostly consistent. The setting is also highlighted well with the high class designs of some of the interior rooms and structures. Not only that but we also get action in the series as well thanks to Yuuji. His kickass attitude brings an action flick in particular with a route involving Makina. On another note, the show does have brutality and fan service. Sexual suggestive scenarios are also present with characters like Amane (*see pillow humping scene). This show might not be Makoto Shinkai level with its artwork but still remains strong in the department\\n\\n\r\nOn most parts, soundtrack is above average. The OP song offers foreshadowing and a catchy way of giving each character some spotlight. Similarly, there are various ED songs for each arc featuring each of the girls (from both past and present). With the tragic pasts of the girls, you\u2019d also have to expect a good voice acting team to play their roles. Luckily, the original voice actors and actresses does that from the game. They reprise the roles of the characters to bring them to life with adequacy. There are some problems occasionally with the way the tone of voice that are done though. In particular, Makina and Michiru can be annoying to watch while even Yuuji can seem dull at times. The good part relates to the humor done with the dialogues. Mix in that with emotions and you get a balanced tone backed with a soundtrack. It\u2019s a decent resonance of the two halves to balance out the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith just 13 episodes, don\u2019t come into expecting a strong story with clever characterization. What you get is a bold story that takes risks with the characters. It\u2019s weighty with the way Yuuji\u2019s role is carried out in each of the arcs in this adaptation. And although some relationships aren\u2019t as strong as the others, the show does emphasize on creative scenarios without rising a big question mark in the end. Still, do be aware that the series showcases some of the most generic tendencies from the get-go. Rushed is also another word that\u2019s no stranger in this series\u2019 vocabulary. In the end, it\u2019s an adaptation that could have been better but still can offer some moments to remember.\\n\\n\r\nNote: it has been confirmed that the series is getting sequels so expect expansions on this season later on.\\n",

Before I starting to watch this, I heard many great things about the Visual Novel. Many people say it's a masterpiece. So, I started to watch with great things imagined in my mind. But after finishing it, I think I drowned into the same swamp again...\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is a story about a group of 6 teenagers (5 girls and 1 boy) that have a problem in their life. They cannot go to the regular school because of the problem. Well,I really don't know what to say about the story besides \"unfocused storyline and full of flaw\". Although I didn't play the Visual Novel, but I know that many plot devices that not exist in the anime. It is really poorly executed and wrecked. Grisaia no Kajitsu is another Visual Novel that failure in story execution. And they still putting fan service while the story is almost faded\\n\\n\r\nI do not say many things about the animation, it's just great. Also, the background reminds me of Angel Beats. And the sound settings was decent\\n\\n\r\nAnd like they said, too much focusing in one point is a suicide bomb  Grisaia no Kajitsu main focus is in the character development, almost all of the main character have their development. But having the character development in all main character not guarantee the character became deep. People say is more concerned with process than results. Well, we have the results, but the process is abstract and full of a question mark in it. This makes the character development not perfectly done well, and such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the enjoyment we have is see-saw. The feelings are mixed up, the enjoyment shine in the Amane Suou route which is the best route. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that is Grisaia all about, a highly anticipated anime but full of flaws here and there. In the end, it's just another Visual Novel that loses its storyline but did decent in character development. Is it recommended? Maybe...., but don't throw high hope for this...\\n",

Saying you'll only watch one more episode but by the time you're done, you've watched them all! This is just the Anime that does exactly that! It is a gem among stones, and this is one review Ihad to write because I do not agree with how poorly people have been rating this Anime. \\n\\n\r\n     The synopsis or description does little justice for the actual story within the anime, the story is far more rich as you continue watching. This Anime touches upon serious topics which is why some people rate this anime so low; pain, death, rape, incest...you could possibly find it all in Grisaia no Kajitsu. Even though this anime has it's comedic moments and a dose of ecchi moments, it doesn't take away from the serious tone for which this anime should be focused on.\\n\\n\r\n     The story revolves around our protagonist Yuuji and his 5 female classmates whom he meets after transferring into the school. Throughout the anime, he helps each one with the problems that they've accrued in their early lives and becomes closer to each one. Each background differs and each one brings its own serious topic, including Yuuji's own background for which is truly sad.\\n\\n\r\n     This anime in a sense is a masterpiece hidden among popular titles. It takes on serious topics and does it right, it's not afraid to challenge the industry, and it's a breath of fresh air from all the typical anime out there. I can honestly say I love this anime now, and I am really looking forward to season 2. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Be it for the dorky humour or the sporadic bouts of humanity in the individual routes, Grisaia no Kajitsu enstablished itself as a force in the otaku world strongly enough to pique my curiosity and get enough funds for anime projects.\r\nThe first adaptation covers the story of the first game and all five routes, but it is immediately evident that the series is cheaply made for a quick cash grab. Recycled backgrounds, vital parts of the story missing to fit screen time, rushed pacing and incomplete characterization aren't going to be noticed by VN readers exclusively, but casual watchers as well. \r\nFundamentally, it's the samething as the novel: Yuuji is still a one man army when he needs to be, and the cast is still a relatively standard set of girls (tsundere, loli, onee-san, kuudere and maid), but it doesn't really work because of the reduced screen time, and if the novel was nothing special itself, the adaptation is even less competent at being a harem with touches of drama and shares the fate of many incomplete VN adaptations. Watch only if you have at least a passing interest in girls with dark pasts or if you care about the latest popular franchise.",

            "content": "I have a more updated review on my website. You can go there by going to my MAL profile and clicking on the website link in the details section. I will not be directly linking the updated review here because of the MAL review guidelines.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu.\r\nRenowned as one of the best visual novels ever to be concieved, the first of the Grisaia trilogy finally received an anime adaption with the collaboration of animation studio 8bit, and Front Wing, the creator of the Grisaia trilogy. When I first heard of this adaption, I was beyond ecstatic. My favourite visual novel was getting a proper (atthe time) anime adaption. Why wouldn't I be thrilled? Well, I can safely say now that this anime adaption doesn't exist, at least in my eyes. If you would like to find out my reasoning for this claim, then continue reading.\\n\\n\r\n### WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME ADAPTION AND MINOR SPOILERS FOR THE VN BELOW ###\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, let's start with the first episode. The first episode of this anime adaption was fantastic, to put it simply. They introduced the characters very nicely, provided a mysterious aura for the protagonist (Yuuji), and expanded upon the fact that every student in Mihama Accademy has had some sort of psychological trauma in their past. After watching the first episode, I had very high hopes for the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time, the episode count of the adaption was not known / confirmed yet. But, everyone who has played the VN prior to the anime adaption (including me) was pretty much certain that it would have been a 2-cour series (22-24 episodes). It made absolutely no sense for 8bit to adapt the whole of Grisaia no Kajitsu, a 50 hour+ visual novel, into a 1-cour series (11-13 episodes). If they did go along with a 1-cour series, then they would have to cut out tons of content, rewrite key events and plot points, and skip on a lot of the monologue that made Grisaia no Kajitsu so popular in the first place. Sounds crazy right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, what do you know, 8bit surprises us (or didn't surprise us) with a 1-cour series. At that point in time, the third episode had aired, and I started to feel a tinge of doubt for the series. The first 3 episodes that had aired were amazing. They adapted the common route with much of the original humour that was found in the VN to begin with, and they included many of the character-developing scenes that made you love the characters, and then have your heart crushed in their respective routes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing the news of the adaption being a 1-cour, or 13 episode series, I tried to be optimistic about the situation. 8bit could of course, instead of adapting the whole of Grisaia no Kajitsu, adapt just one route in full. That plan could have worked brilliantly. The first 7-8 episodes could have been common route to build up the characters, and then the remaining 5-6 episodes could have been a certain character's route. So, that's the mindset that I went with up until the 4th episode, where everything came crashing down.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth episode, to put into layman terms, took my hopes and dreams of the series, stomped on them a few times, ripped them to shreds, tied them back together improperly, threw them out a window, and then left to rot on the street. Okay, that may have been a bit of exaggeration, but you get the point. Never have I been so disappointed with any animation studio before that fourth episode. A comment on the subreddit /r/anime by the user /u/Tenoia explained my frustration pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the fourth episode relatively confirmed that the remaining 9 episodes of the anime adaption would consist of each of the 5 character's respective routes, but condensed into 1-4 episode arcs. That was the /worst case/ scenario 8bit could have gone with. I mean, they gave themselves 13 episodes to toy with, and they decide to adapt each route into a condensed, sub-par copy of their source? The absurdity came crashing down on top of me that I could have suffocated under its weight. Each route in the visual novel has /hours/ of dialogue, and they suggested that they would take those hours, strip it bare, cut out character-building scenes, redo key events, and hand it to you on a silver platter.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that point, I didn't have many high hopes for the remainder of the series. The 6th and 7th episodes consisted of Yumiko's route, /completely/ redone and condensed into a single episode, and Sachi's route also condensed into a single episode. Much of the emotional buildup in either adapted route was thoroughly missing, while the monologue and some key events were altogether non-existent. The 8th and 9th episodes consisted of a 2-part arc of Makina's route, and to be honest, 8bit actually did a relatively good job on its adaption. They combined the good and bad endings, and removed the dreadfully tragic nature of the either ending that was present in the visual novel, but overall, they explained into Yuuji's past nicely, and kept most of the key events.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes consisted of Amane's route, a.k.a Angelic Howl. Angelic Howl is very well known to be the best part of the entirety of the Grisaia no Kajitsu VN, and I can definitely agree with that consensus. It's hard to explain exactly why many feel this way if you haven't experienced the sequence yourself, but to put it simply, it explained Amane's backstory in a very thrilling, tragic, dark, and dreadful nature that forced you to sympathise with the characters' struggles. It also went into 2nd best girl's backstory a fair bit (Kazuki), but I'll skip that portion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the last episode, which so happened to air today, concluded the adaption. To be completely honest, they made me WTF hard after combining the good and bad ending in this final episode, and /then/ moving the ending bit with Sakashita in the forest, to Sakashita in the school. That bit upset me at first, because the forest chase in the end of Amane's route is one of the best parts, aside from Angelic Howl. But, in the adaption, they made it take place in the school instead of the forest, and instead of a chase scene, Sakashita is holding the classmates hostage while taunting Amane. The whole attempted rape scene also completely caught me off guard. But, after thinking about it, the ending that they route instead of the VN's ending wasn't /that/ bad. It just was out of the blue, as the forest chase scene would have made more sense.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10. Too many key scenes are missing, the emotional buildup of the routes was overall lacking, and the sub-par rewrite of Yumiko's route altogether made too much of an bad impact on the series as a whole for me to give it anything other than a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: 6/10. Many people don't like or find the adaption's art and animation appalling, but I actually thought it was slightly better than average. It kept the amazing feel and quality of the VN's artwork, while retaining a unique look that doesn't find itself in many anime series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10. When the first episode came along, I was extremely happy to hear that 8bit was using the original soundtrack from the VN. The visual novel's soundtrack is one of the best there is, so that definitely helped with the overall buildup of some scenes. But, to put it simply, they overused some tense tracks that were designed to only play in scenes of great distress or disorder. Two of these would be \u300c\u30ab\u30b5\u30d6\u30bf\u300d (Kasabuta), and \u300c\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u300d (Deadlock). They also remixed some tracks into pieces that made no sense, and the transitions between some tracks were atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10. I feel genuinely sorry for those of you who didn't read the VN beforehand. The anime adaption almost didn't build the characters /at all/, and they just threw the character's circumstances at you when their route was playing. 8bit didn't give you any time whatsoever to come to love a character in full, which is mainly the fault of the common route's overall length (3 episodes). If I hadn't have read the VN before watching this anime adaption, I would have thought Sachi was a terrorist with a very stoic personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10. The only time I can say I enjoyed this anime adaption to a sub-par degree was the first 3 episodes (common route), Makina's route (episodes 8 and 9), and Amane's route / Angelic Howl (episodes 10 - 13). Other than that, the whole of this anime adaption did not please me in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'm deeply sorry if you had to go through all of my ranting, but I personally believe I have a very good reason to be upset with this adaption as a whole. I'm sure many others feel the same as I do, but if you enjoyed this adaption regardless of it's many flaws, then continue to live that way, because I wish I could enjoyed this as much as you did.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my long rant of a review, and I hope you have a Happy New Year!",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying, Grisaia is NOT a harem. Well, you kinda get that harem-y feel on the first few episodes, but it is actually not. I was actually surprised that this anime received a lot of hate from the community. I actually loved this anime. I will now explain why I enjoyed it.\r\nSTORY -6\r\nTBH, this anime doesn't have that much story. It doesn't have a proper plot other than a guy moves in to a school for girls. But it's more than meets the eye. This anime's plot is about our MC trying to make the girls get over their past problems,to allow them to move forward, to be able to get past their problems. This anime is not for people who likes to have a REALLY deep story.\\n\\n\r\nArt -8\\n\r\nThis anime has an art style which reminds me of the theatre. But with HD features. The art style is normal, and the character design is pretty, bt all it does is just pushes the audience to think that these characters are just really your normal highschool students. These artstyles suits me best, and for some reason I grew attached to the animation in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound -8\\n\r\nThe sound doesn't have anything THAT special, but the reason I picked 8 is because the backing music is awesome. I didn't give this a 9 because the VA is nothing special, but a special shoutout goes to Yuuji's VA. It suits his character well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9\\n\r\nThis is the main selling point of Grisaia. The reason is that they have their own uniqe traits and pasts. Not only that but they deal with it. They try to move forward. Their personality is different from one another, making them uniqe and I've not found a character that I hated in this anime. It's a pretty nice and amazing ride just because of the interactions from one chara to another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10\\n\r\nWell, this is a bit weird since I'm not used to these types of anime. But for some reason I enjoyed it. I watched this anime and finished it in a day. I just plain out loved this anime, but I admit, it's not the best anime EVER, It's just an anime worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -9\\n\r\nThis anime is for those who seek character development in animes. For those who likes chara development, you will like it, love it, and eat it. Arigatou.\\n",

            "content": "May 2014, Grisaia no Kajitsu is officially announced to be receiving an anime adaptation. Fans of the Visual Novel are excited to see how Juicy this animated Yuuji can be. But fans are also apprehensive, as it is being adapted by Studio 8bit. The same 8bit that butchered the adaptation of another fairly popular Visual Novel title not so long ago (Walkure Romanze), however people were hopeful that maybe, this time round, they learnt their lesson. Well did they?\r\nShort answer: not so much. Long answer...\r\nWell I certainly was hopeful after the 1st episode, which did a fantastic job of introducing all the important characters theviewers will eventually follow. Characters that break the mould of the typical 1-dimensional cardboard cut-outs, you usually find in your average Highschool Harem. Where you cannot just label a character simply as a \"Tsundere\", \"Kuudere\" or \"Dandere\" and say that's all there is too them. Because even our generic male protagonist is opted for a more intriguing stoic individual, where you cannot help but wonder how he came to be the way he is (Unfortunately the series does little to explain this). And to top things off, the voice acting turned out to be quite superb, with the VAs able to portray their respective roles so well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet I could not wholeheartedly enjoy the series. Mind you the comedy is fantastic, both intentional with its character interactions and unintentional with the haphazard developments. However it is the latter which creates one of the numerous flaws with the story.\\n\\n\r\nLike in any VN adaptation, the first couple episodes are dedicated to the common route, where a lot of the \"intentional comedy\" takes place. Yet the story at this point tends to jump around, taking random events from the original source material and plopping them wherever it pleases the director. This causes the story to lack some much needed connecting tissue and unfortunately it only gets worse once it reaches the heroine's storyline. That is when the story shifts from 2nd gear straight into 5th, bringing with it breakneck speed pacing, but with it damaging the engine the drives any emotion you may feel towards the characters. Yumiko & Sachi's route suffering the most damage, where it sped through 7+ hours worth of story into single episodes. At least they did not completely ruin Amane's route but that's not much of a consolation when even her storyline is marred by pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noticeable issue is with the show's animation, which at first, looks quite alright with its vibrant backgrounds & character designs. But that makes it easy to notice where they cut corners. Just pay attention to any scene a character is animated walking/running and whenever a vehicle is involved.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I find it hard to review Grisaia no Kajitsu as a standalone anime series, as this so happens to be my favourite VN (so far) and it's the main reason why I'd rate the \"sound\" so highly. But I cannot help for agree with this particular comment I noticed in the forums: \"The people involved in this are obviously professional butchers and Grisaia was another piece of juicy meat for them to chop up.\" Because I saw how they were butchering the routes, by taking chunks of the VN \"they\" deem \"most important\" and cramming them into a 1-cour anime series. Thus creating a series that fans of the VN will not fully enjoy and non-fans will struggle to follow, due to its breakneck pacing. Nonetheless I can say that I enjoyed the series enough to give it this score. Does this mean I'll watch the sequels? Heck No! I'll just wait for those VNs to come out on Steam.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu is based on the adult visual novel that follows 5 female students at Mihama Academy. However, this is no ordinary school; only those 5 students are enrolled here, each with \"special reasons\" for being in an academy that seems more like a prison. Kazami Yuuji, a mysterious \"exchange student from Canada\", becomes the first male student enrolled in Mihama Academy. Although he claims to desire a normal school life, events of the students' past start to unfold, piece by piece. Just who really are these students? The girls must revisit their past and take hold of their lives for another time. \r\nIwas honestly very interested by Grisaia no Kajitsu, knowing that many of my friends recommended me to read the visual novel. Seeing that an anime of the series was to be released this season, I decided to go and see if the anime will entice me enough to spend time reading the VN. As I watched this series, such friends were able to let me know the differences between the anime and VN, so I can represent two parties in this review. However, does Grisaia please the VN readers as well as newcomers to the series? Sadly, this is NOT the case. Rather than showing off why this series is strong and emotional, it turned out to be incredibly disappointing, and the adaptation in short is a trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are a few positives about the series, the sound and art are consistent and actually pretty well-done. The seiyuus from the PSP version of the series come back to do their individual roles. Most of the roles are well-done and solidly depict their character. Maon Kurosaki's \"Rakuen no Tsubasa\" is a pretty nice opening theme, and it's a song I'd definitely listen to on a regular basis. There are a whole bunch of ending songs to this series, all of which are decent, especially \"Rainy Veil\" by Yanagi Nagi. Best part of the series? Probably, and that's somewhat unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing extraordinary, but gets the job done nonetheless. Nothing particularly enticing or awe-inspiring, but the art is at least consistent and there are hardly any moments where the quality noticeably drops. Give 8-bit credit that this is really the only part where they have put noticeable effort into the series, which particularly includes putting much of their animation budget into unnecessary flashy panty shots and a couple of long H-scene-like kiss scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually very interesting from the start, each having incredibly unique personalities. From the blond twintail tsundere (Michiru), the quiet and cold lady (Yumiko), the obedient pink-haired maid (Sachi), the loli with the dirty mouth (Makina), the red haired perverted \"onee-san\" figure (Amane), and the enigmatic male lead (Yuuji), it's very likely that you'll like one of these characters, and that's understandable. So what is the problem about the series? The problem starts not on the characters themselves, but how Grisaia decided to develop their individual characters. This is where most of the positives end. \\n\\n\r\nGrisaia attempts to mimic the visual novel by showing all the possible routes of the series, totalling to a whopping 80 hours of gameplay, and throwing it into a 13-episode anime adaptation. Now you don't have to be a mathematician to know that 5 girls = 5 possible routes, and by logic, cramming 80 hours into a 4 hour series simply cannot be done without sacrifices. However, the sacrifices Grisaia made were far too severe, and turned into a huge mess. After 3 episodes of introducing the female mains with fanservice and panty shots (at least that was pretty good, actually), classic school genre humour, and brief hints on each student's past, the series has 10 episodes to do 5 routes. Although the first 3 episodes were well-done, this is where pacing becomes a concerning issue that plagues the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEach route in the visual novel follows one of the female students and the male lead and her have various interactions. By these interactions, a traumatizing past rears its head back to a particular female lead after an event in the present. The anime attempts to show all the routes of the female leads in the order presented above. However, two episodes is just simply not enough time to fully develop a character without feeling incredibly rushed. Some of the main female characters even only get a single episode to represent their route, which is even more unreasonable. Grisaia made an attempt to make the viewer feel emotional about the female student in question during their particular route. But in the end, it almost felt like a race to see who can \"develop\" a character in the shortest time possible. Simply put, events that supposedly trigger emotions are thrown at the viewer in quick succession, and before you can swallow what just happened, the anime is already miles ahead of you, and completely different events start happening. Suddenly, the route ends off, almost like one of your coworkers that get off of work RIGHT on the dot at 5PM, and no later. The character in question finds her resolve, but you really can't feel anything for the character just because the character development was so rushed. Grisaia would be a horrible relay partner, because they would just go ways ahead of you doing its own thing, while you bite the dust and never even get a chance to catch your breath. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a huge shame because I really did like the characters in the series at first. Their base character before their route is very nice, and their character after their develop is good too, even if you have not a clue how they got there. However, the problem is when the character is being developed themselves. It's possible to feel incredibly sickened and shocked by the context and background information Grisaia gives you for a particular event (Episode 12), but it's strange that one can feel almost no pity for the spotlight character themselves. Worst of all, some of the main characters don't get much spotlight throughout the whole series, and feel more like a harem piece, if anything, just because they don't have substance to back up their character. Goes to show the lack of direction the character development has in the series. And it's not just the main characters that experience this problem. Motifs of the side characters are incredibly unclear and underdeveloped, and you question their position and why they are relevant in the first place. They don't exactly help build the story as they should do, which is another letdown of the series. The anime also skips a huge portion of each route just to cram it in the little time they give it, leaving viewers confused on how things jump from place to place. And a huge blow for VN readers, Grisaia decides to butcher up parts of the story in attempt to solve the time limit and end it \"how they wanted it to end\", a disappointment for those expecting the story to stay true to the original series.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is also very patchy and confusing in many instances; questions are answered in awkward fashion, and it's very noticeable that it's due to the time constraint 8-bit put themselves in. Yuuji, for one, can somehow can lead thought A to thought E, while skipping potential thoughts that normally people would think of making it even more difficult to follow. Yuuji himself is a character that has little development, which is incredibly unfortunate. I know that compared to the rest of the main cast, he should not the main focus, but viewers just really know he's not your \"average student\" that does \"dirty work in the undergrounds\". Unfortunately, aside from some appearances from his boss and coworkers, not much was given about Yuuji's past at all. He really doesn't have much else other than being a classic OP character that can solve everyone's problems. Why he does this to ruin his \"normal school life\" is not something that's explained at all, and nothing in the series would change the fact that Yuuji is a relatively bland character right from the start. I guess Spring 2015's \"Le Eden de la Grisaia\" will focus on this, huh? \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, what took the last bit of hope from this series for me was how some scenes were meant to be incredibly dark and serious to build an unimaginable tragic past and see a character's internal struggles and emotions. However, it almost as if 8-bit wants to make a fool of themselves, and make Grisaia more of a laughing stock, if anything. Just as they unveil dark imagery and psychological themes, they throw in a panty shot, or an intense and passionate kissing scene. This is supposed to be a psychological series, and based on the core that was established, there are definitely some potential to make this series interesting, dark and meaningful. Instead, it almost feels like it's a parody of the series rather than being a serious adaptation, while being incredibly unfortunate that such money is completely wasted in enhancing these unnecessary scenes instead of properly planning out the story and actually develop the lead characters. If the adaptation company themselves can't take the whole development and tragic past seriously, why should the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this series, I really tried to. And I'll admit, there were at least some few parts that I did enjoy, mostly from the first few episodes, and maybe the final episode too. But it doesn't save the gongshow that happened for the rest of the adaptation. It was an okay effort by 8-bit to condense 5 routes in less than 4 hours. Perhaps you'll feel something for a character, but it sure didn't last long for me. Maybe my expectations were too high going into the series, but in the end of the day, I was pretty disappointed by how this series was handled. It had the huge potential to be much better, but alas, it tried to do too much all at once, and failed to properly execute anything at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Grisaia is a half-baked summary of the VN series that fails to please the majority of the target audience. VN readers and fans will be incredibly disappointed by how little substance the adaptation kept from the original series, while newcomer fans like myself will feel confused while experiencing little emotions for most of the characters. The pacing and character development is absolutely atrocious, to be blunt, and doesn't allow time for the viewer to absorb any events that occur. Is it the worst anime ever? Of course not. But there's just too much missed potential that makes this series go to waste. Grisaia the adaptation can be summed in one word: disappointment. If you have read the visual novel, please save yourself and not watch this dreadful series. And if you are a newcomer to the series, you would do yourself a favour by not spoiling a more worthwhile experience of reading the superior visual novel. Will season 2 be a much more worthwhile sequel, or just another letdown? We shall see...",

            "content": "As far as genre goes Grisaia no Kajitsu is probably one of the best in its field, as long as the genre is action, school life, comedy, romance goes. \r\nThe story begins with Yuuji being a mysterious transfer student coming into a new school. Also mysterious as in I don't trust this dude he's probably some badass who can kick my ass, not a Persona protagonist. Fitting his persona the school also seems to be special in the sense only five female students attend. Each of these five girls seems to have some kind of tragic back story as implied in episode 1. (Is thisshow saying men can't have trauma's? I mean maybe Yuuji, but he doesn't seem like it.) \\n\\n\r\nNow as a reminder this is based off a visual novel, so it uses the same anime adaptation set up that consists of each of the girls being helped one by one. Along with that fact this is a visual novel which I have been told is quite popular and it only has 13 episodes isn't a reason to complain at all. I feel anime adaptation are mainly used as a means to draw in more people to the game. (I haven't played it by the way.) If they wanted to tell the whole story like with Clannad, they'd need a lot of money. Remember Clannad I believe still holds the record for best selling visual novel. (Clannad came out ten years ago by the way.) So it isn't surprising that they can't match it. Dangan Ronpa (my favorite game) was the best seller for its year and look at its anime. Same with Persona 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters begin as shallow and 2D (Its odd people complain about this since it is fiction? I mean yeah I fall in love with them, and I like realistic characters as well, but still its like getting mad at someone for being real.) however as each arc ends they go from annoying stereotypes to interesting, well developed characters. My only complaint is not everyone got a arc. Pink haired, maid didn't get any love from the company and remain 2D along with onii-chan girl. (Yeah onii-chan had a interesting back story, but still pretty generic development wise.)\\n\\n\r\nArt work was great. It was fun, and really did a good job at freaking me out. Its been awhile since I was freaked out. Probably hasn't been like this Mirai Nikki, or Corpse Party and those were more plot than art. The art along with the plot gave off a great feeling. Also since this is based off an Adult visual novel who doesn't love fan service and busty women rolling around on beds. I know I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nI always have trouble when it comes to the music section. Especially since I listen to the songs once, or twice then skip. (Sorry Froggy-kun. I know I'm supposed to sing along to watch anime correctly, but being a student it isn't easy managing time and work.) The bgm didn't stand out, but I guess its did its job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed tuning every week to see what happened next with each arc, and whose arc was to follow. This anime is for visual novel adaptation fans everywhere, along with any one who enjoys the sick and twisted, traumatic side of humanity.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have to admit, there were parts of this story where I laughed my butt of, and other parts where I almost threw up because it started addressing several of my biggest fears in a very effective manner. \r\nWhen it comes to the story, overall it has a typical visual novel type of pacing. The main character solves the problems of one girl, then moves on to the next girl. This is very typical in VN adaptations, though in Grisaia's case it's the content that makes the story interesting to watch. Yes, you may get tired of knowing that the main character can somehow solvethe problem of any girl and have most of them fall for him in the process, but if you can get used to that then there's a lot more to this anime. \\n\r\nSometimes this anime is pretty funny, but when episode 4 arrives, it tones the comedy down a bit in favor to staying serious when it should be. It doesn't try to lighten the mood with jokes, but rather lets the atmosphere stay dark until we step back into the light. This makes the drama all the more engaging because it's not trying too hard. \\n\r\nThe romance, though it is there, it is not really addressed too much. It also contains a certain amount of ecchi, but not so much that it becomes very distracting.. That is except the OVA.. \\n\r\nThey don't really gloss over the cruel things happening in this anime, but rather shows you as much as possible without having to censor everything. This anime is not afraid to tell you that what is already pretty bad, can, and will, get even worse. I'm not kidding when I say this: This anime triggered my claustrophobia twice and I had to stop the episode for a little while before being able to continue. And this may be what turned some people off in this anime. It shows some pretty sexual scenes and some really twisted images. It's hard to get into it if you came for a typical VN type of story. Many people don't like the VN type of pacing either, so it's not the best story, though far from the worst. \\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm comparing this anime with a VN a lot, but it's honestly what it felt like I was watching. This anime didn't truly manage to go from VN to anime, but it tried at least. \\n\\n\r\nIt's in the characters that most of this shows strengths lies. Though most of the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts of typical anime characters, like the tsundere, maid, rich girl, loli and big boobed tomboy, what makes these character so interesting is their twisted backstories. Each character has a severe trauma from the past that still haunts them to this day, and they are all pretty messed up. Heck, even our main protagonist Yuuji has a really dark past that we don't really get to see all that much of (see Grisaia no Meikyuu and Grisaia no Rakuen). Speaking of our main character, it's refreshing to finally see a male main character who is not a typical nice guy with no unique personality. He's cynical, funny and has no idea how normal life works. He can sometimes come off as robot-like, though he does show some emotion when needed. He's also incredibly smart, though very bad at taking a hint. \\n\r\nIn this anime all girls are wearing the mask of a cardboard cutout character, when they're actually very broken people. I won't go into specifics on each character, but each girl's problems is not just a common childhood trauma or attitude issues, some of them are seriously messed up. It brings up themes like double personalities, rape, incest, suicide, insanity and abuse, and it does so without mercy. It becomes the Yuuji's job to rip off that mask and glue their real self back together. When you see what's behind the mask, that's when it gets really interesting. The change they go through is often very realistic. Tough most of them go back to their cartboard cutout by the end of their storyline, the changes are still visible. You feel the characters pain and truly wish for them to get a happy ending. \\n\r\nThe \"villains\" are also very well thought out. They all have legitimate motivations for doing what they are doing, and they aren't just there to be evil. \\n\\n\r\nArtwise I enjoyed it to a certain extent. It, again, had a very VN type of design, and more than often it felt like I was playing a VN. I didn't mind it all too much, but I still wish it would have gone a bit more out of that VN comfort zone. The visuals and symbolism is pretty to look at, and the scenery is not that bad. The art is also very, how should I say this.. Shiny. Light can reflect from anything in this anime. It got a bit distracting at times, but there were also times when it was very beautiful. It likes to play with contrasts, which makes everything really pop out, and is quite pleasant to look at. The colors are vibrant and can be distracting at times, but I still liked it quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nIn the music department, the opening is catchy, but nothing very special. It feels like your everyday drama/harem opening and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. \\n\r\nThere are 4 endings overall, ranging from upbeat and happy to calm and sad. Sometimes it doesn't really fit the darker atmosphere this anime often has, but I grew surprisingly fond of them. Especially the fourth ending, which is a very calm and beautiful song. If you should check out any of the songs, I would say to check out that one. \\n\r\nI would also talk about the OST, but I had a hard time finding it online, so I'll just say that nothing really stood out too much, but it wasn't all that bad either. It fit the atmosphere, but it wasn't something all that special. \\n\\n\r\nI do have mixed feelings about this anime. After the two times my claustrophobia was triggered, and the fact that I honestly almost threw up during the last storyline, it's hard for me to decide how much I really liked it. I thought the images was pretty, the storylines were engaging and the drama was very well balanced, so I want to say I really liked it. And, actually, I will say it. I did really enjoy most of this anime. It's dark atmosphere mixed with drama, action, comedy and some ecchi was just interesting to watch. I liked that they showed everything and weren't afraid of showing us very messed up situations. It's unpredictable to a certain extent, though it does feel like a VN. It may just be that I'm a wimp, but still, beware if you have a weak stomach or claustrophobia. \\n\\n\r\nIs this anime a must watch? Not really. Its strength lies in its dark and twisted character backgrounds and it can be very engaging and emotional, though you have to get used to the VN type of pacing and some pretty messed up stuff. If you enjoy this kind of story and setting, kind of like a really dark and weird version of Clannad, then go watch it. \\n",

            "content": "I really thought they had potential when the anime began but alas, it wasn't meant to be. That being said, it still has a few strengths that included interesting characters, and acceptable art.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was rushed. They had short episodes for each girls. This wasn't enough to know the full story of each girls. We just know the major points of their story. That is it. There are very many things they could have expanded on. Watching this series was like reading a chapter summary at Sparksnotes ten minutes before your next class. \r\nWhile we know the general idea of what is going on, mostof the events seems very forced. It's as if it just happened because it happened. There was no reason for it to happen. There are many unnecessary fanservices that doesn't contribute to the story. These wasted time could have been used to flesh out each of the girl's story some more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion for each route are disappointing as well.  Because the story was rushed, there were no lead-up to the climax and to the conclusion. It's as if it just happened. It's like a hurricane that just got in the middle of your street with no weather forecast of it happening\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWe have the emotionless overpowered sniper boy. That is all there is to the main character. While we got inside of his mind a few times in the series, that really wasn't enough to relate to him, or to learn why he acts the way he do. It is as if he's just a device to help each girls through their routes, the ignition to all their solutions. I really wanted to know more about Yuuji. No, not about him having a big uber rectangular ass but more on why he has such a straight face. I want to know why he's a sniper, and why he can read each girls well. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girls in the series have their own interesting personalities. This is one strength of the anime. The problem is that more could have been done. I couldn't really get into one of the characters story because they were bland. It's like having a friend walk up to you and they tell you their life story. It's unpolished, it sounds unfinished, and most of all, the story seems to go all over the place with no build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't grow at all throughout the series. If they did grow, it's in a snap of a finger when they suddenly realize that they should grow up and think of another way. The only thing that we learned about the characters is their past and why they act that way. We don't know much about how they will become. We can just assume that they will grow because of the protagonist. In the end, we still have retarded Michiru, we still have not so friendly Yumiko, we still have child-like behaviour Makina, we still have quiet and takes everything literally Saki, and the big tittied slut Amane. Most importantly, Yuuji is still a one-faced character.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, even if the characters are interesting, there needs more work to be done in order for them to be dynamic. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe good thing about this series is that we see the characters come to life. This is at least one thing we can be thankful for. While the art isn't next level artwork, it is still acceptable. It's pretty much the art that is in the Visual Novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe anime used the exact same OST used in the Visual Novel. The first few episodes had some glaring issues with sound timing. Overall it was okay but not the best.\\n\r\nThe VAs, like in the Visual Novel, did a very good job. The choice for Yuuji's voice was also superb.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were nothing memorable but they were okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you have time to waste, you will probably enjoy this. Just don't expect a fully fleshed story and characters. If you came here because of one of the tags, here are what I will say about them:\\n\r\nDrama - Expect forced dramas because of the limitation to expand on each character's decisions.\\n\r\nRomance - There are promises for romance but do not expect much. This isn't the main focus of the story.\\n\r\nHarem - Each girl got a set of episodes (1 to 4). They all developed some kind of attachment to Yuuji.\\n\r\nPsychological - This is probably in the lower tier of the psychological genre. Each of the girl's routes have a different psychological aspect to them. Even though that is the case, the story was too rushed to call this a good psychological anime.\\n\\n\r\nI found the anime below average in terms of enjoyment. Most parts of the anime just became boring. Its glaring issues outweighs its strengths.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThe anime is pisspoor, not only in comparison to the visual novel but also to other anime similar to this. Some anime fans can still try it to see if it's worth something. There is nothing bad with trying the first three episode. Just don't blame me if you do.",

IMAO, no, their characteristics where just made to make them look helpless like a damsel in distress and the guy is a porn star in a shining armor who come to save the day..........and afterwards he gets to bang them, or at least that's what part of the manga suggest {I have only been to some of the chapters and one of them involves Yuuji banging Amane}, so no more bull butter and here are my ratings for this anime with a Hentai atmosphere, but withnone banging  {cu'z the guy get's to do it in the manga}:\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this is the story of five bimbos of Mihama Academy, who were there to isolate themselves from the world that has given them pain and along come a guy who would help them to overcome the emotional pain that they've suffer for quite sometime. But, you know, regardless of the plot for each arc one thing was certain, and this anime's plot is the most purest of harem and quite frankly the situations and the plots were just too over seasoned with a lot of elements that makes this anime's story line too pathetic to comprehend, so it's a pathetic 1 for the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what do you see in this anime?\\n\\n\r\n-A big school that only has 6 students, which includes the guy.  \\n\\n\r\n-Very fashionable school uniforms for the girls and the guy.\\n\\n\r\n-A nice horizon and background illustration.\\n\\n\r\n-Fanservice that the dogs will howl for, oh , it also comes with Suou who is pleasuring herself in one epsiode {very indecent, and should just be limited to the manga}.\\n\\n\r\nSo with such nice illustration...hummmm, it's a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\\n\r\nI giving a 6 since I have nothing much to comment about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's go over to each of those Bimbos.\\n\\n\r\nMakina Irisu- Forget about her flashback scene, frankly, she is this just a lolicon element for the MC. Her arc with Yuuji can be describe an action element, it's just that the action element can be classified as like a 'B\" movie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKomine Sachi- Ok, so what we have is the quintessential maid girl that is usual in most harem genre, her arc is has that Psychological element, where it is best describe as 'STUPID.\" Geeez, her character alone for being this forever good girls really make her a certified SUCKER.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakaki Yumiko- If this anime has that thriller element it would be her, because of her who always carrys a box cutter and not afraid to slash anybody she hates , also her arc was more like an old body switching thing that was used to be done in some rated 'B\" movies, her acting wasn't much that can be nominated to the Oscars, but then again no harem genre would be complete without a tsundere. But you know, I got to hand it to that girl, she is one tsundere who got owned by the guy.\\n\\n\r\n Matsushima Michiru- the quintessential, crazy girl and in general, her arc is CRAZY andwas just too over-flattering, geez how can a girl like that have a heart transplant is basically ambiguous. \\n\\n\\n\r\n Suou Amane- She is the Hentai bomb in this anime, and it would be best if you guys out there just look her up in the manga, I'm pretty sure you'll wanna be playing with your joysticks. Btw, about her arc, if Bear Grylls of Man Vs Wild would be watching this, I'm sure he'll saying how stupid is original creator,Front Wing is, for making a stupid survival story out of Amane's arc.  \\n\\n\r\nYuuji Kazama- what can I say, he is this prefect symbol of a knight in shinning armor who has that porn star vibe\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all the crazies, over-flattering and stupid scenarios, I won't think twice of giving this a part pathetic 1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nPoor number 3 is what I give this category, I've watch it out of curiosity as to whom the MC would picked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nGenerally it's a pathetic anime all along, I would have been much better if original creator Front Wing just made it a hentai and not something that has a hentai vibe without the banging and if it were a hentai anime, then I wouldn't have to waste my time to watch it, so my advice to the boys , just go with the manga at least  seeing the MC bang the 5 bimbos would give you guys some joy to play your winky, not that I care anyways, since I've already dropped the manga.  My rating....a 1.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was extremely surprised by this show, I was trying to find a new anime to watch and just randomly picked this from a list. when I read the synopsis I figured it would just be another ecchi/harem show and almost brushed it off. however, i looked into the show some more and decided to try it anyway. I had almost no intention of actually watching the show, i just needed something to pass the time. the first episode was okay enough and I was about to put the show down, except that the end of the first episode left enough mystery that Ihad to see what happened next. anyway, enough with the background, and on with the review! \\n\\n\r\n-story-\\n\r\n             I think the story was one of the weaker points in the show, not that it was bad, it just didn't really make sense. my biggest problem with the story was it's spacing, of the 5 heroines, each of them gets an arc. the problem was that the arcs were not even, 2 of the girls got 3+ episodes to explain everything and really flesh out their background, while the other 3 got 1-2 episodes max. overall I thought the story was intriguing enough to keep it interesting and even though it was the shows weaker point (in my opinion) it didn't do anything to seriously cripple the show\\n\\n\r\n-art-\\n\r\n            I don't have anything specific to say about the art, it seemed pretty average but it worked so smoothly that it ended up being quiet beautiful. the opening art was also very good and went with the music quiet nicely.\\n\\n\r\n-sound-\\n\r\n            I loved it, or at least the music part. the opening theme was phenomenal and while I usually skip the ending of a show after listening once to test it, I found every end theme In this show to be captivating and pleasant to listen to. As for the voices, I didn't have any particularly issues, but some of the voices were a little moe for me. \\n\\n\r\n-character- \\n\r\n                   this is were the show really shows it's strength, each of the character's get's there own story arc. each arc does a great job of creating a setting and really showing the issues that these girls carry around with them and Yuugi managing to solve it somehow. my only concern is that the characters with the shorter story arcs didn't get as fleshed out as the others\\n\\n\r\n-enjoyment-\\n\r\n                   as far as my personal enjoyment, I stated at the beginning that i was surprised with this show, while it does have some ecchi elements, they are mostly inserted briefly for comedy and don't do anything to harm the story. I loved this show because it was captivating and fun to watch and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good show.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nA common phrase that is often said is, \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" Obviously, the saying isn't meant for books alone. It's aimed at anything that may look one way, but has more to it than just a precursory glance can give. From food to movies, sometimes it requires one to fully understand what truly lies behind the object. This particular expression can also be applied to people. The way one acts, thinks, and wishes to be perceived are all byproducts of the past that has created him or her. In certain cases, one's outward appearancesdon't match the real person hiding within. In Grisaia no Kajitsu, such a statement contains almost too much truth.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn Grisaia, main lead Yuuji transfers to a new school filled with only five other students: Makina, Sachi, Michiru, Yumiko, and Amane. While the girls all seem quite normal, what lies beneath their visible demeanor is more than just cuteness and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Grisaia begins, it comes off as rather strange. Its dry humor and seemingly dark atmosphere blend together quite nicely. Yuuji talking nonchalantly with the girls while dealing with their troubled pasts creates a weird feeling that permeates much of the series. This is further reinforced by the setting provided. The barren school, the special task-force, and the grim subject matters provide world-building elements that make the anime seep in a less-than-cheery sauce, providing the flavor it has. At times, though, the show prioritizes misplaced fan-service that detracts from what the anime has to offer. Now, some of it is well done: Amane masturbating in Yuuji's room defines her character or Makina starting a make-out session demonstrates her social ineptitude. But when scenes are littered with random panty-shots or more focused on boobs, it doesn't add anything to the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Grisaia may have the ability to balance hilarity and drama nicely, that doesn't speak for the quality of both. More specifically, the show suffers from terrible pacing issues. The beginning of the series is rather pleasant. Characters are introduced, the world is staged, and the mood is set. Everything is primed and ready for the inevitable character exploration. However, the show fails to adequately give the cast the appropriate amount of time in which to lay their story bare. With the exception of Amane, the other girls' arcs are simply unfulfilling because not enough attention is paid to them. Attempting to cram an entire character's worth into a single episode not only does zero justice for the person in question, but also comes off as incredibly rushed. The idea, obviously, is to look at each member of the harem, regardless of screen time. While doing so addresses the entire cast, the aftereffect is a shoddy composition that is just barely held together.\\n\\n\r\nDeep down, the anime actually has a purposeful message. Each girl has a past mired in tragedy and despair that prevents them from being the person they want to be. Grisaia's tale, then, is one about moving on. Learning to accept the mistakes that were made, understanding what needs to be done now, and taking that first step forward is very mature. It's thoughtful, because it is more than just saying, \"What I did was wrong.\" The importance is in growing from the events that shaped one's life up until this point in time. And while such mistakes may be made again in the future, having the ability to become better because of them makes a world of a difference.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia actually does okay when it comes to the art and animation it holds.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent artistic decision is the use of wide-screen. It actually gives the show a more refined look, making the shots themselves hold a bit more importance or weight than they usually deserve. Plus, it oozes a certain movie-like quality that is just nicer to look at. The locations are also treated well enough, with areas being visited besides just the dorm and the school. Forests, city-scapes, and countrysides are shown, each with good lighting and apparent detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are hit or miss. Yuuji and the less relevant characters are somewhat boring or uninspired, trying too hard to be unique enough within the cast. The girls, though, fare slightly better. They look mature, given the topics at hand, are attractive, and contain a good amount of detail, from their hair to their eyes. Among everyone, Michiru stands out the most. With her blonde twin-tails and lion tooth, she just looks like a \"Chiru-Chiru.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation involved is unfortunately not always the best. It does have its moments during more intense situations, but the dialogue-heavy anime usually resorts to mouth movements instead of character expressions or fluid gestures.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs a character-driven anime, Grisaia relies on the cast to carry it the whole way through. Sadly, some are just not able to tough it out.\\n\\n\r\nYumiko is a woman who comes off as entirely unapproachable. Literally wielding a switchblade to keep others at a distance, she is quick to point out the obvious yet is easily embarrassed. Being born as an unwanted addition to the family, she often feels trapped, with no one around to accept her for who she really is. And keeping others out only perpetuates the isolation she constantly feels. Arguably the weakest character, Yumiko is often sidelined due to her usual reserved nature. Not being loud or sincere in her actions, the other girls drown her out, causing the audience to want more.\\n\\n\r\nAs the dorm's \"personal\" maid, Sachi is respectful of the people around her. Kind in mannerisms and a listener rather than a talker, she appears to be tame in personality. However, she harbors a rather obsessive side. This quirk of hers stems from a harsh reality where one decision she made changed the outcome of her life forever. As such, she always takes it upon herself to see through anything to the end, disregarding any sort of personal safety. A proponent for what it means to be selfish, she upholds a heavy burden that any sane person would have difficulty with. However, much like Yumiko, once she is \"developed,\" she is tossed aside, providing no further relevancy.\\n\\n\r\nMakina seems out of place within the academy, usually due to her stature and childlike behavior. But the more one spends time with her, the more there is to learn. Her potty-mouth, unfettered emotions, and literal daddy issues make her a handful to deal with at any given moment. Taking solace in the comfort that Yuuji provides, Makina's psychological issues are at least calmed due to his intervention. A friend to all and a fan of Tuna Man, she may act like a kid, but her willingness to experience what life has to offer makes her anything but.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Yuuji isn't normal by any definition of the word. Unemotional, unintentionally hilarious, and unable to follow the \"easy\" path, his background is shrouded in mystery. Oddly willing to help those in need, his line of work often left him wanting something more. And this was found in the girls of Mihama Academy; being considered a regular, everyday guy by those around him gave him a breath of fresh air from the usual pandering and doting he received everywhere else. As the catalyst for the girls' cures, he not only earns their trust, but is likewise deserving of having his harem.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the most memorable, Michiru is a big ball of joy. Overreacting to everything and just plain silly, she never seems to stop being funny. She has a passion for animals and is more caring than would at first be believed. Having both a literal and figurative identity crisis, she more often than not is unable to cope with being her regular self. Knowing the meaning of \"heartache,\" she refuses to believe she is worth anything more than the dirt on the ground. Undergoing the greatest amount of self-reflection gives her the needed boost in confidence that she's been seeking her entire life. And with such newfound confidence, her resolve to live is forever cemented.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Yumiko is the weakest, Amane is arguably the strongest. Beautiful, womanly, and overtly sexual, she acts without limitations when Yuuji is in the picture. Giving off huge vibes that her behavior is sensationalized, what she reveals about the trials and tribulations she experienced as a young girl provide the much needed confirmation. Her motif is regret: regret at being unable to help, regret at sacrificing those dear to her, and regret with not knowing what to do. She is a textbook example of a person wanting to punish oneself for what has already come to pass. What she discovers, though, is that it isn't so much punishment that she deserves. Instead, she deserves to be freed from the past that haunts her. And in order for that to happen, she must first forgive herself.\\n\\n\r\nMentioned slightly within these interpretations, it's important to understand why the girls are able to take the anime's overall theme to heart. At first look, Yuuji appears to be an anchor, being the answer to all of the girls' problems. And to an extent, this is true. However, it's better to see Yuuji not as an anchor but rather as a guide post. While he may sometimes get directly involved, he much prefers to have the women come to their own realizations. Whether he lends them advice or merely hears them out, it is up to the girls themselves to take the plunge towards resolution. Yuuji is just there to push them in the right direction.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP actually has a strong opening sequence, followed by a slower, rather generic middle. The song picks back up after the halfway mark, ending on a literal high note.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is rather generic, with its simple singing and strumming of the guitar. It used hardly ever, which is for the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED appears to be quite slow and calming, contrasting with the more grim tales that the show contains. But then it picks up, falling in line with the comedy and fun that it also performs well with. The quick drums and high-pitched singing give it that non-serious feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ED is poppy and personal, reflecting Michiru's personality perfectly. It's also whimsical, giving it a hopeful vibe that fits her arc, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth ED is quite melancholic. It begins with soft singing and a slow arrangement that brings a certain amount of sadness alongside it. It gets a bit more fantastical and subsequently happier the further along it goes, but that inkling feeling it starts with always remains.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack consists mostly of mood pieces. The heavy-bass riff during dramatic build-ups and acoustic guitar and piano mixes during the more lighthearted romps. The pieces are fine for what they are, but are not worth listening to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting sees above average performances by most of the cast. A special shout-out goes to Kaori Mizuhashi as Michiru.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked Yuuji and the comedy a lot. Much of it is quite bland in delivery, but that's the point. Offhand comments are the norm, but it is intermixed with Makina's and Michiru's brand of hilarity that was fun to see. The show, as expected, got less funny the more it went on, attempting to put whatever focus it could spare on the drama instead. The laughs became more infrequent, and since the drama wasn't particularly engaging, the fun slowly withered as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Amane, simply because I like attractive women. I couldn't tell if she exactly \"won,\" but I'd like to think that that is the case here, which made me both happy and sad to see. She's hyper-sexualized, as that is her character to a degree, and part of my fun with the show came from seeing her in a sexual manner.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is a psychological anime that dabbles in comedy. While the pacing and cast are wobbly, it's a semi-enjoyable time that should at least keep one interested.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, nice atmosphere, pacing issues reduce impact, meaningful message\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, wide-screen, nice art, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Yumiko, Sachi, and Makina are weak while Yuuji, Michiru, and Amane are strong\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay EDs, okay soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, starts out nice but withers slowly\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu is an anime that had plenty of potential to be something interesting, a chance to tell some compelling stories that contained their share of some emotional moments. Sadly these moments feel too far in between. Rushed narratives and developing characters but only to stop exploring them further has held back the show.\r\nI should first clarify that I had not played the visual novel before diving into the show. In fact, I only took a small glance at the synopsis and thought that I might stumble across something interesting. While the anime itself has certainly appealed enough to me to want to explorethese characters further in the VN, should I really consider that a success? A show needs to be able to stand on its own, and aside from a much more engaging final arc, I can't say I found myself drawn in many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is sadly where the show suffers the most. When people talk about shows that needed more episodes, this is going to be one that will feature very prominently. The show decides to take on many different routes and cram them into the space of 13 episodes. The result? Not great. By the end of the show I was left with plenty of questions and very few things answered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's annoying is that these tales revolving around the five girls are actually quite interesting. Yet by the time I was finding myself intrigued, the arc would usually be finished. The worst part is that at the conclusion of each arc - aside from some subtle differences in character behaviour and appearance - you wouldn't have even known the previous arc had taken place. None of what you have previously watched seems to have any bearing on future events. You could almost take the different stories, rearrange them in any order you would be none the wiser. If you really want to add some emotional weight behind your stories then we need to see their after effects. Naturally, with an anime being made from a visual novel with very distance branches in its routes, this flaw is bound to happen. It's just such a shame to see these stories being told only for them to seemingly have no noticeable impact or development on our characters. It's not a great way to write a show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show won me back a little bit with its final story. Without going into detail, the shift in tone was welcome. I found myself really curious as to what would happen next. Having extra episodes set aside for the arc certainly helped its cause.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters themselves are very distinctive but without being memorable.\\n\r\nKazami Yuuji is certainly an interesting main character. I never found myself completely drawn to his cool, collected personality. His interactions with the girls feel emotionless and at times can shift the mood of a scene for the worse. Yet at the same time it's refreshing to have a lead who doesn't lose his head when things go against him. He's calculating, clever and goes out of his way to help and protect those around him. It would definitely have been nice to have had some more development on his back story, to help explain how he developed the personality he has, especially considering everyone else around him gets their share of development - albeit a minuscule amount.\\n\\n\r\nOur five girls, Makina, Michiru, Sachi, Amane and Yumiko, all get their time in the spotlight but when they're outside of it you wouldn't even know they existed. They are all sadly victims of the writing choices of the show. When they do get they're chance to shine the results are mixed. Some stories were flat out bizarre (Yumiko) and uninteresting (Sachi) while some (Michiru and Amane) definitely felt more memorable. And of course all of them were rushed, never helping the cause.\\n\\n\r\nCheap fanservice moments involving them were also very unnecessary. I'm quite aware of what the source material is like, but when you try to pack that in during inappropriate moments then the result is, quite frankly, embarrassing.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia is a show that could have been something much more had the writers chosen to remain focused on just one route. Instead of being delivered one delicious course, we've been handed five leftovers. I haven't quite lost my appetite for more but the next dish will need to be prepared with more care.",

            "content": "WARNING: As of writing this preview, there are only four episodes out. It may get better or worse than what it is currently. I noticed there were no reviews yet and decided it would be good to have a review of the first two episodes to give people a feel of how the show is shaping up, without spoiling it of course :P\r\nNow on to the review. \r\nStory - 9 \r\nAs this has so far been rather well adapted from the Visual Novel of the same name, the story is pretty well the same. It is really good in my opinion and the MAIN differencebetween the anime and visual novel is that the anime obviously has to move a little faster. That doesn't mean the story isn't as good though. The anime has done well with presenting us with a good story and it is keeping true to the VN rather well and has included the more important/fun plot points of the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 \\n\r\nNow I think the art style is part of the main reason I decided to watch this show and read the VN. It is pretty fantastic and I have yet to really see any issues with the animation or the quality of the art style. It has proven to have a really nice feel to it with some darker colors for some scenes and bright/vibrant colors for other parts. The art is where this show excels.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\r\nAs the sound seems to be the same as the VN with some other newer pieces mixed in, I am pleased with it. Some of the bgm from the VN that I didn't care for as much is still here in the anime because they used the same music but all-in-all, it has a good musical score that fits right in with the mood of each scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nProbably one of the weaker points since the main characters are all rather stereotypical tropes female anime characters BUT that said, they do like to put a nice spin on the archetypes and make the characters more interesting than in other situations or other shows. While you do have your tsundere character, she has a personality that is somewhat different (different enough to be good) than the standard tsundere and every other character is the same in this sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nI have enjoyed this show and definitely enjoyed the visual novel. I recommend this show to anyone and if you finish the show and you still want more, you can check out the visual novel for more, uncensored fun ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\r\nI have to give it a 9 overall because it has proven to be a rather good show with only a few small things to complain about. Though, most of those complaints come from the fact that this is an anime and it cannot include literally EVERYTHING from the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this show has treated me well and I can say it'll be a good show for anyone to check out.",

I outright cried at two, maybe three of the five routes.\r\nNo, let's move on to this: this fucking anime was a horrible adaptation. It was so bad I wanted to vomit. Holy shit it was the worst adaptation of anything I've ever watched, there was so much cut content the show couldn't possibly have made sense to anyone who didn't read the VN, and Sakaki's route was so butchered and wrongly adapted it was like someone giving you a cookbook and telling you it wasan erotic novel. Everything about this anime was fucking trash, just do yourself a favor and read the VN, which was actually really good.",

            "content": "Quality over quantity. A concept which 8-bit failed to understand. As a result, Grisaia is just like a bunch of puzzle pieces where each piece came from a different puzzle. They could\u2019ve completed one small yet perfect puzzle (one route), but instead they tried to form one big puzzle and the pieces just couldn\u2019t connect.\r\nStory: 5\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is visual novel known for its comedy as well as its routes. Unfortunately, the god-send comedy that every vn reader loved became scarce in the anime. On the other hand, the routes just piled up and that\u2019s not a good thing. 8bit wanted to make the showas sad as possible, but like I said, trying to fit in everything is only going to lead to a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nIf one route was used for the entire show, the anime could\u2019ve been amazing even with flaws. However, the portrayal of multiple routes created flaws just too big to brush aside.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the pacing was way too fast. I mean if a guy who you barely met started narrating the story of his life, wouldn\u2019t you feel kind of awkward? That\u2019s exactly what the show did. They tried to make us feel sympathy and pity for the characters even though we barely know basic information. What do they like to eat? What\u2019s their favorite music? We don\u2019t get any of that. All we get is \u201cOh hey, this person has a fucked up past so I want you to feel sorry for them.\u201d Sure, it\u2019s sad, but I\u2019d be confused more than anything. Because again, things are going at a rapid pace, a pace where we can\u2019t keep up.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the anime doesn\u2019t hesitate to show one problem, resolve it, then immediately jump to another problem. Seriously slow down roadrunner. We need a good one episode to just be a slice of life or comedy. An episode where we can see what the characters are like on a day to day basis. Staying sad & gloomy all the time isn\u2019t beneficial to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the episodes focus way too much on one character. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the whole point of an arc?\u201d Yes, it is, but it\u2019s a completely different situation, when the next episode, you\u2019re already going to be focusing on someone else. For example, episode 5 could be about Girl A and episode 6 could be for Girl B. Sadly, Girl B has had barely any screen time the past few episodes, so what are you doing just suddenly dedicating an entire episode to her?  The same could be said for Girl A. The show needed a middle ground. A moment where we could just all sit back and relax. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say one of the only redeeming things is Yuuji\u2019s role in each arc. We get to see just how much of a badass he is, in different ways. His part provides a good amount of action to somewhat but not completely counteract the drama-heavy atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nIf anything can make you feel sad, then you might just love Grisaia. The comedy that appears every once in a while is great too. Also if you like fan service, then that\u2019s another plus. There are censors though, so they downgraded that too. From an objective standpoint or as a reader of the vn, Grisaia is pretty disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t got much to say about the art. The heroines are appealing, Yuuji looks cool, and the chibi scenes are adorable. There are times though, when Yuuji looks like a drawing on a piece of paper rather than an animated character.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not a good reviewer when it comes to the sound section. To me, the opening has neat animation and a great beat, but it\u2019s not crazy amazing. I also think the voice actors are perfect.  I guess saying I have no complaints about the sound sums up my thoughts a lot easier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nI know I said a lot of negative things about how they went about developing the characters, but that doesn\u2019t mean I hate the characters. In fact, I like them. They may not be totally unique, but they do, for the most part, each have at least one refreshing trait. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is Kazami, Yuuji. Dude is a badass. He\u2019s certainly different than the harem protagonists we have today. Unlike most harem protagonists, he doesn\u2019t look dorky or like a child. Despite the rampant amount of fan service, he doesn\u2019t blush or stutter. Instead he remains composed and says blunt, but witty comments. There\u2019s also the fact that he\u2019s a strong and intelligent guy in a non-magic/fantasy world. Thanks to that, we get plenty of moments where he shows off just how cool he is. Yuuji is a breath of fresh air in a world of incompetent and super altruistic shounen/harem protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nNext we got Amane, the big sister character. Well-endowed, she is constantly flirting with Yuuji much to his chagrin. She may be flirtatious, but I think she is the most mature out of the group. She knows when to be serious and actually doesn\u2019t have as much quirks as the others do. \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Makina, a petite girl who is initially portrayed as shy, but in reality, has quite the personality. She acts childish, but shows a great amount of intelligence from time to time. With that intelligent and childish personality, comes vulgarity. She may seem innocent, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s got the tongue of a sailor.  A fair portion of the comedy comes from her use of language and it never fails to make me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nSachi is an obedient and polite maid. No matter what the request is, she promises to fulfill it. Because of this the characters are careful with their words when speaking to Sachi. There are moments when they accidentally joke around and Sachi takes it literally, providing comedy and sometimes pity for the girl. Simply put, she\u2019s a girl who\u2019d spend her entire life searching for bigfoot if you asked for it. \\n\\n\r\nMichiru is an air-head who enjoys acting like a tsundere. Her ignorance can be a good source of comedy, but sometimes it\u2019s just annoying. Couple that with her tsundere actions and you might get ticked off. Everyone has their own tastes, so you might like her, but as for me, I don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nThe last main heroine is Yumiko. She acts cold or in other words is a coodere, but that\u2019s just because she doesn\u2019t want to be betrayed again. She also thinks she wouldn\u2019t be much of a friend anyways. Deep down, she is a kind and caring girl. Once she opens up to someone, she\u2019s more on the dere side. There\u2019s a running gag between her & Yuuji where she tries to cut him with a box cutter. The characters are shown as chibi so it\u2019s both, funny and adorable. \\n\\n\r\nWe also got the supporting cast such as Julia Harudera a.k.a JB. Besides being someone who took care of Yuuji and his boss, we hardly know anything about her. She\u2019s supposed to be someone who frequently assists Yuuji, but that information just never reached the surface.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don\u2019t reek of one-dimensional and provide tons of hilarious moments as well as awesome ones from Yuuji, but they\u2019re far from well developed. It would\u2019ve been better to keep them at a stand still than force a fast change in them. In the end, whether or not you like the characters is up to you. It\u2019s subjective vs objective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much trash you pick up, you\u2019ve just got a pile of trash.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying Grisaia is utter trash, but the quote above best describes Grisaia. Adding more and more stuff isn\u2019t going to magically make the anime better. A combination of mediocre stories will never deliver what 1 good story will. The show should\u2019ve adapted 1 route. There would be some missing information, but the information that is included would surely be enough to get you to understand what\u2019s going on. With multiple routes though, the amount of missing crucial information is way too high. Grisaia no Kajitsu left us with rushed arcs, no time to get attached to anyone, & characters who dealt with their problems at an abnormal pace. Yuuji, the comedy, & the characters, when it's just them during their everyday lives, isn\u2019t going to save the show, but it will at least allow it to be watch-able.",

            "content": "*WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS*\r\nGrisaia No Kajitsu is an anime based off of a visual novel but you can't really say that it was an exact retelling of the events of the visual novel. \r\nIf you have read a visual novel in the past you would know that it is divided in to routes for each of the heroines after a common route in which you make decisions to determine which route you will follow, the visual novel version of Grisaia is no different, but as you are watching this series you will notice that it develops differently to the visual novel.\r\n*SPOILERS*\r\nThe main part of the storybegins in episode four when the first of the heroine routes (Michiru) starts which lasts two episodes followed by Yumiko's route which is greatly shortened to just one episode, next is Sachi who again only gets one episode, (disappointing because Sachi's route is very emotional) next is Makina who gets two episodes and finally is Amane's route which is four episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nI thought that Amane's route was possibly the best in the visual novel and has been shown well in the anime it was obviously shortened but I don't think it really loses all that much. \\n\r\nBut Yumiko's route in the anime is shortened so much that it loses a lot of the emotion and the depth of story it had in the visual novel, they also cut a lot of the plot out, this was possibly the worst route in the anime even thought it was one of the best in the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThere was something that i noticed just over halfway through the season which made me view this anime differently as i watched the rest of the season, it was that the anime had combined all of the routes together to make it a progressive story with the protagonist Kazami Yuuji helping each of the heroine thought their problems separately but on the same timeline, unlike the visual novel. After I noticed this I understood why the story-lines were shortened and changed as you couldn't let some events that occurred in the visual novel happen and keep a linear story-line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this an excellent anime, although if you have already read the visual novel you may not enjoy this as much as if you didn't know the story. The art in this is really good, it is very similar to the visual novel and it just looks good. To some the characters in the anime may seem a little one sided but that is because for some characters there really isn't enough of their back story told in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this retelling of the visual novel but i'm not sure that everyone who has read the visual novel will enjoy it as much as me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score:9/10\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I just realized that this wasn't directly based off of the visual novel but based off a manga series called 'Grisaia no Kajitsu: Sanctuary Fellows' i haven't read the manga but i assume the changes to the story come from the manga and not the director butchering the visual novel.",

            "content": "One of the most painful animes I've ever watched.  By painful, I mean it killed my braincells.\r\nThe characters have little personality.  They lack more traits than they do the amount of panty shots I've seen.  The only part I liked was the flashback of the anime.\r\nHere's how I rate it (1-10):\r\nPlot design: 3.  I've seen better.  There's lack of depth.  Typical, over-regurgitated type of cliche(not the good kind of cliche).\r\nIt's been regurgitated so much that it almost burned a hole into my brain.\r\nWhy:\r\nHelpless, ditsy anime girls in need of cold, indifferent male protag's help.  Girls holding high ranksin society, girls that are combative, girls that have grim pasts and anti-social personalities--they're all ditsy, air-headed, trip-over-their-own-goddamn-two-inch-circumference-legs---lack everything required in a good story--\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\r\nI can put it plain and simple.  They want the D.  They're clutsy.  They don't have depth.  They don't contribute anything BUT panty shots and sex appeal.\\n\r\nHere's my view on sex appeal.\\n\r\nI'd rather watch hentai instead.  I've seen hentai with more character depth and plot and at least the sex appeal gets to the point--not to mention better artwork.  \\n\r\nFood for thought:\\n\r\nHow can you fap to someone that acts like their IQ is abysmal? :]\\n\r\nFirst two minutes of the anime was just panty shots.\\n\r\nThe first girl character had generic design, ditsy personality.  First five minutes of the anime, she can't drive properly and almost gets main protag killed because she panicked over simple conversation.\\n\r\nA lot of people would say \"Wow.  How the f**k do you get to chauffeur the main protag with driving skills so poor?  Why do all the girl characters get so easily phased by small sh*t?\"\\n\r\nBut deep down, I feel all the people who like this anime were thinking\\n\r\n\"Oh, how cute!  She's so mentally impaired that maybe I could associate her with my lonely, secluded otaku self.  I'm sure she's too stupid to mind.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design:  1.  Why? What else does '1' possibly mean?  If you're asking, go find a different anime.  Go watch a bunch.  Learning patterns is crucial to breaking the walls of irrational thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation Artwork: 9.  It's not bad.  I don't care about the ecchi, but it has nothing to do with art.  I think that the anime did well with shading, detailing, etc.  The grimness of the artwork was appeasing.  Of all the blood, horror, and corpses I've seen, they really worked hard on the detailing!  I do also feel they did an okay job on airbrushing the asscheeks on those girls.  Seriously.  It's ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  ANNOYING.  ANNOYING.  HIGH PITCHED.  EMOTIONALLY PITCHED TONES OF PUBERTY.  PLEASE.  I abhor children, cheerily dumb anime girls and boys, etc.  The music was decent--the voice acting was fine--the tone and pitch--gave me a headache.  \\n\r\nWhy: When you meet arrays of weebs that seem to be second-generation missing-link, you too will understand.  Oh, and btw.  Weeaboo has no ethnic background.  Anyone can be a weeaboo.  It's just that perfect, high pitched voice, that ecstatic, fake, joyful tone of voice.  If you have paranoia or worries that people might be using you, lying to you, or even selling you out, don't talk to people who sound fake and weeaboo.  Once you do something that they don't like, they're just going to change into their unappealing bara voice, grabbing your d**k and ripping it off.  I've had a bad past with these sort of people.  Not all of them are terrible people, but most of them are just really annoying to listen to.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I wasted my time watching this.  I enjoyed only the flashback episodes.  All else can go into the trash.  If you don't want to be that guy that watches ecchi for plot, just skip to episode 10 to the end.  You'll enjoy it.\\n\r\nPast that is just survival, horror, children, etc.  I don't feel right rating enjoyment by the whole anime, so I'll do it by two parts:\\n\r\nEarly anime: -10.  Pantyshots.  Pantyshots.  Pantyshots.  Derpderpderp.  \\n\r\nLate anime(episode 10+): 9 for horror.  7 for feels.  5 for ecchi.  6.5 for story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Considering I wasted my time, destroyed braincells, and hurt my own self-esteem writing and watching this---I give it a 2.  The only reason I give it 1 extra point is because episode 10+.  \\n\r\nHere's a tip.  Go watch vanilla hentai if you want soft, more meaningful ecchi.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu....\r\n[OVERVIEW]\r\nI begun watching this anime with low expectations, especially after reading the reviews that the others had so kindly provided. Personally, I had never played the visual novel and I am in no position to compare. \r\nThe one thing I can offer is my opinion when I watching this at night deliriously, preparing myself for immense disappointment. I was proven quite wrong -- this anime could hold on its own but not as well as Meikyuu and Rakuen. \r\nBut first and foremost, I urge of those who hesitate to at least give it a try or for the sake of watching the nexttwo seasons of this. The Trilogy itself is genuinely worth it and this season was merely a very rushed introduction. I had expected there to be much more gore and screwed up pasts but even now I'm unsure if this is what truly took place in the Visual Novel itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[REVIEW FOR THIS SEASON ALONE]\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I thought this was quite comedic, despite the darker palette of colours it too for the introduction. Simple, Quick lines with the characters linked to it flashed across the screen so I was slightly piqued.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three-four episodes was fine. It tried to bring in a cool atmosphere and various masks of people and yet you as a watcher knows that what is apparent is deceiving. It does make you curious for the reason behind their personalities and does grasp your attention for quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when the revelation begins, you can feel that the animators are rushing through it, big conflicts solved quickly in one or two episodes and sudden subtle changes in the characters after the conflict. I judged it as unnatural in my crudely delirious mind, feeling that could have been more development and more understanding towards the character.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, being a person who loves details more than anything else, I cannot deny that perhaps the original had made a deeper meaning for the course of events so I decided to let my disdain for the rush go away for the sake of carrying on with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nTheir interactions at times can feel random, deep moments can occasionally turn comedic in the protagonist's point of a view, a tad bit unfitting of a person who was more screwed up than the rest. Simply to put it; everything felt too easy. This anime certainly deserved more than 13 episodes and the characters deserved more than 20-40 minutes of view time to fully understand them.\\n\\n\r\nThat was this anime's weak point. In its rush, it tarnished a good story. However, it still did manage to pull off a story that one can understand. \\n\\n\r\n[THE OTHER TWO]\\n\\n\r\nI did not sing praises for the first but however, I must beg of you to watch or at least read/play the visual novel. Do not allow just one season to ruin the impression of the other two.\\n\\n\r\nThis season still gives sufficient knowledge to carry onwards to the next two, where the actual plot takes the spotlight. The other two is more well balanced and its consistency is better.\\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nIF there is any advice to give, watch this with the lowest possible expectations to stop yourself from inevitable disappointment. The plot is lacking but the characters are unique and amazing on their own.\\n\\n\r\n[FINAL SCORES]\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment in the midst of deliriousness - 7\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nWatch it for the sake of the other two seasons.\\n\r\nRecommending this? Perhaps.",

For that, he enrolls in a school populated by 5 girls each having their own troublesome past. The series is divided into 5 segments, with each segment dealing with one female character. The story about their past is well explained and then shows how Yuuji saves the girls and gives them a chance tostart a new life. The stories are both sad and dramatic, giving this anime it's serious atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe animation, graphics is quite pleasing. All characters are well designed and the protagonist is pretty badass looking, given his character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nEach character is well defined and their past is explained. Despite a few side characters, you'll probably get to know every main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nIt starts off as a typical ecchi romance harem anime. But once Yuuji interacts with the girls, the past is revealed and in a dramatic turn of events, he saves them. It's quite enjoyable and it's easy to make a few characters your favorite. It's not a bad anime, but it's still much suited to a mature audience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good anime from a psychological point of view and succeeds in proving that. Romance, well, there isn't that much of it.",

            "content": "First things first, I am quite bias towards psychological/mystery anime which makes you really think about life as a whole.\r\nI had finished this anime as soon as it finished airing. Every week, I would wait until it came on, even waiting for it's countdown on the episode to finish before jumping straight into it. I had been waiting for an anime like this to come out which could finally meet my long list of standards.No spoilers~ \\n\\n\r\nStoryline: 8\\n\\n\r\n      I didn't know the plot line had come from a VN so my experience in this only comes from the anime. I cannot compare against the VN so I'm very sorry! \\n\r\n      The plot line as a whole was well thought through. I do believe however, some of it was too rushed. Rather than a 13 episode anime, I think it should have been at least 24. That way, the girls would have more of a storyline, going into more depth on their background than focusing on getting to the end of it. Each girl has their mysteriousness to them which makes it appealing. However, when actually put into the light of things, it was once again way too rush. I give this storyline an 8 because it does have a lot of surprises which still makes me wonder. The events which happens brings me back to Angel Beats but it's pace is what spoiled it for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\n      Fantastic art. I loved the drawing and the way the characters are expressed. Kind of reminds me of a modern Clannad. However, I noticed that the girl's eye lashes are sort of faded out to a red-ish pink? I don't know but that did put me off slightly. Rather than focusing on the story, I would be focusing on their eyes. It made me think it was some sort of dream-like state which I don't think I should be... I don't know... it was weird for me... But I'm really picky with my art so it's just my opinion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: \\n\\n\r\n      Haha! I really liked the opening! It has an upbeat sound which lightens up the anime just before actually watching it. It fits in well with the art especially. To me, unlike Angel Beats, it's OST is more light-hearted and less...depressing? (Is that an ok word to use?) I reminded me of those games I use to play. (Disgaea, Phantom Brave, Etc) However, when it comes to a more in depth part of the anime, it moves into a sweeter piano music and moves into a deeper sound which really steals your heart. I don't know, it really got to me in some parts. I found myself with a few tears in my eyes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\n      The character development is very well done. Their storyline, their emotions and how it really speaks to humanity. I loved it. It really does speak to me sometimes with the questions asked by the protagonists and how they counter it. Their answers do sometimes leaves me with more questions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\n     The enjoyment of this anime is very good. I had some good laughs. I felt involved when the protagonists were in confusing and felt the need to tell them everything is alright. There are some part which for me were a bit rated M and some parts which were just not needed in my opinion. On the other hand, from what I've heard about the VN, it was a lot worse when it came to these rated M parts so I guess the anime itself had to provide for those who like those things... (Did I word it right? Nyaaa, I don't know...) \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (More of a 8.5 though) \\n\\n\r\n      I gave this anime quite high of a rating because, like I said, I'm quite bias when it comes to ratings. Though there were some parts I found unnecessary (to which I listed out throughout my review), I still found it worthy of such a rating. It has a good plot-line which was through through. Only downside was the telling of the story which could have been done a lot better. Pace is something I always nit-pick at when I watch anime. This time, there is no difference. Pace is what makes the storyline that worth while. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it all up very good story, lovely art, lovely music, character storyline is good but can be better. Enjoyment is there and overall, fantastic. \\n\r\n      I hope my review helps! \\n",

The visual novel \"The Fruit of Grisaia\" is one of the longest Visual Novels ever written, and as such spends a lot of time building each character and their background, forcing you to get to know each of the characters and sympathize with them. On that note, I have read the VN, and have watched the series, and I can't help but ask, why? Why did they compress it into 13 episodes? \r\nOverall, the anime variation is a watered down version of the VN, so in the end, I'd suggest, before judging \"The Fruit of Grisaia\" based onthis, read it.\\n\r\nTL:DR, Read it, don't watch it. Watch it for a nostalgia trip if you read the novels (though the Yumiko arc in the anime genuinely drove me nuts as they twisted it so far from it's original source.)\\n\r\nAgain, Read it, don't watch it.",

Of course this story includes some of your classic 'deres, but personality is added to all of them and not just hollow stereotypes.

            "content": "I'll start by saying there was a lot of negative news about Fruit of Grisaia that prevented me from watching it for a very long time. Well, after watching it finally, I'm only able to reinforce in my mind the idea that OTHER PEOPLE'S opinions should be taken with a grain of salt. That's a bit hypocritical since I'm writing a positive review for this anime, so hopefully, if you're reading this, you don't always think for yourself and will heed another person's thoughts. I hope you do this time.\r\nI think Fruit of Grisaia could easily be compared to anime such as Angel Beats andThe Irregular of Magic Highschool. That is to say, it's like a combination of the two. Again, you need to watch this anime for yourself, more than just the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is great, it's nothing too original but that's fine, it's the delivery that matters more than originality, I say. An awesome main character who's been through some terrible things in his life, helping his fellow class mates through their own issues that the past has brought on for them. It's a great premise and it's played out really well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great, much better than I was expecting it to be. Think Monogatari art meets Angel beats art. The emotions the characters display are very believable because of the art work in their expressions, and some of the comedic expressions are hilarious and loveable as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is great. Sad music is played at the right time to make an already tearjerking scene much more tearjerking. The character voices are awesome as well, especially Michiru. She's so funny, reminds me a lot of Yui from Angel Beats!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (*Light Spoiler*) All the main female characters have some sad, dark issues that make them all loveable and make you really want things to work out for them. Some of the episodes concerning these characters will get really dark, especially nearing the end of this season of FoG. And it's the raw emotional detail that's put into these characters that makes this anime so good, and definitely worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: I don't think this series was really lacking in anything. It had a good balance of comedy, sadness, joy, action, suspense - it was perfectly well rounded. It did involve some ecchi and a lot of the ecchi scenes seemed unnecessary but really: When is ecchi truly necessary? I enjoyed the ecchi, personally. But don't worry, if ecchi is something that's offputting to you, perish it from your mind. It doesn't try to shove the ecchi scenes down your throat, and as the show progresses, it becomes less and less frequent.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, in closing, this is definitely worth watching if you enjoyed titles like Angel Beats or Irregular of Magic Highschool. Gave it a ten out of ten myself.",

For example shows like Amagi Brilliant Park, Terraformars and Selector spread WIXOSS. All of which seemed to falter in some way or other. However a certain show called grisaia no kajitsu happened to catch me by surprise. \r\nStory: \r\nY\u016bji Kazami transfers into a school for students with troubles. He is there to have the normal student life he never had up to this point. While being asked to notinvolve himself in the other student\u2019s problems he disobeys orders and does everything in his power to help his class mates overcome past traumas and help them to have a care free school life. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the first three episodes of this when they were released and I saw potential for a good anime so I decided to wait for the season to finish before I went back and re watched it. I have to say I was really shocked by what these girls went through. Troubled by pain they all find methods of coping and all the female cast put on a brave face in front of the others.   \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Yuji helping each of the students to accept and overcome the problems that they have, sometimes using extreme methods in order to do so. Stories vary from each of the female characters. \\n\\n\r\nI do feel as if certain characters arcs were more rushed and I do feel that certain arcs are blown out of proportion in comparison to others. If I\u2019m being honest there isn\u2019t really an overarching story besides Yuji trying to live a normal student life and failing spectacularly.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nY\u016bji Kazami is our main protagonist and mysterious transfer student who wanted to experience a normal life in high school. Yuji is a very rational and level headed guy. His skills and personality is detrimental to helping other people out in dire situations. He feels compelled to investigate the girls and wants to know of their situation, it kind of feels like has the instincts of an older brother to all the girls. I do feel that we didn\u2019t get enough information about Yuji, he is still a relative mystery and I would have liked to see a back story for him, but who knows? There\u2019s a second season announced! \\n\\n\r\nMichiru Matsushima is a bleach blonde fake-tsundere\u2026 yeah. She took on the act of playing a tsundere since others found it comical. She struggles with the fear of loosing loved ones and has an identity crisis. Yuji helps her to realize that she has to move forward in life and find the things that make her happy. \\n\\n\r\nYumiko Sakaki is a moody girl who at first didn\u2019t take a liking to Yuji. Assuming the worst she attempts to slash him with a box cutter numerous times and states her animosity towards our main protagonist. Yumiko has problems with her dad and the dispute led to her leaving and pursuing a life of freedom. It does eventually catch up with Yumiko in her arc. \\n\\n\r\nSachi Komine is a hard-working maid girl who is the most dependable person in the group. Sachi goes through extreme lengths to accomplish requests, going so far as to milk a cow for someone who wants a glass of milk\u2026 Sachi\u2019s arc consists of her learning to be a bit more selfish for herself as it is sometimes good for her and others. \\n\\n\r\nMakina Irisu is a child like and I quote \u2018fool\u2019 Makina has farther issues in a sense as she bribes Yuji to become her farther. She is sought after in the series by a shady group in which Yuji steps in to help out with. \\n\\n\r\nAmane Suou is the final member of the group. She is a mixture of childish, responsible and strange. I suppose it could stem from her tragic back story, but that\u2019s something I\u2019ll discuss in a second. She takes an interest in Yuji when first introduced and she sets her sights on dating him. \\n\\n\r\nNow I can\u2019t give the full details on each of the girls in the series as it would cause spoilers, but their situations are more dramatic and tragic then I\u2019m letting on. \\n\\n\r\nEach character gets an excellent amount of screen time and the female cast is developed very well. It\u2019s their relationship and journey with Yuji that definitely helps them all to progress by the end of the series. Other minor characters such as JB (Yuji\u2019s boss) and the principle lady are not really worth mentioning as JB is the only relative character worth mentioning beside others. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t find the OST anywhere so I can listen to it again. However from what I recall in the anime few tracks stand out, but it suits the dramatic, romance tone in the series as well as the quiet laid back moments. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was well done. The scenery was very well done and it was great during the shifts of tone throughout the series. The character designs weren\u2019t great. It consisted of the stereotypical loli girl, flat chested tsundere, big breasted red head, adorable pink haired girl and the black haired beauty. I was actually shocked to see that 8-bit did this series since they also directed encouragement of climb and the infamous Infinite stratos\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been debating with myself for a week on how much I liked the series. On one hand I feel as if it was all very rushed and thrown in for shock factor and another part of me thinks it was well done with excellent character development. I probably have to say I overestimated this show. Bad pacing can slow down the arcs of the characters and while there were elements to make it a very well done series, I felt that Yuji\u2019s lack of a real objective just makes this seem like a show about him running to the \u2018damsels in distress\u2019 hell even Issei from Highschool DxD had a real motive that his passion drove him for. I do feel let down by the series, but I will give Amane\u2019s arc an honorable mention for shocking and surprising me and leaving me sick by the end. Other than that the others character arcs were also well done so I will give credit where it\u2019s due. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis show had potential, but slacked off in some areas. Good character development is a redeeming factor, but overall this is a bit of a let down. I would recommend you give the first few episodes a try and if you decide to finish the series beware of episodes 10-12 as it is very graphic and disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, have a nice day! \\n",

            "content": "Story 7/10 - The story follows Kazami Yuuji, Yuuji has had a very, very troubled past and joins a school with only 5 other students other then him, he hopes to do this in the hope of having at least some normality in his life. He eventually meets these 5 other students, 5 girls who themselves have faced trauma in thier lives, one at a time Yuuji supports them in overcoming thier past. My only complaint with the story is how it is laid out. The story is kind of laid out in arcs, with each arc focusing on a certain female character. The problemwith this is that it causes the anime to have serious pacing issues, for example one arc takes 5 episodes, but an other one takes about 2. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - The enviornment and background art is good, although the character design has a some flaws, an example is with some female characters with long hair, the hair can sometimes be seen going behind thier eye but other then that the art is good. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 - Honestly this by far is the weakest aspect of the anime, no piece of music stuck out as being rememberable, although the VA fitted the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10 - I felt we got to know a decent amount about the characters during each of thier arcs, there is a good balance of differing personalities between the girls, and the MC is good as well with dealing with the emotional trauma these girls have faced, coming up with very different ways to deal with the very different types of pain that these girls have gone through. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  8/10 - This anime has good characters, has good amounts of comedy, while retaining the seriousness as well. If you can excuse the pacing especially during last 5 episodes of the anime, then it is a decent one to watch.",

Clearly anyone who played the visual novel might be quite disappointed,a lot of important factors were cut out , they explained almost nothing about Yuuji's past and they also only showed some arcs, which is explainable since it's an anime but it could of been done longer and shown more.\r\nOn the whole this is a trilogy that has two games after a sequel and prequel that should be released as anime's march 2015, they probably left all of Yuuji's past as a mystery in this anime (even though they explained some in the game such as in Makina's route)because they will cover all of it in Grisaia no Meikyuu.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was done well, and the characters are amazing , this isn't a typical harem show and is indeed worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also showed teasers for the upcoming sequels,so if you don't like waiting , you should watch this anime after the other two are released.",

            "content": "I am quite new at this since it is my first review, but I think it  is time to give it a shot.\r\nThis isn't your typical harem anime, albeit it has panty shots in the most ridiculous situations. It in no way reaches to a point where the story is just panty shots. It has substance and great substance at that, whereas, I do feel that the episodes should have been lengthier because of the meat they contained. But this is not necessarily bad, as I might have enjoyed more if it, if that was the case but even without it, it is stilla great anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have a solid back story. With each of the 4 girls being given 1 episode each and the special one according to me, given more. That means for our enthusiasts who like a conclusive ending, they will get one. So even if you don't like this anime and do not want to continue, you will be satisfied. For the others who are craving more, this anime has a 47 minute special, a second ongoing season and more. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the back stories interesting are how unique they are, and the fact that you can't really favor any of the girls. I have watched many harem animes and if you see my list you will believe me. But rarely do I come across an anime where I don't find any of the girls annoying, its not that run down, Koros here Koros there, or clingatron 1000. The author seems to know just the right amount of elemental attitude he has to put in each of the girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is OP. If you are looking for a guy who knows his stuff he will be it. Especially for people like me who love the main guy from The Irregular at the Magic Academy, although this one is a lot more realistic. And this anime hits more on a serious note, with good comedy to keep it from running you down.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime.",

As I began my first episode of Grisaia no Kajitsu I was lead into this unknowing pretense so by the end of the first episode, like the last three minutes, I was hooked and I needed to see more. Grisaia no Kajitsu is a story comprised of mini arcs featuring our main character Yuuji. Calm, collected and always says exactly what he's thinking not worrying about his fellow classmates. Yuuji interacts with his classmates in a way that changes their lives etc.\r\nMost anime are like this... The characters neverstick, maybe they're harem cut and pasted but this anime makes the characters more human by giving them terrible pasts.\\n\r\nI personally think this anime is a good watch because it deals with real life problems, death and the fall of humanity. It shows that Loyalty is worth is weight in gold and \"Sorry\" is to be pitied, for actions are what mend wounds. It's refreshing to see an unmovable character (Characters) when faced with people who cave into fear and madness, sin. I honestly think it's worth a watch.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu, an anime adaption of the visual novel made by the game company called frontwing. Honestly, I was quite excited to find out that Grisaia was getting an adaption. As a huge fan of VN (Visual Novel) I wanted to see an anime version of it, hoping it would be as good as Clannad and Little Busters! but to be blunt, I was disappointed. Grisaia is an amazing VN, but the adaption was very weak. I see a lot of people giving this 9, and 7 out of 10 ratings, but I think a lot of those people haven't read the Visual Novel.And when a VN gets an adaption, their usually judged based off the game. Grisaia in total is 50+ hours of reading, featuring a lot of content, each heroine route being about 8-10 hours. And guess what? They crammed all that into 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The thing with Grisaia is that it doesn't necessarily have the most exciting or interesting story line, rather, it's more known for it's characters and their back stories. The story takes place at Mihama academy, a secluded school home to five female students, each with their own reasons for enrolling and living their daily lives there. And one day, Kazami Yuuji, the academy's first male student, enrolls there throwing the girls off balance. As he interacts with each of the girls, he starts to learn more about them and their past, as well as the burdens they each carry. Part of what makes Grisaia's story good is the great balance that it has. The story and characters are fleshed out really well, and there are plenty of serious and dramatic scenes mixed in with light hearted, comedic moments. There is also a touch of romance to spark things up. Everything unfolds slowly, without giving too  much information which adds to the mysteriousness of it and makes you want to know more. This only applies to the Visual Novel though. Frankly, the anime didn't do any of this. The biggest issue with the anime, and why I gave it such a low rating, is because of the story. 13 episodes obviously wasn't enough to give Grisaia a good adaption and really flesh out it's story. It was too rushed and they shoved so much info at the viewer that it was hard to make sense of what was going on. Like I said, Grisaia is a 50+ hour long VN. And they attempted to tell the story in 13 episodes. With the common route being only 3 episodes, you don't get the chance to get a feel of what the characters are like and the connection they have. And for the heroine routes, with each being only 1-2 episodes (Except Amane's as hers had 4), you don't get to fully understand the characters and their past's. They skip so many important scenes that provide for the character development that it ruined their depth and that's what makes Grisaia such a good Visual Novel. For example, for Michiru, they skip all the dating scenes with Yuuji, which was important for her development and where her relationship with the Yuuji started to grow and develop. And for Sakaki's, they basically half-assed hers. When her past was revealed, they cut out a lot of important stuff that showed what kind of character she was, and what led her to becoming the person she is now. Her ending didn't make much sense to me either. Honestly, other than the pacing, there really wasn't any other major problems. 8bit had the story down, It's just simply how they adapted it that made it bad. They did include the major stuff for each of the girl's pasts, but when you throw all that information into one episode and cut out scenes that you think might not be important, it ends up affecting comprehension, and the closure to the routes happened way too fast. When telling a story, the way you pace it and give information out to the viewer/reader is important. If you rush everything and throw so much information out at once, it's just going to confuse people and the story and characters won't make any sense. As far as the story goes, the anime pales in comparison to the Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Overall, the animation was fine. The only thing I didn't like was the character designs. The details were very sloppy, and I felt like they could have looked better. Compared to the CG's in the Visual Novel, the designs definitely didn't look as good. But it did feature some of the cute little chibi animation scenes that were in the VN which I thought were cool. Other than that, there isn't much else to say. It could have been better, but it wasn't uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: There really isn't much difference. The music was basically the same as what was played in the VN. The opening song was different and something I haven't heard before, but I liked it and I though It was fitting of the show. Grisaia does have some great original soundtracks, which I like, so that's a positive. The character voices were also the same, so there's no complaint there. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Grisaia has some of the best characters I have seen. They are all so unique, and well developed. There is definitely a lot more to them that what the anime was able to show. To break down the characters, first we have Michiru, the Tsundere type who adds a lot to the comedy, Sakaki, the cold and lone wolf type, Sachi, the obedient maid who does any request asked, Makina, the playful one, and then we have Amane who is the big sister type, basically the opposite of Sakaki. Grisaia really does have some great characters, but there development was shafted through the whole anime sadly. This can be seen through how fast they rush into a route, pretty much getting to the point without showing any character development, how they had grown and changed before the climax. The characters may actually seem kind of generic at first too, but once you learn about there past, that changes. There is more depth to them that what meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the end, I honestly wasn't very pleased with Grisaia. In order to have given it a solid adaption, it would have needed to have been around 26-30 episodes. And it's disappointing because it's so deserving of one. Maybe I'm giving this less credit than it actually deserves, but I was expecting much more from the anime.  I'm not going to say you shouldn't watch the it. Everyone has their own opinions, and this may be one that you like. All I'm going to say is that compared to the Visual Novel, the anime is quite weak. So if you plan on watching this, or already have, check out the VN, it's worthwhile to read, and you may understand better why I wasn't satisfied with the anime.",

            "content": "Oh boy where to start...\r\nNormally I don't write reviews for the public, but I felt a strong urge to make an exception for this particular adaptation. Before I go any further, I will say that I have played the visual novel for this show and will be comparing this to its source material. If that's not something you're interested in then I suggest stopping now. \r\nAnyway, 8bit was the studio behind this and when I heard this news I was immediately wary of this adaptation. 8bit doesn't have the most appealing track record when it comes to adaptations and this is no different. The firstmajor mistake that they made was making the show a 1-cour series. With 8bit being a smaller, lesser known studio this was most likely due to budget constraints. However, that doesn't excuse the the lack of effort. In some cases the story was completely changed from the source which was something that particularly annoyed me. In other cases they would cram whole character routes into one episode leaving you without a chance to actually get a feel for the situation or connect to the characters in question. The only thing I can say they really did right was Amane's route, even if it was changed slightly, as this was spanned over 4 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIf the other routes had gotten that kind of attention this adaptation could have been so much more enjoyable. Instead what we got was a half-assed attempt at capitalizing off of a successful series to rake in money for possible sequels. 8bit should honestly be ashamed of this adaptation, not only was it piss poor, but they also made some weird design choices. Not really with the characters in particular but the episodes themselves. I mean who thought it was a good idea to animate the show in that weird resolution which caused letter boxing on the top and bottom of the episode. Some people may not be bothered by that, but its always been something that got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of design, the art of the show was nothing to write home about either. There were many moments where I was kind of taken out of the story for a moment due to the terrible animations. If it was close up on characters it was usually fine for the most part, but if they were showing someone from a distance it was very low detail and choppy. It seems like what little budget they did have went to the close ups and those new opening and ending animations. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, do I think this was a good adaptation? No. Should you watch it if you've never seen the Grisaia series before? No, even as a stand alone this show was just bad. Should you watch it if you're a fan of the Grisaia series? Maybe. I did enjoy seeing the characters come to life, especially Yuuji. However, so much was changed and rushed that it just ended up leaving me feeling frustrated in the end. If you're just interested in seeing how they did then I guess go for it, but my personal recommendation would be to stay away from this.",

            "content": "ok ... This anime is not anything special if you're looking for a complicated story, really breathtaking impressions, extraordinary characters. Admittedly, each character had its own story, which made it as it was, but it was rather done well, better than above or above average. Here we have an example of tsundere, loli, a \"killer woman\" or a super technical genius who hides in the form of an innocent girl. The main and \"only\" male hero of this anime is a sterile, \"how\" intelligent and attractive badass for which armies of \u015biwata is a picnic because he is just so great. I did not sayanything, in a way, I got into his style of being, from one side I got a little sore, but on the other I felt affectionate and loving. Of course, you could not miss the typical features for Bishonen such as extraordinary growth, musculature, excellent condition and \"beautiful\" hair. Of course he was in the center of the attention of girls and thanks to his superhuman intelligence he was able to identify each of their problems and understand the past of each of them.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, the plot was not the naggard, it was good, just good, not very predictable, but at the same time (if you have more than 10 IQ) it was easy to deduce what will happen next. The level of complexity of the action was also not too high. A simple and at times captivating plot and action. I could have a little complain about the way the main hero approaches each of the girls. he was terribly schematic and he did the same thing. A sad scene with a happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nregarding music, she did not notice that she played too big a role. Honestly, I did not get into her, if she was really good, she would do it herself, I would pay her attention.\\n\\n\r\nSumming up, I can say one thing if you want to watch good anime and do not hesitate to do it. Grisaia no Kajitsu is for you.",

            "content": "Light novel adaptations (particularly galge adaptations) have always been a bit of a hit or miss whenever they get animated.  In some cases, we have some shows that end up to be great successes such as Kanon 2006 or Clannad Afterstory.  Sometimes, we have adaptations that don't come out as much of a success.  And then we have Grisaia no Kajitsu, which can be best described as a mix of the two.\r\nStory (6.89/10): The story of Grisaia follows our main protagonist Yuuji.  In an attempt to obtain a normal high school life, Yuuji enters a mysterious school that according to thepeople that helped him get there, is a normal school, despite its prison-like walls and low student count.  It is here where he finds five girls, and begins his journey into their lives.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia's plotline is similar to the Key Trilogy of Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  Throughout the entire run of the series, Yuuji journeys through the lives of the five girls that surround him, learning about each of their stories one by one.  A traditional way of telling galge stories in anime form, Grisaia doesn't really get any high marks for using this formula.  Normally, the reason why a show of this nature would be significant in any way is due to the stories and development that are told in conjunction to the way the show is told.  Grisaia is...well, mediocre when it comes to its storytelling in several senses.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the stories.  The stories of the five girls are mostly average for the most part.  One of my biggest gripes of the show is just how each girl is treated differently.  Out of the entire thirteen episode runtime, the show treats every girl differently with some girls getting nearly half of the entire runtime to tell their story while others get only a single episode to tell why they're the way they are.  This serves as a double-edged sword for the series.  On one hand, with the arcs that get the most runtime, we have some pretty good stories that bring the show up a few notches.  However, on the other hand, we have stories that don't really stack up very well. This is largely at fault due to the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nPacing for this show is also a horrendous issue.  At times, mostly during the \"good\" arcs, the show slows itself down and accurately tells the story so that the audience gets absorbed into the story, which does work and is beneficial.  However, as an inverse effect, the stories that don't get enough screentime to accurately tell the story, are rushed, rushed, rushed.  It was a very blatant problem for the series because when you're watching a character based show, the last thing that should be done is rushing through the most important thing, the character stories.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, the show doesn't really have much of a resolution.  Like a lot of shows similar to this, the show sort of ends without a real ending, instead, opting for one that doesn't really do much progression romantically.  While this is ok for an ending, since a lot of shows of this nature also do this, it doesn't really make that much of an impact because it was so blatantly obvious and expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Grisaia had a interesting thing going for it.  On one hand, it had some horrendously rushed character stories that really could only make you care less about them since their stories seem forced and not progressional due to how the show rushed it.  But at the same time, it did make stories (particularly one) that was very well told.  Sadly though, without the final arc of the series, this show would've gone down the drain fast.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Some good character stories\\n\r\n+/-  Key Trilogy style of storytelling   (It works, but it's been done before)\\n\r\n-   Awful pacing\\n\r\n-   Mostly bad/rushed character stories\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.66/10): The characters for Grisaia also share similar problems like the story.  Personality-wise, all of these characters reflect a different anime troupe that are rather meh when taken at face value.  It's really the stories of these characters that make them more three-dimensional than they are, when combined with their perspective stories, are rather lacking.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have our main protagonist, Kazami Yuuji.  Compared with most harem protagonists, Yuuji is a bit of an odd man out.  He is very calm and collected when faced with virtually any situation, and takes everything that the girls ask for him literally which include, but are not limited to, burying them, killing them, or being their father.  While he is a decently interesting character, he is a plot device.  Virtually no part of the show is strictly focused on Yuuji himself, opting to turn him into the thing the girls long for, as well as the thing that triggers them to tell their story for all of us to see.  It's not that this is bad because the girls are the main focus of the story, but comparatively speaking, this guy serves nothing more than a turn on button for the girls' past.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the females of the series.  Michuru, Yumiko, Sachi, Makina, and Amane.  The structure of the show is tells the story of these five girls in the order shown above, giving each girl a different number of episodes to tell their story, thus varying the amount of screentime and development that each of them get.  From this structure is where Grisaia gets its main problem as far as I can see.  Nearly all of the girls here, you don't really get to know.  In fact, about three of them get a total of half of the total series runtime, which really begs to differ if they even should've bothered to do so since the poor effort to tell them really made it look like it was more of an obligation rather than a way of serious storytelling.  Taking away their stories however, the characteristics of the girls are obvious and troupe-like with traits like: the fake tsundere, the distant cool one, the maid-like character, the imouto/daughter character, and the horny one.  The girls in this series in simple terms, both make the show dark to the extent of me wanting to throw up, and make it average to the extent of you not wanting to care.\\n\\n\r\nApart from these six character, side characters are something that don't really show up too often, with the exception of being JB.  (God.  Why did they have to give her that nickname?)  The side characters aren't really too prominent in the series and for the most part, serve to move the plot along more than anything else.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Interesting, but also somewhat bland MC\\n\r\n+/- The girls in the series are good and bad\\n\r\n+/- Supporting characters are little more than plot devices\\n\r\n-  Major problem with balancing character importance\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.23/10 and 7.01/10): The animation for this show was produced by 8-bit, the same studio that created Infinite Stratos and Tokyo ravens.  Grisaia does have an animation style that I would consider to be rather pleasing to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a certain style to it that almost makes the character's eyes and hair shimmer like crystals.  It's a sort of bright style that sort of gives off the dark and psychological undertones that the show has.  What makes this style of art so significant, is the fact that the same style works very well for when the show does go dark.  It's almost malicious to see something turn so drastic so suddenly, and I love this show's animation strictly for that.  As a psychological show, I at least expected a scene or two to make me cringe in terror, give me sleepless nights, and hopefully, give me regret for even bothering to watch this in the first place.  Thankfully, (or rather, unthankfully) the show did deliver on a couple scenes that give off that sort of strange and twisted feeling that I came to expect.  (That episode 12...*shudders*)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did find odd about the artwork were a duo of minor things.  One of which being the chibi oriented art style that the show did.  It's a rare style that the show uses maybe three or four times, but it was memorable enough for me to remember it due to how odd it was.  In addition, all of the female characters in this show share a rather peculiar trait that I found both off and somewhat irritating.  That trait is, the eyelashes.  Every female character possesses this red mark on the corner of their eyes, and personally, I just found it a bit weird as it looked like they all had a strange rash or something around their eyes.  (This is really just a personal complaint.)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show is rather average.  The show utilizes soft tracks for its ending songs, and an opening that I guess is decent to listen to.  I wouldn't call it a song that I would listen to time and time again, but it does serve its job decently well.  But what the opening also does, which is interesting, is it gives a bit of foreshadowing to each of the different girls and what their stories are.  It's a nice detail that was added in and gives the audience a glimpse as to what one can expect when watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good art style that fit with the show well-roundedly\\n\r\n+/- Average soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (6.90/10):  Grisaia was a show that I personally found to be less than extraordinary.  Watching episode after episode didn't really give me much feeling, and I didn't really feel sorry for the girls due to so many of them being handled so poorly.  In addition, the sometimes tasteless attempts to add in ecchi were well, tasteless.  However, it wasn't until I watched the final arc of the series, which really put this show into a different light for me.  The way it was written made me reconsider what I thought of the show beforehand.  That being said, the flaws in the previous episodes still weren't enough to forgive it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe art, character designs, and the final storytelling of the arc were really the only positive points that I can even make with this show.  To explain why I like the final arc so much, well, let's just say I needed a lot of moe show therapy in order to recover.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing, the bland character troupes, the fact that we don't get to know Yuuji all that well, the fact that they have a character nicknamed JB, imbalance with character importance (one girl literally only gets one episode to tell whole her story whole others get 4-5), and the overall keep the audience in the dark thing with a lot of the main character's backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm not really quite sure.  Slogging through a bunch of crap in order to get to what I consider to be the best part isn't really worth it from what I see.  It's not that the show fails to give us some interesting stories, it just fails to make the audience care enough to shed tears or feel sorry for the girls and their problems.  Overall, I would say that this show succeeds in some aspects, but taking the time to get to those positive and shining moments in the series is something that I feel just isn't worth the time to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.91/10",

Not only that, but they are developed and paced in a manner which allows the viewer to feel compassion towards the characters. \r\nIn this way, this anime shows a close resemblance to the Code Geass series in which the characters are all developed to near perfection and their personality reflects their stories.\r\nAt some places towards the end however, it is very difficult to watch for anyone with the slightest distaste of light gore (Infected Cutsetc), however this adds to the shock value of the specific story and really helps you appreciate the story even more. Like Code Geass, it leaves many ends untied and unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason which i personally adored this anime is that the story is developed at an amazing pace (even for a 13 episode series), to such success that it even rivals \"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" in development. Add this to the flawless character development similar to \"Code Geass\" and it is a perfect combination to an anime which will peak your interest from the very first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who appreciates a good story and does not mind some mild nudity, or light gore. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime if you would rather not see light nudity or light gore, or if you do not like anime which leaves a lot to be answered after you have finished watching it :)",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu, starts out as a run of the mill harem anime. Grisaia does not stand out very much in the beginning due to its harem tricks but I imagine those tricks were only to grab hold of viewers as the series started to break away from the usual harem hijinks and moved towards a gripping storyline. I know right? A harem with a plot. So whenever your friends ask you with a smug face \"Hey, are you sure you're watching it for the plot?\" you can valiantly say \"Why, I sure am!\"\r\nTo kick things off the story, or plot in this case, canbe described as a character driven plot as the main character explores the past and personalities of every girl around him. Now this may not be different from some harems, but what really makes a character driven plot shine is its characters which I will get to in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is just staggering. The colors, the saturation, and the detail. The stimulating visuals is what first caught my attention to first start the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was solid voice acting was great, BG music, as well as a great OP and ED. There really is not much to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters! Now I will say not every character is perfect but majority of their respective arcs were very interesting. Some I believe needed some more screen time because the anime did not reveal enough about them. I wish I could speak of their stories but that will lead me to spoil some touching scenes, but I can speak of my experience watching them. Personally, I grew to love the tsundere (You'll know who when you watch it) arc the most because for some reason she pulled my heartstrings more than the others. The other character arcs gave me one hell of an experience as I could not predict the life they had. Every character had a life very much unique to their character and their character alone.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime more than I would like to admit since I am not a fan of the harem genre. Throughout the anime I had to remind myself that this is in fact a harem anime because the anime always seemed to branch off from it. The anime itself foreshadowed a lot of stuff that was not present in the show but stayed in the back of your head leaving you to ponder question after question of what they could possibly mean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Grisaia was a great anime that I could possibly see myself watching again in the future. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that there is a second season currently airing which will answer the questions left over from the first season. The most prevalent question being, \"Who exactly is ..\" Oh, I'm sorry I forgot that I should steer clear from spoilers; however, there's nothing wrong with a little teasing right? I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did and remember this is a harem anime, but at the same time its something entirely different.",

Yuuji is established as a very non-feeling protagonist, and this often made the way he \"rescued\" each of them from their tragic fates somewhat stereotypical or extreme. It fell into the pitfall of repetition, but since this anime was based off an visual novel game, it makes sense.\r\nCharacter backstory is very well done? Michiru's was obviously given the most care, and it was the one that made the biggest impact on me.\r\nAt the same time, until I caught up withthe sequels (Grisaia no Meikyuu and Grisaia no Rakuen), I really was neutral about Yuuji. But for sure, check those out, they've done phenomenally on them.",

I loved every moment of it and i cried my way threw all the girl's routes, especially Sachi's. Who is by the way the best (IMO). So i knew going into it that i would love the anime adaptation as well. It was this story that got me into anime and VN's in the first place. \r\nAs for the anime itself i feel it's let down a bit by having a overdose of fan service, more that is necessary honestly. As wellas just not having enough time in 13 episodes to fully tell the story from the novel. So that in places it really ends up feeling rushed. They had to cut out a lot of my favorite scenes. That said what they did manage to fit in, is still amazing. The characters, art, voice acting are still top notch and the story is exactly what i was hoping for. Especially since it's different in places and i got to watch some more bad ass scenes on Kazami Yuuji doing his thing. \\n\\n\r\nSo naturally i despite it having a few small issues i give this top marks. :) I can't wait to watch Meikyuu and Rakuen, once i have finished those Visual Novels first.",

            "content": "The Fruit of Grisaia had kind of a dull story but I never got bored with it. It was interesting, weird and sexy like alot of other animes I have watched.\r\nStoryline: Grisaia's storyline was my least favourite thing for this anime, and that's pretty bad. It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't why I watched the show. My favourite episodes would have to be \"Angelic Howl\" 1, 2 and 3. Along with \"Raison D'\u00eatre\" and \"Letter of Happiness.\"\r\nCharacters: Characters are always a big part of the show you're watching and for Grisaia I liked a lot of characters. Sachi was personally my favourite. She wasbadass and sweet and dresses up as a maid, who wouldn't love all that? Yumiko was a very good character as well but I didn't like any of the parts where she would change her personality randomly around Yuuji. Amane was my other favourite, since her backstory took up three whole episodes and she's hot, duh. Also, her nad Kazuki are my otp. I can't wait to watch season two so Kazuki can return and they get together. I didn't like Makina or Michiru that much, they were pretty annoying and Yuuji was an interesting character, I'm excited to find out his past.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: It wasn't the best animation I've seen but it was settle. At times it was great and other times it looked horrible, not as bad as Sailor Moon Crystal though. The animation in the opening and endings were beautiful and the flashback scenes were very pretty as well and stood out.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music was amazing. The opening was my favourite part, since it was catchy and memorable. The endings were nice too, my favourite having to be the first one. The voice acting sounded very well especially Kazuki's. The music is done by Elements Garden\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Grisaia was worth the watch and I'm super excited to watch the film and second season. The Fruit of Grisaia was mysterious, sad and hot.\\n\\n\r\nIt has thirteen episodes and is done by studio 8-bit. It's licensed by Sentai Filmworks and you can watch it on Crunchyroll. It aired during October 5, 2014 to December 28 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This is one of those anime that make you wanna say, \"OMG, I can't believe that happened!\" and have that scene repeat over and over in your head.\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\nI haven't played the visual novel myself, but I think the animation was quite loyal. To be honest, when I first saw the first 3 episodes, I thought it was just going to be another mainstream harem anime with a mainstream harem ending. I was wrong. WhenI saw just how dark the anime got, it immediately got my attention.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFor the characters, they're quite relatable, even though I've never experienced what they have. Each heroine had their own dark past, some worse than others. Unlike some anime adaptations, The characters here seemed so real, it felt like each of them were real people. I'm just glad the heroines got their happy ending in the same universe.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who wants something light and dark at the same time. If you liked school days, Yosuga no Sora, or other VN adaptations, Grisaia no Kajitsu is a must watch.",

            "content": "Ever since middle school, I've been particularly fond of psychologically damaged girls...Actually, I don't think that's the right way to start this review off. Let's try again. Ever since middle school, I have been being psychologically damaged by girls and...oh screw it, let's just do this thing.\r\nGrisaia No Kajitsu (The Fruit of Grisaia) originally released as an adult visual novel in February 2011. Packed to the brim with with compelling flashbacks and story-driven action (And SEX), it quickly gained recognition and took off without a hitch. Being as successful as it was, Grisaia added two more additions to its franchise, those being Meikyuu and Rakuen.Needless to say, it has been speeding down a hill of publicity for it's unusually dark and twisted heroines, as well as it's protagonist (Yuuji Kazami) who is -- for lack of a better word -- a man on the edge without nothing to lose.\\n\\n\r\nIn Grisaia No Kajitsu, we become acquainted with Yuuji as he transfers out of a military/secret-service type gig and into a lavish high-school built to house mentally disturbed teenagers with a history of intense psychological trauma ranging from Aphasia to murderous tendencies. The catch is that the school is still relatively new and there are only five registered students (All female) at the moment. This first section of the trilogy serves as a method for viewers to become acquainted with those students and learn a bit about their pasts and how they wound up in a school so bizarre. However, things don't stay that simple and quickly become a bit more hectic as the pasts of those girls come back to haunt them.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, at least on the surface, is more than just a bad-ass guy becoming acquainted with five disturbed adolescents. It is a tale set there to illustrate how different people deal with different traumas. Packed with revenge, twisted memories, and death, Grisaia immediately becomes a story that viewers will not want to separate themselves from. Allow me to break it up into a few key components to better illustrate this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat sets the music of Grisaia apart from many other anime is, simply put, the range and diversity of it. Every song is immensely different from the former. Had it been constructed any other way, the show would topple down almost instantaneously. But Grisaia needs this varied collection of music, seeing as it deals with extremely varied feelings. Psychological trauma isn't a simplistic topic, and the way it is captured by different melodies in this soundtrack is near perfect. However, the music can become repetitious seeing as songs must be recycled once a previously-noted emotion becomes prevalent again. It's an unfortunate occurrence, but it doesn't deprecate the overall tone by that much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe character's in Grisaia No Kajitsu are easily the shining point of the series. And in the first episode of the show, each one is introduced in a well laid-out and timely-manner, not giving any single student the \"Upper-hand\" so-to-speak. What's great about Grisaia is that you meet every single character that matters in the first episode and don't have to deal with that rush that normally occurs when new characters show up halfway through the series. With everyone being introduced in the pilot, viewers continuously have time to grow attached to either a specific one or all of them in general (But Makina is mine so back off). The range of traumas you will encounter within these females will help grab hold of your interest and maybe even teach you a thing or two in the medical field. Another thing is that those traumas are presented in a way that doesn't necessarily make them look weak or insignificant. The fact that these girls were able to cope with situations so hopeless sets them up to be strong characters, much deeper and more complex than you'd typically encounter in the slice-of-life genre (Which this show somehow happens to fit into).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art, being irrefutably the weakest part of the show, is at least somewhat decent. Tolerable would be a good way to put it, seeing as it doesn't distract you by any means, but it could have been done better. There is a noticeable drop in quality when compared side-by-side to its visual novel counterpart. This, in turn, left a few high-strung fans of the series upset and sprinting toward the forums on MyAnimeList to break their keyboards as they complain about why the show sucks. It really doesn't though. The art is on-par with anything else to come out of a non-major studio in Japan. One thing to be noted though, is that the art becomes somewhat...less good as the show goes on, making it look more rushed -- like it was done with less care than in the earlier episodes. All in all, it's not something to worry about and it doesn't take away from the overall feeling Grisaia No Kajitsu has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story potentially could have been the shining part of Grisaia no Kajitsu had it been done correctly. But instead, it feels more like something written in simply to complement the characters, focusing more on flashbacks than the tasks at hand. The pacing of this show is ultimately what drags it down more than anything. Like I mentioned earlier, it gets off to a fantastic start and the playing-field is completely leveled for everyone immediately. But you'll notice as it progresses that the creators payed more attention to the characters they thought had better, more anime-style stories that would fit the production better. The playing-field was no longer leveled anymore. Some of the girls had just one or two episodes detailing their experiences, while some of the others had three or four. On the other hand, the story in the visual novel seems more fair and branches off into five different routes, giving you more time to understand just what is going (Or what went on) on in the lives of the girls. On top of this, there was one scenario near the end of the story where things just got a little too ridiculous. It's hard to get into it without spoiling anything, but there was a sequence of events that completely exuded all realism for a good 5-10 minutes, ultimately ruining the mood for me.\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia No Kajitsu is a show I'd recommend for either lovers of the darker-side of anime or entry-level viewers looking for something more \"Adult\" than shows like Dragonball Z or Naruto (Or anything else wrongly mistaken for what anime is as a whole). Grisaia does a sufficient job carrying itself to the end of season one and definitely leaves room for the story to improve in the two more seasons slated to come out for it. And even though the pacing can be a little rough, I'm sure you can enjoy the show just as much as I did.",

            "content": "In writing this review, i have played part of the visual novel before watching the anime, and so i will try my best to throw away any biases or pre-judgments that i may have.\r\nThe highlight points of the anime for me were definitely the Story, Character and Art.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story can simply be divided into two sections: the preliminary episodes where the setting and characters are introduced to us, and the individual arcs where each heroine is explored more deeply in her own story.\r\nArt:\r\nThroughout the anime, i can't help but admire the beautiful art and animation of the characters. The vibrant colors and character models aredone very well and is a good blend of maturity, elegance and cuteness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn my opinion one of the strongest point of this anime are the characters, each one of them is unique in their own way and have their own quirks and interests. They can all be comedic at times but also serious which makes them more entertaining to watch. Most importantly, the way each character behaves and act are tightly linked with their respective story allowing us to become more attached and feel empathy for them.\\n\\n\r\nWeaknesses:\\n\r\nOne of the flaws of Grisaia no Kajitsu is the short length of the series, this means that each heroine are not given much time to develop as much as they can and their story moves at a pace that makes it difficult for viewers to follow and become attached to.  As the focus are on the heroines, the male MC also does not appear to get as much development and at times seem to exist solely to become the aid to advance the heroines arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAll in all, Grisaia no Kajitsu is a very enjoyable anime combining elements of comedy, drama, romance and to a certain degree, tragedy. Some of the topics are quite dark and psychological in nature and may not be for everyone. But i urge people to give this ago and if you like it, definitely watch the two sequels since they answer many of the questions or doubts that you may have.",

It's emotional, intense, cute, funny, all while building a great sense of character depth. The main reason that people dislike this anime is because A) They've played the visual novel or B) The story is lacking. To combat scenario A, its only natural that the Visual Novel is a more complete telling of the story. I do believe thatthe Anime did a good job in catching the spirit of it, even if it did make it into a PGish version. If you have played the Visual Novel, you're enjoyment of this may be dampened because you will understand all the details that are left out and that serve to change the main points of the series. Watching the anime first, then playing the VN is perfectly fine and you will enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\n To scenario B, it's true that the story isn't the greatest. The main appeal of this series is the backstories and characters that the anime builds itself around. It doesn't have a strong central story but the back stories are solid and done very well. They produce many emotions in the audience including grief, happiness, and just that feeling that only moe can bring. \\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion, I'm mostly writing this review for the people that haven't played the VN. I want them to give this anime a chance because it has great characters and an even better art style. If you're a big fan of story, this may not be the anime for you. I enjoyed this anime but was discouraged before deciding to watch it by all the negative reviews that it got. I just wanted to show that the reasons for the opposition may not apply to the general audience.",

            "content": "\"The Fruit of Grisaia\" is one of the most uneven animes I've ever seen. It has moments where it is genuinely quite good, and moments where it is laughably bad. The content varies from near-ecchi levels of gratuitous boob and panty shots to decent relationship drama to somewhat disturbing horror, in a way that seems rather uncoordinated rather than deliberate. \r\nThe story concerns a boy with extensive military training, something of a Jason Bourne type of government-created super-soldier, who is more-or-less an ethical person and claims to just yearn for a typical high school experience. He is sent to an unusual school which has justa few other students, all of them comely lasses of course. It's not the most original plot in the world but what in this genre of anime really is? \\n\\n\r\nIn the style of many animes it then explores the back story of each of the girls in a semi-episodic format, through the lens of their relationship with the main character. These stories were where the series got so uneven, some of them are laughably cliche and inexplicable, but I did find three to be pretty good, if not exactly triumphs of realism. \\n\\n\r\nIt is just so weird to me, even by anime standards, that an anime would juxtapose panty shots with the heavier content in this series. As decent as the series was at times, it never really rose to the next level like other episodic not-really-a-harem shows. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, the silver lining is that the second season is so much more highly rated. I haven't watched it yet but I easily hung in with this one because of the promise of these characters and premise but with a better overall presentation. Here's hoping that pans out!\\n\\n",

I eventually started watching Grisaia, and finished it the day I started it. Yes, it's a bit short, and the pacing may be seriously wrong, but overall it's still a good anime. Not a great one, but still good enough to keep you interested. Now, let's get started with the review.\r\nStory - Overall: 7\r\nThere really isn't a story in Grisaia, but hereis the jist of it: A guy named Yuuji wanted a regular school life, and eventually was able to join a high school where there are only 5 other students, who are all girls. All the students have a troubled past, and Yuuji helps these students deal with there past. That's basically it. It's simple, but still is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - Overall: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is absolutely stunning, filled with bright colors. Sadly, the animation in the 3D parts of this anime are extremely choppy, and are left to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - Overall: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is really nice and fits well, and the opening is one of my favorite openings in anime of all time. No real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Overall: 10\\n\r\nEvery single character in Grisaia has a personality. No little the screen time, every character felt different and fresh compared to the overused anime archetypes (except for michiru, but she is waifu material anyway). Yuuji, the main male protagonist, is also one of my favorite main characters in anime ever, because he just is so different from the generic harem protagonist. Anyway, this is probably my favorite cast in anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThis anime is really good if you can overlook the pacing, the choppy animation, and skip the visual novel. If you pretend the visual novel doesn't exist, it's actually really good.",

            "content": "*This review contains spoilers.*\r\nNearly every season we are greeted by one or more harem Anime, a trend that started during the 2000s and continues to this day. In midst of this abundance of harem Anime we have the revolutionary (read that in a sarcastical tone) Grisaia no Kajitsu which offers some new takes onto the setting. Instead of being a slice of life high school romance or a fantasy battle harem, Grisaia has a much higher emphasis on action, violence, drama and deep psychological wounds. \r\nOur protagonist, Kazami Yuuji, transfers to a private school in hope of finally being able to live a normal schoollife. His background is not revealed until Grisaia no Meikyuu but it's foreshadowed at times that he apparently comes from a military-like background. Arriving at the school he notices that it only has 6 students of which 5 are girls. Wait ... what? This is a good example of unexplained settings that are there just because the plot wants it that way.\\n\\n\r\nAs time progresses and Yuuji is getting more and more in touch with the girls he is learning more and more of their respective pasts and tries to help them to overcome their problems. But as it turns out, the stories of each girl are absurd nonsense in almost every regard. Take a look at Makinas arc: She is the daughter of an influental family that has ties to the highest japanese politicians but her mother Kiyoko doesn't want her to become the next heir, so she hires someone to assassinate her. Yuuji then flees with Makina to the nearby city and plots a plan to kill her mother. In the end, he single-handedly invades the office building where Kiyoko is working, takes down everyone in his path and kills Kiyoko, all while being dressed as a mailman. If this isn't the kind of ridiculous story you want to see, then I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroines of Grisaia are stereotypes of the harem genre but with greatly exaggerated background stories. While the Visual Novel (VN) has some character development here and there (especially Yumiko), the Anime lacks any character development whatsoever. As such, most of the conflicts in Grisaia seem pretty pointless because one of the goals of drama is experiencing characters growing while facing their problems. The shining star among all characters would probably be our protagonist Yuuji: He is serious, well-mannered, strong, intelligent, adept - he can handle any situation, even if it's a 5 vs. 1 fight. Yuuji is the kind of protagonist that would fit well into an action Anime. But Grisaia is not an action Anime. Yuujis cold personality and indifferent expression doesn't fit well together with romance or drama. He lacks any sort of empathy and it's hard to believe he could develop feelings (they don't necessarily have to be of the romantic kind) for any one of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is fanservice. The VN contains frequent a sexual innuendos (sarcasm, wordplay ...) and such, but nothing of that remained in the Anime. Instead of using ecchi in a stilistic manner, Grisaia shoves it bluntly into your face (for example in episode 2, there is a scene where Sachi is showing Yuuji around the school and the camera solely focuses on her ass because her panties are visible). Call me harsh, but this kind of usage of ecchi is a sign of a low quality Anime in almost all cases.\\n\\n\r\nIf you take at look at how well the Grisaia Anime adapts the contents from the VN, the Anime becomes even worse.\\n\\n\r\n- Makina (2 episodes): Her character development is missing, Yuujis first meeting with Kiyoko is missing (therefore giving no explanation on why Yuuji immediately resolves to killing her instead of trying to solve the conflict in another way), the end of her arc is a combination of her bad and good ending\\n\r\n- Amane (4 episodes): The end of her arc (4th episode) is an anime-only story\\n\r\n- Yumiko (1 episode): Her entire episode is basically an anime-only story with only a few short flashback scenes taken from the VN that give a glimpse of her past\\n\r\n- Michiru (2 episodes): Most of her background story is missing, the background story of the \"other\" Michiru is missing as well, her good ending (therefore the whole conclusion to her arc) is left out entirely\\n\r\n- Sachi (1 episode): Her character development is missing, the second half of the episode is an anime-only story\\n\\n\r\nAmanes route is the one that was adapted rather well (even if the end is different). Her route basically only consists of her flashback scene and the Anime does a pretty good job on telling the most important events that happened during this flashback. With a whopping 4 episodes, Amanes arc is also longest, therefore having the advantage of simply having more time to tell a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect where I'd actually say the adaptation did something right is the fact that the romantic developments from the VN were left out. This may sound weird when you consider that Grisaia is a harem Anime but as I hinted above: The romance in Grisaia suffers from it's nearly emotionless protagonist. While Yuuji is a cool dude by himself, he doesn't fit together with romance in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's the conclusion?\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime adaptation of Grisaia has gained a fair amount of popularity due to being highly unusual for a harem Anime. To a certain degree I can understand that it's nice to see something fresh, but that doesn't automatically make it good. Grisaia is one of many examples of a story that tries to be too complex, contains too many themes and is overall just unbelievable, incoherent, ridiculous, absurd and badly executed. The more the episodes progress, the more \"what the fuck\"s I did have on my mind.\\n\\n\r\nI think Grisaia is as bad as any other generic harem out there (albeit for different reasons). Don't expect too much.\\n\\n\r\n3/10",

            "content": "\"At this point, no matter how I change, the things I've lost won't come back.\"\r\n-Kazami Yuuji\r\nThis quote describes this adaptation rather accurately. The content cut for the sake of the adaptation cannot be replaced, no matter how well the adaptation is done.\r\nAs an adaptation, Grisaia no Kajitsu was doomed from the start. No matter how you look at it, 13 episodes is not even nearly enough to adapt the 70+ hours of content in the visual novel. Facing other limitations like having to convert to a harem format, the struggle to fit everything into 13 episodes and maintaining the harem's status quo can lead tonothing else than disaster.\\n\\n\r\nThe end result is a mess devoid of any kind of character development. The story is only a shadow of the original work, having been cut, rearranged, rushed and changed considerably. The sad thing is that even what remained was ruined by poor pacing. I must admit that after my first watchthrough, I had trouble remembering which of the girls was which (something I've never had trouble with).\\n\\n\r\nIf it had been a 24+ episode anime (and preferably done by J.C. Staff) it would've without a doubt have been better. Each of the heroines deserved atleast 3-4 episodes for their story arc, with the remaining episodes going to the vital character development and building the base for the individual arcs, something that the anime never managed to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is basically a direct import from the visual novel. It's not the greatest and most memorable sountrack ever, but it does it's job well enough. My only complaint would be that a couple of my favourite songs from the visual novel didn't make the cut.\\n\\n\r\nBy far my favourite thing about Grisaia is it's characters. It's main selling points are it's (sometimes overly sexual) comedy and the contrasting dark psychological aspects. The characters perform both these roles admirably, and manage to remain interesting and unique while doing so. What makes them so amazing is that although they might at first seem extremely stereotypical, they characters' personalities are actually far deeper and more complicated. Being a harem anime, there's plenty of attractive girls to pick from, and there's most certainly something for everyone (unless you're looking for traps, in which case you'll have to wait until Grisaia no Meikyuu.)\\n\\n\r\n The choice of Sakurai Takahiro as Yuuji's voice actor was probably the best decision made regarding the anime adaptation. Delivering his sarcastic comedy with deadly precision, he gives a fitting voice to the once mute protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for Grisaia no Kajitsu is 7/10. Despite all it's fallbacks, it still has a part of the essence of my favourite visual novel. It was good enough that I felt it was still somewhat enjoyable to watch, and I don't regret watching it in hindsight. However, if you've played the visual novel or intend to do so in the near future (which I recommend you do if you have even faint interest in the VN genre), I suggest you pass on this, as you'll probably just end up dissappointed or spoil the far superior VN for the sake of a mediocre anime adaptation.",

With that being said, I almost stopped watching after the first two episodes because I thought it was silly and boring. I'm glad I stuck around though because I was so wrong. Upon first look, the character don't seem like anything special but once you learn their backstories, it brings each one into a whole new light. My favorite character is Amane. I felt like she and Yuuji had the strongest connection and also that she needed him the most out of everyone. I feltlike the time that she and Yuuji spent together on screen was cut way short(not her backstory) so I even ended up buying the VN. OH MAN! On the VN, I watched what I assume to be Amane's happy ending with Yuuji and it destroyed me. I'm pretty dead inside and thinking about it still makes me want to cry. Amane and Yuuji are now probably my favorite anime couple of all time. It's pretty amazing how two broken people can fit together so well.",

You will be guaranteed to find one of the girls likeable or even the MC who fits in as one of my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC very strongly reminds me of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei's MC.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI'm a fan of the ecchi/romance/action genre of my shows and this fits right in with them with a unique edge to give it a higher score than other shows on my list. After the first few episodes i knew i had to binge watch the rest of it because it was addicting.\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\\n",

The artwork is superb and it's refreshing to see this anime design it's characters eyes to make them look more Asian than the widely used \"Western/European\" style.\r\nFor me, the comedic scenes were so funny I was in tears, and the dramatic and emotional scenes had me in tears also.  SoI guess, this anime had me in tears most of the time.  \\n\\n\r\nAwesome show.",

            "content": "Grisaia no Kajitsu, Le Fruit de la Grisaia, The Fruit of Grisaia, or whatever you want to call it. Grisaia no Kajitsu is the anime adaptation of an Eroge, or adult visual novel. Note I have watched Kajitsu, Capice, and Rakuen but I haven't played the game yet, but I have a great understanding and comparison between the two. With that knowledge, I bring an anime review. I will be reviewing Caprice and Rakuen very soon. There are no H-Scenes, this anime adaption is based off the M rated version of the game, that has all H-Scenes removed.\r\nLet's get this started shall we? Grisaia noKajitsu revolves around our protagonist, Yuuji Kazami, a mysterious transfer student with an unknown background. As his job of being the main character, he fulfills this by extending the plot by talking to the other students of his high school. He learns the past of the five heroines, and earns their trust or love? Anyways, this season was fully meant to be a starter for Grisaia no Rakuen fully.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start our pluses...\\n\\n\r\n1. Artwork is great, same artist from the original game, who doesn't want that? The artwork is really well, that's it.\\n\\n\r\n2. The voice actors are amazing. Matching with the emotions and personalities of each character was perfect.\\n\\n\r\n3. Storyline is interesting and appealing.\\n\\n\r\n4. Main character is badass and is funny when dealing with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\n5. The five heroine's backgrounds are explained fully, making them easier to understand their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nTime for some cons.\\n\\n\r\n1. Unnecessary censoring. There is an ecchi genre to it, plus gore at that too. Kajitsu was rated M for a reason, and rated R as an anime for a reason too. Censorship is completely meaningless. Might as well say its PG13.\\n\\n\r\n2. We had to wait to learn about our protagonist's past in Caprice, months later. So we had no information about who the hell was Yuuji Kazami. I'll count this as plot holes.\\n\\n\r\n3. Yuuji Kazami's goal is not explained until next season in Caprice.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 7/10 for these reasons. It was interesting, creative, and unique. All you can feel in this anime is this ''Mysterious'' vibe from the protagonist. Do I recommend it? Yeah, if you're willing to watch the rest of the series. Grisaia no Kajitsu cannot go by itself and have a food rating without the help from Caprice and the rest of the series in Rakuen. So if you have some free time, then yes, go ahead and watch it. It's worth the time. I'm not too sure about anime newcomers though, newcomers should pass this anime, but veterans on the other hand, go for it.",

            "content": "This is a once in a lifetime series. A show so monumentally bad you can't help but watch in wonder. Just about every story arc goes to levels of over-the-top usually reserved for soap operas, and on top of that it also has every harem cliche. You can tell it was based off a visual novel because of how much the show sucks the main character's dick. He's a cool badass who saves all the ladies from their demons and they all love him from the get-go. Usually I don't even have a problem with the harem trope, it saves a lot of time byskipping boring set-up and you can jump right into the characters, and it can work well when you have good enough characters to explore, but this series seems to thinks it's legitimately a good writing technique. In fact, even outside the harem trope, all the writing is extremely convenient. True, you'd have no idea what was going to happen, but why would the things that happen ever happen?  I would love to list out every silly, ridiculous, over-the-top thing that happens but you'll have to take my word for it, it will blow your goddamn mind!\\n\\n\r\nWhat baffles me most is that people seem to think this is a legitimately emotionally effective series. Apparently the VN is \"life-changing\" but I just can't possibly see that being accurate. I could really shit on this series all day but I can't at all say this wasn't the most fun I had this fall season. I was in stitches through every \"serious\" moment and every \"joke\" falls flat. It's actually somehow unique in it's abundance of cliches. I think that was 2 new seasons it promoted at the end? I'm ok with that.... I think.",

            "content": "As soon as i got done watching this I had to sit back and think for a minute. I knew it would probably be some sort of harem that wasn't going to break the mold or anything, but i ended up being surprised. Let me tell you all about it fam.\r\nAs soon as episode one i noticed its kinda just lousy fan service and mostly 2D characters. I understand that they all had some sort of tragic past but that didn't stop it them from being unoriginal in any way. You have the ususal assortment of Tsudere, Silent but deadly, Pervert girl, Maid, and Loli.Pretty standard stuff. Pick which everone you want and pretend that they are going to end up with our cardboard cutout of a main character,Yuuji.\\n\\n\r\nSo the first 7 episodes are generic filtered harem style \"boy meets girl\" cycling through each chick every couple of episodes, while throwing hints of Yuuji's tragic and blood stained past and shit like that. So each girls development is going to be purely based on the couple of episodes we delve into their \"tragic past problems\" and such. Its supposed to be explaining the reasons why thy act estranged like they do, but for half of them i don't buy it as a comparable reason for being 2D. \\n\\n\r\nThere was one girl left (the Pervert girl) who hadn't been through the ringer with our titular male lead yet. Like all the others i expected to witness a two or possible 3 episode sequence of her cliche/mundane tragedies and see er strengthen her relationship with our Hero. (not that it'd matter because we all know he'd never get with one)\\n\\n\r\nBut... for no reason... the show decided to get good. And i mean pretty top tier in my opinion. (or it could seem top tier due to the fact that the rest was bottom tier) \\n\\n\r\nThe Pervert girls back story not only introduces a new and interesting character, but it also ties back to the main character because its his sister. Now that's not unheard of or anything but it was worth noting. As a middle schooler her and a bunch of female class mates get stranded in between the bottom of a mountain face and possibly miles of jungle like forest. With all means of communication cut of from the outside world. The girls have to figure out the best way to sustain themselves and find rescue. As to not spoil anymore of the actual good part of the show i will not go to in depth, but you should know that it is actually pretty damn good. So good in fact i couldn't help but wonder why it wasn't created about just the Pervert girls tragic backstory. Literally all 13 episodes could have easily been dedicated to it and the show would have actually earn'd a lot of praise i think. The way the dive into how the psyche breaks down and the primal instincts to survive break through logical reasoning was very well done. It also works its way into the present time story really well too, and made the wrap up of the season quite enjoyable id say.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is the deal. \\n\r\nepisodes 1-7          Rating: 5\\n\r\nepisodes 8-13        Rating:9 \\n\\n\r\nI'd say its worth watching the first 7 just to get to the back 5. It helps build up a little character relations as well i wouldnt recommend just going right to the back 5 but you could and you'd still enjoy it but if only a bit less id say.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Don't watch the back 5 episodes if you are squeamish.",

            "content": "Knowing that Grisaia is sourced from a VN from Frontwing, which is well known in the H circles, I kind of had an idea of what to expect going in- a harem with girls drooling over the main protagonist with copious amounts of fan service. Fortunately, this fruit tastes quite different from its appearance (Grisaia is a modification of the French word \"grisaille\", which describes a means of painting in monochrome). Grisaia is about a group of five very special and privileged girls that attend a normal-sized school despite being the only students. This special status is granted to girls who have suffered immense traumain their lives, and the school is meant as a place of peace and recovery. In enters our protagonist, a calm, level-headed super-soldier like Sagara Sousuke but with common sense. Having decided that he wants to move on from his military-based past, he is sent to this special school to fulfill his wish of an ordinary school life. He is apparently greeted with anything but that- girls with multiple personalities, girls that randomly roll around on his bed and smell his bedding, and girls that attack him at every opportunity. Will Yuuji's prior training be enough to survive this new onslaught?\\n\\n\r\nGrisaia is by no means a normal harem; in fact, the romance aspect is perhaps even questionable. The show combines a typical ecchi-based harem and some comedy with a much darker, thriller-based heroine storyline. This show is really more about Yuuji getting to know each of the girls and eventually helping them heal from their wounds, rather than the girls being all over him. The most memorable aspect of the show is how dark it is; there are copious amounts of gore and blood, in addition to brutal beatings and some hauntingly disturbing scenes. There is probably more censoring due to gore than ecchi in the TV version. Think you've got the guts to watch through it? Looking for something different to try? Well you've found it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation in Grisaia is solid. First off, the show is interestingly rendered in widescreen, as if a movie! The show is drawn with a moderately saturated palette, though occasionally you'll be treated to an eye candy of vivid ocean views complete with moving clouds and sunsets, though the studio apparently doesn't understand physics as clouds constantly swirl in opposite directions. The show has some pretty nice backgrounds and a large variety of scenery. The drawing is crisp in general though they occasionally purposely blur parts of the view, as if to imitate camera focus. There is occasional CGI usage for various things such as cars and waves but it isn't too distracting. The characters are also well drawn. All the girls are easily distinguishable and have notably diverse wardrobes. As a unique trait, all females all drawn with red-tinted eyelashes. Overall, emotions are well expressed and reactions are believable, the exception of course is our protagonist who shows very few emotions throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an unexpected amount of action in this show. Let's just say Yuuji's skills from his prior occupation are frequently utilized. Expect aggressive driving, shootouts, and explosions. The battles aren't like the common minute long swordplay battles found in other action-based harems, it is rather like the battles involving Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei; battles are often one-sided and end within a few seconds, granted they are very thrilling seconds. As mentioned before, there is substantial gore and blood in this show, so much so that censoring kicked in repeatedly. There is still plenty of fan service as well, so you will enjoy lots of censoring in general with this show. Expect endless panty shots and naughty winds. More unexpectedly, there are also mature oriented scenes including attempted rape and obvious girl masturbation scenes. In summary, the show is more intense than I originally expected in terms of both action and ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound package was average overall. The OP is a light pop piece with a pretty weak melody but a fair stringed instrument accompaniment. The show has a multitude of EDs that for the most part follows the particular central heroine for the episode. The EDs range from melancholy to lighthearted playfulness but I didn't find any of them particularly good. The BGM is supportive when necessary but completely absent for a good portion of the show. Though not particularly memorable, the BGM was used to great effect when it mattered; insert songs are also utilized to highlight critical moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is fairly interesting, composed mostly of seasoned supporting veterans. Kaori Mizuhashi, Hiroko Taguchi, and Akane Tomonaga all share credit for giving their respective characters a bit of flair. Maybe it's just me but I found Makina Irisu's voice to be a tad annoying. It is an overall good performance by the cast overall, especially in the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSurprisingly, this show rather reminds me of GTO, especially the aspect of an individual going way out of his way in order to help alleviate the root cause of someone else's hardship. The story highlights five girls, each of whom has extraordinary circumstances. Whether it is political intrigue or a random fascination with bombs, expect some curveballs and some dark material. While the show isn't depressing overall, do expect it to delve into rather forbidden territory, ethically.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts with a few introductory episodes before then having the protagonist work his magic with each of the girls. The girls all have a crazy situation that ultimately requires Yuuji's unconditional military might (and his connections) to resolve, the plot progression is both interesting and engaging. Each arc is something of a self-contained thriller with its own rising action and climax that lasts between one and two episodes. The one exception is the last arc, which lasts a total of four episodes and represents perhaps the darkest, most chilling part of the show. The show ends with a teaser of things to come as a second season is already in the works as of this review. Furthermore, there is an OVA out that greatly explains Yuuji's past and why he goes to such lengths to help others.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYou're not going to find any cookie-cutter heroines here. All of the girls are definitely a bit on the weird side, but given their past you can see why. Expect a good amount of character exposition as well as character development. The girls' attachment to Yuuji grows naturally and it's nice to see the effects linger after a heroine's arc is over, unlike Amagami SS and its clones. Though a tad unrealistic, the fact that the school has no other students (and apparently teachers other than the principal) conveniently eliminates a common source of unnecessary supporting characters. Indeed, the show is very focused on the heroines, and to good effect.\\n\\n\r\nYuuji on the other hand doesn't get much attention. How did he turn into a super spy/assassin/sniper in the first place? How is he already so \"intimately\" familiar with girls given his military past (unlike Sagara Sosuke)? As mentioned before, the OVA answers much of this.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis show was an unexpected surprise, in a good way. What starts as a seemingly ordinary harem, took a drastic turn and attempted something very different, perhaps a bit risqu\u00e9 but definitely memorable. Apparently, the original VN is quite popular too, and there's even a Kickstarter up to get it translated into English.\\n\\n\r\nLooking for something fresh and new? Perhaps something with harem roots but goes somewhere new? I'd recommend giving this a shot, and make sure to taste at least the first heroine arc as the first few introductory episodes really don't give a good indication for the rest of the show.",

Also I will be comparing this with the Visual Novel so if you aren't interested in that then you may wanna read another persons review!\r\nThe first question I must ask is why is this only 13 episodes long while the visual novel has much more to offer? With this let's push right into the story first. It's way too short and with this it's bound to be rushed, this is very typical with Visual Novels though since they normallytry to condense many hours of content into a short 12-13 episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was rushed from the beginning. They skipped over tons of material which could have been used to devlop the characters much more than they already were, which we will talk about in a bit. They had 3 episodes designated to characted devolpment then right with episode 4 they decided that they needed to start ending it and started to roll though each girls route's which were heavily modifed and almost nothing like the routes from the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. There is a character for everyone's tastes! The big breasted Onee-chan, the Tsundere, The Kuudere, The Maid, The Loli and The Cool Main Character. Also because of it being rushed the characters are underdevloped and you have troubles feeling bad for them when you hear about the troubles they had to go through.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first watched this anime I enjoyed it but after playing the visual novel I don't enjoy it as much anymore. The characters are underdevloped and the story is rushed as hell and alot of people didn't like it. It may have done some damage to the name of the source material but if someone did actual picked it up i am sure they enjoyed it as much as I did.\\n",

            "content": "This is a review by someone who has not played the visual novel. To sum up my thoughts in one sentence, I would say this show would've been perfection if it was extended to 20+ episodes, but even then, I found it refreshing and enjoyable. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nUpon first glance, this story seems like a stereotypical school harem with all the accompanying tropes of a dense mc and many ____-deres, but it's actually quite a dark and suspenseful plot. The structure is a bit similar to Clannad's, where the mc learns about each girl's past and does his best to resolve their issues so that theycan find peace in the present day. The difference is that instead of having issues like \"my parents didn't buy me a gift for my birthday,\" it's a lot darker and involves murder, suicide, and all the other bad stuff you can think of. This means each girl has her own arc, and that each one doesn't really have an effect on other girls' arcs. There's no problem with designing a story this way, but the problem was that each arc was not properly balanced in terms of pacing. One of the girls literally only receives one episode for her entire route, while another girl's takes up 4 episodes. This means the show is a combination of well-developed stories and poorly developed ones, but even the characters that did have lengthy arcs felt rushed. The saving grace is the originality of the story with all its previously mentioned, non-traditional dark elements in a harem show. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA great OP and decent ED, but these are heavily subjective opinions. The art is pretty great too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat is refreshing about this show is the mc is not a dunce, and instead actually has skills and awareness about what's going on around him. Since all the female characters have such dark and disturbing pasts, he's not going to be able to help them heal with just some therapeutic talk; he'll sometimes need to use force to drive away their past demons. It was very refreshing to see such a harem mc. \\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the story part, the characters do not get an equal treatment of screen time, so some of them are well-developed and have a comprehensive past along with complex personalities, while others are bland and forgettable. Nonetheless, each character is intriguing as their pasts dictate who they are, making for some more original heroines than are usually found in harems. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite knowing that the show was rushed, it was suspenseful watching each of the heroines' messed up pasts and seeing how the mc resolved them. In essence, you'll never think \"wow I've seen this plot device before.\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show was rushed for sure, but I think the originality of the show made up for a lot of it. Each arc was intense, unsettling, and even though the conclusion of each arc was predictable, the climaxes were not. If the pacing had just been drawn out more, this show would have been a masterpiece. If you prioritize the content of the plot over the pacing, definitely give this a watch.",

            "content": "I did not know the source material beforehand, which was pretty obviously a Visual Novel.  I watched this because I am binging on Sakurai Takahiro anime.  ;)\r\nStory (6/10):  The story is semi-episodic, with each girl's route being its own arc, and them all tying together at Mihama Academy, an \"ordinary\" school with only 6 students and one principal/teacher.  Naturally Kazami Yuuji, our male protagonist rescues/helps the girls in turn.  Kazami is not an ordinary student, even though that's what he wants to be, but he's clearly had some form of black ops background, because he can kick some serious ass,and has connections to an agency that comes to his aid when he needs it.  The girls are also not what they seem at first glance, each of them has a complex back story that brought them to Mihama Academy.  The set of stories isn't the most realistic, with the exception of Amane, who was the sole survivor of a bus accident in the mountains, but they're all compelling enough.  It'd have been better if more episodes had been allotted to all of the non-Amane stories, since they don't get a whole lot of time; the anime feels very compressed.  The ending seems tacked on, as if it doesn't actually belong there.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10): The girls all look unique enough, but Kazami's design is very generic.  Overall this isn't particularly impressive, though I've certainly seen much worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10): Sakurai is as always breathing a whole lot of life into his character.  All the girls' VAs are decent, but nobody stands out; none of my favourite female seiyuu are in this anime.  The BGM is not bad, though maybe a bit repetitive.  OP and ED are fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):  Contrary to the usual bland harem protagonist, Kazami Yuuji is actually brimming with personality, which was a pleasant surprise (otherwise Sakurai would have been wasted on the role, but seiyuu don't appear to have the choice that film actors do in regard to which roles they take on).\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I didn't care for at all is Amane.  I don't like her big-boobed self throwing herself at Kazami, especially when it later becomes clear exactly why she's doing it -- but it feels to me very much out of place.  She should have come clean before propositioning him.  And what she should come clean about -- I actually agree with her. It was not entirely her fault, because it was a harrowing situation, but she was a wimpy, whiny, stupid girl, and somebody else paid the price for that.  Maybe I should have more empathy, but I just don't.  If we're talking life or death, pull yourself the fuck together already.  Did I mention she should have come clean instead of trying to seduce Kazami from the start.  You betcha.  This is so not my ship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):  Overall I enjoyed this more than I usually enjoy harem anime, because the stories were more substantial and because Kazami is such an unusual protagonist.  He isn't the blushing, easily embarrassed guy who can't handle women -- he treats them all very matter of factly most of the time, though he is also kind when they end up crying.  I enjoyed his dialogue the most, and he had some unconventional ways of rescuing the damsels in distress.\\n\\n\r\nI could have done without the fan service.  Especially the panty shots were at times misplaced into the most dramatic scenes -- if somebody is running for their life, and it's not a comedic moment, I don't want to see a bloody panty shot; it rips me right out of the story.  I don't mind fan service if it's done in terms of the story; here it was just stupid.",

            "content": "In case you missed it, Grisaia no Kajitsu is rated R+ for Mild Nudity. Just so we're on the same page here.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is one of a wave of anime based on popular Visual Novels of its time. As I haven't yet tried the VN, this review is based solely on the anime, and not some pre-existing expectations like the majority I've seen here.\r\nAlso, this will be a review on the full series, but I'll avoid major spoilers.\r\nThe story starts with the interrogation of a suspicious individual who claims he was on his way to school. However, Yuuji Kazami isn't a typical high schoolboy. He not only seems incredibly mature and calm for a student, but is also beyond typical high school age. As the story continues, it becomes apparent that not only is Yuuji far from normal, but so is his entire school.\\n\r\nCould Yuuji be the solution to this broken everyday life?\\n\\n\r\nQuality - 7\\n\r\nBeautiful Art, a deep, interesting Story, and acceptable Sound...so why such a mediocre score for Quality? Well, my main problem with the story was honestly the pacing. It may seem like a trivial matter, but when huge portions of what seem like fillers are skipped, it changes character dynamics quite a bit. Keep in mind that even without familiarity with the source material I was able to distinguish that the plot was rushed, and you should be able to see why fans of the VN were so upset by this project. Each arc blends into the next, though not seamlessly at all. It felt like I was watching movie after movie rather than a single story. To top it off, because they sacrificed character development to rush the plot, it's not great for rewatching. All this negativity didn't detract from a few beautiful moments, but did make the characters seem superficial or fake.\\n\\n\r\nLikability - 9\\n\r\nDespite some aforementioned issues, this is a truly cool story. I love the main character and the action scenes were almost all amazing. While it did remind me a lot of a VN, it wasn't in a negative way like usual. there was clear progression and while it did feel almost like watching a game walkthrough (with how effortlessly the MC handled each situation) it had good funny, dark, and happy moments exactly how it should have. I thought each arc could practically have been a standalone anime, which meant for me that a lot of enjoyment came from a relatively short viewing time. Pacing is again the enemy of Likability, but I already covered that so let's continue.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendability - 6\\n\r\nNot only does this have the usual Harem and Ecchi tags, but it also contains Nudity AND has some really dark/depressing parts. Despite all of this, I feel that anyone who likes action-y stories and/or is willing to watch an anime for a kickass MC is within the target group of this anime. To be frank, it doesn't get \"better\" as it goes, so if it doesn't catch your interest it's fine to give up. Though by the same reasoning, why aren't you just watching the first episode right now? This is your official recommendation from me: Just give it a try. You might be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating - 8",

            "content": "I started the anime just to watch another one of my guilty pleasure, fan service, harem shows but got so much more out it than I ever would have expected.\r\nStory - 7\r\nI wouldn't say there is anything to special about the story itself. Its just a guy that has gone through some shit who just wants to go to high school like any other teenager and live a normal life but ends up going to a school with only 5 students who are all female that all have their fair share of baggage as well. His relationship progresses with all of them just as allharems do. They all eventually fall in love with the MC due him helping them deal with their individual trauma. While cliche I much prefer it over the MC just being a really nice guy who all the girls just cant help but fall in love with.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed the darker tone of the art style since it fit so well with the overall mood of the anime. When things weren't so dark and depressing in the story itself the art gave off a very calming vibe.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nI think the OST fit very well and practically the only reason I don't rate it higher is just because I personally didn't care for it as well as the OP and the EDs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is where I feel Grisia no Kajitsu really shines. While at first it seems like you have your typical bad ass, quiet, transfer student with his harem of cliche girls, it develops into much more. They give each girl a tragic backstory and the troupes each of them are taken to the extreme and are acknowledged throughout. After the MC helps each one of them get past their trauma they of course fall in love with him which makes it seem so much more genuine than most other harem shows out there. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe psychological element in a harem is something that I never come across. Right here it works so well. It makes all of the characters feel like actually characters making me more invested in these characters than in any other anime in the genre. By far the best harem I have seen up until this point. Anyone who enjoys harem-esk anime would love Grisaia and even if the genre isn't for you, it is still a fantastic show with awesome characters.",

I loved the visual novel, beginning to end, and once I learned of the anime adaptation, I needed to see it. Little did I know it would be this good. Everything about it piqued my interest. Once I was finished with it, I had found one of my new favorite anime.\r\nStory\r\n------------\r\nThe story is executed very well in my opinion. Naturally, as the visual novel is quite lengthy, they could not include everything. But they did include every important bit for the story to progress smoothly. Also, the story itself I found interesting as well.From the visual novel to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nThe art style is, as it was in the visual novel, breathtaking. I loved it beyond belief. The beautiful art makes the characters stand out, the environments vibrant, and the occasional fanservice that much better. :3 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nCharacter is key in anime, and Grisaia nailed this aspect once again. Every character is just amazing in their own way, and the character development throughout the series stays consistent, which is a great thing.  Also, character design is varied and unique as well, with a wide variety of characters in the cast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Grisaia no Kajitsu is an amazing anime adaptation that should be enjoyed be many more people. In my opinion, there is nothing to lose from watching this masterpiece. Naturally, opinions differ, and I understand that. But I do hope people who are interested in this show will watch it. :3",

However I never played any of them so I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Its kind of like Full Metal Panic because of the super over-powered, ex military m.c. who transfers into a school and then its also similar to Bakemonogatari where all of the female characters have little mini arcs and they're each weirdly connected to the m.c. in a kind of haremy way but its not really like a true harem if that makes sense. Also, it has lots of different waifus toargue about which is always fun. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is definitely enjoyable but it had the potential to be a masterpiece if they fleshed it out properly and made it longer... Each season could have been atleast 24 episodes. If you like end up liking the show, the second season is really cool because it goes back and develops the characters more.",

What you need to know is that this show is a triller anime that somehow follows all the harem anime tropes. You will consistently have some pulse pounding and compelling action on screen that's cut by its harem theme.The main character is compelling, everyone's backstory is mysterious, and the show does a good job of answering most of your questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a series worth a watch if you enjoy harem shows, yet also one where you can get a kick out of the absurd story as well.",

            "content": "If you have read the visual novel then you will understand that a lot either has been cut out or changed. This is understandable though, as I am guessing there was a small budget and story needed to be done so that the main character helps all the girls instead of following the route of one. If they did do each route seperately, they could have easily have got 4 or5x the amount of episodes they had. While I understand why, the problem is because a lot is cut out, the anime lacks the same level of detail and development as the VN, the charactersare not as developed and the past trauma that these characters have doesn't seem as dark. \\n\r\n-------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nStory - The story is about a young man called Kazami yuji who comes to Mihama Academy, a school of 5 others besides himself. The anime is split in arcs in which Yuj helps each of the girls to come to terms with thier dark pasts.   \\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - The art is good, but it does have a few problems like the odd bit of hair going behind a characters eye (because apparently that happens). The sound is ok, but not really great. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nKazami Yuji - A very capable young man who works for a Japanese government agency, He, like the main female characters, has a dark past. All he wants is a normal school life. He usually cautious and displays unorthadox military methods. \\n\\n\r\nYumiko Sakaki - One of the 6 students at Mihama Academy. Due to her past, she is reluctant to make friends and tends to keep to herself, she is also the most reluctant to accept Yuji, going as far as to flash a box cutter at him and to use an online site to find any info on him, all without success. She eventually accepts Yuji. \\n\\n\r\nAmane Sou - Amane acts like a big sister type of character and tries to seduce Yuji using her well developed body. She also acts like a motherly figure to fellow student Makina. She is good at cooking, has an interest in cars and drives a motorcycle. She was involved in an accident involving her school bus when she was younger. \\n\\n\r\nMakina Irisu - Makina is more of an immature but carefree child. At first she avoided Yuji, but warmed up to him after he helped her catch a crawfish. She is easily infuenced by the others behaviour and speaks in childish way. Her family is extremely powerful and wealthy and so Makina is able to speak several foreign languages due to travelling abroard as a young girl, and has an insanely large amount of money in a bank account. \\n\\n\r\nSachi Komine - Sachi almost always wears a maid uniform due to being told by some people that she should wear one. Sachi is probably the one who is most haunted by her past. She takes everything asked of her seriously, even if it was meant as a joke which causes trouble. IMO, She is probably the most affected by her past. \\n\\n\r\nMichiru Matsushima - Michiru is a noisy, silly and energetic girl who tries to be a tsundere, because of her silliness she tends to annoy the others. Michiru can be summed up by thinking that vitamin C will help make her smarter, she is actually confusing vitamin C for DHA. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - If haven't read the VN then you'll definitely like this, I also recommend the VN which you can get on Steam or Denpasoft. If you have read the VN, then you will be disappointed by the large amount cut as well as the less detailed pasts of the characters and the different methods used by Yuji to solve the girls problems.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review may contain minor spoilers. Read at your own discretion.\r\nGrisaia no Kajitsu is an adaptation of the Front Wing visual novel, released in 2011 to much praise. I'd personally go as far to say that it's easily one of my favorites. Needless to say, I was really excited to watch this anime adaptation, despite my (justified) skepticism. Even reading at an above average pace, Grisaia no Kajitsu is long, and I mean 60-80 hours long. Throwing that together in 4 hours of animation is impossible without sacrificing many things, but in this case, they sacrificed maybe too much.\r\nI'm sure you already know thefundamental premise behind Grisaia no Kajitsu, but if you've forgotten by some stretch of the imagination, let me run through it quickly for you. Kazami Yuuji is a young man with a troubled past and a dangerous \"job\" that leads to him desiring a normal teenage life. To that extent, he ends up at the gated Mihama Academy, a private school designed for those with extreme circumstances to thrive in a relatively \"normal\" environment. This is Yuuji's opportunity to lead a normal high school life together with the other five students, who also so happen to be girls.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a simple premise, but things turn out to be much different than they look on the surface, and while the girls attempt to live a normal life along with Yuuji, he notices that he must face his own troubles along with those of the girls he interacts with daily. In the visual novel, this leads to you picking one of the girls and Yuuji facing a problem with himself that allows him to improve and help the girl he's in love with. The individual routes are incredibly well written, and Grisaia no Kajitsu crafts an amazing story along with interesting multifaceted characters that you learn to care for.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the anime adaptation live up to all that? Well, it doesn't, which is precisely the problem.\\n\\n\r\nWhile 8bit's adaptation gets the fundamentals down for the most part, what you get past that is a shoddy thrown together synopsis of sorts. It's a bit harsh, but I'd say that the anime is the equivalent of looking up a Wikipedia article and seeing how the routes play out. But even then, that wouldn't be accurate, considering how drastic the way the anime had to be changed to work not only in its 13 episode boundaries, but to work in a way that Yuuji could help all the girls without really picking one. That leads to many of the episodes past the initial few (which mostly are to set up the characters, though to not much avail) feeling incredibly blunt and hollow. Yuuji seems to resolve the problems with methods that don't seem to have any context to them, or Yuuji containing an item or information that the show doesn't convey clearly to the viewer because the build-up has all been removed.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the story's biggest flaw, which is pacing, of which the show has none to spare. With the first four episodes essentially for setting up, that leaves 9 episodes to sum up all of the backstories and individual issues for each girl, which isn't nearly enough. Michiru, Sakaki, and Sachi all only get one episode and that leads to the horrendous Sakaki episode with the least amount of coherent sense to it, expecting the viewer to just accept the events with very little explanation. Michiru and Sachi's episodes are essentially abridged versions of the VN routes but in the same vein, there are too many things that happen abruptly without any explanation, and it leaves gaps that the viewers are just supposed to fill in themselves. Makina gets two episodes, but even with that much it rings hollow due to the amount of sudden time shifts that occur, and events that don't even seem remotely connected to each other. The conclusion is never foreshadowed at all and for the most part you don't understand Yuuji's motivation or why what he does fixes everything. There's too much that you're just supposed to accept without any context, and that's just bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nAmane's route is the only one that gets any justice, giving the Angelic Howl exposition a good three episodes. Even though this is obviously still too little, it's nice that for once the show felt a lot less condensed and you were able to really worry for the characters and allow the events to unfold. However, this show's last episode is just a trainwreck, an obvious twist on the final events of Amane's VN route, but with an incredible amount of \"suspense of disbelief\" needed to really accept what happens. Ultimately, Grisaia no Kajitsu still ends on a sour note in terms of its story, but at least a lot less sour than the middle episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the art and sound, those are definitely the best aspects of the show. The art looks pretty spot on compared to the VN, and the soundtrack is, as you could guess, the soundtrack from the game! Even the individual character ending songs get played, which I thought was a really nice touch. The soundtrack provides a really comfortable feeling for the show and of course fits perfectly. The art, while good, looks kind of awkward at times, though this is mostly nitpicking. These two aspects of the show were definitely where it shined the most, and at times I found myself admiring these quite a bit to distract myself from all the things that I didn't like. It's impossible to say that the style of the show's aesthetic wasn't pleasing to the eyes, and that definitely made it seem worthwhile at times, though rare.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are where I can't forgive 8bit's adaptation at all. To be brief and analytical, I'd call it a \"lack of context for the character's actions\". To be long-winded and personal, I'd say that they completely botched the character development for every character in an unforgivable fashion. Pretending I didn't play the VN, I can't understand why any of the characters do any of the things they do, and Yuuji is the worst example of this. Yuuji in the anime adaptation is this all-knowing problem solver who never has trouble doing these incredibly strenuous and risky things for people. The initial problem is the fact that it seems like he has no weaknesses, which is not true at all. Yuuji is supposed to be, above all else, a vulnerable person under his thick skin. That's what made his character so interesting in the VN. In this, he's too one note to be interesting. However, the point is moot when the real problem is not his actions, but the lack of reason for them. Why is he doing these incredible things for girls he barely knows? You could assume he knows them better than the anime allows the viewer to see, but it's hard to swallow that because there's nothing to give that point any footing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'm supposed to accept Yuuji just risks his life for girls he basically just met, and I can't do that. I love the characters in Grisaia no Kajitsu, but they did an incredibly poor job developing them. They'll throw out that Michiru is a tsundere, and Makina acts like a kid, and Sachi's the maid, and Amane is the big sister, and Sakaki is the kuudere loner, but then gets flaky with how they handle the characters after their fundamental personalities are established. They never go any deeper than that, even when they dive into their individual pasts. At that point, I need to care enough about the characters to really stake my emotions in their plight, and I'm unable to do that with any of them except maybe Amane at the LEAST. Their pasts don't carry half the weight they need to, and their characters aren't established enough to support any of that either. It's a complete mess, and these are characters I basically spent 80 hours caring about playing the VN.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't get enough individual time to flourish, and they barely get enough time together to establish the group dynamic. It's just established and then you're supposed to refer to that standard for the entire show. That isn't just bad character writing, it's the result of a completely botched job. They had no room to put any of the character development in amongst all the exposition and events they had to address. It's a simple \"cart before the horse\" writing scenario. If the characters aren't important enough to me, then their suffering isn't going to be either. I'm just going to know it's suffering, but that's just objectivity and holds no effect over my emotional response to the show, which is an unfortunate outcome.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, there's a lot of magic coming out of the VN to see all these characters fully animated in a full scale view of the school environment and the places they visit along the way. For that reason alone, I pushed through it all, because it was a really nice feeling in its own way. It's just a shame that amongst that, there was too much that impeded my personal enjoyment of the show. I spent too much time clutching my head in confusion or in disappointment, not understanding why they made some ridiculously unwise choices.\\n\\n\r\nI understand with 13 episodes, there was no way this was going to be a clean adaptation. As I stated earlier, this is 4 hours versus 60-80, and much had to be removed before there was any way they could make it work, but even then, they could have made it work better than this. They left too many remnants of scrapped information that contradicted or lacked the context to productively inform the viewer of their significance. In the end, it's kind of like tearing something off a page and leaving fractions of it behind with nothing to substantiate it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking to see whether you should play the VN or watch the anime first, play the VN, I'm begging you. It's an incredible and worthwhile experience and by watching this first you'll just spoil all the climactic events without any of the emotional build-up to make them great. After you play the VN, would I personally give this anime a recommendation? Not really, but if you want more Grisaia no Kajitsu and wish to see those same girls fully animated and are willing to trudge through all the garbage to accomplish that like I have, then sure.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, it'll never live up even as a simple adaptation, so I can't justify giving it any higher a score than I have.\\n\\n\r\nTHE FINAL VERDICT: 5/10\\n\r\nToo much of a synopsis, not enough of a story. Too much inconsistency, too little character development. Looks and sounds nice though.\\n\\n\r\nThis are my personal feelings and I in no way promulgate them as fact. I hope you enjoyed the review!",

            "content": "On on hand, there should really be one reason to ever watch this anime: because you read the visual novel, enjoyed it, and want to see your favorite scenes and characters animated. Especially Yuuji, the main character, because he was without a voice and wasn't ever seen very much in the VN. Now these two things the anime does very very well. It takes a lot of the core scenes from the VN, and even just some various memorable scenes are found, and it's really pleasant to see these scenes from a different perspective. The anime also does a very good job of animating Yuuji'scharacter, his voice actor does a very excellent job at portraying Yuuji's naive, laid-back attitude, and the animation they put to him really fits into his character. They also do a fair job at recreating the scenes from the VN, which is impressive considering how little they had to work with from the random backgrounds in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's about where the good criticisms stop. And honestly, some of what they're doing that is good is taking away from the anime anyway. Just about everything, from the exact script and the scenes, to even just some actual animations from the original, is just an exact copy and paste from the VN. While this might not seem like a bad thing, it gets really old really quickly, because if you have read the VN, you're almost just re-reading the VN. If you haven't read the VN, though, it still falls apart though, because which scenes they choose to use and the overall pacing of the story is really really off, such that a viewer who doesn't already know what's going on will just be confused as to why certain things are happening as they are.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that aspect, they also use the exact same music as was found in the VN, which would seem harmless except that one of the primary criticisms of the VN is that the music isn't that good. And it isn't any better in the anime version. All of the characters also always tend to stand in the exact same poses that were found in the VN's sprites very often, which makes them look very awkward when animated. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, stepping aside from the comparison to the VN, the anime still is just low quality overall. The animation isn't that great overall, with some of the characters often looking very strange, their features being too odd to really take seriously. They also overuse a lot of generic anime tropes that nobody wants to see, such as flashing some girls' panties around at what seems like every single given opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can't really recommend that anyone watch this anime. As an anime, it's very low quality, with poor pacing and awkward animation. As a replacement to the original visual novel, it doesn't cover nearly enough of every girls' story to really get the full effect of what they're going through. As an animation to follow reading the original VN, it can be fun to watch for a few episodes, but at the end of the day the bad just far outweighs the good, and it just isn't an enjoyable experience. If you're interested, I would highly recommend to rather go read the VN, because it is, overall, very well-made, and a very good and enjoyable read.\\n\\n\r\n(Side note; I do encourage you to take my review with a grain of salt. I only actually watched 4 episodes of this, anime, so I don't know anything of the quality of the other 9 episodes. I am only telling you what I interpreted from having read the visual novel beforehand, and my experience in watching these 4 episodes, after which I decided that this anime was simply not worth my time)",

            "content": "The Fruit of Grisaia is the most fucked up anime I\u2019ve seen in quite a while. And it\u2019s not fucked up in the fun way that Speed Grapher was, more so in a Higurashi sense. In fact, I can\u2019t think of an anime I\u2019ve watched since Higurashi that made me wonder what the fuck the writers were thinking.\r\nThe hero of our anime is Yuuji, a new addition to a high school with only five students before his arrival. He\u2019s got some sort of special ops training and sniping ability but it\u2019s never exactly explained what he\u2019s doing at Mihama Academy.\r\nHe meets five girls, all ofwhom carry the personalities you\u2019d expect of this sort of thing. There\u2019s a giant tit sex hound, a loli, a maid, a tsundere. He screws around with them for the first three or so episodes, nothing particularly exciting.\\n\\n\r\nBut then Michiru\u2019s story comes along. Michiru is a blond tsundere and my favorite character of the show because her story was the only one I felt was any bit decent. Her best friend committed suicide in front of her after they both met in similar, suicidal circumstances. Her heart gave out so she had a transplant in which she gained her best friend\u2019s heart. As a coping mechanism (though of course, the anime goes out of its way to make this supernatural and weird) she has adopted the personality of that friend while having another personality (her own). To hide her feelings she either depends on the friend\u2019s personality or pretends to be a silly tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nMore depressing shit happens to her and the show does a pretty decent job of creating a likeable, interesting character with dual personality and tons of mental baggage. This was the point in the show where I was nearly bawling my eyes out, mostly because I can relate in a lot of ways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the big surprise is how the anime starts as such a perverted show. You don\u2019t see this coming at all and that shock value pulls you in. It\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t happen sooner though. If the anime had taken itself more seriously from the beginning, I feel that this entire series would have worked a hell of a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, after this bit of depressing storytelling it goes into a Clannad style \u201cgo to each girl, learn her baggage, solve her problem\u201d set up that seems to rush too fast through some of the girl\u2019s story while giving too much time for others.\\n\\n\r\nWe learn about Yumiko, the girl who is not Senjougahara. Seriously? This girl is Senjougahara. From the hair to the use of a box cutter to being a total bitch.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress.\\n\\n\r\nHer baggage is about her family wishing she\u2019d been born a boy and how she was treated like crap by her business mogul father. It\u2019s decent but very rushed, leading to a final stand finale that is seriously fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nWe then follow Sachi, the maid girl who makes bombs! After being asked to get rid of tests, she takes it a bit too far and decides to blow up the school. Her baggage is about her parents dying in front of her when she was ten. Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Makina, the obligatory loli. She\u2019s the daughter of a political entity who has another daughter who gets hurt badly in a car bombing. Makina has a hit put on her by her own mother, leading to a situation of running and hiding from the police and assorted assassins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as if this doesn\u2019t sound bad enough, steel yourself for the four episode finale. Three episodes talk about Amane\u2019s past. Amane has big boobs and is totally in love with Yuuji. But when she was younger her bus flew off a cliff and herself, her classmates, and a teacher were forced to survive in the wild. Which leads to suicide, sickness, cannibalism, getting fucked by your teacher; you know, happy things! The bus also contained Yuuji\u2019s sister by complete coincidence (and stupid plot device).\\n\\n\r\nThen the end is a giant hostage situation that has one of the most awkward boner shots in any anime ever, as well as the greatest \u201cPissing everywhere after being shot\u201d scene in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd did I mention Yuuji works for an assassination group headed by a hot blond who probably wants to fuck him?\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s this all boil down to? One huge clusterfuck. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad clusterfuck per se, but it\u2019s a very surreal one. Even the soft orange and yellow lighting adds a dream-like quality to this show that makes it compelling despite how screwed it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s what will most likely be the reason people watch it and remember it. It\u2019s different, definitely. It\u2019s like the writers wondered what it\u2019d be like to make a harem where everyone is so mentally screwed it makes your boner as confused as it was watching Elfen Lied.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDamn, that girls masturbating! Oh boy, panty shot! I\u2019m sure enjoying fapping to\u2026what the fuck is this?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd the hardest pill to swallow is how uncaring the show is for its cast. I can understand being very ecchi at the beginning as an attempt at commentary on the genre or to juxtapose the later episodes, but why keep being ecchi during really fucked up sections?  It\u2019s like the show is trying to appeal to people who shouldn\u2019t be allowed access to a computer, nor the outdoors. Oh boy, gotta screencap the dying girl\u2019s piss soaked panties! Oh goodie, here\u2019s an apparent stream of diarrhea down her leg!\\n\\n\r\nLike, what\u2019s the point to the average viewer? Clannad and Angel Beats tackled these sort of subjects (albeit, not quite as screwed up) without humiliating the cast and trying to be remembered as fapbait. This show could probably stand on its own and be remembered as something different if it weren\u2019t for the Elfen Lied style of the ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Japan\u2019s infatuation with torturing young girls and sexualizing the tortured girls? What is so great about suffering? And what the fuck is the point of having a show that is nothing but being sad?\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s one side of me. The other appreciated how different this anime was and how, despite the depressing attitude, it gave us a set of decent characters and some unique situations. The main character is surprisingly funny sometimes because he says things guys in a harem would never say. Calling one of the girls a whore and a prostitute, telling her she\u2019s ugly, literally burying one of the girls. It\u2019s a much more blunt approach not only to the harem idea but also the fixing of the girl\u2019s problems.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the girl\u2019s themselves fall into every convention possible and most fail to impress even with the sad stories. I\u2019m still trying to figure out why the hell Sachi was even around.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was unimpressive, all standard fare. And I didn\u2019t think the animation was particularly good either. It has a sort of oversaturation of color a la No Game No Life while the characters look standard and borrowed from other anime. I couldn\u2019t help but look at Michiru and be reminded somewhat of Karen from the Monogatari series.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the night, the dream is over and I have to get out of my sticky pajamas then wipe all that cold sweat from my forehead. Then I have to follow that with a score, which I find really hard to do. This is another example of me being conflicted over an anime and not really knowing where I stand. I can see both side\u2019s arguments about it and I genuinely think this is an anime that is for a very specific crowd. Neither side of me enjoyed the ecchi at all but both sides could agree that it handled some characters decently and did have a welcome edgy bluntness to the comedy. But all the same, it\u2019s still broken.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an old review I did, one of my first in fact, for Elfen Lied that encapsulates a ton of the same thoughts that I\u2019m having with this show. In that review I said that it is a love it or hate it show, which Fruit of Grisaia most definitely is. I mentioned relating to the alienation of the characters and I can\u2019t say I relate with anyone in this show but for Michiru (whose story I felt was realistic, interesting, and good psychological drama while all the others were extreme as hell). And then I wrote a little something I feel applies here:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe more boobies and panties, the more men care about characters. No man wants to really like an anime character and see her go through hell, so let\u2019s do just that, make them cry, which in turn means they\u2019ll like the series!\u201d\\n\r\n-Lead Writer\\n\\n\r\nAnd that right there perfectly summarizes this anime. I enjoyed what it offered, flawed as it was, and look forward to the two more seasons already confirmed (and I hope for a lot of explanation and less suffering). It was a very edgy, very emotionally draining show that is unique in what it does, but that unique style will definitely turn away a majority of viewers. If you can get past the initial hurtle you\u2019ll be reminded a lot of Angel Beats and Higurashi. If you liked those shows or Elfen Lied or generally anything really fucked up, you\u2019ll probably find some entertainment value here.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Fruit of Grisaia is not for everyone. After reading this review, if you\u2019re mildly interested you should watch it and form your own opinion because the vast majority of people won\u2019t agree with me on this score. But for my money, I think it\u2019s good, it\u2019s going to stick with me for a long time I\u2019m sure, and I can\u2019t wait for more.",

            "content": "Keep in mind episodes 10& a half through 12 3/4 are not covered in the main part of the review, scroll down for them.\r\nWhat first got my attention was obviously the art. I didn't even need to look at the production studio to know that this was made by the guys that animated monogatari. Naturally that means that the art is incredibly detailed & a incredibly beautiful to watch. The story centers around Yuuji, a japanese student (a tiny bit older than he should be) who attends a highschool ran strictly to accomodate a select few (that are all rich beyond their wildest dreams). Sototal we have Yuuji + 5 chicks, each with her own backstory and reason for wanting to be sceduled by the rest of society. As each independadly develop a crash for the (rediculously skilled in everything) Yuuji, and he in turn explores their tragic backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that will immediatly get your attention is the setting. Apart from a school with 6 student total being awesome, the whole place seems to be a holiday resort, with the time stuck in almost constant sunset throughout the entire series. This, accompanied by the very detailed high-resolution animation gives of a very nice feeling that the viewer quickly learns to appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nNot all is merry&rosy however. For one thing, the viewer quickly loses interest after tha first three to four episodes due to Yuuji simply being too op at everything. He's flawless, which ultimately makes him as uninteresting as it goes. So the focus is on the girls. While they each have a unique personality, none of them manage to make the viewer actually care. In fact when for the first time the viewer develops sympathy for one of them (the little one that calls Yuuji papa) that little s\u00a3$t acts in the stupidest way possible, making me instantly hate her. \\n\\n\r\nLets be honest though, it's tollerable. The art is good enough to support the anime on its own, despite the characters being relatively weak. In fact it is that god damned amazing Monogatari art that makes this show worth watching... Unless of course we're talking about 3 very specific episodes...\\n\\n\r\nRegarding episodes 10-12: None of the above actually reflect them. Through these episodes, the viewers see the backstory of a redhead that belongs to Yuuji's harem. Also let us be clear that while the rest of the anime is action-romance packed, these 3 episodes are pure, hardcore horror. The bus Amane (the redhead) was in, crashed in the middle of nowhere, leaving 12 girls + the driver trapped in the wilderness. None of them has any idea how to get back and food supplies will only last so long. Among those girls is Yuuji's older sister, Kazuki, a completely unsociable brilliant girl. I don't want to spoil anything, but lets just say that lack of food and proper medical care makes for some pretty fun situations. (keep in mind, the pacing in those episodes is unbelievably slow, unlike the rest of the anime that has a relatively fast setting, and this is done on purpose). Seriously, those episodes practically standalone, so go watch them, now.",

            "content": "The psychological genre is one that I am quite fond of.  For me animes that have this tag are generally high quality in my opinion and I am often prone to giving these kinds of animes scores higher than they ought to really be.  That said I waited a few days after finishing this series to write my review and I just can't find a place in the anime that was objectively not good.  To get the easier parts of the review out of the way, Art and Sound were all up to date and both visually and audibly appealing.  Charactersand their designs were very appropriate (Makina with the childlike personality hence childlike form, etc) and the voices for each character were done well.  The background music was dynamic and fit the scenes of each event well, though if I had even one criticism here it's that Makina's voice is straight annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nNow then the Story (9)\\n\r\nPsychological genre animes like this often get the viewer thinking and keep it that way to retain their interest in the show---its how they get their viewership.  Much like the time-honored formula of fanservice attracting views, a complex and well written plot is the primary hook here.  You would think in the first couple of episodes that the anime would very easily and could very easily be just another ecchi involving one male and multiple female co-leads but as the MC interacts with each character and helps to resolve the lingering issues of their troubled pasts the anime really shines with stories associated with each character getting progressively darker/complex.  That aspect of the show is quite possibly my favorite one from this series.  Now that being said I gave the story a 9.  That is because even though I was a huge fan of the almost episodic nature of each girl's story I did have issues at various points with either the time spent or the resolution given to each female character.  The first one would be Yumiko's story as I felt it was altogether too short and the resolution was way too easy.  This aside I was very much enthralled by the story and genuinely wanted to see the next episode ASAP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10).\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS WERE SO WELL DONE AHHHHHHHHHHH\\n\r\nokay excuse that outburst, like I said I'm a big fan of the characterization in this show on a character by character basis only.  By this I mean 90% of the characters had unique personalities and histories but it does not mean I think every character was given optimal time.  I'm giving this a 10 and not a 9 because for this category i'm judging content and leaving development an issue with the story.  That being said I've got a few obvious favorites:\\n\\n\r\nYuuji:  THe MC, the OP male lead who manages to get the job done perfectly despite his means and his obstacles what a guy.  Now in most cases I'd not be a fan of this but his character was so damn focused that even the light bits of humor he'd work in were hilarious by comparison.  Like if this character was made to be full of himself or present any sort of superiority complex then I'd hate it.  Instead we get the cool under pressure driving force that the anime really needed in order to be successful.\\n\\n\r\nJB:  This one's a shocker even to me but representing the \"middle man\" of the series up until the very end is actually a role I think was very hard to fill and do properly.  The show could've easily made JB one dimensional and have her stick firmly to one side or the other but in JB we saw someone decidedly set on following rules and orders but at the same time encounter regular and frequent conflict with how those order were to applied to and via Yuuji.  I think maybe if the viewer was given the backstory of her association with Yuuji at some point in this series and not later until Meikyuu then the connection would have been better but regardless I really enjoyed her character.\\n\\n\r\nMakina:  For as much as her voice makes me wanna bash my head on the table, she's such a great character.  The high-pitched young heroine/part time \"marine\" was very energetic and what the show needed at times.  I thought it was altogether stupid of her to leave Yuuji during her episode and get that damn apple plant but she couldn't help it and that's exactly what i'd expect of a character like hers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall if i was asked whether or not I'd recommend this series to a friend then I would say yes if and only if the friend was interested in this GENRE/KIND of show.  The show's brief moments of lighter story are juxtaposed very well with the larger moments of horror, confusion, anger, sadness, etc but the show itself maintains a very dark feel about it, especially the backstories.  A casual viewer would probably not like the show but to anyone who can stomach the violence and horror they'd love it.  10/10",

Without a doubt, these expectations were crushed mercilessly.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThe plot was substantial and interested me. However, the pacing was dreadful, starting off slowly, then going too fast, only to be dragged out during Suou Amane's arc. Ambitious to complete the main story, the whole series was terribly rushed.

This anime is a fine example on how not to do it. Instead we are given rushed story lines, very little interaction between the characters, and lack of development between the characters.\r\nFor example: One character dies in the VN but we are given quite a lot of time before we see this. The character grows on us and the death is very emotional. The character in the anime is given.. one episode (and only about 10 - 15 mins).\r\nNo emotional build-up,no steady pacing, and lack of development makes every romantic feeling seem hollow and forced. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is actually fairly well done. I enjoyed the character designs and overall \"feel\" of the show that they were trying to get across. In other words the show feels very forced and underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nI understand what they tried to do for future seasons (Labyrinth of Grisaia and Eden of Grisaia) but boy did they flub it up big time. \\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: Is this anime good?  Well to keep it standing up on an anime is fine. The anime itself has no real major flaws other than pacing issues, but knowing where the anime came from (a vastly superior trilogy of VNs) then it really falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nIf the anime simply spent more time on each character and was longer it could have worked, but seriously? 5 characters, 12 episodes (about 6 hours total). That common route in the VN took longer than that.",

            "content": "The Fruit of Grisaia started and ended with me bemused every step of the way. The reasons, however, changed. The show started out with little insight on what was going on.  The bits of info I could pick out was that the school was special, had 6 attendees (5 girls 1 guy), and that one of the girls wants to murder the guy. I felt like I was thrown in without any guidance as to where the plot was going, but luckily the first few episodes explained the superficial information about the characters pretty well.  As I was deeper into the show, Irealized the purpose of the protagonist's involvement with the school, and I also realized the guy is an assassin (not really a spoiler because I'm pretty sure I'm just an idiot and should have known this from the start).  I realized that there is something fundamentally wrong with each girl in the school, and because of that, the protagonist is there to protect and help them.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this moment on, I really started to enjoy the show and wanted to know how the protagonist was going to help the next girl come to terms with her past. Each girl is very unique which made me very invested in the story. After about 8 or 9 episodes, I decided to rate this show an 8 for the time being, because I was truly enjoying it until........the next....4....episodes......\\n\\n\r\nThis is why my rating of an 8 went straight to a 6.  The show had a dark atmosphere about it, and each girl's story was pretty messed up.  It did get pretty dark from 1 through 8, but nothing too much for me.  Episodes 9 through 10, though, were just insane in my opinion.  the last two girls' stories were just absolutely unnecessarily gory,  depressing, and just down right creepy.  I understand writers like to express their artistic right, but this was entirely too far.  It completely took me by surprise and threw me straight out of the plot.  I had to fast forward through a couple of scenes, and at some points I just wanted to stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil anything and the ending, but if you don't like needless rape scenes, girls peeing themselves, and dead bodies, don't spend your 300 minutes on this show.  I would have scored it a 5, but I just wanted to make myself believe that I didn't just waste 300 minutes of my life.",

            "content": "So I have recently been on an anime slump, constantly going into animes with an impression from looming at their MAL rating first. So of course the first anime I randomly pick with no backstory is Grisaia no kajitsu, and let me tell you ... What the actual back. So Hulu provided me with the mature warning (don't recommend this one for the family) so I was kinda on edge.\r\nStory:6\r\n The first three episodes were pretty mysterious was really intrigued by them, But oh man, Everything after goes into each Charcters arcs. That's all of my *spoilers* but I need to emphasize here that Ihad no idea this was adapted from a VN, had no idea there arcs for the girls, didn't u understand the progression. Even as someone who hasn't read the VN this still feels pretty rushed , maybe not don't know but from what I could grasp it seem to forced at certain parts and the core of the girls stories didn't feel as fleshed out as the should have been. \\n\r\nArt & Sound : 7 \\n\r\nThe art was visibly pleasing, especially in the soft scenes. Often look at some of the sunsets and believed them to be well placed and overall benefit the scenes. The graphic scenes were intense as one would expect sometimes the animation didn't seem first rate by any means, but nonetheless was pleasant, the ED was good I phased through some of the credits but did sit through a couple times to hear it.\\n\r\nCharacters : A loaded and confused 6\\n\r\nI feel very much that had I actually ya know read the VN that I would be far more attached to these characters and would delve farther into their backstories of immensely fragile and unstable teenagers. TEENAGERS. \\n\r\nThese kids down right Spooked me to the core man. Plus the main character is a nightmare sociopath that only cares for those close to him. \\n\r\nJ.B. The waifu tho ~~~\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall :Strong 6 to a light 7 \\n\r\nThis was one hell of a ride of the random animes I decided to jump into that could have very well been a a 7 which is pretty amazing knowing how much gunk is in anime these days. Had I known it was a VN adaptation and had prepared for it this series definitely would have been a strong 7 - light 8 category. But you live and you learn. I recommend my anime roulette to others had fun and eliminated a lot of preconceptions of how the anime would be . Still tho J.B. WAIFU ~~~",
